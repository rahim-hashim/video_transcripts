# Joe Rogan Experience #2177 - Chris Robinson
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [July 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRHbaj194I)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day.
*  Especially the first season is like 1972 or three I think.
*  Colombo. I almost forgot about that show. They used to tell him not to smoke?
*  Well no, like the character, I could tell they're probably just building up.
*  Like he noticed that he has a cigar in his hands the whole series or every episode.
*  But it's funny that in 1972 people were like, please don't smoke in here.
*  Lieutenant Colombo, he's always being reprimanded for it.
*  Interesting. I forgot about that.
*  And he's always really, you know, Peter Falk's character, he's always like, oh, sorry.
*  And he puts it out always. He's never upset or anything.
*  Yeah, that was an interesting character, right? Because he was like this bumbling guy who was actually not.
*  He was kind of setting you up the whole time.
*  Letting you underestimate him.
*  Acting like, pardon me. What another thing.
*  He's always about to leave. And he's like, oh yeah. And he comes back and hits him.
*  And he's annoying people and they're like, oh.
*  Incredible though, aesthetic.
*  And like the other day I'm watching this episode that Jonathan Demme directed, Steven Spielberg.
*  I mean like all of these famous directors start to cut their teeth in TV and on episodic things like that.
*  There's a real tone to it and stuff that's cool and the way everyone looked.
*  But one other funny thing about it that I've noticed in Colombo is that it always starts with a murder.
*  And then usually a lot of times in the arc of the story someone shows up to the crime scene.
*  Usually whoever did it or whatever, right?
*  And so, but they're never upset.
*  You know, there's never someone that runs it. What happened here? Your uncle's been murdered.
*  Oh, I didn't do it. You know, it's kind of like how it starts instead of some dramatic, you know, like, oh my God.
*  You know, how could this have, you know, no one's even, they're just like, OK, well, you're bothering me now.
*  You know, in cop shows you can always tell police, even SVU, they're always like, I've had enough.
*  Can you guys leave? And they leave. I'm like, is that how it goes? I don't know.
*  No.
*  It's weird how many of those shows there are where they catch the bad guy.
*  Like that is it's like something that I guess people with anxiety need to let them feel like if someone is a bad person and they do commit a murder, they're going to get caught.
*  Like are the are the interest in those kind of dark scenarios?
*  You're only interested in them when there's justice at the end. Is that what you're saying?
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  Because anything nebulous or whatever is like too real, maybe.
*  Yeah, there's those shows and then there's medical shows.
*  Remember when there was there was a time where they're like every other fucking show on TV was about a hospital?
*  Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
*  And the only one that I really remember is Quincy.
*  So Jack Klugman yelling at everyone all that, you know, he's yelling about the sandwich.
*  He's yelling about the blood sample.
*  He's yeah. When we were kids, we were hardcore.
*  We were in, you know, that initial phase of American kind of hardcore punk stuff because we had just missed out the.
*  Like seventy seven, seventy eight, seventy nine.
*  And then there was an episode about the L.A. scene and they and Quincy goes to the punk club.
*  Don't you see what you kids are doing to yourself with the loud music and the anger, the pills or whatever?
*  You know, he like and there was a thing when we were kids and there was a song.
*  I forget which band did it.
*  But if you were you were fake, if you were Quincy punk, you know, because they took like the way people looked on Quincy or whatever.
*  That instantly became a punk. Yeah. Yeah.
*  You're bullshit. When you started out, like what what was the inspirations for your band?
*  Like, what were you guys into? I mean, it's it's hard to untangle because my dad was a singer.
*  So our dad was a singer and. He was very well, my dad's the kind of a strange guy in general, a lovely guy, but dynamic, to say the least.
*  But he had had like a hit in the late 50s called Boomer Dip Dip, like a top 40 kind of record and and a couple of subsequent sort of.
*  You know, rock and roll singles.
*  And he was living in New York and stuff. And then when he that kind of pales out and then he moves back to Atlanta and he immerses himself in like the folk music scene.
*  And he was signed to a label called ABC Paramount.
*  So by the time I come along in 66, it's kind of he's not doing it anymore.
*  What was he doing? He was a guy. He was in a middle.
*  He was like Willie Loman. You know, he was in the garment business.
*  My grandfather, Ike Robinson, they were in children's wear.
*  My dad was in women's wear and then ended later back in children's wear.
*  But the one thing around the house that I remember earliest memories are him pilling out this his guitar and singing folk songs and.
*  Just. I don't know.
*  I'm dyslexic person. And so my you know what I mean?
*  So there was I don't know if that has anything to do with it, but there was something about always singing these songs.
*  It would like open up stuff for me, almost like being high or in a in a not in a psychedelic way, but in a way that it changed the space.
*  You know what I mean? And records started doing that to me very early.
*  And that kind of is where so it's kind of we think it's normal.
*  Other kids dads aren't playing old folk songs at the house that I know.
*  But by the time Rich and I, you know, we're kind of like angst ridden suburban youth.
*  You know, for some reason, my parents decided to move to the suburbs.
*  I don't know.
*  General apathy.
*  Ready to begin the mound of resentment and regret.
*  I don't know.
*  All the things the suburbs represent me.
*  I would say for me.
*  There was a television show in the do you remember Night Flight on USA Network back in the early days?
*  I remember the name. I don't even remember what it was about.
*  Yeah, it would be like it would come on at midnight and it would be concerts and like films like cool.
*  Like it's probably the first time I saw Eraserhead or Rude Boy, the movie about the clash and, you know,
*  declining Western civilization punk things and New Wave things.
*  And I always had an interest in the in stranger things, you know, and things that weren't normal or, you know,
*  you know, Mr. Roper on Three's Company or whatever.
*  And this show, they had a show that came on at two in the morning and it was from Los Angeles called New Wave Theater.
*  And that was like huge, huge.
*  Being a kid in the suburbs in Georgia where, you know, it's still pretty much like that band, all the people that's that band, Alabama,
*  you know, they wear like trucker hats and flannels and like want to beat you up because you have a Ramones record or something.
*  That's how it was.
*  Wow. So this show was like a real beacon of, you know, my mom was like, oh, yeah, it is Peter Ivers.
*  A very interesting character, Peter Ivers.
*  Forty five. Yeah. So this is what I'm really into.
*  Don Bowles is the drummer in Forty Five Grave who was in The Germs.
*  Not a happy childhood amongst them.
*  No, but well, I don't know.
*  But they definitely made amazing, beautiful, cool outsider art.
*  And, you know, I think something that we have a hard time understanding in this day and age is art that's made because of the visceral
*  interaction with you and other people that has nothing to do with I'm going to be a big star.
*  Right. Right. Right.
*  Some of the things I think I mean, fuck, I'm like the one of the last.
*  I mean, the Black Crows, we have to be one of the last bands of the time where we kind of felt it was our duty to never truly give in to the other side.
*  You know what I mean? And kind of understand this us versus them idea.
*  You know what I mean? Or vibe is something that's inspiring and something that is like, you know, I was always interested in counterculture, you know, and anyone.
*  Again, that's like why the algorithm maybe isn't as perfect or it never will overtake everything because there's always going to be the one person who's like, I'm going this way.
*  That's not enough for me.
*  You know, the deep dive people and the and so we kind of found ourselves in the crosshairs of this kind of stuff.
*  The cramps, we were in the cramps, the gun club.
*  So and then REM comes around their first record Chronic Town.
*  And so my dad and my mom and dad had a lot of records, maybe 250 records, 300 records, you know, which was a lot of records back then.
*  Bluegrass records, you know, Lester Flatner, Earl Scruggs records or Mose Allison records, Jimmy Reed records, Johnny Guitar Watson.
*  And then they had, you know, Buffalo Springfield records and Bob Dylan records.
*  I mean, that's a big I mean, for millions of people, but something as a kid that I knew no other kids would go.
*  You guys want to come over and listen to records?
*  I'm going to put on the times they are changing.
*  I mean, like, again, there would be a reason to get beat up.
*  But that kind of stuff catapults us into then punk rock comes along and it's like, oh, it's anyone can do this.
*  You don't have to be.
*  We'll figure it out later.
*  What talent or whatever?
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like we just want to plug in and start going and singing horrible things and trying to be offensive.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Because think about now you go to the you know, now people walk around in Dead Kennedy's t-shirts and it's like, oh, cool.
*  But back then, Dead Kennedy's made people like the name of that band, the Circle Jerks, like the names of these bands made people upset.
*  Right.
*  And legitimate rebellion.
*  Yeah.
*  Instead of posturing.
*  Exactly.
*  A lot of what's going on today with Dead Kennedy's t-shirts.
*  But I mean, I think inevitably anything like that.
*  I mean, Edgar Allan Poe was that in a literary way in the tail end of the Victorian age.
*  But now he's just like a thing hanging in some goth kid's car, like an air freshener or something.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Yeah.
*  So things get swallowed up culturally.
*  Right.
*  And regurgitated as just this, you know, and it just so happens that Dead Kennedy's have one of the greatest logos of all time.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, there's always going to be adherence to what most people are interested in and what's popular.
*  And then people that are trying to mimic what's popular so that they can become popular.
*  And then there's always legitimate counterculture where people are just like, I don't vibe with any of this.
*  Yeah. I'm looking for something else.
*  Yeah. I'm looking for something that's real, something that's raw.
*  And as I think that's going to accelerate with AI music and all this electronic music.
*  And again, as you were saying before, stuff that's sort of created to feed the algorithm.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, there's there's strategies to become successful rather than just expression that resonates with people.
*  Let the people. Yeah. Yeah.
*  In a way, I mean, someone took a chance, you know, a band like Alan Vega and, you know, like Suicide, like someone, you know, the no wave music in New York in the late seventies.
*  Someone took a chance and said, yeah, I would think about how weird was that, you know, like bringing that into a studio where who was just in here?
*  Fucking 38 Special or some shit.
*  You know what I mean? And then there's like this or whatever.
*  You know what I mean? Yeah.
*  I mean, it's a cool thing about early, you know, like the first Sex Pistols record, the Clash records a little different, but even the Dead Boys or bands like that, like a lot of those early punk records and a lot of the post punk records.
*  Those bands, they're not making records trying to sound, you know, oh, I can make a record sound like I don't give a fuck or something on my garage.
*  But you know, you can do anything now with like a button and and people and I like lo fi shit, too, of course.
*  But back then, they're in these bands.
*  They're not making lo fi records there and just like that's a real band in a but with great gear and people who are making like records that we would think are.
*  Sonically, like, oh, that's correct. Right.
*  And then you have these punk people in there just like you can't turn it up all the way.
*  Well, we're doing that. You know what I mean?
*  Wasn't this sort of rebellion out? You guys had like a falling out with ZZ Top right when you were on tour.
*  Wasn't part of it something about corporate involvement?
*  Yeah, we were always. And it's funny.
*  I just saw Billy Gibbons a couple of weeks ago in London and we've been friends for many years and a massive ZZ Top fan.
*  I mean, those records, especially the early records, I mean, they just sound delicious.
*  You know what I mean? I just and when is it?
*  Which one is it? Is it Rio Grande? I don't know.
*  One of those records where you open it and there's like a giant plate of Mexican food, like growing up in Atlanta, like that was I didn't know what that you know what I mean?
*  Like you could get that.
*  We had barbecue and we had soul food.
*  We have our own regional culinary identity.
*  But to see stuff like that, I was like, wow, I got to try that.
*  You know what I mean? But no, we.
*  They I don't even know if ZZ Top where they were in their career, if they knew anything that was going on about like these guys that were the opening band,
*  except for the fact that, you know, in the music business at that time when you're still selling records and you're selling two hundred fifty thousand records every week or whatever for a couple of years.
*  So it starts to be kooky when it was a thing.
*  But they were sponsored by Miller Lite.
*  And I just got into this thing where, you know, so we'd go on stage and do our thing.
*  And there's big Miller Lite posters all over the stage or whatever, you know, and I got in my little troublemaker mind.
*  We're the black crows. You know what I mean?
*  No one gives us money that we don't drink this beer.
*  No one gives us fucking money.
*  You know, I'm standing under this sign because I have to be here tonight.
*  But I want you to know that no fucking beer company sponsors our music.
*  No one owns us.
*  You know what I mean?
*  These naive sort of thing about like, I don't know.
*  And we my brother and I talk about it a lot.
*  And as we've gotten older, and especially since we put the band back together these last few years and have been in a really positive place and a really good place, I realize like, you know, part of our part of that.
*  That we were involved in, we believed in like as if rock the S what we feel is really the true essence of rock and roll.
*  It's like I describe it as like the movie Quest for Fire, you know, when they have to keep the fire burning in that little thing and they're going across the swamp and they don't want the Neanderthals to get it or whatever.
*  That's kind of how we felt in a weird way about everything that was out.
*  You know, one minute you're in control.
*  Your kids were writing songs.
*  We're in control of that.
*  I'm in control of like, this is what we're doing.
*  This is how we look.
*  This is what we are.
*  And then you're in the grownup world and you've sold you've made people tens of millions of dollars.
*  And I'm hardly a savvy business person.
*  I never could be.
*  I never would be.
*  Wasn't in the cards for me.
*  And so part of our like being hard about it or being difficult, not being compliant was trying to, in our minds, keep this pure thing.
*  You know what I mean?
*  And in a way that still is part of what we are today.
*  How old were you guys back then?
*  Oh, in the summer of 89, Rich was 18.
*  I was 23 when we made our first record.
*  Wow.
*  Just a young rebel.
*  Well, you know, the other thing is, is rock.
*  You know, you remember rock and roll was culturally and socially its place and its importance and its reverence was a lot different than today.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, I think it's one thing I think is cool about hip hop music is the hip hop stars have taken over the that kind of attitude.
*  Yes.
*  Which I when I see their fashion and I see, you know, I mean, there's lots of hip hop's not one thing, of course.
*  Right.
*  And I'm 57.
*  I like what I like.
*  You know, I like old records anyway.
*  But when I hear new things that I like and I'm like, OK, so they're singing about drugs, they're singing about sex and, you know, they're singing about, you know, maybe I can't really identify with the violence of poverty.
*  And you know what I mean?
*  The extreme nature of some of it.
*  But but it's that that's another form of rebellion as well.
*  Yeah. And it's that's it.
*  Isn't it hip hop itself is an interesting art form because there's not a push to popify it.
*  You know, like the hardcore hip hop artists are very successful.
*  The lyrics are rough.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, they're they're very hard edged lyrics.
*  But yet these are the lyrics that, you know, get millions and millions of views.
*  You can't even say millions of sold albums anymore because it's like that's that had to be the weirdest thing to watch the sale of albums evaporate.
*  Not just the sale.
*  You're absolutely correct.
*  Not just the sale, but the the meaning of a record like of, you know, and again, in the big scheme of things, the record business isn't as old as, say, you know, the writing or whatever.
*  But in the way that we would listen to music and you would, you know, there's a company that would find talent and put that whole thing.
*  But yeah, making a record and saying, OK, we're songwriters.
*  This is what we're this is our this is our latest work.
*  This is what we've been working on.
*  This is our craft.
*  And this is our talent and our poetry and our this is what we want to say.
*  Now it's like, you know, an album, you know, like I personally think that it's still an important medium and I've I've yet to give up on it.
*  You know what I mean?
*  If they said, right, you know, oh, you know what I mean?
*  What am I?
*  That's what I've always that's what Rich and I've always done.
*  We write songs.
*  It was one of the only things again, the way we could experience the world was to write songs.
*  Again, the way we could could experience the world was through that because he's, you know, as crazy as me just doesn't talk as much.
*  Not crazy, but I mean, different, you know, artists, you know, I think it resonates with a lot of people, which is why there's this resurgence of vinyl.
*  Right. Like people still want to listen to actual vinyl.
*  They still want to see an actual album.
*  You know, agreed.
*  And there's there's a lot of like looking at that as a lot of reminiscing from people that are like my age and your age that were around when these things were the way you consume music.
*  I've been buying records as I was 12 years old.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like, and it was weird.
*  Maybe that's because my mom and dad had a lot of records.
*  But, you know, my wife and I, we just moved just around the block in L.A.
*  And we've been together seven years, but we kept our records separate.
*  I don't know.
*  We have thousands and thousands.
*  I just put four thousand records in storage because we don't have space for that.
*  Wow.
*  And but I'm like, but it's funny because no matter what I see a record store, I'm going in and I can I could.
*  And, you know, after however many years of buying records, I know what I'm looking for.
*  And I don't buy records online very much.
*  I still like them.
*  I don't know.
*  I like that.
*  I'm like a kid when I if I've been looking for something and I see it, I'm like I get a shot of like endorphins.
*  I'm like, you know, I mean, I'm looking around like I don't want to.
*  Yeah, it's weird.
*  It's geeky stuff.
*  It's nerd stuff.
*  But the record store was really important to me as a young person and a musician because before you could go on your phone or before the algorithm, whatever, like there's another person that looks cool.
*  I oh, you know what I mean?
*  Like they have Chelsea boots on or like a cool band t shirt in the suburbs back in the 80s.
*  It was like, you know, I mean, if you saw someone, you took the chance to be like when you'd go to their house and look through their records, you know what I mean?
*  And it's funny that still that way.
*  You know what I mean?
*  I have so many friends in my life and we're friends because of records.
*  You know what I mean?
*  And it's like my wife and I DJ all the time in L.A.
*  And we go to New York and we carry our records around.
*  You DJ like, yeah, like we have my wife's name is Camille.
*  So we have the best DJ name ever.
*  The captain and Camille.
*  We do.
*  Yeah.
*  Concerts and bars and parties and gigs and stuff.
*  Really?
*  When did you start doing that?
*  DJing?
*  I started like well back in the 80s, everyone used to take a turn playing records at the pizza place.
*  They had two turntables called Fellini's in Atlanta where all the.
*  As my dad referred to them, dirtbags and low lives hung out, everyone in a band, of course.
*  But then in the early 2000s, a friend of mine that worked at the great record store, Other Music in New York, my friend Michael.
*  We started doing these nights and playing like a lot of weird psych folk as a kind of as genre.
*  And we both love those records and we called that we called Gurus Galore.
*  And yeah, and just when I wasn't doing the Black Crows, I had this band called the CRB.
*  We were like a little psychedelic folk rock little group that toured around and made a bunch of records.
*  But our so we played two sets a night.
*  So it was kind of like Grateful Dead model, like very heady, trippy.
*  So but the CRB and especially in California, we always had friends DJ the show's doors open till after the show and in between sets playing records.
*  She's something we've always done in my wife used to DJ before I met her and stuff.
*  So just just something you enjoy.
*  By the way, if I could make if I could make money doing it, I would never do it.
*  If I if me and Camille could just play records, I would be the happiest person in the world.
*  You would stop performing.
*  No, I'm kidding. I love singing.
*  I love performing. I love being in a band.
*  You know what I mean? I I love it's changed a lot like anything else and travel and everything.
*  But I personally it's yet to beat the adventure out of me.
*  You know what I mean?
*  You never know.
*  Same thing about why I could go online and buy whatever book or record I want right now.
*  Anything, almost anything you can imagine, you know, is available, is available.
*  But, you know, I know when I'm in Denver, I'm going to this certain bookstore and I know that what they have really curated things in there that I'm looking for.
*  I can wander into, you know, you never know who you're going to meet.
*  You never know what you're going to eat.
*  You know what I mean?
*  The laughs and the you know, it's still a lot of stuff out there for someone like me.
*  A lot of stimuli, real experiences that are good and human.
*  Yeah, human experiences.
*  Yeah.
*  And that is what live music and live performance is all about.
*  Right. I mean, music is great.
*  Live music is something really special.
*  I tell you, the pandemic was weird for the world.
*  And it was, you know, for artists and musicians, we had, you know, no one's no government bailout for the guy who, you know, playing guitar or whatever.
*  But as hard as it was, one of the worst parts of it to me was not not just being able to do what we do, but not going to see bands.
*  You know what I mean?
*  I have a little I have a label called Silver Arrow and we've been doing this for a few years.
*  The Black Crows records come out on Silver Arrow.
*  It's a little different, but I'm always going to see bands.
*  You know what I mean?
*  We go whether it's the Rolling Stones or whether we go see a band at a little club in L.A.
*  And I'm always looking for new, you know, things to people that are interesting.
*  If I could help them out in their careers.
*  A lot of it is with really young artists.
*  I want to put them in the studio.
*  I want to give them good experience.
*  I want to give them a great record deal because it's changed the model.
*  But we but to do that, you have to go out and get in it.
*  You know what I mean?
*  We always laugh.
*  I'm like, is there anyone older here tonight than me?
*  You know, like you're like, oh, there's what?
*  You know what I mean?
*  It's a freaky dude who still goes to see bands.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, people don't want to let it go.
*  And why should they?
*  Why should you?
*  I mean, in L.A. right now is a great time.
*  I mean, there's a lot of good music going on in L.A.
*  And there's a lot of bars where, you know, we know if someone has a it plays great records, we'll go listen to them play records.
*  You know what I mean?
*  There's a lot of good record people, bands.
*  There's a lot of cool L.A. is very alive right now.
*  No kidding.
*  Well, like what parts of L.A. are this happening?
*  I mean, it happens all over, but especially more downtown and like to the east.
*  Downtown.
*  I mean, yeah, you have to survive getting into the place.
*  So fucked up.
*  But that's probably something that adds to the feeling of you know what it does.
*  And it's funny because I had a nostalgic moment about when we started talking about look, man, don't get me wrong.
*  My parents did the best they could.
*  They're just fucking people, too.
*  But part of the other part of adventure and the other part of being interesting and like New Wave Theatre, my mom's like, they all look like mental patients, just like you.
*  You know, like, great.
*  But was to go to downtown Atlanta in the 80s was dangerous, too, you know, during the crack epidemic.
*  It was a violent place.
*  And and we were, you know, obviously we were white kids from the suburbs traversing like this urban place to get into these little underground clubs to see these bands that added to it.
*  You know what I mean?
*  And just the aesthetic.
*  You know what I mean?
*  I was obsessed.
*  I still am an obsessive influenced by the beat writers and beat culture.
*  And so for me, like, you know, Jack Kerouac isn't writing about the suburbs.
*  He's writing about the, you know, Mexico City or whatever.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Gregory Corso or Allen Ginsberg, all these poets and people are writing about all these experiences that don't seem to be happening in like a neighborhood where they call the houses a five, four and a door.
*  You know what I mean?
*  So a certain angst is cultivated.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, that only the only thing that could satisfy that would be something that I felt was gritty and real.
*  Well, there's a there's something about if you can.
*  I mean, I haven't been to downtown L.A. to see music in quite a while.
*  But the last time I went there, I saw Gary Clark Jr.
*  and Honey Honey at this very small place with, you know, maybe there was like 200 people in there.
*  I took my daughter and it was like a late show on a Monday night, like 1130.
*  And here we're seeing Gary, Gary Clark Jr.
*  and Honey Honey play a cover of Midnight Rider.
*  And it just felt so special because there's no one there.
*  And you survived.
*  And you survived. And you get out.
*  You get out of here. Where's the car?
*  Get the fuck out of here.
*  But you know, it's weird about that.
*  And I get it.
*  And we but haven't I spent a lot of my time reading.
*  I read a lot of varied materials.
*  And one thing that comes up is humans are dangerous.
*  And places where there's a shit ton of them are usually pretty gross and dangerous.
*  It's a numbers thing.
*  It's totally numbers thing.
*  It's other things, ills as well.
*  Sure.
*  That are hard for us to deal with.
*  And look, if we're lucky enough to be walking upright and some how mentally stable or whatever.
*  Right.
*  But but but I think cities have always been dangerous places.
*  They certainly have.
*  Ancient Rome was a dangerous place.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  You know what I mean?
*  I mean, it was so wild.
*  We were just in Sicily and we went to Palermo for the day and it was a polo.
*  Have you ever been to Palermo?
*  Yeah.
*  Wild. Yeah.
*  That city is like a like an electric wire that's got sparks shooting out of it.
*  You can't get a hold of it.
*  You know, my grandfather's from.
*  Yeah.
*  Palermo. Yeah.
*  When we went to Italy, one of the most interesting.
*  Is this water?
*  Yes. Yes.
*  And this coffee and this if you want.
*  Cheers.
*  One of the most interesting things is just Italy in general is like every time I go there,
*  I'm like, maybe I should live like this.
*  Like they fucking know how to relax.
*  People know how to relax.
*  Like with the way they sit down and eat, no one sits down and eat for 40 minutes.
*  You sit down and eat for two hours.
*  French people have it dialed in pretty good.
*  They do.
*  Well, yeah, they have pasties, which is the.
*  What is pasties?
*  Pasties is a it's it's a aperitif from the south of France.
*  You ever see it says Ricard Marseille.
*  Marseille is famous for pasties.
*  It's a it's all Mediterranean cultures have an Anisette based drink.
*  Italians have Zambuca.
*  The Greeks have Uzo Arat in Lebanon and Lebanese people.
*  And there's all sorts of them in the south of France.
*  They drink one that's a little more sophisticated and a lot more herbs and things in it.
*  And they say you always know in France someone from Marseille because they always have a pastis in their hands.
*  It's like it's a high alcohol level, a lot of sugar, but it's delicious.
*  You put it in ice and dilute it with water and it makes it all this kind of milky color.
*  You know, it's genius.
*  Well, it's just you only have a certain amount of time on this planet.
*  And they've chosen to live their time in a more relaxed manner, more community based.
*  And just people like to sit around.
*  Do you think that any of that has to do with embracing a certain middle classness or or even lower middle?
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like the working man, you know what I mean?
*  Even a blue collar way, I think.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Whereas here it seems that's been stripped away from something to be proud of unless it's kind of in a way distortedly proud.
*  You know, distortion of what that could be.
*  Right. I know what you're saying.
*  Yeah. Well, in here, it's supposed to be your your main goal is to get to be the type of person that can look down upon that.
*  Yeah, yeah, totally.
*  Yeah. Your your goal is not to exist in that and just accept it.
*  This is life. The life is you have money for food.
*  You have money for your house like you're not well.
*  Well, if you look at like media like sitcoms from the 70s, whether it's Archie Bunker or whatever, like they're just people with jobs and even taxi.
*  Or Barney Miller or whatever.
*  You know what I mean?
*  And now it's then it turns into full house where somehow all these people and these kids live in this amazing house and everyone has clean clothes.
*  You know what I mean?
*  It's like there's no struggle.
*  Yeah, totally.
*  Yeah.
*  And no, no.
*  It's not just recognition.
*  I think it's and it's not celebratory.
*  It's just like, look, man, this this doesn't make the man right.
*  What my material things don't make me who I am.
*  It's who I am, how I feel, what I, you know, what I've learned.
*  That's the big problem is what we're sold in Western culture, that the goal is to acquire things and to achieve a certain financial status.
*  And then then you'll have made it.
*  I get it. Pastis doesn't grow on trees.
*  You know what I mean? I got to pay for that shit.
*  It's not that expensive.
*  You know what I mean?
*  It's not it's just there's a distortion.
*  Like when we were kids and I get it, like I said, I I made the choice in my life, Mom and Dad, we weren't, you know, we were middle class people.
*  But I made the choice when I said I'm not going to university, I'm going to be in a band.
*  My dad, that was like the last dollar I ever saw.
*  Not even like, hey, you know what I mean?
*  And but I made that choice.
*  That choice wasn't made for me.
*  Right.
*  You know what I mean?
*  And within two years, I'm on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine.
*  We're fucking around.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like selling millions of records.
*  I get I get that.
*  You know what I mean?
*  I'm not lost on me.
*  But it gets back to where we started talking about there will always be a part of me that is making music because it's really maybe the only place where I'm truly.
*  Free.
*  You know what I mean?
*  I have the freedom.
*  You know, it's funny.
*  I tell the story.
*  We were on Saturday Night Live two times.
*  The second time was in on our second album, Southern Harmony, and we went on the show.
*  It was the number one album in America.
*  It debuted at number one.
*  Our new single was a song called Sometimes Salvation.
*  We were going to play that.
*  And we're going to play one of our big hit records.
*  And at the time, it was a, you know, called Remedy.
*  And we had just written this song called Nonfiction.
*  And I was like, let's play nonfiction.
*  And it's funny because it's different as my brother and I are rich was like, yeah, fuck it.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like, it's a cool song.
*  The guy, whoever was the music guy, he was like, you can't do that.
*  And I was like, well, I mean, we could do what we want, I think.
*  He was mad as we were smoking weed in the dressing room like didn't John Belushi OD in the bathroom.
*  I was like, what do you fucking care?
*  Call the cops.
*  I told him, call the cops.
*  We get arrested and Saturday Night Live for smoking weed will be bigger than this.
*  But the guy, now that I'm older, I realize I was just totally being just horrible like kid.
*  But he goes, you're making a big mistake not playing this single.
*  And I said, OK, well, here's the deal.
*  You're on this show next week with some other fucking band.
*  And then the next week after that, and then the next week after that, when this is my band.
*  So let me make the mistake.
*  I'm not going to let you tell us what to do.
*  And if it's a mistake, then we'll fucking eat it.
*  And I'm still here.
*  And where is he?
*  Well, it's funny.
*  Someone told me he has a I forget his name.
*  I read into him once before he did not like our attitude.
*  He was on a podcast about Saturday Night Live or something and said we were the worst people he ever dealt with in his entire career there.
*  And I was like, well, thank you.
*  That's funny.
*  The worst how?
*  Because you just didn't listen to him.
*  Yeah, yeah, we didn't do what he wanted.
*  That's not what you're supposed to do with artists.
*  Especially when you're young and you're still like the fire is like so intense.
*  You know, that's always the problem with the executive mindsets versus artistic mindsets.
*  Right. And you some producer character who just wants everything to go according to this very specific plan they have laid out.
*  And you're trying to take an artist and first of all, just trying to take an artist and making them sing one song is kind of crazy.
*  Right.
*  Yeah. I mean, there's I mean, I think we see that now.
*  Yeah. You know, we see people are like, I'll do it.
*  I'll do it. You know what I mean?
*  There's someone who's ready to jump up and do anything.
*  And I think that's been a part of showbiz.
*  But that's kind of what we were saying before.
*  I think the talent show thing, you know, the vote for me.
*  Right.
*  You know what?
*  No one was voting for us.
*  Right. We were unvotable.
*  And that was part of the reason that we were drawn to these characters and these people and these other outsiders and these other whatever kind of spectrum we're on or whatever that's different that would we were like, you know, music to us represented everything anti vote for me.
*  But did it feel weird to transcend that and become mainstream massive?
*  Yes. It's very weird.
*  Like, what is the juxtaposition?
*  I mean, it has to be so strange.
*  You're you're these rebels.
*  And then all of a sudden you're the number one fucking band in the world.
*  And then. Yeah.
*  And it's it was tough.
*  It was maybe tougher for me because I was more boots on the ground in the scene and with people.
*  And now it's like, especially in the 80s in Atlanta, it was like, you know, fuck major.
*  Anyone who signs with a major label, man, fuck that.
*  You know what I mean?
*  And I'm like, yeah, you know, power to the people or whatever.
*  You know, and then it's like you're on MTV 30 times a day and in between fucking Toyota commercials and Snapple or whatever.
*  Right.
*  So and it's weird because our politics are so in line with so many of the like the alternative politics of music, the way, you know,
*  that would let the grunge or whatever.
*  So, you know, I'm the same age as all of the grunge bands, but I don't exist in the 90s in the same way we weren't.
*  You know what I mean?
*  I'm doing something.
*  But it is funny.
*  Like, you know, people say, well, Kirk, no fucking label is signing Kurt Cobain today.
*  But as a matter of fact, Kurt and our generation of people were we were talking about compliance and defiance.
*  You're making a mistake.
*  Fuck it.
*  It's my mistake to make.
*  It's my band.
*  It's my art.
*  And people we met and my kind of generation is not about being old.
*  Now I think there's so much compliance.
*  OK.
*  I don't want to cause any trouble at the record label.
*  This is we're all distorted right now with social media and all the different avenues for people to get attention and to get famous.
*  It's so easy.
*  I shouldn't say it's easy because it's rare but common.
*  So it's like it's more it's it's more highlighted which way you can go to achieve success.
*  But do you remember that famous time where Kurt Cobain and Nirvana were playing and they were forcing them to lip sync?
*  Yeah.
*  And so what did Kurt do?
*  Do you start reading out of a book or something like that?
*  Like you did a bunch of wild things.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Of course.
*  I mean see if you could find that Jamie because it's kind of hilarious.
*  Yeah I know.
*  I know what nobody did that at the time and they were telling them no no no you can't play live.
*  Yeah here it is perfect set to perform the recent single Smells Like Teen Spirit the British music chart television program top of the pops time to show the policy requiring artists to sing live vocals over prerecorded backtracks.
*  As you would expect Kurt Cobain his bandmates would not let this go without having some fun.
*  So they started fucking around in the middle of the song.
*  The result was and still one of the greatest middle fingers to live performances ever.
*  The band literally made its own shred video.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Because you got to sing the live vocal over the yeah.
*  So you started fucking around and coming up with new live.
*  Great.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean we were we loved the replacements.
*  You know that was like a band like they're.
*  Being on Saturday live was a disaster but we thought that's our band you know I mean I remember every fucking person that we knew in Atlanta that Saturday night that the replacements came on and made in TV on Saturday live.
*  We all were at parties and watching it and getting completely shit face watching they like shave their eyebrows off and shit and we're rolling around and change clothes and people were like oh dear.
*  We were like yeah sharing it on like that's how you.
*  That's it isn't that part of one of the goals is to be that big of a pain in the ass to the.
*  And who are you being a pain in the ass to put some authority right.
*  Something that says you can't do that or this is the way it goes and that changes you know but I think as a as a youth.
*  That's definitely something I'm not feeling with a lot of bands.
*  I mean I think it's there in like the punk scene and stuff like that but but they're not they're not getting access to that green green day is still that way.
*  I think the carrot is still dangled right in front of everybody's face is so close now you know a special with people that make it independently through YouTube and tick tock and all these different venues there's just so many different ways that someone could become massively successful now.
*  And see this is where I become the time traveler I am from the last century.
*  I get it.
*  I find I don't you know I think a guy smashing his nuts on a rail on a skateboard is as funny as anyone but I've seen it you know what I mean.
*  Yeah.
*  You know what I mean it's not like Steve Coogan or something you know what I mean like the craft and like subtext and like all this other weird cerebral stuff with comedy or whatever.
*  I just don't I will never.
*  I guess it's just me as well.
*  The things that the cinema that I enjoy the books I read the records that I listen to.
*  There is all of them.
*  If there's one thing in common there's a level of craft.
*  There's a difference between having it's a difference in having a fine meal at a very nice restaurant versus eating garbage.
*  Yeah.
*  Eating tasty garbage and tick tock is tasty garbage.
*  Yeah you're right.
*  That's absolutely I've never thought about that for you and you can't put it down and you keep going to it and you over consume it.
*  And at least when you do when it's just visual you don't get a big stain on your shirt.
*  I think you get a stain on your brain.
*  Yeah I really do.
*  I do.
*  I think so much of what's going on today like even if I just waste 10 minutes scrolling through tick tock when it's over I just feel like confused.
*  Like what am I doing like why am I fucking paying attention.
*  I don't I'm not I don't have any I never had my I never did any of that.
*  You don't have Facebook Twitter nothing.
*  No I mean the band has one I guess but that's perfect.
*  I don't personally.
*  Good.
*  I never tweeted or any of this.
*  Good for you.
*  And it's funny my phone like I'm still this way you want to my best friends like the three or four people in the world that like I'm super super the closest people.
*  We talk on the phone.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Like I love talking for hours.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean about whatever.
*  So it's I I I get it but I don't.
*  Yeah I'm one of those older people.
*  Well you developed in a different time and this time is fucking bizarre.
*  I can't imagine spending your life grown ass people spending all of their time playing video games.
*  That's a real thing.
*  Well at least that's exciting.
*  It is.
*  But yeah video games.
*  Some video games.
*  Why does it give you a shock.
*  No some video games are so immersive man.
*  You have 3D sound and incredible graphics.
*  Really.
*  Running through corridors and people are chasing you.
*  It's very exciting.
*  And it hits all of your dopamine receptors and it fires you up.
*  I mean video games are pretty fucking amazing now.
*  But it's just the world that we're living in today is it's not designed for human beings.
*  It's designed to capture human beings capture your attention.
*  It's not it's not a like if you're you're spending your time going from a coffee shop to a restaurant to a bookstore to a record store to a live concert.
*  Museum to an art gallery.
*  These are human experiences.
*  These are human experiences.
*  But if you're spending your time arguing with people on Twitter all day like nothing is more depressing to me than seeing old rock stars argue about politics on Twitter.
*  It is so goddamn depressing watching rock stars virtue signal and attacking people personally for having differing political beliefs like and then looking at their timeline and realizing these poor fucks are addicted to this shit.
*  They're doing this five six hours every day.
*  Get off my lawn.
*  It's get off my lawn.
*  Get off my lawn.
*  You know it's fucking rock stars.
*  It's like good lord man.
*  Do you have friends like get out.
*  Get out of the house.
*  We just we just you know it's funny we were gone for three months.
*  We did the States on this latest tour.
*  We played a lot of new songs from our latest record.
*  It was amazing.
*  And then we finished in Europe.
*  And my wife and I stayed in Sicily and went back to London at the end.
*  And I've been doing it for 35 years of that you know 1990 first time I go to Europe and it's still like I don't care.
*  Thirty five years.
*  It's a lot of shows.
*  I don't care if I wake up and I'm tired and we have friends all over the place which is a beautiful thing.
*  Friends in Amsterdam friends in Paris friends in London friends in Madrid friends in this you know Germany.
*  But we're we're constantly out doing you know I mean there's no way we're not heading the town in any town and finding what it has that makes maybe it unique or special.
*  Whether that's taste.
*  Yeah.
*  Or whatever.
*  I mean it's I it sounds silly but like I said before it's adventure there's still adventure in the world and I'm not talking about jumping out of an airplane adventure.
*  Yeah.
*  You know that just stimuli.
*  I think it's it's cognitive nutrition.
*  I think it's actually good for you to experience different cultures and see how people hang out and see their restaurants and see you know.
*  And you see everyone's doing the same.
*  You know they just styling it a little different.
*  Doing it a different way but it flavors your understanding of human beings.
*  That's why my very very special place the thing that I love almost more than any other thing is Jamaica.
*  Really.
*  I've been I was lucky enough to have a dear friend introduce me to Jamaica.
*  Oh 30 years ago and I have friends there and I have a whole life there that has nothing to do with anything other than Jamaica shit.
*  And I go to the country and like we like have like a country kind of life there you know ocean and no resorts you know.
*  The food there is fucking amazing amazing food in Jamaica.
*  Jamaican food is so delicious.
*  And you have to get out there and eat it and they have like anything else you know the fruits there the vegetables there the seafood and and you know they say in Jamaica that the goat a goat in Jamaica only has one bad day.
*  It's not even a whole bad day.
*  It's just a quick moment.
*  One bad moment.
*  That's a wrap.
*  One bad moment and the rest we're all happy with.
*  Yeah and then the rest everyone's eating it.
*  Yeah that's one of the things I loved about Anthony Bourdain show you know that he would go and really immerse himself in these cultures and eat their food and hang out with their chefs and hang out with the people and get toured you know someone would take them on a tour around the town.
*  You know what happened to sometimes he would be tired and hungover.
*  Oh yeah.
*  And yeah.
*  Most of the time.
*  But yeah but again you know I mean I get it man everyone has a tough thing but it's like oh dear I don't know.
*  You know I better get this.
*  I'm like okay.
*  If you enjoy what you're doing being tired is not that bad.
*  If you enjoy what you're doing it's okay.
*  So what.
*  Just get up have a coffee let's go.
*  And I bullshit you not.
*  If for some reason I had to like get a quick 20 25 in I could curl up right there and do it and you wouldn't even know I was here.
*  I believe you.
*  Like expert.
*  That's 35 years of being on the road.
*  Knowing how to power nap.
*  I got to get I got to go down or I'm going to like be in it like in an intersection like you know waving a gun around with my pants down by my ankles.
*  I've learned how to sleep instantly on planes.
*  I get on a plane and almost always I'm out cold.
*  Me too.
*  I annoy every single person I'm traveling with.
*  Yeah.
*  How does he sleep so quick.
*  She's like what.
*  How'd you fall asleep that quick.
*  Even when my Jamaican dog in my life we brought it when my wife and I were married in Jamaica and we have a little street dog that we brought back.
*  Oh that's cool.
*  Bami long face.
*  Yeah.
*  Bami she's 35 pounds but I can even sleep with my Jamaican street dog on my lap.
*  That's cool.
*  So Jamaica is your spot huh.
*  Fan and they just got hit very hard with this hurricane.
*  My friends are okay and stuff but they're everyone's really shooken up over in Jamaica.
*  It's scary shit man.
*  And it's been a bad they haven't had something like that since 2007 and this was worse.
*  I saw live footage of it some live cell phone footage of it.
*  It's just unless you've experienced that live when you were around the sky and the sky becomes an angry monster and everywhere around you is dangerous and the winds are 120 miles an hour and just like it's so humbling.
*  I've never I mean I was in a tornado in Atlanta in the early 70s and that was.
*  I mean I was probably too young to be like traumatized but I remember my feeling my parents trauma about this thing going over our house or whatever.
*  It's fucking terrifying shit man.
*  When it was over though when you're a kid it was like amazing like the whole world was one big pine sap jungle job.
*  I mean for weeks we were just because you're just climbing in all the fallen trees and my dad had some old Pontiac and that thing was like a you in the car some giant pine tree.
*  Smash Wow.
*  So it was like a surrealist thing too as a kid you know like wow everything's been shaken up.
*  Yeah it's also a lesson in the temporary nature of things you can look out and think this is my lawn this where the cars parked this is how things are and then all of a sudden the sky's like not today bitch.
*  Throw a tree through your fucking house.
*  What was that commercial in the 70s of Mother Earth gets angry with it.
*  Remember that it was like shampoo or something.
*  But it was like there was their catchphrase and it would be like oh yeah I remember that.
*  It was like it might be shampoo or something something stupid but it's true you know and you have to do it.
*  I mean shit fuck.
*  Well Katrina is still something like you know I love New Orleans is one of the most special cities in the world and it's still amazing it's still vibrant dynamic alive.
*  But I think the scars of that place are still there I mean that was devastating brutal yeah unbelievably brutal I mean when when hurricanes hit places and devastate them it takes decades for them to recover especially without aid and then sometimes
*  it's like the people that are there they just don't want to do it anymore it's like when you realize you're in a place that this happens and there's other places where this doesn't happen you just get the fuck out you know.
*  But there's a humbling of being attached to nature in that way that I think like I grew up in Boston and there's something to the people that live up there that understand that every winter it's going to get so cold you could die outside.
*  Right that's a that's a reality that no one in LA experiences because in LA it's like earthquakes fire floods zombie apocalypse.
*  I get a little bit of that but you can kind of get away from that.
*  It's not going to overcome your entire city.
*  You can build a very high fence and have the state of the art security system.
*  The fires are wild.
*  I was evacuated three times living in LA.
*  We were in the valley.
*  Yeah yeah.
*  We were in the valley three separate times the last time the two houses across the street from my house burnt to the ground.
*  It was wild.
*  It's just wild going through your old neighborhood and seeing just house after house like there's 40 houses in our neighborhood that were burnt the ground we were in Marin County Northern California and out in a place called login Edis and was this is four or five summers ago.
*  And we just you know kept shitting the car guitars you know there's one guitar and I just can't live without some pictures you know we just get both our cars filled because you're out you know just ashes falling in the yard and scary.
*  Well it's when it goes bad it goes real bad.
*  I was filming fear factor once in.
*  It was about an hour and a half away from LA and the fires get so bad we had to stop shooting drive home and on the way home we're off the five freeway and on the way home the entire right side of the highway for an hour was in flames like completely in flames like a Lord of the Rings movie.
*  Like you're waiting for demons to ride horses over the top of the mountains.
*  It was it's there's something about those those kind of scenes it's like it puts you back in check.
*  That's like hey man like maybe the things you're concentrating on aren't all that important for real.
*  I think it also touches us in a in a in our animalistic DNA of like still being that person you know these people again it's a quest for fire being these people who are really not just completely immersed in their environment as well for survival and sustenance and everything.
*  Yeah that it's still like in the way I guess you know there's an instinctive thing in those moments that that has to be the exact same chemical reaction in every human being in any.
*  Expansive time that we've been like this.
*  Yeah yeah when we were in Sicily we're at one I guess there was an eruption there recently.
*  There's one today or last night.
*  That's right I was seeing it on the news but when we were there there's we were near this one island that had a constant eruption at night time you could see the red at the top of the mountain just a little bit of red like blob bubbling up off the top of the mountain.
*  It's so fucking cool.
*  I've never really got close to something like that.
*  Like you know.
*  Have you ever done a tour in Hawaii we fly over in a helicopter.
*  No.
*  Hawaii is wild the big island is wild because it's growing every year because the lava is constantly flowing into the ocean you can literally watch the island expand in real time.
*  That's wild.
*  And you fly over in helicopters so you're flying over you're looking down at the lava pouring out of the earth.
*  Is this Italy? Mount Etna look at that isn't that wild man.
*  That's incredible.
*  Not to be confused with regular Italy.
*  Yes Sicilians think of themselves very differently.
*  Look how beautiful that is man.
*  God that's so fucking cool.
*  We visited Pompeii too.
*  I did that as a kid and it's still one of the coolest but I was like you know it's funny when I look back you know they have like up the streets they'll have like the fountain at the end of the street or whatever the water would come and you could see like where people lean their hands.
*  There's like an indention for the centuries of people leaning in to get a sip of water.
*  I just put my hand on that as a kid just like I could I almost couldn't stop like thinking about that.
*  I do that all the time.
*  I do you know I do that with my kids and I'm like fucking around like shake the hand.
*  I shook Chuck Berry's hand.
*  Bo Diddley's hand.
*  Yeah.
*  Little I shook Little Richard's hand.
*  John Lee Hooker.
*  You know they're all like laughing.
*  Did you meet John Lee Hooker?
*  I did one time.
*  Wow.
*  That's a guy I'd love to meet.
*  It was his handshake was like amazing.
*  It was just like he touched my hand.
*  It was just like a like a cloud.
*  It was the softest like pillow.
*  I was like wow.
*  And it was early you know early days we had lined the Memphis Blues Festival and he went on before us and I was like I just don't think that's right.
*  Right.
*  I know we're selling a lot of records but that's it's crazy.
*  That's John Lee Hooker man.
*  Yeah.
*  Never get out of these blues alive.
*  Yeah.
*  Boom boom boom.
*  Yeah.
*  He was as cool as it gets.
*  That's amazing man.
*  Have you ever met anybody that just like gave you like can't believe I'm talking to this person.
*  Yes.
*  But one time it was Dr. J.
*  Oh wow.
*  I was at some party in Vegas.
*  This is back in the mid 90s and VH one thing or something.
*  And I was standing outside was at the Hard Rock and this is the guy's name Steve Wynn who owns the thing the Hard Rock.
*  Yeah.
*  Or something.
*  He owns a bunch of that.
*  Yeah.
*  And this was 30 years ago and I was there and he was like oh hey Chris you ever met Julius Erving.
*  I was I mean I was like I loved Dr. J.
*  So much growing up you know he and George Gervan were my heroes.
*  I played basketball and I was like he was just so cool you know and he was like hey man nice to meet you.
*  I was just I was like a little kid.
*  I just couldn't believe that I met Dr. J.
*  Dr. J.
*  I got to throw him in there too.
*  Wow.
*  One would be Robert Altman the director.
*  Oh really.
*  I met Robert at a party.
*  I was at a party like a Donatella Versace party in London and there were a bunch of famous people there but everyone sat down at a table and you know different things.
*  And he was a I was just like oh and he was with Richard E.
*  Grant.
*  They were making Gosford Park.
*  Richard E.
*  Grant also I was impressed to see and meet because of the film with Nell and I is one of my favorite movies of all time and there's with now you know like there he is.
*  I mean it's Richard but but there's Bob Altman who is you know lord of my imagination and you know one of the best film my favorite film.
*  Some of my favorite films of all time.
*  So after when the dinner kind of like is less whatever people are up talking to other people I just go over to him.
*  I'm like fuck it.
*  I'm just going to you know I would be a little bit timid or shy in that situation and I would never think anyone I still to this day never imagine anyone knows who I am or what I do or whatever.
*  It's a good way to go through life.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And then you find out most people don't know who you are.
*  Give a fuck what I go over and I introduce myself and I instantly recognize that he smells like weed like he's you know got a roach in his pocket or something and I'm like Bob are you hold it.
*  He goes yeah you want to get stoned.
*  I was like yeah.
*  So he pulls out a joint and like we're sitting there and we're just talking about weed and you know he's like it's hard to get I get this from California you know and I was like wow man I you know and we smoked a joint and talked a little bit about music and jazz and London.
*  And that was kind of it and he was like oh you should come by the office.
*  And I never took him up on it like the production office just because I just I felt out of my depth.
*  You know what I mean.
*  I should have.
*  But that that was like one of those things I will always remember.
*  It's interesting when you meet the people that were heroes to you and they're just human beings.
*  They're just normal.
*  And then you realize like especially in your case like you've become that to other people.
*  And then some kid will come up to you.
*  Chris Robinson.
*  Yeah.
*  And you're like yeah.
*  Fucking normal person just a person.
*  But to them you're you're the black crows.
*  You're not a normal person.
*  You're a fucking god.
*  You know it's weird.
*  You're an inaccessible like plateau of society that very few people ever experience music as a part of that as well.
*  You know like you said I mean and I you know there will always be.
*  I don't know.
*  I think that there is a connection in creation art.
*  You know where does the idea come from.
*  I mean I think there's people who can manipulate that and make I'm going to make a pop song and it's going to sound like this.
*  And not saying that it's not special not good.
*  But then I think there's other things that there's I'm not using it in a Christian way or whatever.
*  I think there's a divine spark of something that happens or whatever drops in your lap imagination wise.
*  The muse.
*  You know the muse is real.
*  The muse is real.
*  I think it is real too.
*  And the one thing that I do believe about the muse and I consider the muse a female presence a female dynamic.
*  You know and I feel that the muse at least my the muse that I feel is a very jealous thing.
*  And I don't mean it in like any possessive way or anything weird but just like the second your devotion is turned somewhere else.
*  The muse could leave you.
*  That might be as superstitious as throwing salt over your shoulder or whatever.
*  But I honestly believe that.
*  And it makes it difficult in life because life isn't just the muse.
*  Life isn't just the dream world that I live in my imagination.
*  And the ideas have to come from somewhere.
*  It's not just singing and dancing and you have to have ideas.
*  What is this?
*  You know for me I've always had to be involved with every aspect.
*  The album covers the stage design the fucking lamina.
*  Everything has to fit into a world that I can feel like I want to inhabit.
*  You know something that's comfortable and interesting.
*  And I think if you remove so it's not just the musical part of the muse it's the whole thing.
*  And I think if you're like you know what I'm going to get into I'm not you're if my reverence for that goes away and even in the slightest I feel that she will turn her back on me forever and I'll have nothing no more poetry no more music.
*  Well you're probably right because let's assume the muse is real.
*  The muse would probably reserve its greatest inspiration for its most devoted followers.
*  I think so.
*  Yeah the most devout followers are the ones that are going to be adherent to a ritual.
*  Sit in front of the computer or the notepad or however you write and just like spend time.
*  Yeah I could never ever write lyrics on off screen.
*  I could never do it.
*  You write it on paper?
*  Oh yeah.
*  Does anybody write lyrics on screens?
*  I think yeah.
*  Like a lot of people.
*  Artists that you know of?
*  Yeah yeah.
*  Interesting.
*  I think a lot of hip hop people write rhymes on their phones.
*  Yeah no I know a lot of rock and roll people who were like hey you know.
*  Well the phone thing is convenient.
*  I transfer all my notes to phones because it's an occasion I'll write something on the phone.
*  The best thing about the phone honestly is like sometimes I have an idea.
*  Maybe I've had a couple of cocktails too which is like you know memory is slippery when you're drinking with friends and you're having a good time.
*  But you have an idea.
*  I'll just like run into a bathroom stall and I'll hit the voice recorder and just say it.
*  I do that too.
*  I do the voice recorder as well for like if I'm plucking around a guitar and I get a little something that I like.
*  Or when Rich and I are writing songs too like if we're not.
*  But you know I've never had a home studio.
*  I've never wanted that.
*  Really?
*  I never.
*  You want to go to a place?
*  I want to go to a place and I like a part of my thing is I like everyone's contribution.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Right.
*  I mean in the Black Crows Rich and I write the songs.
*  So but the contributions can be musical or the product or it could be anything.
*  Right.
*  I mean sometimes that you know it's the engineer and the producer and the band and the.
*  And it's the vibe of those people being together.
*  And it's all of that circulating and percolating and making something everyone in on it.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like an old submarine movie or something.
*  Like you're being depth charged and everyone has a job to do so you don't die.
*  Right.
*  You know.
*  But I think that's important for me.
*  You know like I love I mean Prince is one of my musically.
*  I mean there's an argument you made that maybe Prince was the baddest motherfucker of all time.
*  Definitely an argument.
*  I mean because there's people who can write.
*  There's people who can play.
*  There's people who can produce and record.
*  And there's people who can dance and sing and perform.
*  That guy did it all at its ultimate level.
*  Every musical instrument.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  He was insane.
*  It was so good.
*  And he was so different.
*  The first album came out.
*  It's just that picture of him with his shirt off with his hair.
*  You know and you hear the songs and you're like wow this guy's out there.
*  Yeah the second record Prince.
*  Is that the second record?
*  Yeah the first one's called For You.
*  And there's a picture of him kind of like.
*  It's For You is that one with Jack Me Off.
*  No that's later.
*  Okay.
*  For You the first single is Soft and Wet.
*  Which is before Jack You Off.
*  It has to be Soft and Wet.
*  So I always laugh because I was you know by the time we're in the suburbs I live in Atlanta.
*  You know I'm obsessed with black radio at the time.
*  I'm only listening to V-103 FM Atlanta.
*  My first concert is Slave and Cool in the Gang and Sky at the Omni.
*  I'm going to see The Time, Vanity Six, S.O.S., Lakeside, Cameo.
*  Oh wow Morris Day.
*  Yeah that was one of the best concerts I've ever seen.
*  At that you know at that time in my life and only listening to that radio.
*  So the first Prince single comes out and it's Soft and Wet.
*  It's a great song.
*  Dun dun dun dun.
*  Dun dun dun dun.
*  And like funky and cool.
*  This little kind of disco breakdown in the middle.
*  A little roller skating shit in the middle.
*  And I'm like I didn't but I didn't really know what Soft and Wet was yet.
*  You know I was like is this like a washcloth that he left in the bed.
*  What is this?
*  Yeah.
*  No he was a character man.
*  I never met him.
*  A very original character.
*  I never even I saw him.
*  I only saw him in concert once.
*  Really?
*  And it was fantastic.
*  He was amazing.
*  He was doing a residency once at House of Blues in Vegas.
*  But it was like really late at night.
*  I had to do something in the morning and I passed on going.
*  To this day I kill myself.
*  Yeah because he would do the concert and then go play another eight hours or whatever.
*  Yeah well he was going up really late.
*  It's like it was after midnight.
*  And I was like I got shit I have to do tomorrow.
*  I can't do this.
*  I can't be that tired.
*  To this day I'm like fuck.
*  You know what's funny the other person I met that I was that put me very much at ease but
*  when I first said hello that I was totally freaked out was George Jones.
*  Oh wow.
*  I met him at the at the Ryman Auditorium after Johnny Cash passed away.
*  It's like me Jesus the Sistine's chapel.
*  Man I mean I was like I was I got ushered into this dressing room.
*  You know I was a guest.
*  Chris Christopherson was there.
*  I was you know I was amazed to meet him.
*  And but I'm like fucking George Jones.
*  Old possums right there.
*  And I end up talking to him and he was really really sweet man.
*  I wanted to talk about Kansas City Chiefs.
*  He loved the Chiefs and I used to watch football back then.
*  And but I will always remember.
*  So they were he was taking over for Johnny Cash singing.
*  I think it's Johnny Cash.
*  Maybe it was Johnny Cash.
*  I think it's Johnny Cash.
*  Maybe it was Waylon's part.
*  I don't know the song that great.
*  The Highwayman.
*  I was a highwayman.
*  And the Columbia.
*  Yeah.
*  And he was the dam builder on the Columbia River or whatever.
*  But he he kept looking at the lyrics.
*  He went I'm a damn builder.
*  Chris Christopherson was like man it's not like he goes I don't think my fans want me.
*  I'm a damn builder.
*  I mean he just kept thought it was so funny and I was like what amazing you know that I got to be in there.
*  But the other funny part of that is they were like Chris we take a picture with George and Chris and I'm like I'm getting my fucking picture taken with George Jones and Chris Christopherson.
*  That's pretty well.
*  This is like coolest thing.
*  And I'm like I'm like in the middle.
*  You know.
*  Man this is the coolest day ever.
*  And then the door opens.
*  My ex wife is there too.
*  But then the door opens.
*  And Al Gore gets in the picture and ruins it.
*  Get out of the picture.
*  Who.
*  How did he get in there.
*  I don't know.
*  Did he start talking about the climate.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  That was his initial climate thing.
*  But I'm like let's talk about your wife telling people what they can listen to.
*  Out of here.
*  Who are you.
*  Self righteous.
*  Yeah people forgot about that.
*  She was the one who made well it actually helped albums because when they put those warning labels on them.
*  Everybody wanted them.
*  Everybody wanted a warning label one.
*  Yeah.
*  And they haven't even got a warning label.
*  Oh I remember when NWA had the warning label on them.
*  I mean all of them.
*  But I mean I'm like you guys are really seriously upset about the band Wasp.
*  I mean like you feel like you.
*  It's really ridiculous now in hindsight.
*  But I remember I was in high school at the time it was a big thing.
*  Well they're telling you what to do again.
*  You know what I mean.
*  And a lot of it was racist.
*  Oh yeah.
*  But it was like I guess it was out of high school.
*  It was like when rap music was really starting to emerge and those lyrics were so shocking like early ice tea ice cube all that stuff.
*  It happened with rock and roll.
*  You know what I mean.
*  Elvis Presley.
*  They wouldn't let him shake his hips on TV.
*  I mean it happened with Chuck Berry too.
*  And there's that the initial phase of the cosmic fucking blood and brimstone of rock and roll is ends pretty quickly when it starts.
*  And then you turn into the Paul Enka Pat Boone sort of style until the Beatles really come back around.
*  I mean there's you know you have lots of cool records in between there but they're very they're small.
*  But it's interesting like that where things come in waves.
*  They come in waves of great artists for whatever reason.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Well I think I mean I mean at least if you look at like when I look at my age people we were just we were close enough to the Beatles and close enough to the sex pistols and close.
*  You know what I mean.
*  And the Stones and Zeppelin.
*  That shit's long gone for a lot of younger people.
*  You know as time as time moves on.
*  Yeah.
*  You know what I mean.
*  I just ask you a question because before I forget did Rick Rubin try to get you guys to change the name of your band.
*  Yes.
*  And did he really try to get you to change the name of the band to KKK the Cobb County Crows.
*  I know that the king of yoga or whatever the fuck he's selling whatever you know whatever his you know.
*  But under that beard that that guy.
*  And it's funny because good for Rick Rubin whatever he can do whatever he wants.
*  You know he has very little.
*  But he did say that's a that's a true story.
*  Well so by the way it was unimaginably offensive unimaginably.
*  Why would you say that to us.
*  You know how does it happen.
*  Because I think.
*  Well we were we were called Mr.
*  Crow's Garden and it's a book.
*  It's like a children's book from like the 20s.
*  Called Mr.
*  Crow's Garden.
*  With an E. So it's a name.
*  He was Mr.
*  Crow.
*  And we were kind of you know into like psychedelic you know like it was our that was the name of our band.
*  So when we made Shaker Moneymaker a few years had gone by since we first were Mr.
*  Crow's Garden.
*  And now we don't sound like that.
*  And George Choukoulis our producer and our A&R guy in our lifeline to the music business to the world who signed us and stuff.
*  He was like we need you know we got to change the name.
*  So there was a little bit of time where before we said we'll be the black crows.
*  And that's when Rick interjected that that's what he would.
*  Because we're southern.
*  Aren't all southern people fear driven ignorant bigots.
*  Isn't every one of them.
*  But he didn't say it that way right.
*  So how do he said it like it'd be cool it'll be like controversial.
*  I'm like yeah.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  Yeah.
*  So and I and how did he bring it up.
*  Like I think this is a cool you're from Cobb County.
*  See we're not from there but when we we're from Atlanta.
*  By the way it's fucking hard to get it to change Wikipedia that they're like we're being rich born in Mariana.
*  We're not we're from Atlanta Georgia you know third generation Atlantans.
*  And I was like my grandfather was born in Atlanta in 1906.
*  You know what I mean.
*  So it's hard to get that change.
*  But he was like oh so you live in Cobb County C.O.B.B.
*  Well you should change it to Cobb County Crows and put them all case.
*  And we were like it's it's that's so foul and disgusting.
*  It's also it's such a crazy idea to not have like context to it just to imagine that you're going to call ban the KKK like what the Cobb County Crows actually sounds cool.
*  It's easy.
*  You know it was a Cobb County CCC.
*  No problems.
*  Great name.
*  Nothing wrong with it.
*  You probably achieve the exact same success as the Black Crows.
*  But I don't know because the poet in me and the the armchair occultists would believe that that the only way we got we achieved what we achieved became what we became is because of the way that some reason also leaving the E in it made.
*  That was the one thing that I said we would do.
*  So it's you know and by the way leaving the E in it was also great and it's still great to this day when we're someone requests something or want something from you and they misspell the name of the band we're like no.
*  No.
*  You could get a look there.
*  There are a lot of me.
*  I just can't imagine that conversation someone's saying I can't imagine it.
*  I can't imagine it either.
*  To be honest Rick is a friend of mine.
*  So just to you know for clarity I don't hate Rick Rubin or anything.
*  He's a genius.
*  He did say that.
*  Fascinating guy.
*  I mean he's a very interesting thinker and I can imagine this idea intrusively embedding itself in his mind and then coming out of his mouth.
*  I just can't see.
*  I just you know I found a lot of when especially in this you know when our first record came out and you know we're on tour and we're working that record and I'm the one who has to get up in the morning and OK so we're playing we're in Cleveland now we're playing Cincinnati I have to go to 10 radio stations in Cleveland and Cincinnati and do the handshaking and the talking and you know sell the band.
*  I mean I meet all the like local promo people you know so they pick you up and stuff and most everyone was really super cool and they would be the people that could get you drugs and pay for drinks and stuff.
*  Yeah you know and but wow I would be driving in the car with some of these guys and they'd be like must be tough being I'm like you know like talking down to me like you don't know me just because I'm southern and I'm a musician.
*  Doesn't mean that you know talking down to me like I'm stupid or something or I'm like whoa whoa you know must be tough in what way was like you're from Atlanta like they have schools there you know I mean like yeah like just kind of patronizing me or thinking that everyone's supposed to go.
*  You know I mean we're not from Atlanta Georgia yeah you know what I mean you don't know what books I read you don't know what I'm into you don't know anything about me.
*  Well this is always been a deep history of prejudice about people in the what they would call the flyover states to the arrogance of New York and Los Angeles and you know you kind of fly over state people talking to me.
*  You know there's some people that like except Chicago a little bit and some other cities Detroit a little bit but the reality was it was about the coasts and everything in between was bullshit.
*  As if everyone in Rochester New York has like a PhD in French literature.
*  By the way that used to be kind of true when you would go on the road not true but you would notice a market difference in the awareness if you were talking about a country that you were talking about.
*  And the awareness if you were talking about anything out of the ordinary the awareness of people's what they knew in certain cities in certain places in the country versus what they knew in Los Angeles.
*  Yeah yeah I mean they would yeah they're hip yeah they weren't sophisticated they didn't know as much but I mean that changed with the Internet.
*  Yeah everyone has exact you go to fucking reference Cleveland Ohio you know you go wherever you go there's fucking people that get it they get it.
*  Do you remember when Bill Hicks used to just look at the audience and go moo.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh yeah.
*  A lot of people still haven't caught up to Bill.
*  Oh he was great.
*  I mean his he's called his flying saucer tour because he would only go to places where flying saucers would land.
*  Weird little out of the way spot.
*  What's that record called rant and C minor or something.
*  It's something minor.
*  It's a day minor.
*  I don't remember.
*  I don't know what key it said but that.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean well I still put that on and it's just fantastic.
*  Believably changed comedy changed comedy made people want to become profound.
*  It was a change comedy from just a bunch of stuff to laugh at to stuff that made you think about it after you're done laughing.
*  I think George Carlin had that as well.
*  Sure.
*  Yeah for sure in a different way.
*  But you know Hicks is more psychedelic inspired and it was just more esoteric.
*  Yeah.
*  Like thing in him that for lack of another description I think that gave him that kind of.
*  Yeah.
*  It's the right.
*  It's the right way to describe it I think.
*  I had a chance to see him live a bunch of times.
*  Luckily.
*  Like in a way he understood what you know what a great underground band means to someone.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And what it meant to him.
*  Yeah.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah.
*  It was he was an artist who was an artist that was also a comedian.
*  You know he wasn't trying to conform to like whatever the stereotypical this is the guy that's going to get a sitcom act is going to create.
*  Yeah.
*  But there's not a lot of those.
*  Is it worth is the sitcom worth it.
*  That doesn't exist anymore.
*  No but I mean for those comics that like took that route.
*  You know what it was the golden carrot.
*  It was the thing that they held over all of our heads is that if you develop an act that could be converted into a sitcom all of a sudden you're Tim Allen and you have 50 million dollars in the bank or you're Jerry Seinfeld or you're Brett Butler or you're Roseanne Barr.
*  There was like a few of those people.
*  Yeah.
*  And there's a bunch of people that had managed some more obscure shows that people forgot about but they made a lot of money as well.
*  And it was this thing that if you could get on a sitcom and then all of a sudden you're the king of queens.
*  You know like my friend Kevin James that was his thing.
*  Right. Right. And that's how he got through it.
*  And it's that that was the magic portal the magic portal to wealth.
*  And it's it also fucked up a lot of people's acts because there was a lot of really funny comics.
*  After that now you're kind of stuck.
*  Censored.
*  Yeah.
*  And now the things that you want to say you can't say.
*  They self censored.
*  This is the saddest thing.
*  I think there's some of the great comics of like the 90s that are ruined because they self censored now because they sort of develop this act for television.
*  And then once we're on television they got all that TV money they wanted to keep it coming in.
*  So they never really branched out into more offensive subject matter or you know just just more provocative more provocative.
*  You know what I mean.
*  You know what I mean.
*  And you feel right.
*  Everyone else will judge what that is.
*  Yeah.
*  But it's just the problem is you're never going to make everybody happy.
*  And now way more people have an opinion they can express like because of social media like everyone can express their opinion.
*  It's not as simple as you're you hope to get the favor of a reviewer like someone who's cool really likes bands comes to see oh Bob's here this guy's fucking cool.
*  He's going to review our show.
*  And you like you kind of trusted Bob.
*  Bob was a good guy.
*  He really loved music.
*  Wasn't trying to tear things down.
*  Those guys don't exist anymore.
*  Yeah.
*  You know now now what everyone's trying to do is get people on social media to like them and or not be mad at them.
*  So when they put out a special you see not be mad at them.
*  You see which is the role the artist sometimes is to make your audience mad at you to challenge them.
*  Yes.
*  I mean not you know what I mean.
*  I mean in a way like God how many things in life like that I didn't like at a time that I finally found my way through later and like oh of course thank you.
*  You know what I mean.
*  Like you of course that's the natural of course progression.
*  It's the natural way.
*  And by the way not everything is supposed to be like you were saying.
*  And I guess that's where we are with this social media.
*  Nothing can have that sort of mystique around it anymore.
*  Because it's it's it's it's forcing too much out of someone you're expecting too much from someone to either follow you and or understand get it or acceptance.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  Well it's just a foolish pursuit.
*  The pursuit of other people who you don't even know their their love and attention and you'll morph and change and adapt whatever you're trying to produce in order to gain their favor.
*  That's a fucking folly.
*  That's such a foolish way of interacting with human beings and whatever you create is not completely false.
*  Right.
*  And you can see where you know personally I think you're starting to see culturally where that hollowness and that falseness isn't helping.
*  Oh it's definitely not helping.
*  It's it's a it's pushing us over the edge.
*  Yeah it's not good.
*  You need experiences from people where when they resonate these when they put out these works whether it's a book or music or anything.
*  This thing represents their soul and their perspective and their actual.
*  This is a thing they've created not a thing they're doing so they hope you like it not a thing they're doing so they hope you don't get mad not a thing they're doing with you highlight social issues.
*  Vote for me.
*  A virtuous person.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  It's it's not.
*  Can you say that the virtuous part of it that that's funny too because you know especially like you know the lobby your place is full of pictures of famous people who have been arrested.
*  Yeah all my mug shots.
*  And it's like I mean in a way in a counterculture way whether it's a poet a musician a jazz musician anyone you know Robert Mitchum what you know what you know Robert Mitchum is cooler than Kurt Douglas because he got busted for smoking pot.
*  OK so Robert Mitchum is cooler than you Kurt Douglas.
*  But the outsider in culture you know I mean the loser and the outsider or other themes that we do not celebrate as much and I'm not talking about some fabricated pop star who pouts and is like look how dark I am.
*  Right.
*  I mean that's not that's not what I'm talking about.
*  No.
*  I mean they're always there again showbiz and corporate things you know can manipulate these kind of archetypes.
*  Yes.
*  And put them in the genre specific things that they want because they know.
*  Yeah.
*  That's that's not that's that's I'm formulating a rebel is so gross.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh my god.
*  A formulated rebel a disingenuous formulated rebel.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean you see them.
*  But I think they sort of make you really appreciate people that are true artists or the people that are just it really is just their expression what they're trying to create.
*  They hope people enjoy you know there's.
*  I mean it's funny because that's you know more than ever not just for the fact that I really went had to go through certain things to come full circle with my career and my brother and what the black crows mean in my life a lot of things you know.
*  A lot of it starting with with my wife Camille and stuff.
*  But one of the things that that that keeps me excited and one of the main things that I love is I know that we're and call us old fashioned or call us naive or any anything you want.
*  It doesn't matter.
*  But that we were talking about that stupid flame idea this purity but I know when we go out on tour and we write songs make records play concerts it's something that is raw still in there we're not in our monitors we don't there's no computer on our stage.
*  You know I mean we don't you see these fucking bands cancel a show because their laptop didn't work I'm like well bar your mom's.
*  Cancel shows because their laptop.
*  Happens all the time is fucking hilarious and like there's bands are up there not even playing and they press a button and they're up you know which is fine whatever you want to do to get over I get it I'm again I was born the same year the Beatles made revolver I get it you know.
*  But think about that in my daughter's lifetime the Beatles will be a fucking hundred years old the record will be a 1964 is a hundred years ago.
*  That's crazy.
*  You know what I mean.
*  So crazy to think about it that way.
*  Like when I was a kid it was just a decade or two ago.
*  Well in the same decade between the Beatles if that hundred years was the end of the Civil War and the Beatles.
*  It's weird it's weird thing to look at time that way but.
*  It really puts into perspective because we look at everything through this lens of a finite lifespan of 100 years if you're lucky you know we look at everything like this is this is like a long time but it's not a long time.
*  No.
*  I did used to do this joke about that the Constitution like the American America was founded in 1776.
*  I go people have to be 100 that's three people ago.
*  Yeah.
*  Three people ago they started this like it's nothing.
*  It's so new.
*  Everything's so new.
*  Civilization itself.
*  Oh my God it's so ancient.
*  Is it really.
*  It's not.
*  I mean you're talking about the three thousand years.
*  Yeah.
*  In the big scope of things.
*  Not that much time.
*  And they.
*  And I think historically and because of science and things.
*  You know it's like that idea of well this was the Bronze Age.
*  It started on Thursday and then it went.
*  But then they find a corpse in the ice in the Italian Alps and the guy has a bronze sword and he's two thousand years before they thought they're like fuck I got to read.
*  Yeah.
*  I got a problem with that with archaeology.
*  I got to get my abacus out and do the math.
*  Yeah they're very reluctant to change the dates of things they've been publishing about forever.
*  But there's some things that they find every now and then that force them like there's a place called Gobekli Tepe in Turkey that's 11000 years old and they found it in the 90s.
*  I believe it was a sheep herder found this like piece of stone in the ground he kicked at it moved it around and realized it was an edge to it and then they excavated it and it's just an enormous temple structure and to this day I've only excavated like five percent of it.
*  There's a lot of controversy behind it because people are like why aren't they continuing to excavate like what are they doing.
*  Well now in archaeology they they can do almost just as much with sonic.
*  They can plan out what's going on and not disrupt.
*  Well that's how they know there's many many of these structures around that same area.
*  You know we did the last thing you're eleven thousand years old.
*  The last show of our tour we were in Marita Spain playing in a Greek I mean in a Roman theater that they had only done the excavations in the 50s because I guess it is a very old place.
*  Because I guess at a certain point they just filled there's an amphitheater next to it where they would have gladiatorial games and things and then the theater for theatrical and religious purposes.
*  But you're sitting you know Pink Floyd gets Pompeii we get Merida.
*  It's still cool you know.
*  Yeah.
*  But you're playing in this place was built during the reign of Augustus.
*  And and then the guy goes yeah well you know it was just filled with trash.
*  There is.
*  Wow.
*  That's just filled with trash and then finally they dug it all out of there you know and so then this was down there.
*  This is wow.
*  That was all covered.
*  Yeah.
*  That's nuts.
*  That is so nuts.
*  It was fantastic beautiful place.
*  We went to Greece last year.
*  I got to see the Delphi.
*  Delphi.
*  Well we went to Ulysses or no what how do you say it?
*  Illusian.
*  Well the Illusian mysteries right.
*  Illusinian mysteries.
*  Where you descend into the cave I think.
*  At one point it was a parking lot from what I've read because I'm really.
*  You mean now?
*  Have they yeah yeah like where the original mysteries took place.
*  No no you can still go there.
*  Oh really?
*  Yeah it's all cartoned off.
*  It's all it's protected.
*  You know you have to go through a gate to get in.
*  His guards there and stuff.
*  But we went to there which is where the Illusinian mysteries were and I got really lucky to go
*  with my friend Brian Murorescu.
*  I was there with my family and Brian was there at the same time and Brian Murorescu was a
*  scholar who wrote this incredible book about the use of psychedelics in ancient Greece
*  that's now been confirmed through they take these old pieces of pottery and they found
*  ergot in the pottery.
*  Yeah of course.
*  They think all their wine was laced with psychedelics and these people were and they invented democracy.
*  I mean they were tripping balls and trying to give everybody an equal participation in
*  society and figuring things out but you're around these structures and these are fucking
*  thousands of years old.
*  What is it the what was it the what was my mind?
*  The koukion.
*  The drink.
*  Yeah the koukion.
*  Yeah.
*  You know and they find this almost exact same structure in Peru as well.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  And down in the thing psychedelics mirrors in the corner where they could build fires
*  and like send lights around and stuff.
*  Yeah.
*  That's awesome.
*  Yeah.
*  And then but what happens to in Greece is they it's the what is the law.
*  It's a once in a lifetime experience but then the rich people get their hands on it and
*  they start having their ceremonies private ceremonies more exclusive or elitist and that's
*  kind of the fall of that.
*  Well the Romans put a stop to it.
*  No they didn't.
*  People no they did these people are like rethinking society the same way they put a stop to it
*  in the 1960s when the government made all psychedelic drugs schedule one when they were
*  doing that so they can go after the anti-war protesters and the Black Panthers and they
*  changed the counterculture moving.
*  Cannabis is close to the same thing.
*  I mean you know when I first made the decision to be a daily cannabis user I was an outlaw
*  now I'm a patient.
*  Yeah.
*  Is that interesting?
*  You're like we used to be like you know they are people think they killed Bob Marley because
*  of shit like that but now it's just like it's my medicine.
*  Yeah.
*  Well you know it's now and how many states Jamie legal and how many did we say it was
*  like legal in 19 and I think it's half the way.
*  I think it's half the country has legal marijuana half the country and the other half the country
*  wants it.
*  What are we doing?
*  Like how the fuck is it 2024 with all that we know about all the drugs and that this
*  one 24 states three territories in Washington D.C. have legalized recreational cannabis use
*  seven states have decriminalized its use commercial distribution is legal in all jurisdictions
*  where possession is legal except for Virginia and Washington D.C. personal cultivation for
*  recreational use is allowed in all jurisdictions except for Delaware.
*  Delaware Illinois New Jersey that's surprising and Washington state that's even more so.
*  First off let's just be honest no one's ever ever had fun in Delaware.
*  I'm just kidding.
*  And there were Bidens from I think it's just a dumb thing for us to be hanging on to the
*  fact that they're still allowing grown adults to tell other grown adults what they can do
*  with their consciousness with all the data that we know about things that are very hard
*  that are very harmful that are not just legal but prescribed by doctors.
*  How about just everything is harmful that they allow in the world.
*  You know they don't give a fuck about the sea being a plastic desert but don't smoke
*  pot or I mean I find that's always been the case with authority isn't it.
*  You know what I mean.
*  Like language you know what language you're you know what I mean.
*  What language can you use and how you use it.
*  Sex and violence you know the talk about Rome.
*  Rome and now we're going back to Rome and one of the reason Rome was so successful is
*  because they placated and we talk about Rome we're not talking about Italy we're talking
*  about the city state of Rome.
*  That is the thing that conquered the room the city state and the surrounding areas where
*  other things but they keep the masses happy with violence and bread.
*  Yeah.
*  And you know in the same way that you keep people you control people by fear and ignorance
*  keep them yes you know what I mean and it's exactly.
*  And tick tock.
*  Just keep them mildly entertained all day long.
*  I find that I find the idea of tick tock about as interesting as the game tick tock.
*  Tick tock tock.
*  Yeah I'm not doing that either.
*  No I'm not doing that either.
*  It is crazy when you go to the Coliseum and you realize the extent of the construction
*  of it and how elaborate it was and how many different things they had going on where they
*  would turn it into like they have both naval battles filled up with water and wild wild
*  shit that animals and cages they could race the floor.
*  It's unimaginable.
*  And now you know the thing about going there too is you go I wonder if they ever thought
*  this is going to end.
*  Did they ever imagine.
*  Of course not.
*  No they certainly never imagined some idiot comedian and his family from California at
*  the time were going to go visit and go whoa cool this is where they had sword fights.
*  I mean I I imagine yeah it's I think some of the emperors probably in an egocentric
*  way felt and it's true.
*  Everyone knows you know a lot you know there might be some kid who never heard of Bird's
*  record but he might know who Nero was or Caligula or something or like the most dramatic sort
*  of deranged parts of like where the where that period of Rome of the dictator starts
*  to become.
*  It's just always shocking when you go to a place that was in complete control of like
*  most of the world and then now it's nothing.
*  Now it's gone.
*  Now it's just ruins that people visit and it's just a city.
*  Yeah.
*  What if Bill Gates had been like you know Guido whatever it would be a different thing.
*  What if the whole Internet came from Italy not America.
*  You know what I mean.
*  Right.
*  It's just always weird to go to a place too when you're from America.
*  Claudio Gatzo whatever like he came up with this.
*  You know what I mean.
*  But they had a pretty good run in the Renaissance.
*  Oh well they've had amazing runs artistically.
*  I mean that's also something I think about when I go to Italy.
*  Like there is something about their life and their lifestyle that contributes to this incredible
*  body of work when it comes to art when it comes to music when it comes to sculptures
*  and paintings.
*  Like there's so many great artists in that part of the world.
*  Have you ever seen a book called Naples 44.
*  No.
*  You know this book.
*  It's one.
*  It's a friend of mine gave it to me a couple of years ago.
*  It's a British Secret Service officer comes to Naples in 1944 directly in the push of
*  the allies pushing the Germans and then fascist up the peninsula from Sicily and then landing
*  in Italy.
*  And it's an unbelievable book that this guy writes.
*  And it's the sadness and the like tragedy of it as you and like anything else war is
*  dramatic war is pain and violent.
*  The aftermath of war is something that people rarely can wrap their heads around or interested
*  in maybe because it's even you know you take away the drama of the battle and stuff it's
*  bleak but there's something about this guy.
*  Not Italian English guy.
*  But he captures the spirit of the humanity within like this transitional period in Naples
*  but unimaginable stories to pravity but also great exalted human things as well.
*  And then just some things that are incredible like you know Italians in their clothes and
*  even the rich aristocratic class in Naples to the person that could when they didn't
*  have any fabric around this time after that they're they're walking around Naples in
*  beautifully tailored suits made of old army blankets that they would use black paint on
*  to make them look chic.
*  And yeah and I was like wow I would love to see that garment in a museum.
*  But just all manner of things.
*  And there's a there's another American guy was there at the same time and wrote another
*  book about it which is also very interesting because this guy was one of the only books
*  of that time.
*  I have it in my phone I could tell you but that talks about like the gay scene with the
*  soldiers in Naples and stuff too like during this thing like just my just you know what
*  I mean incredible stories incredible survival and heroics and art and culture that still
*  survive and you know during the darkest time.
*  It's a great great book and unbelievable unforgettable.
*  What's always interesting too when you're thinking about things thriving and existing
*  against resistance you know in a dark time or a different time a time of much more difficulty
*  you know and you get a chance to sort of feel what they felt when they were doing what they
*  were doing.
*  I think culturally historically I mean I think one of the great reasons Europeans have a
*  much different attitude you're talking about you know Sicilians Italians but everyone French
*  Spanish Spanish people know how to have a good time.
*  Oh yeah sure.
*  To have two events like the World War One and World War Two.
*  Yeah we have very little.
*  It's hard for us to understand what those two events must have felt like through communities
*  cities families.
*  I just read another amazing book called Wine and War and it's a history of like the wine
*  business during the Nazi occupation during World War Two.
*  Unimaginable wild shit going on and but the French people you know because the Germans
*  they knew as well like you know what's what's the blood of France is the wine.
*  What is the thing that holds it together in all these things.
*  But it's also a great commodity and also something of great elevated status you know all this
*  stuff with the way they dealt with the Vichy.
*  I just you know I'm like wow man these guys had a lot on their plate for five years and
*  leading up to the you know inevitable Nazi occupation.
*  Even in World War One I mean in World War One France lost 25 percent of its men and
*  then in World War Two they lost another 25 percent.
*  And I in the book I mean and also just history I think that's one of the people you know
*  one of the reasons I think Germany I mean a lot of French people just didn't want to
*  do it again.
*  You know what I mean.
*  Right right right.
*  And that and I think you know and you know it's funny too like history repeats itself
*  all the time.
*  We know this you know and there was a lot of in fighting and political things within
*  the French government at that time whether that's you know through the military or whatever
*  that made them really a soft spot.
*  You know they had no no one was there was no cohesiveness that the way they would think
*  about fighting or defending or whatever.
*  But they went out in the end.
*  You know what I mean.
*  But this book about just how that affects all the different wine regions and the characters
*  and stuff.
*  That has to be insane.
*  It's a great great book.
*  Because it's so important over there.
*  Wine is everything to them.
*  It's so important.
*  And you know it's funny one of the things in the book you're like OK so they're obviously
*  you know confiscating everything for the Wehrmacht and doing all this stuff.
*  But they take this I might be wrong but I think it's the Poulet-Fusse.
*  They take this this guy has like you know however many casks or whatever.
*  And they just take everything and then the guy's upset.
*  He's been in his family for 400 years or whatever.
*  And he's sitting there with his head in his hands and they're like it's just wine.
*  He goes I know it's just wine but they destroyed 300 year old casks the oak barrels.
*  That's the secret to the R wine.
*  And they chopped them up and threw them on a fire or whatever.
*  You know what I mean.
*  And he was more upset about that than the wine itself at that time.
*  And he was like they're irreplaceable.
*  Could never ever have that again.
*  It's been in my family for you know stuff like that really gets my head spinning of
*  oh yeah forget it's not just the grape and the person that makes the wine.
*  You know what I mean.
*  It's every every detail every aspect.
*  Well they can also destroy the history of how it was made.
*  Like people won't know how to do it correctly.
*  I mean that's the one of the darker aspects of occupation is when they destroy ancient
*  stuff like the burning of the Library of Alexandria.
*  I mean could you imagine what that I mean we have no I mean unimaginably.
*  And by the way who burned it down.
*  Christians did they.
*  Yeah it was Christian people who ran amok because of something that had happened.
*  Some sort of crime that was committed or something.
*  And they it was the early Christians who burned that down.
*  Those motherfuckers.
*  You imagine if that had some sort of an explanation as to how they built the pyramids.
*  And it's lost forever.
*  I mean it could be anything.
*  Anything.
*  I mean millions and millions of.
*  But that was the most sophisticated society that has even today ever existed.
*  If you look at ancient Egypt in terms of their ability to construct things that
*  baffle us to this day.
*  The Great Pyramid baffles people to this day.
*  There's hundreds of thousands of people debating how and why and what they were for
*  and what they did and we really don't know.
*  I'm also interested in any thing where before science becomes one thing and like the
*  occult is another thing.
*  And I know there's a certain time and I'm really interested in John Dee the great occultist
*  scientist English around the Elizabeth the first rain alchemist.
*  But that his scientific ideas were equally they possess the same gravity as his occult
*  ideas and those things were in the same world.
*  They weren't removed from each other.
*  It wasn't like one was silly and one was serious.
*  They were both taken with the same level of sobriety or whatever.
*  You know.
*  And and that's what we were talking before.
*  I think there's a to be to remove the mystic from everything or not to be able to at least
*  have a nod to it or understand.
*  I mean what is ancient Egypt.
*  You know what I mean.
*  But yes they're a great civilization that could organize you know organize but at its
*  base and what's holding it together is this mystical like weird thing.
*  You know like very much to remove that completely.
*  I think is it's it's it's I don't know.
*  It seems so rigid.
*  It's a foolish rational.
*  There has to be a case.
*  Yes of different things because you feel people's need for that to integrate those things.
*  Well there has been in all great cultures right.
*  I mean in Chichen Itza have you ever been to the ancient mine structures.
*  I've been to some but I didn't go to that one.
*  They all want to do other ones and they're in places of worship and they all they all
*  involve rituals.
*  There was a lot going and what they did was incredible and psychedelics and psychedelics.
*  Yeah I mean as well I went to Chichen Itza we got lucky there was a really good professor
*  that was kind of explaining things to us and he was talking about the different psychedelics
*  that they believe that they would use and the way they had structured their all their
*  buildings to align with constellations and the way they had sort of worshiped this whole
*  integration of the sky into all of their architecture.
*  I mean it's an integration into universal consciousness.
*  I mean that's really what it is and it's funny because you think well you're poisoning the
*  water.
*  Well you're poisoning.
*  We're all.
*  It's all one living organism and the universe is one living organism.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  I mean I don't want to get too far out man you know but of course what it's all just like
*  the ecosystem or whatever like the frog eats the tadpole and then the bird eats the frog.
*  You know what I mean.
*  But it's just because you can't see it doesn't mean that it's not.
*  It scales up.
*  Yeah.
*  And out and within.
*  In.
*  Yeah.
*  Forever.
*  Yeah.
*  That's the reality of it.
*  So it's not just we're poisoning the water we're poisoning ourselves.
*  Yeah.
*  And of course you know again I I would like to think the earth is is a strong thing but
*  and I don't get wrapped up in it but it's like I mean if you shouldn't if you live in
*  your own shit you get sores you know.
*  Yeah.
*  You know what I mean.
*  Right.
*  Hence the plague.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah there's a.
*  This is just when you think about the universe as a whole it's just too big for our
*  brains and we don't think we just think about our neighborhood or our lives or our
*  personal problems or our bills or our tick tock.
*  Yeah.
*  Nonsense.
*  And it's just thinking about nonsense.
*  You know what people think about that they can buy shoes that they don't have to
*  touch to put their feet in.
*  I see this disorder.
*  We see a commercial and the guy walks over there like never touch your shoes again.
*  I'm like wow you know I mean like finally.
*  I'll slot the shoes you get sliding.
*  And I'm like amazing that everything is everyone relax.
*  You know you never have to touch your shoe.
*  What if I want to touch my shoes.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Well some people don't understand they want comfort you know and some people
*  especially if you're doing something you don't enjoy you you think of struggle as
*  like your job or work and then once you're not doing that you don't want any struggle.
*  You just want relaxation.
*  But isn't it funny also that our culture is dictating a certain health thing.
*  Take the sober challenge.
*  Go to the gym buy these gym clothes and walk around in them do all this but we're
*  not going to take care of anything else.
*  You know what I mean.
*  Like you don't care about our mental health.
*  You don't really care about our health.
*  You know what I mean.
*  You don't do anything but it's like but culturally let's start putting this out
*  there.
*  You know what I mean.
*  Like why.
*  You know there's when I first went to New York City there were bars and bookstores
*  and weird junk stores and all sorts of things that weren't corporate.
*  And now it's just gyms and banks.
*  And I think I don't really go to the gym but I imagine you could get an ATM in the
*  gym next door to the bank with the ATM.
*  I'm sure you could.
*  A lot of gyms I'm sure have ATMs.
*  I'm just saying you know like be healthy be you know what I mean.
*  But I'm like it is funny.
*  Like there's nothing that's saying to you be cerebral.
*  You know what I mean.
*  There's not a lot out there.
*  You know you watch old Dick Cavett shows.
*  They're smart people.
*  Then they're not promoting a movie or a fucking book or what they're just talking
*  about ideas and philosophy and art and their culture and the society.
*  Even what was his name.
*  Mike Douglas show.
*  Yeah.
*  Muhammad Ali.
*  Yeah.
*  And John Lennon and then some senator from Oklahoma or whatever.
*  You know they're just talking.
*  You could do that back then.
*  Now it's got to be you know the interview is pre done.
*  It's about the mood.
*  They show the clip.
*  That's only on television but that's also why podcasts are so popular.
*  True.
*  You can just kind of talk about anything.
*  You have a new place that's also not under the scrutiny of having to play
*  commercials every five seconds.
*  It's also.
*  That's a big factor but it's also not under anybody else's direction or advice.
*  Yeah.
*  What's really important.
*  Yeah.
*  How can you know.
*  No I know.
*  I'm just I'm not doing it.
*  It's not going to happen cynical.
*  I'm just saying.
*  But I mean if I'm not doing it at my level of the game if I'm not doing it like you
*  don't have to do it you don't have to.
*  All you have to do is make something that resonates with people and avoid anybody
*  else's input.
*  I've had a lot of bad input come my way that I've ignored you know especially in
*  the early days and things started to kind of take off.
*  Everybody has an opinion about how you can grow this thing to the next level which
*  is those they want to talk about.
*  You know how to take the show to the next level.
*  Thought about having more celebrity and more of this and that.
*  Everyone has advice and maybe just avoid these kind of topics or maybe this and
*  that.
*  As long as you don't have any input from other people then whether people like it
*  or don't like it it at least it's you.
*  It's you and the people you're talking to and it's a real thing.
*  It's not a it's not a promotional right.
*  It's not a buy this.
*  Yeah yeah exactly.
*  It just exists as which is just one dimension of things.
*  Yeah.
*  And you know it's nice to be clean cut and your teeth are wide and you're smiling
*  and you're selling shit.
*  You know.
*  By the way I got a pair of shoes you don't even have to touch them.
*  What size are you.
*  I don't even understand that.
*  But it's just if I could walk around like an 18th century French Duke I would.
*  That jacket that is a rock and roll fucking jacket.
*  I've been looking at that thinking the moment I saw you.
*  Can I wear that.
*  I don't know if I can pull that off.
*  Your muscles are too big to get it.
*  Well I mean I could get one tailored.
*  But I'm just thinking I don't know if I could pull that off out in public.
*  People like what are you doing dude.
*  As a comedian like you can't be too cool unless you're Cat Williams.
*  I knew you were going to say Cat Williams.
*  I'll tell you why Cat Williams is cool because he's still out there talking shit
*  and an eight year old beat him up that time.
*  Remember that shit.
*  Eleven year old kid in the hood grabbed that motherfucker in the headlock.
*  He's like let go of me.
*  And he's like laying on the ground.
*  I was like man you got to have some.
*  You got to be cool to come back from that.
*  Well he's just real.
*  You know he is who he is and everybody loves him.
*  That guy can wear anything.
*  But I can't.
*  I can't wear sparkly shoes.
*  Look at him.
*  That's amazing.
*  Look at him in his fur coat.
*  His fucking giant rings.
*  He's he's an awesome dude too.
*  Fun guy.
*  Yeah.
*  I only got to meet him the one time I did a podcast with him.
*  And you know and it was because he did another podcast and he said Joe Rogan will never have me on his podcast.
*  And I'm like I'll have you on any time you want.
*  Like we just never talk.
*  I never met him before.
*  Oh really.
*  No.
*  And then finally I'm not comedians are like drummers.
*  They all know each other.
*  You know every drummer knows every drummer in every band.
*  I know everybody else.
*  I just never met him.
*  That's funny.
*  He was already so huge that when he would stop by in comedy clubs this is like after the pimp chronicles.
*  He would only like go by a kid you know would go to a bunch of different clubs.
*  And if you weren't there when cat was there you missed him.
*  So he only came to the comic store like a handful of times and the comic store was that was my haunt.
*  And that's where I went with all my friends and all the you know the best comics in L.A.
*  and you know all collaborated at the comedy store.
*  And I never got to see him there.
*  I mean I'd heard he was the smack somebody once like somebody in the front porch one night.
*  I missed it.
*  You know but I just I'd always admired him.
*  I thought and I always talked nice about him.
*  I didn't understand why he thought I wouldn't have him on the podcast.
*  But once I met him he's a joy.
*  He's a he's a funny smart dude who's a lot of what he's saying.
*  He knows the fuck he's doing.
*  He's like very tongue in cheek and very just having a good time with it.
*  But he's a genuine character like a genuine unique character.
*  I would love to meet him.
*  Oh he's great.
*  You love him.
*  Very smart dude too.
*  Very I see him at the airport.
*  I'll say you know man you like this jacket.
*  He might be able to fit in that.
*  It'll be a little long.
*  Get the sleeves taken in.
*  Where the fuck do you get that jacket.
*  You know I.
*  My wife got me this jacket.
*  Pretty dope.
*  She's got good taste.
*  Yeah she truly does.
*  Yeah and then you're wearing about 10 pounds of silver.
*  Yeah.
*  It's true.
*  They call me the silver stacker.
*  I don't know if you've done that.
*  That's what the kids call it.
*  My daughter calls it that which wears but it's my stack.
*  Stacks.
*  They have stacks.
*  I'm just learning about these things.
*  I just got to be careful not to fall in the pool.
*  Yeah.
*  But I just love when rock stars stay rock stars.
*  Nothing bums me out more than seeing an old rock star in a
*  golf shirt.
*  Like dude.
*  Yeah.
*  You got to hang in there.
*  I know you're 60.
*  Fucking 60.
*  I just saw the stones.
*  They're 80.
*  They look.
*  They're amazing.
*  I mean we're amazing.
*  I love.
*  I mean I'm wearing.
*  I have stones.
*  I mean the stones are everything.
*  I love the Rolling Stones.
*  I always have.
*  And I've.
*  The Black Crows toured with them in 1995.
*  We did all of Europe with them.
*  We did Wembley Stadium with them.
*  I've you know.
*  I've got you know I've got to hang with Keith and Ron.
*  I've you know that's hung with Mick a little bit.
*  They're the fucking Rolling Stones you know.
*  And so my wife and I and my 14 year old daughter who lives on
*  the East Coast.
*  She was with us for the few weeks this summer.
*  I'm like let's go.
*  You know what I mean.
*  I haven't seen them in a while and we went and.
*  I went without any.
*  I don't you know what I mean.
*  I went with nothing.
*  I wasn't going in with any expectation except to pay my
*  be there with everyone and see the Rolling Stones.
*  Right.
*  And.
*  Be there.
*  And they were great.
*  Mick Jagger's voice was.
*  Incredible incredible.
*  I mean his energy and stuff's incredible but his singing.
*  I mean they did wild horses at night and I looked over and my
*  14 year old was like crying and I was like wow.
*  She's feeling it so deep.
*  Yeah.
*  Great midnight rambler.
*  The this.
*  They're in a stadium with just like eight Ronnie and Keith just
*  had like two speakers on stage and still playing.
*  A lot of bands don't play live anymore.
*  They have their digital shit through the P.A.
*  There's not even any sound on stage.
*  Wow.
*  It's all through their in-ears.
*  And to me that's really weird.
*  Whatever it takes for you to get the gig I'm hip to people do
*  what I've seen cool shows like that.
*  But personally I like a lot of sonic chaos.
*  You want it real.
*  Yeah.
*  I want to feel it.
*  I saw them at CODA the Circuit of the Americas a couple of years
*  ago.
*  And you know it's just when you watch Mick Jagger walk out of
*  the stage you almost can't believe he's really there.
*  Like how is that really him.
*  I told my wife he's like a Sasquatch but everyone's seen
*  him.
*  Right.
*  It's like he and he's still out there.
*  I remember Bill Hicks had a bit in 1988 about the Stones still
*  doing it.
*  Yeah.
*  In 1988.
*  But this is this crazy thing.
*  Oh my God.
*  The Stones have a new album like what.
*  This is 88.
*  Yeah.
*  And here we are in 2024 and they're still out there killing
*  it.
*  And this show was amazing.
*  It was amazing.
*  Amazing.
*  It's so good.
*  The best I mean the best I consider myself a midnight
*  rambler a fishing auto.
*  One of the best midnight ramblers I've ever heard.
*  Oh they were so good.
*  So good.
*  And people were you know what I mean.
*  Just it was it was really I'm so happy.
*  That we went to SoFi Stadium.
*  Yeah.
*  I was just I was great.
*  You know because I will admit sometimes and OK let's be
*  honest I get access to backstay.
*  You know we have it's cool but sometimes in big places like
*  that something I get a little bit like not because of that
*  people would know you were I just get weird around giant
*  crowds.
*  Right.
*  I did when I was little I didn't like theme parks you know
*  all sorts of weird stuff.
*  Yeah.
*  But it was so cool.
*  I was so inspired.
*  You know I mean I like floated out of there so happy.
*  That guy has two trailers that he takes with him everywhere
*  that are just a gym two huge trailers that are just like
*  Mick Jagger works out every day.
*  And when he gets out on that stage and like he's fucking 80
*  he might be 81.
*  If I live to be 80 you could come find me.
*  I'm going to be 300 pounds living in Sicily and they're
*  going to you know those beautiful painted wagons they'll
*  drag me around in it.
*  But you won't even get to 300 pounds eating their food.
*  No you don't.
*  That's what's crazy.
*  That's when you realize we're being poisoned.
*  Yeah.
*  You eat in Europe for a week and you don't gain any weight.
*  Like this is not I had pizza I had pasta I didn't feel bad.
*  You come over here you feel you get hit with a tranquilizer
*  dart.
*  Yeah.
*  Like we're fucking poisoning ourselves.
*  You won't get to 300 pounds if you live in Sicily.
*  No unless you drink a lot of fucking wine.
*  Yeah.
*  Even the wine is like it's better.
*  Well it's just there's something about like just the air there
*  just something about the atmosphere.
*  I'm not a you know I'm not I have no I'm English where we are
*  pretty much in our DNA English and then like a big scoop of
*  Polish Jew on top.
*  You know not even a big scoop at this point.
*  Both my grandfather and my dad were six 11 Jewish men who
*  whittled me and my brother down to about 20 percent.
*  And but when I'm I don't know there's there's something about
*  there that is so just I don't know.
*  I I I love to go to Paris but Paris isn't relaxing.
*  You know I'm out all we're doing stuff.
*  I love London.
*  I love Madrid.
*  I love lots of places.
*  I love Rome.
*  I love lots of places in the world.
*  Something about Sicily man.
*  I'm like just I'm I'm in what you know I mean like this is
*  like you said it's about the lifestyle just so laid back and
*  it's maybe I like it because it's a bit of anachronism.
*  I think you know what I mean like you're going you feel like
*  you've stepped out of the same pace and or rhythm of the
*  modern future world that we see every day.
*  Yes it's a different vibration it's different.
*  I mean and then everybody's doing it that way too.
*  So you sort of settle into their way of life.
*  You sort of settle into their pace of things and then if you
*  need a shot of adrenaline just hit Palermo because that place
*  is wild.
*  Oh I'm sure it was so good.
*  Is it still run by the mob.
*  They say no.
*  Oh then yes.
*  They say that it doesn't exist anymore but but if I remember
*  there was a big scandal during lockdown in some small town in
*  Sicily or maybe it was Palermo.
*  I don't know I'd have to research it today.
*  The police were upset because some old mob guy had died and
*  they had a giant parade.
*  No one like was in the area.
*  Yeah everyone was just out there old people you know everyone
*  was out there doing their thing for Don whoever it was who is
*  not with us anymore.
*  And I was like OK they didn't want that story.
*  Yeah well those people ran that place for a long time.
*  Now they're an integrated part of their society like the Yakuza
*  is in Japan.
*  Yeah it's just for a very long time for a very long time.
*  You know the way it works.
*  Have you ever seen a funny movie called Johnny Stacchino.
*  No with Roberto Bellini the Italian comedic actor.
*  No it's you would love it.
*  Yeah so fun.
*  It's from the 80s and he Stacchino is a toothpick.
*  Yeah so he's Johnny toothpick and it's that fit.
*  What's the story of it's a famous story.
*  You know he he's a school teacher in Naples or whatever but
*  he looked or in Italy and this girl whose wife or lover
*  whatever some big gangster in Sicily.
*  She see he's trying to he's in hiding because he did like
*  ratted on someone.
*  I don't know something.
*  She sees him and he looks just like him so she brings him to
*  Sicily and he's like walking around you're like you know what
*  are you doing.
*  You know what I mean.
*  So it's that kind of thing but it's unbelievably funny movie.
*  It's insane.
*  Do you remember there was an Italian singer who created a
*  very popular song where it was fake American lyrics.
*  A kind of trying to remember his name but it was a song where
*  he's singing fake words that sound like he's singing like the
*  Rolling Stones or or or you know the Beatles or some way.
*  But he's doing it with fake words.
*  It's like what he thinks American songs sound like but
*  it's gibberish.
*  This is the guy.
*  What is his name.
*  Adriano Selentano.
*  Give me some give me some volume on this.
*  Listen it's really cool.
*  I love you.
*  It's a cool song.
*  This song is very cool.
*  There's a couple of different versions of it.
*  This is like a live performance of it but there's another one
*  that's like a music video of it and it's like really fucking
*  interesting what that guy did.
*  That's cool.
*  That's really good.
*  Yeah.
*  I just made up fake American music.
*  It's fucking great.
*  I'm going to do that next week.
*  Why not.
*  Fuck it.
*  I mean you know that's there's there's a lot of songs that have
*  like words that aren't really words you know they're just
*  kind of like sounds you know.
*  Dan Arbok talks about that from the Black Keys like a lot of
*  times he sings things he's just like making up sounds making up
*  words.
*  Mick Jagger did it.
*  Yeah I'm sure.
*  Yeah.
*  Or he took words and mashed them into something that was more
*  especially live in the 70s.
*  He has a lot of vowels going on and you're like I don't know what
*  he's so good.
*  But man he's not lost any of the energy.
*  If you watch like his old performances and now it's just an
*  older guy doing the same.
*  They.
*  It's also very cool because they play everything in the same key
*  you know you'll find a lot of older and I get it man.
*  This you know singing is singing is a physical thing.
*  I mean what my one thing is kind of like the muse like if I
*  stopped singing I would go away.
*  Mmm.
*  You know I mean if I didn't say you know.
*  If I I'm going to take two years off I would never it would
*  never get back to where where my voice is.
*  Why is that.
*  It's just the nature of the physicality I think you know what
*  I mean especially as it's 35 years 40 years of singing.
*  So it's like you're working muscles in your neck vocal
*  chords are just muscles.
*  Yeah.
*  Wow.
*  And you're working on a regular basis and get out of shape.
*  Yeah.
*  And then and then like that and then it just won't come back or
*  won't come back to where I'd like to like my I really like
*  where my voice is.
*  Yeah.
*  I say we sing the songs in the same keys you know.
*  It was funny we played the forum.
*  We were the first concert in the forum L.A.
*  Forum after covid and it was a bit I had never played there.
*  It was a big night.
*  It was you know friends and family.
*  It was great.
*  But George to call us who's produced our first records first
*  two records and signed the band after the show.
*  He was like if I had known you'd still be singing of 30 whatever
*  years later we would have put the keys back for you.
*  You know that wasn't how it worked back then because you know
*  in rock and roll you get you know you have the verse and then
*  you get to the chorus and you want to get it exciting.
*  Yeah.
*  You want to knock it up a notch you know but we don't change
*  them either.
*  I like that.
*  I mean my voice has changed obviously but but it's still the
*  same key.
*  Do you wonder how long you're going to do it.
*  Do you ever think about stopping.
*  I don't.
*  I do sometimes.
*  I mean.
*  You know the pandemic was funny for me because at first not
*  financial three things or whatever.
*  It was just like you know since I was a teenager pretty much.
*  This is what we do.
*  We tour we do concerts and we make music blah blah blah.
*  And I was like maybe I'm going to go a little kooky not doing
*  it.
*  And then I really I mean I had horrible days like everyone
*  else and you know despair and fear and stuff of the unknown.
*  But a lot of those days like I like I have a lot of interests
*  you know what I mean.
*  I have a lot of others I'd like to write a book I'd maybe like
*  to write more than one book you know find my voice outside of
*  the musician in another artistic way or whatever and just loving
*  my wife and living life.
*  Yeah and you know moving to Sicily.
*  But a lot of those things you you know I'm not ready to do that
*  now but also I look ahead and I'm like to.
*  Do I want to be on stage when I'm 75.
*  Do I want to.
*  There's a difference if I have to.
*  I don't know.
*  I guess I'll call it when I if I'm lucky enough to get to 75.
*  I get through the end of the week.
*  You know what I mean.
*  But I do.
*  I love it.
*  But it's but but for that event gave me the perspective of
*  there's others I don't want to you know I mean I would hate to
*  be.
*  I've always hated the idea that this is all I could do.
*  That might sound weird but no no it's a great because I'm born
*  to do it.
*  I love that kind of scenario like you know like this is my
*  wife's like when I watch you we're friends when I see you in
*  your element this is obviously what you're supposed to do.
*  Yeah.
*  But but I think I have am I don't know if ambition is the
*  right word but I definitely have interest in things that have
*  nothing to do with this.
*  Yeah you know.
*  Well that's part of being a human right.
*  You don't want to be isolated to one specific interest.
*  And I so many fascinating things and the isolation.
*  That's a thing too.
*  And I'm really happy with what what could we have a level of
*  success.
*  It's great or whatever.
*  Yeah maybe I don't know.
*  But the one thing I like about my life is I'm not the kind of
*  I'm not so well known that I still can't do my own grocery
*  shopping.
*  I love to cook.
*  I like to go to the market.
*  I like to pick out my shit.
*  You know or that you can't get you know I mean we have access to
*  the whole world.
*  You know and I don't have to worry about anyone giving a shit.
*  You know what I mean.
*  Yeah.
*  Or the people that do like it they come up to me wherever I am
*  in the world.
*  They're usually real fans.
*  They're not celebrity people.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  So they're like yeah and I saw you at the when you played this
*  song you know and that's the other thing about music.
*  It's like rock music.
*  You know you can be you can do a lot of stuff but you know one
*  thing about the songs we've written and I meet people and
*  people play the songs we've written at weddings and at
*  funerals.
*  You know I mean not just parties and not just things but like
*  you know my brother I wrote you know when we wrote She Talks
*  to Angels I get I am I always have time and I'm always
*  humbled by people's experiences with that song and addiction
*  and things in their lives whether it's them family member
*  that loss or people that have overcome things.
*  You know what I mean.
*  And that we you know just wrote that song one day when we were
*  kids and that means so much to people.
*  When there's a lot of songs like that in our repertoire that
*  people come up to me really funny things sometimes like
*  people will pick some song about that was your wedding song.
*  I was like OK.
*  Jealous or more obscure even really like some weird like
*  this song called nonfiction.
*  Like we walked down the aisle and not I like the nonfiction
*  really.
*  It's kind of a dark song.
*  Well that's it.
*  You're giving out you know with music it's like it's an art
*  form that changes people's feeling.
*  It's when you hear a great song it literally gives you energy
*  completely.
*  It's a drug.
*  It really is.
*  It's like an an audio exactly the same.
*  I mean we I mean it's maddening to be with me because it's this
*  is the only time during this day that I don't have music on.
*  But you know what I mean.
*  But I listen to French music from the 20s and I listen to
*  like Peruvian cumbias from the 70s or avant-garde electronic
*  composers whatever you know or blues and rock and roll and jazz
*  and yeah and R&B and whatever.
*  But a lot.
*  Yeah.
*  Well that means you're doing the right thing right.
*  Like you really love it.
*  I also need it like you just said not only just for energy
*  but like for some soulful connection as well.
*  And you know when especially with you know when I was younger
*  we all suffer from depression and some people have a more
*  acute relationships with that.
*  But you know if there's a certain melancholy that comes
*  over me there's only some artists that can I can sail
*  across that deep water with you know what I mean to kind of
*  assure me that I'm not the only we're not the only ones that
*  feel this way.
*  We're not the only ones that are you know life is life is
*  that is what it is.
*  You know what I mean.
*  Like you're not no matter how rich you are no matter how
*  successful you are no matter who you are you still have to
*  deal with the ups and downs of it.
*  Absolutely.
*  And I think adversity is the thing that really makes us who
*  we are.
*  You know that's one thing is like being a father I'm like I'm
*  not afraid of the adversity my kids face.
*  As a matter of fact that's what I really want to get to is how
*  because what makes us who we are is how we deal with adversity.
*  And if you don't deal with any adversity it's not good.
*  And if you push it under the table or this or that and avoid
*  it.
*  Yeah.
*  Then then where are you.
*  You know I mean where's the.
*  And the great.
*  And it's these things are cliches but the greatest lessons
*  are the hardest ones.
*  You know what I mean.
*  Those are the ones that stick to you the most.
*  Yes.
*  And those are the ones that make you grow.
*  I have a great friend who's in a fantastic band they just open
*  for us.
*  We've been friends that called his name is Jim Jones.
*  His band is called the Jim Jones All Stars.
*  He was in a band called The Hypnotics and and we've known
*  each other for 30 years and he went through really deep
*  heroin addiction in the 90s and.
*  And it's funny to talk to him and I love it.
*  You know he's but he's like yeah man it was something it was a
*  lesson.
*  You know I mean I'm like that's a fucking tough lesson and I'm
*  happy you're still here to talk about it.
*  But I love his attitude.
*  You know I mean I love that spirit in people.
*  You know what I mean.
*  That it didn't you know.
*  I learned from this and I've moved on from this and I don't
*  have any regrets.
*  I don't have any resentment towards this or anger towards
*  about it.
*  And it's no one's doing but my own that responsibility to take
*  responsibility for stuff.
*  You know it's a big and that's that's important.
*  And I think we see a lot of that gone away.
*  You know what I mean with people.
*  And every story is different.
*  You know what I mean.
*  And every not everything is the same and the what is real and
*  what isn't real between there.
*  That's for everyone to figure out for people.
*  Yeah.
*  But but the fact that that can be captioned in a song and like
*  you said sort of carry you through these bad moments we
*  realize like other people are experiencing grief hardship
*  depression darkness terrible thoughts of loss.
*  And that's the reason why those songs are so popular.
*  It's not like people want to suffer like no there's like
*  something that resonating and anger is a part of that too.
*  You know what I mean.
*  Like and it's funny like what's the newer music.
*  I'm like you guys like the world looks pretty shitty.
*  Aren't you guys pissed a little bit or you just like no I'm just
*  going to get some likes and my pants fit right and my hair is
*  good.
*  I'm like OK I get pop music is light sometimes but I would like
*  for the young people to you know I'd like to see in the art a
*  little more.
*  Anger or I'd like to see more rock.
*  You know it's like when I'm looking at music coming up today
*  there's a great absence of strong new rock bands that that seem
*  like rock bands from the past.
*  Guitar bass.
*  Yeah yes yes I mean God damn it people still love that music.
*  What the fuck is going on.
*  Yeah you go see AC DC there in a fucking stadium.
*  Yeah you go see Metallica there in a stadium.
*  Yes.
*  So people are going.
*  So what the fuck happened.
*  I mean where is everybody.
*  I mean I think it's definitely there it's just it's it's again
*  I think people for some reason think the music business is
*  supposed to be the gauge or that they're just like any other
*  fucking salesman.
*  They always have been just because one salesman had a cool
*  taste and one didn't don't kid yourself right.
*  They're not artists they're salesmen and there's cool
*  people and not cool people but they're not.
*  You know what I mean.
*  Yeah yeah yeah I think like now we live in a time and you see
*  it a lot you see people making comments about it and our
*  industry about how you're just following.
*  Whereas before yeah you had things that were popular but
*  someone you know someone said fuck sign the Stooges.
*  Yeah yeah you know Danny Fields.
*  Yeah but he had great taste but he was still a record company
*  guy.
*  The business side of it.
*  Someone you know what I mean.
*  Someone said sign Susie and the Banshees or whatever.
*  Someone said dude I mean Bob Dylan you didn't know when they
*  made first Bob Dylan record that he'd be 83 years old Bob
*  Dylan.
*  You know what I mean.
*  Yeah yeah and a lot of people said don't sign him.
*  He's not marketable he's not commercial and you know that's
*  my thing where I'm looking for still that maverick spirit or
*  somebody who does have the wherewithal and or vision to see
*  that maybe something is a little bit outside the box still could
*  have not just it would have importance and it can be popular
*  as well.
*  Well of course and it always has been that way.
*  The idea that that can't that everyone has a short attention
*  span now and we're interested in frivolous things.
*  No that's not true.
*  That's just still junk food.
*  It's still junk food.
*  Right.
*  And there's still people that like a nice meal.
*  I'm glad you're out there dude.
*  Thanks.
*  Thanks for doing this.
*  I really appreciate it.
*  It was a lot of fun.
*  I really really enjoyed talking to you.
*  We got to talk about a lot of weird stuff.
*  Yes sir.
*  Thank you very much.
*  Cheers.
*  Bye everybody.
