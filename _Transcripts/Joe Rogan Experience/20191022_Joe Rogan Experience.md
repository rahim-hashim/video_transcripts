# Joe Rogan Experience #1367 - Bridget Phetasy
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [October 22, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G64Hs7iZpU)
*  Hello, Bridget.
*  Hello, Joe.
*  What's happening?
*  Nothing.
*  I'm so excited.
*  We made it happen.
*  We did.
*  Happy Sober October.
*  This is the first podcast ever where Marshall is in the room.
*  Oh my gosh, I feel so honored.
*  We are honored.
*  This is a special one.
*  He's just exhausted and I knew he wanted to just lie down next to me.
*  My dog always comes through the YouTube show and we're always like, oh, she's going to
*  knock over the lights in the middle, but you see her come in and out in the edits.
*  Well, when Red Band and I used to do the podcast back in the day, we used to do it in my office
*  in my house when my kids were really little.
*  So I'd hear like screaming and crying in the background, you know, she took my toy, something
*  like that.
*  So thanks for doing this.
*  Thank you.
*  How's Sober October going?
*  It's great.
*  I want to thank you for doing that.
*  Why is that?
*  Because it creates a community and it's super cool for people to just have that month of
*  clarity.
*  I just think it's really cool.
*  I'm grateful.
*  It's my sober birthday in October.
*  So I was like, how many years?
*  Six years.
*  That's a lot.
*  No, that's, that's insane.
*  It's, you said weeds, the hardest part.
*  Yeah.
*  Weed is, are you sure you need to be sober from weed?
*  Um, yeah, I've tried because here's the thing.
*  Here's the kind of, you really want to know what kind of addict I am.
*  I will, I can do it for a while.
*  I've tried.
*  So I was in rehab when I was 19 for heroin and I started using everything when I was
*  12, 13 years old.
*  Well not everything, but I mean, I started drinking and smoking weed.
*  I mean, all over.
*  I moved every year and a half.
*  It's a long story.
*  Um, my, my whole thing sounds like an improv and like I'm making it all up, but it was
*  just chaotic upbringing.
*  But I'm from the East coast and then I graduated from high school in Minnesota.
*  So to give you, we just moved a lot.
*  I went to like 11 schools in 12 years.
*  So I started drinking really young.
*  I started smoking weed right around when my parents got divorced.
*  And then I was pretty much a daily smoker from the day that I found weed.
*  It was like, ah, oh my God, like 14.
*  I loved it.
*  A release was an escape.
*  Was it just a perturbance of normal?
*  No, my, my upbringing was kind of chaotic.
*  And honestly, I think that I owe weed a debt of gratitude because I don't know that I could
*  have been fully present for what was going on in the house.
*  And and and not like killed myself or done something worse.
*  It was just too much for like a small developing brain to handle.
*  And we'd put enough of that nice, like fuzzy distance between me and the like chaos.
*  That's a good name for a band.
*  Fuzzy distance.
*  Fuzzy distance.
*  I'm going to have to start it.
*  It's just going to be me alone crying.
*  I'm saying, damn, I had no idea.
*  It was and so it was it was good, except then I escalated after I was drugged and raped
*  when I was 18.
*  Oh, Jesus.
*  Sorry.
*  Not to get heavy.
*  It's part of my story.
*  It's horrible.
*  But bad shit.
*  Like one of the things that I've had to come to terms with is, you know, I don't blame
*  myself for that happening.
*  But I I do have to take responsibility for the fact that when you're a woman or a girl
*  and you're out getting blacked out and in this instance, you're around people who are
*  bad.
*  Things happen that are not good.
*  It sucks.
*  But, you know, if I had daughters, I would be like, watch your fucking drinks and like,
*  be careful and don't get don't try not to black out because you don't know what is going
*  to go down.
*  There are so many people that I know that have been drugged.
*  Yeah, I know.
*  I know the thing about that that's so weird to me.
*  Well, A, I don't I try to make light of everything because I have to in order to survive.
*  Or you're a comedian.
*  And I'm from the East Coast.
*  That's just how I handle shit.
*  Like my family's from Rhode Island.
*  My dad's one of ten.
*  It was a roast battle growing up.
*  You either if you were the sensitive one, they're like, oh, you're going to cry about
*  it.
*  You couldn't survive.
*  You had to just be like on top of it.
*  That is Rhode Island, Boston, Connecticut.
*  You can't.
*  You're getting roasted and you either keep up or you're like, you're out.
*  You're the loser in the family and you're drinking too, obviously.
*  Oh, for sure.
*  Heavily.
*  So he I unfortunately was like, if you're going to do that, like use enough to make
*  sure that I don't come to in the middle of it.
*  Don't be an amateur, bro.
*  Because I have memories of it and kind of came to.
*  So it was like I would have preferred just the nothingness of, you know, it being launched
*  like stuck in my subconscious.
*  I think.
*  What was the whole Cosby situation like for you then?
*  When I wrote a whole thing about it because I wrote this piece on medium Bill Cosby raped
*  me kind of because when I because it's a little click baby.
*  Because when all that stuff came out, I was like, oh, really, ladies?
*  You're going to come forward now?
*  And I had to stop and like evaluate my own my own cynicism and just response to that.
*  And writing is pretty much how I process everything.
*  It always has been.
*  And so I'm like, I'm just going to write about this and see what comes through.
*  And essentially it was that internalized shame that had I had been holding onto was I was
*  projecting it onto these women who because if a bunch of girls from Minnesota came forward
*  and said this sleazy dude, you know, drugged us and raped us back in the 90s.
*  Yeah, I'm 40.
*  I'm 40.
*  So yeah, it was like the 90s.
*  I would come forward and support them in support of that.
*  If it was the person who did it to me, I wouldn't be like, come on, ladies, it's a little late
*  for this now.
*  Right.
*  But that was my kind of gut instinct.
*  I think that was like I said, I think it's internalized shame.
*  I think I just I had not forgiven the girl in me, the young girl in me who blamed myself.
*  I didn't tell anyone when it happened.
*  I woke up and I'm lucky I'm not dead.
*  I'm lucky I made it to get sober six years ago when I look at how my trajectory was.
*  And so I ended up like kind of coming to and the weird thing about roofies is that you
*  don't really remember.
*  So I like thank the guy for having, you know, it was like, oh, thanks for letting us crash
*  in this place I didn't even mean to crash at.
*  And I think and then things started coming back and one of my friends, I think something
*  happened to her too.
*  And and it's crazy.
*  I'm telling this story just based on what happened last week.
*  So I just went we went to like the Apple River, which was this place in Minnesota, and just
*  I got blackout drunk for like the next five days.
*  I couldn't I couldn't handle it.
*  I felt ashamed because I was drinking underage.
*  I had I was working in a restaurant.
*  I had a lot of older friends.
*  We were downtown Minneapolis.
*  I felt super cool.
*  And my friend and I both have the exact last memory.
*  And then I have memories of like crawling around on the floor and trying to find a phone,
*  like just bad things.
*  And I always hesitate to tell them to because I know they're a guy.
*  They're like, yeah, tell me more.
*  Just kidding.
*  Defensive mechanisms.
*  And yeah, so then I just went bananas.
*  I started doing hard drugs that year.
*  And you think you did that as a response to that?
*  Oh, yeah, definitely.
*  I mean, I think I just was trying I was already running from so much there had already been
*  my and that was like a tipping point.
*  Yeah, my my stepdad was a little crazy.
*  I don't really publicly talk about it all that often.
*  But it was like whatever.
*  I met like crazy stepdad.
*  Do you like it?
*  I think you can figure things out.
*  And it was really chaotic.
*  And and then that kind of escalated my drug use.
*  I found hard drugs.
*  And like then I tried speed and math and I hated it because my brain already races.
*  I don't need any help with that.
*  That's rare, though, that somebody doesn't like speed and math.
*  I hated it.
*  I hated it.
*  Get on that stuff.
*  No, no, no, I don't.
*  I loved heroin.
*  I didn't get lucky.
*  Well, heroin is like that maternal like womb thing.
*  I think it's also I don't I don't need stimulation for my brain.
*  I need I always wanted relief from this.
*  Were you snorting it?
*  What?
*  Heroin.
*  Yeah, and smoking it.
*  Did you ever get to the point of shooting it?
*  It was right before I quit.
*  So once and then I was like, I'm going to die, essentially.
*  Because you realize like I was going to be 89 pounds in 19.
*  I totally had like one of those Hallmark movie moments.
*  I had been out here with a boyfriend and he had a movie and we were just like it was like a
*  Sid and Nancy movie.
*  I was parent.
*  I was doing so much blow.
*  I had delusions of like I was.
*  Movie meaning he was making a movie.
*  He was in one.
*  He's in a movie.
*  And we were out here and it was just chaos and we were like it was the shit that I did.
*  How did you get into comedy?
*  That was not for a while.
*  Thank God.
*  I got dared to do that in 2010, basically.
*  So somebody dared me to do it and the comedy store is where I popped my cherry.
*  And it was on like one of those bringer shows and it was an absolute shit show.
*  Every fucking stereotype that you ever heard.
*  People were doing blow in the green room and like everybody.
*  It was like all.
*  You were in the belly room then?
*  No, it was on the main stage, but it was one of those like me.
*  It was when it was in like the years before the research.
*  Oh, that's when I was gone.
*  Yeah, you weren't around.
*  From 2007.
*  So you got there in the darkest days.
*  Oh, it was fucking dark.
*  They say the darkest days were like 2007 to like 2012.
*  It was dark.
*  And then my set went OK enough that I decided I wanted to like do it again.
*  But that was many years after the trajectory.
*  So long story short, I ended up in rehab at 19 and I was there for seven months.
*  Seven months?
*  I was in a halfway house.
*  So you were arrested?
*  No, I put myself in a halfway house, but it was like.
*  How does that work?
*  Can you put yourself in jail?
*  No, it's not jail.
*  Then how come you could put yourself in a halfway house?
*  Because a halfway house is like that in between jail.
*  It's not mandatory.
*  So they let you put yourself like, hey, look, I'm fucked up.
*  You mind if I just hang out here for a while?
*  I couldn't go home because of my home stuff.
*  And so I basically after two weeks, my insurance was up and they're like, OK,
*  you're free to go.
*  I'm like, no, I can't go.
*  I'm going to do drugs in like two minutes.
*  And so they let you stay?
*  No, I took a bus and put myself on general assistance.
*  The joke is it's Minnesota land of 10,000 treatment centers.
*  It's like a great place to get sober.
*  And so I put myself on basically welfare.
*  And then I found a place and I'll never forget.
*  I called this place and the woman answered and she was like.
*  I was like, hi.
*  And I had had some guys try to do stuff to me.
*  So I was looking for an all-women's place.
*  And this woman was like, you ever heard of boot camp?
*  I was like, sounds perfect.
*  I needed that structure.
*  I needed something.
*  And so they basically because I was on welfare, they accepted me.
*  And it was like me and I was the only white girl.
*  I was by far the youngest.
*  It was basically a lot of women just who the judge said, like,
*  go to this program for three months and you won't go to jail.
*  It was nuts.
*  Dude, that's an education.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  I mean, I realized what a privileged little spoiled brat I was.
*  That's for sure.
*  And then I never but I also hide behind that.
*  So I never wanted to share anything.
*  And they're like, it's all relative.
*  Everyone has their problems.
*  And I'm like, yeah, but these stories versus mine, they're not.
*  I feel like I just had too much.
*  So your stories you couldn't even share.
*  And then I started sharing them.
*  They're like, damn, white people are fucked up.
*  And that was when I learned it was really an early lesson
*  and like all this intersectional bullshit.
*  It was very early lesson for me that like it doesn't matter.
*  It does not matter what color your skin is, what like when you're an addict
*  or when you're at rock bottom or we're all humans just like fucked up
*  trying to get out of our own way.
*  And so that was that was an interesting experience.
*  And then I got in my car, moved to L.A.
*  Well, your fucking Twitter feed is hilarious.
*  You have one of my favorite Twitter.
*  Thanks.
*  Wow, that's an honor.
*  I like or retweet your shit all the time.
*  Well, I was recently in D.C. and somebody and they said that,
*  oh, this is Bridget.
*  She's a Twitter celebrity.
*  And I was like, what the fuck?
*  I've never wanted to kill myself.
*  That's nothing wrong with being a Twitter celebrity.
*  Marshall trying to say hi to you.
*  Hey, buddy.
*  Hey, buddy.
*  I didn't even notice he got up.
*  That's all right.
*  He's my best friend.
*  Marshall's everybody's best friend.
*  How dare you, Marshall?
*  Yeah, he's a.
*  Um, yeah, that that I forgot where we were.
*  Well, sorry, you were talking about.
*  I got distracted by Marshall.
*  Intersectional.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Hi, Marshall.
*  Come here.
*  I just don't want him to get caught in the wires.
*  No, I know.
*  He wants to play.
*  I get started playing with him.
*  Hey, buddy.
*  You can play.
*  You want to lay down?
*  Yeah, I just don't want him to get in the way.
*  So you were saying that you realize that everybody has their problems.
*  Doesn't matter if you're black or white.
*  Yeah, I really learned a lot.
*  Those women, it was run by lesbians.
*  They like taught me some shit that stuck with me my whole life, like cluttered room, cluttered mind.
*  I loved that one.
*  It was basically like they were very strict.
*  But what happened was I learned how to be a really crafty drug addict.
*  So I was like, well, as long as my room is clean, I don't have a problem because I came.
*  I came to L.A. at 19 or 20, I guess.
*  And this is like 2000.
*  And I started interning at this website called Buddyhead.
*  It was like this old music website and they were all punk and they had the number one
*  gossip site for music in town at the time.
*  And everybody was obsessed with this website.
*  And then feeling Marcel is a distraction here.
*  He seems like he seems a little restless.
*  Buddy, come here.
*  Come here, pal.
*  Come here.
*  He's so cute, though.
*  I can't bear to kick him out.
*  Come on, come on.
*  Say hi to people.
*  Oh, hi.
*  That, ladies and gentlemen, is the sweetest dog in the world.
*  Seriously.
*  You've been asking for him to be on the show forever.
*  He's just going to he'll do the rounds.
*  He'll go to you.
*  Hi, what are you doing in here?
*  He'll go to you.
*  He'll get pet.
*  And then Jamie, he'll get pet.
*  But I just don't want to interrupt the conversation.
*  No, a little bit of a distraction.
*  That's fine.
*  I'm all over the place.
*  I don't want him to yank any wires out either.
*  Hey, he's going to Jamie now.
*  Told you.
*  Doing the rounds.
*  That's what he does.
*  They're such like love sluts.
*  It's amazing.
*  Goldens are love sponges.
*  So is my boxer.
*  She'll go sleep from one bed to another to another.
*  She gets all the love.
*  Well, he doesn't he's not allowed to sleep in beds.
*  Yeah, but he's very loved.
*  I've never had a dog like that before.
*  They're just so different than any other dog I've ever had
*  because he's just a constant friendly lover.
*  He never gets annoyed with you.
*  He never wants to go lie down.
*  He's always happy when you say hi to him.
*  Yeah, you just start talking as just like pure unconditional.
*  Yeah, I mean, it's crazy that those used to be wolves.
*  I know.
*  Turn them into this thing.
*  I know.
*  They domesticated themselves.
*  Sort of.
*  Didn't they?
*  Yes.
*  Well, initially, but there was actually a display going on right now that I went to last weekend
*  at the what's that science museum in LA?
*  What is it called?
*  The California Science thing?
*  The one downtown?
*  Yeah, it's downtown.
*  The one next to the arena where the football arena.
*  I think it's the California Science Center.
*  Whatever it is.
*  There's a whole thing on dogs.
*  Okay.
*  And it's a whole thing on there's one of them.
*  It shows how dogs became dogs from wolves and the slow process of their ears starting to droop.
*  And get cute.
*  And their snout starting to shorten.
*  They became smaller.
*  And I mean, every animal and this is something that they didn't realize.
*  I don't think it's like the last couple of decades for the longest time.
*  They thought that wolves were wolves and dogs were a mixture of wild dogs and canids and all
*  these different animals.
*  And they realized, oh, no, these are all wolves.
*  Wow.
*  Like a fucking Chihuahua is a wolf.
*  I just have such a hard time believing that.
*  It's hard to believe.
*  It doesn't make any sense.
*  That's like saying a Prius is a car.
*  I just have a chance.
*  Came from a Corvette.
*  I just can't.
*  It doesn't make any sense.
*  No, that's true, though.
*  Yeah, it is true.
*  They found out that somehow or another human beings manipulated through selective breeding.
*  They took a wolf and turned it into like an English bulldog.
*  It's crazy.
*  But I love them.
*  Strange.
*  Well, that's yeah, I should let him out.
*  Just let him out because he probably he might have to pee or something like that.
*  And he wants to go talk to he's going to the door because he wants to go get love from
*  everybody else.
*  Yeah.
*  All the security guys.
*  I'm the fucking cutest dog of all time.
*  He's so cute.
*  I've never.
*  They're so good to have around.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  He's like he whenever you feel bad, you just go to him and just he just gives you love and
*  kisses.
*  Their presence is huge for things that are pretty silent for the most part when my dog
*  is boarded or whatever.
*  It's like what I feel like there's this like giant presence that's gone.
*  And you know what it is, though?
*  It's like emotional candy.
*  Like you shouldn't have candy all the time.
*  And you should have people in your life.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  You shouldn't just be one of those fucking weirdo dog people.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Like people just like dogs, you know, just like candy or even like food.
*  Fuck vitamins.
*  They just eating candy.
*  You know, there's people that are like that.
*  Oh, I don't go to dog parks because of that.
*  Oh, it's so true.
*  Right.
*  The dog park scene in L.A. is psychotic.
*  And there's always someone with a dog that can't control.
*  No, that's been me before, too.
*  When I was one of my one of my dogs, one of my pit bulls was a puppy.
*  He was like five months old, maybe six.
*  I would open up the door.
*  He would run to find the first dog.
*  You can find him in the face.
*  I'm like, what the fuck, bro?
*  I had never had a dog like that before.
*  Yeah.
*  Didn't know how to handle it.
*  I didn't know that like, OK, you can't.
*  This is a male dog with his balls and he's five, six months old.
*  You literally can't bring him around unless you like have him rigorously trained.
*  Yeah.
*  And it needs to be rigorous, like shot collar.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, someone.
*  Yeah.
*  And someone has to show you how to do it correctly.
*  Yeah, that the dog after seeing two attacks on a dog park, I was like, OK, I'm out.
*  No, it's people bring fucking crazy dogs at dog parks.
*  Yeah.
*  And I treat my dog.
*  I mean, there's some I there's some leniency, but I'm very much like it's a dog.
*  I'm not one of the like, let's dress in sweaters and have a birthday party for like, no, no.
*  We're not having a birthday party for my dog.
*  We're not putting any kind of Halloween costume on this pet.
*  My kids do all that shit tomorrow.
*  They do all that shit to him.
*  You know, they dressed him up like a fish the other day.
*  They got him a fish costume.
*  I'm like, I'm like, no, he's a fucking dog with a crazy.
*  He's like, I can't move this weird outfit on him.
*  So you were talking about Minnesota and you're talking about being here.
*  Then you moved here.
*  Yeah.
*  And then I went back east and then I was in the restaurant industry for a long time.
*  So basically I was in rehab and then I left rehab.
*  When did you start writing?
*  I always wrote.
*  You always wrote.
*  Did you always publish things?
*  No, I didn't know that you were getting paid to do it.
*  You were just writing for just a self-expression.
*  I started writing, I mean, my journal, holy shit, from that first rehab.
*  Have you ever seen that movie Seven?
*  Yes.
*  Where he was like, that's what my journal is like.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  That movie still fucks with my head.
*  Why am I still single?
*  That movie still fucks with my head.
*  I saw it in a theater and I remember driving home thinking I was going to get murdered.
*  That was Kevin Spacey.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm just realizing that now.
*  Yeah.
*  Being creepy as fuck.
*  Yeah.
*  But one of his most brilliant roles.
*  Well, American Beauty was another one.
*  Creepy as fuck, but one of his most brilliant roles.
*  I think that, I think, oh God, I hate saying this.
*  You think one has deserved it.
*  I don't think, I wonder how fucked up you have to be as a human to be able to play someone that fucked up.
*  I know, I know.
*  To go to that place.
*  Yeah.
*  Not just to go to that place, but you fucking believed it hook, line, and sink.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay, like the Joker.
*  Joaquin Phoenix.
*  I fucking believed it.
*  I haven't seen it yet.
*  Spoiler alert.
*  I know.
*  No, it's fine.
*  It's been two weeks.
*  I know.
*  Well, I'm not going to spoiler.
*  But it's-
*  It was a dark week for me.
*  I couldn't go see it.
*  I wasn't emotionally strong enough.
*  You get dark weeks?
*  Well, just because of some shit that happened that was crazy that triggered all this stuff
*  from when we started this conversation as.
*  When you had the conversation with that girl.
*  Yeah, no, it was crazy.
*  It was like a crazy, PTSD is real.
*  You know, I hate that the word triggered has been destroyed.
*  It's been destroyed because it does, when you have had trauma,
*  and there's a brilliant book, The Body Keeps the Score,
*  and he talks about how it lives in your body basically.
*  And he worked with vets and, you know, it's crazy.
*  In this book, I've been rereading it again,
*  and he's talking about how when he was writing to get some from the VA to get
*  like a grant to study PTSD, they were like, no, we don't even really think it.
*  It wasn't even part of their profile, which is crazy to think now that-
*  PTSD wasn't part of their profile.
*  It wasn't even like a thing.
*  It was a brand-
*  It used to be Shell Shop.
*  It was, yeah, my grandpa.
*  I mean, I have all my grandpa's, I should have brought some,
*  all my grandpa's letters from World War II.
*  I mean, that guy, he would be getting bombed basically,
*  going under, getting underway every single day for months.
*  And he's like, the most striking thing to me is how he's like,
*  I don't want to feel sorry for myself.
*  I know nobody would want me to feel any self-pity.
*  I'm like, we live in the biggest pussy generation of the entire,
*  we live in just the whiniest culture.
*  He's literally at war, and he's like, I'd hate to be whining.
*  Don't you think that the reason why we have such a whiny culture is because things are so safe
*  relatively?
*  Yeah, I do, definitely.
*  Because the people that are complaining for the most part,
*  the people that are egregiously complaining, they don't have real issues.
*  It's just so weird.
*  I always see this like, I am fighting for my life.
*  I'm like, no, you're not.
*  You're on fucking your couch getting Postmates.
*  So I put it-
*  Your story, like when you tell your story,
*  that's one of the stories that legitimately makes you sit back and go,
*  holy shit, okay, those stories, nobody gets upset at.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  It's a lit- I mean, I don't mean they don't get upset that it happened to you.
*  I mean, they don't get upset at you expressing this like it's some
*  horrible, disastrous event in your life because it clearly is.
*  Well, yeah, and it is, that's why I hate that the word triggered has been so destroyed
*  because it is a thing that people have to, and so in this recent,
*  this girl is my hero, and this recent
*  thing that happened, it was like this person walked in into a situation and she looked distraught,
*  and like long story short, we ended up at a rape trauma center together, and it was-
*  When you said she walked into a situation, you mean-
*  It's like we, it's hard to, she gave me permission to like talk about this if it came up,
*  and so I'm okay with it.
*  Just don't say her name, right?
*  No, no, no, and I'm not telling her story, no details of hers.
*  So I was in a 12-step meeting, and she kind of walked in and looked distraught,
*  and I'm not one of those girls that's like, hey, welcome, like, it's not like leaving the fuck alone.
*  Right, but you saw-
*  But I saw the look, this is where I might actually cry.
*  I saw the, I recognized that look, like it wasn't like I'm having a bad day in sobriety,
*  it was like something happened, and I just made a beeline for her, and I was like, are you okay?
*  And she was like, no, I'm not, and she said like something bad happened to me,
*  and we left that there, and then we went out onto a bench, and we were, I was like,
*  how old are you? And she's like, I'm 19, and young, you know, and I was like,
*  she told me what happened, and something bad had happened the night before, and I was like, well,
*  and I told her, I shared with her, I was like, that same thing happened to me at your age,
*  and I was like, and she's like, a what? You know, like that look of like relief that
*  somebody could understand, and she's like, what do I do? And I'm like, well, I know what not to do,
*  and it's nothing, so, and I'm telling you, it was like, that girl is so brave, I'm like,
*  what compelled you to even walk into that, into the meeting? What compelled, I wasn't even going
*  to go to that meeting, and then when we ended up in that center, like, the counselor was so amazing,
*  the nurse was so amazing, it was like a warm blanket of love was just wrapped around her, and-
*  Was she in sobriety?
*  It was, like, I can't, it's like not really my story to tell, but it was, she was fucked up,
*  yeah, so, it wasn't like dead sober, but yeah, so it was just, it was basically like my story
*  that she was telling, so it triggered, like, all, it was weird to hear my story as she's relaying it,
*  and I'm having, like, flashbacks, so last week, I was like, I haven't really told anyone I'm even
*  gonna, like, talk to you or anything, because some of my friend was like, so what have you been doing
*  to, like, get ready? I'm like, well, I've been crying a lot and eating a lot of cake.
*  To get ready to talk here?
*  Just like, because they're like, yeah, like, it's just Joe and a conversation, but I think people
*  think it's like, you know.
*  Some people it is.
*  It is.
*  Things get weird with people when there's an event coming.
*  Yeah, well, and it was my anniversary of six years, which always is like, oh, that was Friday.
*  So, it was amazing, you know, it was amazingly healing, like, too, to be able to just, it was one
*  of those moments where there's, there's, where something bad that happened to me, I was like,
*  oh, suddenly this has meaning. Like, I can use this to help someone else, and that's, you know,
*  I interviewed this really brilliant woman who escaped from, like, a million things, and her whole
*  thing is, like, if you, what good is our freedom if we can't use it to liberate somebody else?
*  And, you know, circling back to, like, the World War II and this generation, Ayaan Hershiali says
*  that basically this generation is like, they're like trust fund babies with freedom, because they're
*  so far removed from having to fight for freedom that they just take it for granted.
*  That's an interesting way of describing it.
*  Yeah.
*  Trust fund babies with freedom.
*  That's, Ayaan, she's just brilliant.
*  She is brilliant. That is a, that's, that's a great way to look at it, too, but it's very hard for
*  people. Without struggle, I think people don't know what to do.
*  Yeah.
*  And they create problems that don't exist. It's a very common thing. I think human beings are
*  designed to deal with so many different problems that could come up in your environment, whether
*  it's physical threats, danger, all these different things, community, all these different things that
*  you're designed to handle. And when those things aren't there, your brain and your body starts to
*  manufacture things. A lot of people that you see that create drama online.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, like there's so many people that I follow secretly. This is what I do. I bookmark
*  their Twitter page and then I go to it. Just when I need like a dose of madness.
*  Yeah.
*  And there's YouTube videos like that as well. And, you know, it used to be blogs. You could go and
*  read where people would just obviously, their real life is so meaningless that they're seeking
*  all of this drama online. They're seeking this distraction online. And there's people that I
*  follow that are involved in arguments 12, 14 hours a day.
*  I know.
*  And I can relate. Okay. I truly can relate because I've been mad, madness, like crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  I've been crazy before and I'm still definitely a little crazy, but I get it now. I know what it is.
*  Do you go to therapy?
*  No.
*  Oh.
*  No.
*  How do you know? How did you figure out you were crazy? Like how did you self-reflect, I guess?
*  I think. I think a lot. I'm honest with myself.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  I think isolation tank, drugs, the drugs that have helped me, like psychedelic drugs.
*  Yeah.
*  Although those are, whatever you tell your therapist, you could lie to your therapist.
*  You can't lie to mushrooms.
*  Yeah.
*  Mushrooms go, what bitch? Look at this.
*  Yeah.
*  They'll show you everything.
*  DMC too.
*  And edible pot, all those different things.
*  All those different things will show you all the real problems that you have.
*  Yeah.
*  But I know what these people are doing. I know that it's a site, people get caught in cycles
*  of like creating bullshit and then they get in cycles of like festering.
*  You know, Jamie Kielstein?
*  Yeah.
*  One of the things, Jamie is a reformed super social justice warrior.
*  Yeah.
*  One of the things that Jamie told me was that like he would like say something about someone
*  like this guy's a Nazi and a piece of shit.
*  He would say it on Twitter and then he would be glued to his phone looking at every response,
*  you know, every response that came in on Twitter and he'd be reacting to it or freaking out or
*  angry or getting love from it or getting anxiety from it. And then people turn on him and be like,
*  no. And then he would fucking fuck you and go back at him. And it was just like this
*  thing where you're trapped in it. You're trapped in it all day.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Faisal and I were talking about this, the kid from Iraq who was on my podcast and he
*  was, I was like, it's so weird. And, you know, they, and all those like dystopian books, it was
*  like this wreckage everywhere. And then you plug in to get to a better place. And I feel like when
*  I unplug, it's like a Disney movie, you know? I'm like, and then I plug in and it's like chaos.
*  I don't want a flip phone. I don't want a flip phone.
*  I want one. I know. I know. I know. I like taking pictures of things. I like having the option,
*  but I've done much better over the last six months of being way more disciplined with my time.
*  Yeah. Yeah. You know, like sometimes I'll have, I go, I want to check my phone and I go, don't,
*  don't do it. So I'm like giving myself advice. Like the same way I've become my own therapist.
*  Yeah. I've given myself, I give myself advice on don't just randomly just start reading Google
*  stories. Yeah. Yeah. You know, I go, I'll look for information. I'm like, there must be something.
*  But some of the funniest things that you do, like my favorite of your routines are your rabbit holes.
*  When you take us through your internet rabbit holes, those are like my favorite bits that you
*  do because I can, yeah, cause I can identify so much with that. Like you'll be, and I always joke,
*  like I know I'm in trouble when it's like, maybe 9-11 was an inside job because all roads lead to
*  9-11 was an inside job on the internet. Like that's just when you're
*  All roads lead to tower seven.
*  Oh, every single one. If you're finding yourself like, hmm, what did happen there? You're like,
*  okay, get off and get off.
*  Well, the problem is you can find, no matter what the subject is, even if it's completely
*  ridiculous, you can find someone with a compelling argument that it makes sense.
*  Yeah.
*  And then you watch a YouTube video.
*  Yeah.
*  And the problem with YouTube videos is too, there's no one standing there going,
*  that didn't happen. That's not what he said. That's not real. No, no, no, no, no. Architects
*  and engineers, 9-11 truth. Not all the architects. Hold on. Hold on. Let's get a real structural
*  engineer. Hold on. No, no, no. You're missing 30 seconds of that video where the center of
*  the building collapsed. Hold on. That happened minutes before. Hold on. That's when the beams
*  were cut during the demolition of the building. That's not what happened. You need all that.
*  You need the fact checking.
*  It's so hard.
*  You don't.
*  Because you get a flat earth video. You'll start watching those motherfuckers. You're like,
*  what? Is this real? Are we really on a, we're on a disc?
*  I watched that like Zeitgeist movie or whatever.
*  Oh, yes.
*  I'm like, there's some good points and there's nothing.
*  Well, Zeitgeist is not, that's Peter Joseph's movie. That's not completely preposterous.
*  Yeah, no.
*  That's a very good movie.
*  Yeah.
*  But it's not, there's, I think anytime, like if someone wanted to write a blog on you,
*  this is Bridget. This is Bridget Phetasy. There's not, there's just one voice. That's not you.
*  That's someone writing about you. If you were there, you'd be like, well, that's not entirely
*  true. And yeah, I'm like that sometimes, but 99% of the time I'm not like that. You can't
*  cherry pick the worst aspects of me and write a blog about, right? You'd be able to say that.
*  But people do that.
*  Yeah, they do do that.
*  I mean, that I-
*  But it's not real.
*  No, it's not.
*  And that's the problem with someone writing a blog about you or making a YouTube video about you.
*  Right.
*  Or even tweeting about you. If they went on a tweet storm, you know, I read Bridget's
*  Twitter feed and she's a fucking rancid cunt and this is all the problems with her.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Why do they do that?
*  I'm, I mean, it's interesting too, because you know, you are very public. I am very public.
*  There's a lot of material for people to draw from, but still like they don't see me cleaning up my
*  dog's shit in the backyard. Like that's me. You know, that's the-
*  Well, you are you. You're the whole of you.
*  Yeah, the whole.
*  When someone tries to, and even like, you know, I have friends that have done stupid shit and
*  someone said that guy's a piece of shit. I'm like, no, he's not. He did a piece of shit thing.
*  Right.
*  One time.
*  Like who hasn't? Who among us?
*  Yeah, don't tell me he's not a good guy. I've known him for fucking 20 years. I love him to death.
*  Like-
*  Yeah.
*  People are not a thing, a one thing. There are a bunch of things. And the problem with like some,
*  like internet interaction is so incredibly limited because whether it's through Twitter feeds or
*  blog posts or whatever it is, it's a shit way to get the whole picture across,
*  especially when you're defining a person.
*  Yeah.
*  If you, or discussing a subject, like it's a good way to get your thoughts across at that very
*  moment. But if you're like, if you want to tell me that vaccines cause all these fucking horrible
*  diseases and I'm like, okay, we hold up, stop. Let's get some scientists in here.
*  Yeah.
*  Let's get some people. Let's have a fucking four hour discussion about this and let's bring up
*  peer reviewed studies. Let's find out what the fuck is going on. You know, can veganism really
*  cure diabetes and cancer? And is all that shit really caused by meat? Well, hold on.
*  Let's get some scientists in here. Let's talk to people that have actually reviewed the data
*  because there's so many goddamn documentaries and so many goddamn videos-
*  I know.
*  ...to tell you and you're like, oh my God.
*  You can find anything to confirm anything you want to believe.
*  Anything.
*  That's the craziest thing. And there's no check on that belief. If you've decided,
*  it is truly confirmation bias. You're like, here's what I believe and now I'm going to seek out
*  things to confirm that. You should be seeking out things to debunk that belief.
*  Yes.
*  If you're trying to be intellectually honest, but most people, it's not even really in our wiring to
*  want to do that. We just want to be right. We want to be-
*  No, I have some friends that believe every fucking conspiracy theory that comes on the pipe.
*  And conspiracy theories are fun.
*  I always send them debunking things to get mad at me.
*  You're like, no, that's not-
*  No.
*  But it's so easy to go down that it is a weird- we all kind of become two-dimensional abstractions
*  online.
*  Yes.
*  So I had friends that I waited tables with. And then what happened to me kind of getting
*  caught in the crossfire of the culture wars is that I just noticed I wasn't saying things
*  that I wanted to say. And I was like, why aren't I tweeting these things? It was weird to me.
*  I'm like, huh, that's weird. Why am I self-censoring? And then I realized because
*  it was- and then once I started saying those things, I was like, oh, this is why I'm not
*  saying those things.
*  Yeah, you don't want to get in the war.
*  But I didn't even know the war was going on.
*  The war is always going on.
*  I was an idiot. I was drunk and waitressing and I put my head up in 2015 and was like, there's a war?
*  What's going on?
*  When people are expressing controversial opinions, there's always a war. And you know,
*  on the flip side of it, there's certain people that want to believe the official story about
*  everything. And they're just as annoying as the people that want to believe every conspiracy.
*  I was not aware that the war included controversial opinions. Boys and girls are different.
*  I didn't know that the thing had gone- the war had new rules. And Michael Maus always gives me
*  shit. When I was on his podcast, because I've been doing all this, when you start speaking out
*  against the left, you end up on right-wing media because they're the only people who will have a
*  conversation with you.
*  Isn't that crazy now?
*  Yeah, it's crazy. So I go on Glenn Beck and I'm like, did you know that the left has different
*  rules for themselves? And he's like, yeah, no shit, Bert. Yeah, we knew that. We've been aware of
*  this. And I'm just this moron who's like, can you believe these double standards?
*  Deeply entrenched in that culture war. You wouldn't understand how far it's gone.
*  And I was like, literally just getting high, waiting tables, trying to make jokes, trying to
*  maybe get some of that TV money, sell a show, and like trying to pay my bills every single month.
*  This past February was the first time since I was 17 that I knew how I was going to pay
*  two months of bills. Like that's a long time to be-
*  Congratulations.
*  Thank you.
*  I have some friends that are blissfully unaware and occasionally I'll send them things like,
*  I have a friend of mine and I was sending this article about all these different track and
*  field events that are being won by men now.
*  Oh God. I have no idea.
*  Men who identify as women. Not only that men that identify as women, but you know that like in some
*  places you don't even have to take hormones. All I have to do is identify.
*  Oh, no way.
*  Yes way. Yes.
*  That's crazy.
*  High school kids, like you can't force them to take hormones. All they have to do is identify
*  as a woman. It's different everywhere because no one knows what the fuck is going on. So there's
*  all these different rules everywhere you go.
*  I was getting my eyebrows done and the woman who does my eyebrows is Vietnamese and she was telling
*  me that her kids got their ears pierced and she's like, oh, I went and like the kids, they got their
*  ears pierced and my daughter who's not 16 yet wanted one in the like top of her earlobe.
*  And the guy was like, oh no, she has to be 16 to do that. And I was like,
*  yet she can take hormones.
*  Oh, how the youngest of kids.
*  I was like, this is the stupidest state ever.
*  I was reading an article about this guy who's losing custody of his son because he wouldn't
*  let his son transition at six. His son went to his wife and the wife and him split up and the wife
*  wanted to chemically castrate the boy and give him hormone blockers because she had decided that
*  the boy was a girl, whether or not the boy decided or not, still we're talking about a young, young
*  kid. And the guy was being ordered by the state that he had to refer to the boy. I don't believe
*  it was California. He didn't refer to the boy as a girl and he had to, and he was going to have only
*  supervised custody now because he wasn't referring to, he was not allowed to misgender his son.
*  His son was no longer a son. His son was now a girl. Well, here's the thing about all that
*  shit. It's like, no one wants to fight against the mob of the left, but no one, there's no
*  established science on any of this stuff and everyone's different. I mean, are there people
*  that are trans? Yeah, for sure. Are there young people that know that they are a girl from the
*  time that they're young and they're trapped in a boy's body? There's so many of them that say they
*  are. I would be an asshole to deny that. But how, what do we know about this? How much do we know
*  about this and how much should we interfere with their hormonal development? Well, it's so important
*  to like brain functioning, isn't it? Not just that, not just that. A lot of them. Brain development
*  and don't you change your- A lot of them become gay men. If you leave them alone, they just become
*  gay men. There's a lot of them. You know, I've seen this online. There's like a lot of pushback
*  from some communities saying that it's very anti-woman and homophobic, that a lot of these
*  things are kind of a race. It's like just- What's anti-woman is the competition. Well, that and also
*  just like, I can't, you know, sometimes you'll see examples of women can't talk about their periods
*  or something because it makes like a trans woman feel bad or if you, you know, so there's this
*  ratio of like me being able to talk about something because it's, it's like, that's weird to me too.
*  I should be able to talk about my experience as a woman and not worry- No, you can't. You're ruining
*  the experience for trans people. But see that- Stop. Just stop. It's all about compliance. I mean,
*  that's what most of this is about. All these nutbags that are tweeting, the ones that I
*  follow, they're tweeting 12 hours a day. It's about compliance. I mean, most of what they're
*  doing is trying to get- There's one that I tweeted the other day. Over and over and over again,
*  in all caps, she wrote, any gender can have their period. Any gender can have their period.
*  Yeah, no, I'm not playing this game. This is where I draw the line. I know that we just got
*  demonetized, but- No, we're demonetized as fuck. As soon as I said cunt, it was over.
*  I'm not, I can't, that's the thing. I'm like, do whatever you fucking want. I wanted to be a
*  turtle when I was like six, you know? A real turtle or a ninja turtle? A real turtle. Like
*  live in the super turtle? No, turtles live in sewers. I wanted to be like a sea turtle.
*  Or like a ninja turtle. No, I wanted to be like a turtle in the Bahamas. I didn't even know there
*  was a difference between a turtle and a tortoise until I was 30. Oh, I know. I don't think I was
*  aware of that. I thought it was just a different name for turtles. There's so much we don't know.
*  A ground turtle and a water turtle. They're all fucking turtles. I don't know anything, really.
*  So that's the beauty. Which ones lived like hundreds of years? Is it turtles? Or sea turtles
*  do too though. Oh, I think so. But there's tortoises in Joshua Tree. Oh, yeah, right? Yeah.
*  Do you ever run into one? Yeah, they're tortoises. Yeah, I've seen them. They tag- I want to be a
*  ranger in Joshua Tree. They're there for when you're tripping. That's why they're there.
*  They're like, what the fuck? God put them there just so you should- Nature's little artifact.
*  It's an artifact. So when you're tripping, how many people have tripped in Joshua Tree versus
*  not tripped in Joshua Tree? I don't know. I think it's like 30, 70. Tripped versus not tripped.
*  I feel like I go enough to kind of offset. I go sober a lot now. Like once a quarter. So I'm
*  offsetting those numbers. Do you ever do anything like isolation tank? Do you ever do that? I've
*  always wanted to. Well, I have one here if you want to do it. Yeah, I do. I've always wanted to do
*  that. I want to kind of go back and say I don't want to disparage therapy. I think it does help
*  a lot of people. It definitely has helped me. Well, I think therapy is like comedy. There's
*  good therapy and there's terrible therapy. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And by the way, certain personality
*  types really are kind of untreatable. So if you have narcissistic personality disorder,
*  my therapist, the dirty secret is we'll kind of pass them off to someone else or something
*  because once you realize somebody can't see it, they're wrong. They won't really. Well, I talked
*  to a therapist about that. They said some therapy doesn't work because all these people are really
*  there for us to talk about themselves. Yeah, yeah, yeah. My therapist is kind of calls me out on shit.
*  So I like her. My friends who have overheard us because we FaceTime because she's a holdover from
*  the East Coast. They're like, it sounds like she's your friend and she's being kind of like hard on
*  you. But I need that. I need somebody who's going to... I don't necessarily always... It was
*  interesting. I just learned this past week that when you've had trauma, one of the kind of byproducts
*  is that not only do you not trust people, but you don't trust yourself. And I was like, oh,
*  I didn't know this. You put yourself in a bad situation, right? So you don't trust your own
*  judgment. And often like your reaction to it. So my reaction to what happened to me was very, I mean,
*  yes, I was young and I can forgive myself for that, but it was to... I was like hypersexual
*  after that. And then I recently last week had this moment where I was like, oh, God, all the men that
*  just didn't deserve me. And this is one of the... I mean, it really was like I felt like I was
*  re-virginized or something. I don't know what happened, but I suddenly was like, wow, I don't...
*  I suddenly have self-worth. It took me a lifetime. Well, this is one of the... Where I'm squishy,
*  I'm squishy on a lot of things. And I think feminism is really important. And to like shit on it
*  is there are women who died and got jailed for like the right to vote. So that doesn't sit well
*  with me. But some of the excesses of feminism and of the, in particular, sexual liberation
*  is that I was told sex is empowering and it's not fucking empowering if you're not empowered already.
*  Like in my experience... You were told sex is empowering as a part of feminism? Well,
*  it's kind of the messaging is like, you know, women can have sex too. And just like it's an
*  empowering thing. But isn't it more of an anti-shame thing? Because like women are shamed for their
*  feelings, their passion. Yeah. And I think that's why I think that I understand it. I understand why
*  that would be the... But I feel like what got lost is that sex is very intimate. And for years,
*  there's like intimacy is so creepy. I just couldn't... I couldn't make eye contact. No,
*  we're not doing that. That's not happening. And it's... I just... Yeah. Like,
*  get in the back. Get in the back. We... I just didn't have that... I don't know. I just... I
*  missed the memo that it should be something... I was taught that it was, you know, like to kind of
*  withhold because then a man won't respect you, which feels a little bit transactional. So there's
*  that messaging. And then there's the messaging of like, free the nipple and be empowered. And like,
*  you can have sex with whoever you want. But if you have trauma and you're not really great on the
*  self-esteem department, and then you start trying to sleep your way to empowerment, it's only going
*  to create... In my experience, for me, it created a lot more shame and a vicious cycle that was like
*  very connected to addiction for me, too. Sleeping your way to empowerment is a funny concept. Well...
*  Suck and fuck your way to enlightenment. I mean, I'm not going to throw the baby out with the
*  bathwater. And I know I can already... I can... You know, the problem with my brain is that I can...
*  I'm always like contradicting myself. So I can... That's because life is complicated. Yeah. And
*  there's not... It's not binary. Like, sex is good or sex is bad. Like, there's different situations
*  where it's good and different situations where it's terrible for you. Yeah. And it's just the whole
*  weird writing for Playboy. So to ask me... You asked me when I started writing, I always wrote...
*  I wrote that piece, Bill Cosby Rape Me, kind of. That's a great title. Thank you. And then I
*  ended up... Twitter was really how I got every connection in the writing world. I started...
*  Somebody hooked me up with an editor from Playboy, and there was this piece going around
*  that was like, why I don't suck dick. And I'm like, well, someone needs to stick up for sucking
*  dick, and that person needs to be me. And so I pitched to Playboy in defense of why I love
*  giving blowjobs, basically. And I didn't know, again, because I'm a child of the 90s who was
*  just high, I didn't get the memo that now a lot of that is seen as internalizing the patriarchy.
*  What? Wait a minute. What is?
*  Literally. What about eating pussy? What is that?
*  Not eating pussy, sucking dick. But how does that work?
*  Oh, that's okay. But it's only okay... Sucking dick is internalizing the patriarchy
*  because you take it into your body? Well, no. Just some... The whole point of
*  why I don't suck dick is that it's a degrading experience, which it can feel that way. And
*  I would say... Everything can feel degrading sexually.
*  And it's not this or that. Sexuality is so fucking complicated. That's why I loved writing for
*  Playboy, because it is everything. It is shame and fear and intimacy and love and passion and
*  all of it. It all happens in sex and in those messy relationships and the whole consent culture
*  thing, which again, there are good things that come of it. But then there's another thing,
*  part of it, where I'm like, how are we going to hack something as awkward as sexuality,
*  when you're... Especially when you're in your hormones and your...
*  Once again, it comes down to compliance. That's what the whole consent culture is about.
*  Look, consent is imperative. It's important. It's everything.
*  Of course. You don't want anybody doing
*  anything without your consent. However, this idea that you should ask for consent before every
*  single step of the way... Can I touch your left leg? Yes. Can I touch your ass? No, not yet.
*  You ever see that video? No.
*  It was a great video. It was like they're teaching consent. Consent can be hot. And it's like this
*  guy and this girl kissing. And the guy and the girl... The guy's like, can I kiss you? She's like,
*  yes. Can I touch your shoulder? Yes. He has to say it every step of the way. But it's always the guy.
*  But it's explicit too. It's not...
*  But it's always the guy. The girl's... Can I suck your dick? Of course. You don't have to ask
*  questions. The idea that the girl has to ask is ridiculous, right?
*  So if you have a video where the girl's asking the guy, everybody's like, what the fuck is this?
*  What is this? What is she, a sex robot? She's asking if she can fuck you? That is crazy.
*  Can you put it inside me? Yeah. Yeah. No one does that. Has anybody ever said that ever?
*  Asking the guy for consent is one of the most ridiculous ideas ever. If you're making out,
*  that's consent. Well, and this is a difference between explicit and implicit. And there's so
*  much a consent that occurs, it's implicit. And that's some of the sexiest stuff.
*  Right. Right. You don't have to talk about it.
*  Yeah. And it's learning to read that body language and read the like,
*  she's... But people that want compliance, that's what it is.
*  But who are these people? Crazy people that have no life and are on Twitter all day.
*  It's the power trip thing. What they're trying to do is get people to bend their behavior and
*  change it to their will. But why?
*  Because they're nuts. Because they enjoy power tripping.
*  Like why are people saying, stop using guys? Stop saying guys. Stop using gendered language.
*  You ever see that video? Which one?
*  Where they're speaking in front of the socialists. Oh, I was going to say that too.
*  Point of privilege. Point of personal privilege.
*  Yeah, I made fun of it on Dumpster Fire. That fucking video is amazing.
*  Yeah. But when the guy, guys,
*  can you just stop with the chatter because I have a really hard time paying attention.
*  I've severe ADHD. And then the guy who's like the trans woman gets up and says,
*  please stop saying guys. Stop using gendered language. Like, oh my God, we're in a movie.
*  No, it's insane. Reality has become parody. I was watching someone was saying like,
*  please stop using the masculine. And I have like thousands of retweets. And it was like,
*  please stop using male and female. The binary needs... I'm like, no.
*  Well, you know, Todd Phillips, who directed The Joker. One of the things that he said,
*  he was talking about, he said he's really difficult right now to do comedy.
*  Right.
*  You know, it's just like, he's doing an interview. They're like, why are you doing this? Like really
*  dark superhero movie, this dark action movie. Like he's like, wow, fucking hard to do comedy
*  these days. I mean, you know, you guys don't understand that this and that. So he used the
*  term you guys. And one of the reporters that criticized it was calling, you know, say Todd
*  Phillips is a piece of shit. And look how he uses the term guys. Like the main points this person
*  made was that he was using the term you guys. Like that guys...
*  Because everything is a patriarchy?
*  Like what?
*  It's gendered language.
*  But it's also just like language. You know, that's the...
*  Women use it all the time.
*  I use it all the time. I use retard all the time. I know it's not good. It's not good.
*  But it's not bad. Here's the thing about it.
*  It's from being on the East Coast though.
*  It is, but it's also, it has nothing to do with a disease. This is what the problem is.
*  It has to do with people literally being retarded, like retard, like slowing down the progress.
*  Like a person who thinks the earth is flat. That is a retarded way of looking at the world.
*  And if you make videos about it, you're slowing down scientific progress.
*  If people get caught up in your rabbit hole.
*  I'm glad that we're mutually going to be canceled together.
*  I'm hoping to get canceled.
*  You keep trying.
*  I'm trying.
*  You're trying. So you're like South Park.
*  But this is what I think. I just, I think what's going on right now is just like this chaotic
*  period of adjustment to our ability to communicate with each other openly and across the board and
*  in this weird way through social media.
*  Why are we responsible for everyone's feelings?
*  We are not.
*  But this is the world we live in.
*  You are responsible by your language and jokes that you tell. If your jokes are offensive,
*  you are responsible for literally every person's feelings in the audience.
*  Not necessarily. Bridget, here's the thing. It's such a small number of people.
*  Yeah.
*  And they're so loud. This is what we saw with the Chappelle special.
*  Yeah.
*  Right?
*  Right. Right. Right.
*  With the Rotten Tomatoes.
*  Reviewed by Rotten Tomatoes. They decided for whatever fucking goofy reason to make it reviewed
*  by five super woke critics. They gave it a zero percent. They open it up to the public.
*  It gets a 100 percent rating.
*  They're like, thank God.
*  What the fuck are you talking about? Everybody else says it's awesome.
*  And they're going to like it more because they don't like you assholes that say it's zero percent.
*  Well, in the critical theory, guys, you know, like James Lindsay, you've had them on.
*  They're great. But the whole idea.
*  Oh, it's 99 percent and 35 percent.
*  Yeah.
*  Hey, at least the tomato meter went up a little bit with the critics.
*  Yeah.
*  The critics jumped in.
*  The byline says it won't elicit many laughs either.
*  It's like, oh my God, edgy but empty, sticks and stones, won't break any bones,
*  and it won't elicit many laughs.
*  I mean, this was, I don't know.
*  James Lindsay just posted something today. He just posted something today that just said, oh my.
*  Oh, it's about diversity in medical institutions. And that they think that people who are at the
*  head of medical institutions, they should have tenure because we by this, it would take 50 years.
*  Like some woman posted this thing. Like forget about competence. This is there. Here it is.
*  What does it say? Diversity leadership, diversified leadership.
*  Researchers say term limits may create more opportunities for women and minorities in
*  academic medicine. Like term limits. Like forget about how competent you are at brain surgery.
*  What we need is more brown women in your part, doing your part.
*  So we're going to teach them how to be brain surgeons.
*  So what I've learned from them is just that it truly behaves like a religion.
*  Yes.
*  Like wokeism.
*  Yes.
*  And this is the piece that I was writing. I think I quoted you and Bill Burr and just,
*  I was saying like Comedy's Last Stand and around Chappelle and how his special, whether he meant to
*  do it or not, goes like right after every single one of their tenants.
*  Yes.
*  You know, almost like strategically. He goes after every, and I was saying everyone's like,
*  oh, it's reactionary. It's reactionary. I'm like, no, they're fighting.
*  They're not reacting. They're fighting back.
*  Well that, Rotten Tomatoes is the, that's the battleground.
*  Right.
*  That shows you, like this is the ideological battleground.
*  Right.
*  This very small number of woke people versus the vast majority of people that don't turn to comedy
*  to have reality defined for them. They turn to it to laugh.
*  Right.
*  These people are trying to-
*  They want relief.
*  These people are trying to define reality through all forms of art and they're doing it by, again,
*  trying to get people to comply with their very rigid terms of what you can say, the way you can
*  think, whether you're punching down or punching up on how you treat people and how you treat
*  minorities and trans people and-
*  I just get to the like, why? Why? I mean, why-
*  It's a power trip.
*  I understand, but what, because I don't, I like to give people the benefit of the doubt.
*  And so I know that they wake up and think, and that's the weird thing about the time that we
*  live in right now is that literally everyone on all sides thinks they're on the right side of history.
*  Yes.
*  And I was, and you and I were talking about this, like the, before we were, how weird like Trump
*  Derangement Syndrome is, where it definitely exists on the left and there's like the craziness
*  and the people who literally see all day long, they're online tweeting about Trump. I'm like,
*  what do you, how do you feed your children? I imagine they have starving children just
*  waiting for like dinner. And then on the right, you see it with like, he can do no wrong. So it's
*  like these, the MAGA and resistance strains of Trump Derangements. And it's so, it's like most
*  people don't live in there in either one, but they seem to have the loudest platforms.
*  But that's, you know, they say about the left and the right, the further you go left,
*  the further you go right, they kind of get in the middle. They get together because it's an
*  ideological thing. They do.
*  When I was getting a text of working at Playboy, you retweeted it actually. And it was why,
*  you had no idea, but it was, I wrote, women date assholes because you're a pussy. That was like
*  the first column and they were testing me to do a column and you just so happened to retweet it.
*  So you probably got me that job. So thank you.
*  You're welcome.
*  And I didn't realize, cause I got attacked by like all the dudes on the right who were like
*  kind of beta dudes and they were like, I'm not a pussy. I'm a good guy. And then,
*  and then there are all the people on the left, the like radical feminists. And they were like,
*  you can't, you know, this is toxic masculinity. And I was like, what the fuck is happening?
*  You guys sound exactly the same. You should date. I figured out how to solve the problem.
*  Well, I always think it's hilarious when a right-wing person and a Democrat date.
*  How do you make that work? Maybe it's just like hate fucking.
*  Yeah. I hate fucking. Fuck Nancy Pelosi. No, fuck me.
*  I'm sure. I mean, look, people are goddamn complicated.
*  We are very complicated. That's what was so weird about working at Playboy was I got there
*  right when they went non-nude and I was like, sorry, everyone. Like one minute.
*  It was like somebody on Twitter. It was like McDonald's being like,
*  we're not serving fries anymore. Sorry guys. It was like new Coke. Like what?
*  Yeah. Why would you fuck with Coke?
*  So that was a weird time. And then it was a lot of transition, but just writing for men,
*  waking up to the fact that there was this culture war and then writing for men at a time when it was
*  like anti men. I didn't realize that had happened either. I was like still singing. This is a man's
*  world. Like in my mind. And then suddenly it was like, oh, there's a, there's a, there's a sex war
*  going on too. I got the idea behind me too. Like I was also sexually abused me too. I didn't get the
*  times up. Like the other thing of times up times up for what? Like, what is the time up for?
*  Why do we have to use me too? It's such a common phrase. Like it's so weird when a guy is like,
*  I can't wait to see you. And I'm always like, hashtag me too. And people go, lol.
*  Cause now it's become a joke. Yeah. And I know there's been enough
*  Asia Argentos enough, you know, hypocrites enough for the crazy ones. But it is important,
*  you know, because I mean, circling back to what happened to me last week and in my young like
*  childhood, it's important that these, that, you know, I see that woman that I, that the 19 year
*  old as my hero, but also the culture is more supportive of her going and saying something.
*  And it was not 20 years ago. So that is progress. You know, that's definitely progress. But progress
*  is not clean. Progress comes in these waves, knocks rocks over and knocks over pile. And then
*  everybody rebuilds and then we figure out where the fuck the ocean line is now. You know, the shoreline
*  moves. Everything moves. That's been the weird thing is that it's, I, you know, I was joking
*  the other day that I'm like, uh, you know, sometimes something will happen with Trump and I'll be like,
*  all right, that's it. You know, like sign me up for the resistance. I'm going to be marching in
*  the streets. It's in the streets in the minute. They're like, uh, yeah. And what's your gender?
*  I'd be like, I'm out of here. What are your pronouns? I'm out. Forget it. My name is Bridget.
*  Fucking piece of shit. I'm not joining you either.
*  They them. I'm a they them. I'm just out. I'm out. They them. I have a friend whose daughter's a they.
*  She calls herself they. Well, I would be, you know, that's the other thing too, is that you,
*  you latch onto these things when you're a kid. Of course you're totally going to be
*  ripe for having that happen to you. Oh, for sure. You know, you're going to have like two they thems.
*  Babies. They call them babies. People are raising their kids as they, and I just say,
*  let them decide what they are. I don't push them in any one way or. These kids are going to be so
*  fucked. It's like a fucking Disney ride. That was the weird thing when I was working on the,
*  this is also another weird moment I'm having right now because I listened to so much of your
*  podcast when I was trimming weed and anyone who's trying weed knows you do it for like 13 hours at
*  a clip and go crazy and somewhere in an alternate timeline, I'm trimming weed listening to me.
*  On your. But this was all that, that whole culture. And it's so funny because the way those kids
*  revolt, like the way they rebel, all the like hippie kids grew up with like their pants on acid,
*  losing them at festivals and shit. And the Burning Man kids, like one of my friends,
*  she joined the army. I'm like, yeah, this is what happens. That's how they rebel. The kids that grew
*  up with all this crazy shit. They're like, I'm going to be, I'm joining the D fucking a mom.
*  That's what I'm doing. That is what happens. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. If your parents are drug addicts,
*  you become sober and a marathon runner. Yeah. Yeah. That happens. So your kids are going to
*  be like, you know, it's they dad. I'm pretty good at not, I'm not, I let them do what they want to
*  do. I'm not like, I'm not that rigid. Yeah. I mean, I have like rules and stuff, but there's
*  also a lot of communication in my house. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's, I mean, I know what the
*  fuck happened when I was a kid. I try real hard to not make any of that happen to them. Yeah. Yeah.
*  So there's a lot of time where you like, uh, come from a crazy upbringing. It was crazy. It wasn't
*  bad. They were nice, but they were distant. It was more absent, but they were working. Yeah. I was
*  a latchkey kid. When I was a kid, my parents have worked all the day. Yeah. You know, and then when
*  they got home, I was going to martial arts. Yeah. I was never around my, at least you had martial
*  arts that you probably would have been a fricking hooligan. Oh my God. That saved me from the time
*  I was 14 to the time I stopped fighting. That saved me. Wow. Because that gave me structure.
*  Yeah. I had no structure. And it teaches yourself self-discipline. Yeah. It teaches you to respect
*  the whole idea of discipline. That's what I love about Jacko. The whole discipline equals freedom.
*  Discipline equals freedom is fucking hilarious. Do you see the post? My wife put up a post of
*  Marshall with a watch on. Oh, that's serious. 430. She puts it at four o'clock in the morning.
*  I love it. He's so inspiring now that way. Cause he just, I want to see it.
*  Get after it today. I love the watch too. So fucking silly. I'm always like, is that blood
*  or is it sweat? Sweat mostly with Jacko. He's a fucking savage. He's amazing. Like,
*  Jacko really does get up every fucking morning at 430 and works out like a beast.
*  But I think there are some men where like they should, you know, well, we should be,
*  they're just like born warriors. And in this society where there's not really, it's so kind
*  of easy and it's not like they're, it's what do you do? And as we were talking about, I think a
*  lot of that energy of like the negativity, I always say to people online, I'm like, go build
*  something because I know from my own experience that if I'm, if I'm not using that energy
*  creatively, I'll self-destruct. It's like it goes inward or I'll project it outward and I'll tear
*  people down or whatever. Well, that's what you see. Yeah. So go build something. Go make something.
*  Attacking all the time. It's so much of an attack culture. Well, discipline is a very important part
*  of being a healthy person. And for men, I think there's a certain amount of energy that you must
*  expand. You must expand it. You must, you must blow it out of your system. Yeah. And this is
*  actually why I'm very grateful. And again, for you and your platform, because I know from writing
*  for Playboy, I would hear, I would say, Hey guys, what do you think about going bald? And I would
*  get these like long letters from men who had never been asked like, Hey, how are you doing, dude?
*  And they would tell me these stories of like, what it was like to lose your hair or what it's like
*  for to have ED or whatever. And it, there was not really a space for, in this culture war, there's
*  not the, the male magazines have been kind of taken over by the, there's not really a space for men to
*  just be men. There's only spaces podcasts. It is. And you give, but you give these guys a voice and
*  for all the shit you get, you, I feel like you use it responsibly for them. You could be up here
*  being like, go cause a lot of chaos guys. And like, go get whatever. And you're trying to, you know,
*  better yourself and therefore help other people to better themselves and ask questions. And like,
*  it's not like you're up here. You could be doing a lot of bad shit with this. You would be wielding
*  this weapon. Like, you know, you could run for president. Oh God. Let's do it.
*  That's not happening. But yeah, I think that there's very few legitimate outlets for men
*  because everyone has to be, you have to go through the filter of executives and producers and all
*  the, if you're going to put something out there, like a, some sort of an entertainment product,
*  it has to be filtered by the network. It has to be filtered by all these other voices.
*  And if they want to keep their fucking job, they're not going to let you just be yourself.
*  There's no way they're going to try to mold you. They're going to show what about the diversity,
*  what you need as a girl sidekick to balance you out because everything you're doing is so masculine
*  and people are going to be really turned off by it. And what about girl voices? You know,
*  I can't believe you two guys are on there and you're talking about gay rights and there's no
*  gay people in the room. You need a gay person. And then next thing you know, I got this fucking,
*  this woke round table and it's a goddamn disaster. And men, again, they don't look,
*  I have no problem with anybody saying like, you can, if you have a podcast and you're a guy,
*  you just love taking it in the ass, go do a podcast called take it in the ass. Have a good
*  time. That's you. But if there's no one filtering you and no one stopping you, you can really
*  accurately reflect who you are. You can accurately project who you are. But if you're a man,
*  just a regular man who likes manly shit, do you like, do you like hot rods? Do you like fights?
*  Do you, do you like tits? Do you like these things? Well, then you're a piece of shit.
*  And in this day and age, if you have that, these, these normal male desires, which fucking every
*  male has, everyone, the gay called toxic masculinity, when every man has it, there's no outlet.
*  Because everyone has to, everything has to be filtered through an executive or a director.
*  And then what shadow does that create? So every time, you know, what you resist persists, what
*  you repress creates a dark shadow. So when you're taking all of this masculine energy and you're
*  constantly beating men over the head with how bad they are, it's not going anywhere. Now it's just
*  going underground and it's going to leak out in weird fucking ways because they're not allowed
*  to express themselves. And the problem, I see this all the time is like, oh, toxic masculinity,
*  toxic masculinity, let men be men, let men share their feelings. And then it's like they do,
*  and they're like, shut the fuck up. They want men to change. They want men to adjust and they
*  want men to look, you can be a really good person and also be a man. Yeah. And manly man. Yeah.
*  And I don't think that you can, they think that you have to evolve and change because the men
*  that are a part of that are all pussies. And there's a lot of those guys out there. There's
*  a lot of those guys that don't like manly men. And they want to think there's something wrong
*  with someone like Jaco. There's something wrong with a guy who likes hot rods and tits.
*  And there's nothing wrong with the guy who's not a manly man either.
*  Nothing wrong with that. But they're competing. But they're competing. Right, right, right. Every
*  male feminist is competing. I saw somebody with like a cis, hetero, blah, blah. And I was like,
*  oh, you're a woke dude trying to get laid. Like whenever I see that in a cis hetero normative,
*  I'm like, okay, so you're just, that's all. That's all they have, but they have to do that.
*  I had a bit that I was doing about male feminists. I go, they don't exist.
*  Find me a male feminist that can pick up heavy shit and run fast. They're not real. They're not
*  real. You know who the meanest people have been to me online other than like incels and radical
*  feminists? Blue checked liberal dudes. Like some of the like allies. They're the people who have
*  come the hardest at me and been the most cruel to me. About what? They're just always on my nuts
*  about. Am I allowed to say that? Yes. Yeah, you can say that. We'll let you. I got nuts today.
*  It's like a white person using the N word. Oh, that's, that's going to go over well.
*  That's exactly what it's like. What are they getting after you about? What was the last one?
*  You know, I think I said something about like Tulsi, you know, how they're like, oh, she's a
*  foreign ass and everybody's like, you're a fucking idiot. And they, they just,
*  as I kind of started just speaking my mind and the weird fucking hard thing about being
*  a feisty comedian and somebody that sometimes writes more serious pieces is that I get to,
*  I, I don't mean to, but I dance outline of like, it kind of cracks me up when people get all outraged.
*  Of course. It kind of makes me laugh. And I, I can't help the comic in me is like, that's my,
*  I'm supposed to be pushing the envelope and buttons and I, you know, the free speech stuff,
*  I will die on that hill. That is literally a hill I will die on. That's the hill to die on.
*  And that is when I say, when I see these, like the, the, the sides going, I'm like, okay, yeah,
*  we got to push against some of the corruption and this is getting bad over here. And then I'm like,
*  wow, okay, this is authoritarian and insane. And you can't say anything. And he's so many of these
*  woke left dudes are mush. They're mushy. They're made out of mush. Like come run a hill. You're
*  made out of mush. Do a deadlift. That was one of my favorite billboard routines ever. The guy
*  screaming on the plane where he's like, and he's like, that is a screamer. She come from a woman
*  or a child. No grown man should ever have that coming out. And he's like, that's like,
*  if the ant and he was talking about how animals would be like, stay away from that one Lindsay.
*  Cause it is, I don't, I don't think I was thinking about it. I'm like, I don't think I've ever dated
*  a liberal dude because they're there. I don't know. I don't think so. I don't, not in the,
*  not recently because I like my men masculine, but you can be masculine and also be liberal.
*  I'm pretty liberal. Yeah. Yeah. I know you are. I know I, I'm not saying that I,
*  you can be masculine and liberal. I just doesn't happen that often. I think they're all taken.
*  They've like snatched up pretty quick by the liberal women who are like, I see what he's a
*  unicorn. It's well, and I think too, we come from a different generation. So that it's more of a
*  struggle maybe now than it was like back when you got married. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think there's
*  something wrong with it now, which is not good. So crazy. No, no, no. It's, it's, and I think most
*  women, many women, I, I'm feisty and I opinionated like, I can't have a guy who's not going to put me
*  in my place. I can't have a man who's going to just let me walk all over them because I will.
*  It's normal. It's natural. I mean, no one wants that. Well, I think there's a natural inclination
*  that certain women have with weak men to push them around. I think it's normal. I think you,
*  you're testing the boundaries of what you can get away with and not get away with communicating
*  with each other. Well, and it's also the whole like concept of nice guy. It's like, well, you're
*  not a nice guy. You just were trying to backdoor your way into dating me by being a friend and
*  it's manipulative. Jordan Peterson talks about that. Jordan Peterson says that you, you don't
*  want to be a nice guy. You want to be a dangerous person who's nice. A dangerously nice person.
*  Dangerous person who is nice, but just being a nice person all the time. Like you're, you have
*  to be nice. Well, you're nice because you have no choice. A dame, you want to be a dangerous person
*  who chooses to be nice. There's a big difference. That's interesting. Cause you have a choice to be
*  nice or to not be nice. And I want a dangerous person when this shit hits the fan. Yeah.
*  Everybody does. I don't want some. Everybody does. You want a dangerous woman too. Yeah. Yeah. You
*  want someone who can figure it out. Yeah. And you don't want mush. Mush. People are made out of mush.
*  Do you think that we're making more mush? Yes. If there's anything I think in this life that is
*  un fucking bendable is that we are making more mush. And how do you, how do you think that we
*  helpfully and not, you know, I find that I do what I did as a child, which is shame the mush.
*  You went through a whole fucking litany of chaotic events that shaped you and you had
*  terrible things happening when you learned from them and then you became who you are today. But I
*  don't want to. You don't have to do it that way. No, but my point is using how do, how do I, how do
*  you inspire people who might be attracted by this kind of, you know, the reason I started my podcast
*  is just so that people could tell stories of grit and resilience, because I find that what happens
*  is we'll start talking about the victimhood culture, but then it sounds like we're victims.
*  And I don't want to do that either. I want to build something. Grit and resilience. But how do you,
*  you know, I worry that these young minds are being indoctrinated. And this is what I always ask them,
*  like the women in, young women in particular, with like intersectionality, which seems like
*  this race. I'm like, play the tape forward for me. Where does this lead? How does this lead to
*  self-esteem? How does this lead to feelings of empowerment? I mean, my therapist and I talk about
*  this all the time, how hard she's having, how hard a time she's having with the younger women,
*  because they're all coming in with this sense of perpetual victimhood of everywhere you go.
*  It's the patriarchy and everything is oppressing you. And how the whole idea of therapy is to get
*  you out of feeling those, you know, going from maybe being victimized, feeling like a victim to
*  taking that and being more empowered. I don't exactly know what you could say to young women,
*  because I've never gone through that experience. But for sure, for young men, they need something
*  that's difficult. Young men need difficult things in their life. Like those boundary waters or
*  whatever that is. Yeah, something, anything. For me, I always tell them jujitsu. Get involved in
*  jujitsu. Because I don't, getting involved in martial arts that involves striking is fucking
*  dangerous because brain damage is for keeps. You keep that shit for the rest of your life.
*  That's why I'm so adamant about trying to get fighters to quit when I think they should quit.
*  You know, when they've hit this wall and they come to me for advice and it's happened many times,
*  I'm like, you gotta stop. You gotta stop. There's no way of fans or buds. Don't look for that fucking
*  pot of gold at the end of the rainbow because you already been knocked out four or five times.
*  You gotta stop. Because if you don't stop, you're going to be a 60 year old person that shits their
*  pants. Your wife's going to have to walk you to the car and you're not going to know where you are in
*  a supermarket. You're going to get lost. Like this is what happens. This is real. So striking,
*  striking arts are very dangerous. And I think you got to know when to get off that fucking boat.
*  You gotta know. But grappling is a different animal. Grappling, you could teach people jujitsu.
*  And I went to jujitsu with a guy who was fucking 62 years old. Yeah. 62 years old. This guy,
*  I was like, how old are you, man? It's like 62. I'm like, holy shit, purple belt. 62, going after it.
*  Trying hard, trying to get his black belt. I'm like, good for you, man. Like it was a fucking
*  cool conversation. That to me is something that I would encourage young men to do because it's
*  really difficult. And in the beginning you feel hopeless. And then as you get better at it,
*  you learn, oh my God, with hard work and discipline, and I just fucking keep showing up,
*  just keep showing up and figuring it out. I can get better at something. It's a very difficult
*  thing. I can use that as a vehicle for developing my human potential. And also I realize that I can
*  overcome struggle. Right. I can overcome these things. I can overcome and I can get better.
*  And then also the exertion of energy, just going out there and fucking exhausting yourself.
*  You're more calm and peaceful. And then there's the other thing about jujitsu is your constant
*  physical contact. Yeah. Like people need hugs. They do. As weird as that sounds. But men need,
*  even hugging each other, it sounds like maybe gay or something. I don't care. But it's good. It
*  feels good to hug. No, it's- Even though you're trying to kill each other, you're touching each
*  other. Yes. Connection is important and you need that brotherhood. There's something about that
*  camaraderie that you have to have. There's a camaraderie that exists in jujitsu that's unlike
*  any other camaraderie I've ever experienced because you don't have, there's a certain resentment
*  from striking. If a guy beats my ass, if I go spar with some guy and he beats my ass,
*  next time I see him, I'm like, I'm going to fuck this dude up. I don't like him that much.
*  He hurt me. He gave me a headache. Like I went home, I have a headache because a guy hit me with
*  a punch. So I'm thinking, I'm going to fuck him up. And this is what men do. Sparring,
*  and sparring oftentimes turns into fights. But in jujitsu, you could choke me and arm bar,
*  we could choke each other. And then afterwards, it's all love. It's all hugs and clap hands and
*  thanks, man. And people tell you how they caught you. They tell you, I almost tapped there, dude.
*  And we'll laugh about it. There's a really great class that I've been wanting to take and it's at
*  Gracie and it's Women's Empowerment, but it's all just like self-defense, the one in Beverly Hills.
*  But it's an amazing class. I like sat in on it because I like it as a woman. It feels like
*  the most realistic. I feel like I can actually use it. For sure. Jiu-Jitsu is the most realistic
*  for women. Just to get away. Defend yourself. Yeah, to defend yourself just to get away. I'm
*  not going to sit there and fight. But just giving myself that window of an opportunity that I might,
*  just a chance, a fighting chance. Because otherwise, yeah, no. Well, jujitsu is also
*  something that someone who's a weaker person can effectively utilize on someone who's stronger.
*  Right, right. Because it's so technique-based. Yeah. I think that that is one of the things I've
*  learned from all the men who were writing into me at Playboy is Jordan Peterson has something that
*  really speaks to these guys. I've seen him get a lot of crap, but he has saved so many men that I
*  know. These guys have written me letters telling me so much and I'm not sure really what it is about
*  his program or whatever it is that he's saying, his message. Well, he's concentrating on young men.
*  He's resonating with young men because- Is it discipline? What is his primary-
*  He always talks about cleaning your room. Right, right, right. Make your bed.
*  Messy mind, messy- Cluttered room, cluttered mind.
*  Same thing. He's essentially saying clean your room, get your shit together.
*  Okay, yeah. There's so much to what he's saying
*  that expands far beyond that as well. His movies are getting- He says there's a documentary about
*  him right now, The Rise of Jordan Peterson, and it's getting censored. Why?
*  These people are protesting it being in these theaters. They don't know. They think they're
*  supposed to censor him. They think he's transphobic and homophobic and all these different things.
*  But he's helped so many people. But you know his origin? Do you know what
*  happened in Toronto? No.
*  Okay. There was a bill that was being passed. It was going to force you to use one of- There's
*  this gender pronoun bill. Say if you wanted to use one of the 78 different gender pronouns,
*  you would be obligated, legally obligated to use them. And he was protesting against that.
*  It's like you're using compelled speech. You can't compel me. Canada does not have free speech.
*  They do not have a First Amendment. So it wasn't that he didn't want to
*  use their preferred pronoun. It was that he didn't want to be compelled to use that.
*  Yes, legally compelled. Legally compelled. And he didn't want to use made up words either.
*  Right. Because there's zee, zur, and jim,
*  and all these different crazy made up words. Yeah.
*  Like you want to be a they? You want to be a he or a she? What are we doing here?
*  Yeah. What are you? Okay. You want me to call Bruce Jenner,
*  Caitlyn Jenner? Okay, I'll call her Caitlyn. That's fine.
*  You want me to say it's a her? Okay, I'll say it's a her. That's fine.
*  I don't care. I don't give a fuck. But you want to start making up words? And that's where he's
*  like, no. And you want to legally compel. And you want to call me a bigot for not
*  letting my kid get hormones. Like, this is where this is where or the sports thing I get very
*  like outraged about. It's insane. It's insane. There's a bunch of different schools that are
*  letting kids compete in the gender that they identify with. And those in those places, those
*  women's track events are fucking dominated by men. Dominated. They're breaking world records.
*  Was that woman's name Rachel McKinnon? She just broke the world's record for the cycling event.
*  And she's she used to be a man. I mean, all the in the like, you're a bigot if you don't agree
*  with this. No, you broke the world's record. How'd that happen? What is happening here? What's
*  happening here is you're a guy. This is my born a guy. This is when I feel like I'm in a simulation.
*  And right. And there's somebody who's like, let's see how many people we can get to like,
*  get on board with this shit. Right. And then and I and or I'm like, maybe I'm just old.
*  Maybe. No, what's getting what's happening is women are getting fucked over. That's why this
*  is the most crazy. I get called a turf a lot. But they're in the middle of this ideological battle.
*  And women are losing scholarships. They're losing their ability to compete with people of their own
*  gender. This is or their own sex, their own whatever you want to call it, whatever the
*  right chromosomes. When you start adding trans men and trans women into the mix, you're going to
*  get two things depending on the sport. The trans men are going to get fucking smoked.
*  Period. When when when women transition to men and they want to be a man and compete with men,
*  they're going to get fucked up in almost every sport, particularly fighting. It is funny how
*  much it's gotten men talking about periods. Has it? I guess it's just like, you know, I'll see men
*  defending like a woman's right to talk about her period. I'm like, yes, that's right. Now you're a
*  feminist. What man has ever had a problem with women talking about their period? No, no, I know.
*  But they exist. They're squeamish. That is so weak. That's mushy, man. Guys are scared of pussy
*  blood. You're not scared of a bloody steak. You're scared of vagina blood. Yeah, they are. There are
*  guys who are squeamish about it. And they're another one. Shake them off the leaf. Yeah, yeah.
*  Shake them off. Yeah, there's there's a it is it does feel a banana. I read something somewhere
*  where it said, you know, that there was gender, like stereotypes were being determined by biology.
*  And now we're using biology. Now we're using gender to determine biology as so biology
*  determined gender stereotypes, the male and the female, whatever. And there was a reaction to that.
*  And now is a reaction to it. They're using gender to determine biology and how it's getting. Yeah,
*  it's so confusing. It's so maybe this is just a broad spectrum of people. And there's low
*  testosterone males, there's high testosterone females. And that should be okay. We should be
*  allowed to be whatever the fuck we want. But the thing is that the low testosterone males can't
*  compete with the high testosterone males. And the high testosterone females can't compete with the
*  high estrogen females. And there's like if you want a Barbie doll, and you're built like the Hulk,
*  you know what I mean? Like if you're if you want to be Barbie, but instead you're you're you're
*  built like Tom Arnold. Yeah, one of them lesbians always wears vests.
*  There's a type of lesbian that wears those Patagonia vests everywhere. Right? I have a
*  Subaru my brother's like, you gotta just come out. Come on, those thick ones with a wide waist.
*  I get called an alpha widow all the time. That's what the insoles call me. Alpha widow. It's a term.
*  Yeah, you can Google it and everything. It's like a woman who chases after alpha males,
*  but they're not interested in like wiping me up. And so I end up a widow.
*  That doesn't make any sense. But what I was gonna say is that like, it's like the unrealistic body
*  types. Yeah, like this is a thing that gets brought up all the time. They've even had these
*  promos and these advertisements taken down, particularly in the UK. There was a big story
*  about that because they were promoting unrealistic body types. Okay, one of those guys tried to do
*  that to one of those Vox guys. Is this a body positive? Was trying to No, it's not. I was
*  trying to like say don't follow these gay is he's a gay guy. He's saying don't follow these gay
*  Instagram thirst pages, because they're promoting an unrealistic body type. And the fucking gay
*  guys just attacked him to the point where he had to shut his fucking Instagram down for a while.
*  Because gay guys don't play with that shit. They don't like that unrealistic body type. You
*  could pull it off on some women. Yeah, it's unrealistic. Or they're eating cake. Yeah,
*  but it's not unrealistic. That's a real woman. Okay, it's just not your body. Or it's not typical.
*  Well, look, if you're a fucking a person, I'm five, eight. If I look at LeBron James,
*  seven foot tall man, well, that's an unrealistic body type. No, it's realistic. Yeah, playing
*  basketball professionally. He's a real person. Yeah, fucking hologram. It's not unrealistic.
*  It's just unachievable for me. That's just that's just what it is. Right. That's what that's what
*  you got. That's the fucking hand you got. Yeah, nothing to do with realistic or unrealistic. If
*  you see a girl and she's got a tiny waist and a big ass and big tits, she's got that Jennifer Lopez
*  jean. Fuck. Yeah, that's just her. She got lucky. You didn't get that lucky. That is realistic.
*  Yeah. Now, if they're using that to sell fucking Fanta or Adidas shoes or whatever the fuck it is.
*  So what if you're saying, well, all these girls feel terrible because that's unrealistic. That's
*  life. That is that is life. Yeah, that again, we come back. We come back to why are we responsible
*  for everyone's feelings? Get get off the fucking couch and go do something about it if you don't
*  want to if you don't want to feel sad. No one cares about though. Fat dudes, fat dudes. Fuck off.
*  No one cares. No one feels bad about fat dudes. Well, they get away with the whole dad bod thing,
*  which I wrote a whole piece about. Where I was like, guys with a gut like that bod. Dad bod isn't an
*  excuse to be lazy, though. I know some guys who will lean really into that. They're like, it's a
*  dad bod. I'm like, they like it. Yeah, they kind of get away with it because it's like, you know,
*  guys get like cute, adorable little dad bod and women get like fupa. I don't think so, though.
*  No girl wants a dad bod, do they? The only reason why I want to be a dad bod is because they know
*  that the guy has like less options. He's more likely to stick around. Right. Because it's
*  going to dad. I was like, where are you going, bitch? Or is going to fuck you there. Either one.
*  But I mean, look, I'm sure some women like joey guys. They like it. Yeah. And I think some women
*  like more like girth than me, like a little bit of weight. Yeah. Some girls like big, thick women,
*  too. Everybody's different. Everybody gets, I just think that if you like somebody that's and here
*  to your point is that it's fine. Whatever you like, whatever your type is, if you're into like a big
*  dude, if you're whatever, but the people who like people who are fit are somehow not being
*  shamed. The only thing that's changed is people's ability to express themselves online through
*  social media. That's the only thing that's changed. And because of that, people are yelling about
*  things that don't that, that they can't do. Do you get fit shamed? I get called a meat head. I guess
*  that's fit shamed. Yeah. Yeah. Guilty as charged. Yeah. I don't care. But if you're ashamed me for
*  being in shape, like congratulations. I don't care. I don't care. It doesn't work. Yeah.
*  That's like, you feel great. Cause you're shaming you for being successful. Oh, you got me. Sorry.
*  Sorry. I figured out a lot of shit. It's such a weird, this is a weird, the weird world is that
*  it feels like we're raising the, you know, we're the bar isn't it's being lowered and lowered and
*  so instead of raising our standards and trying to everybody lift each other up, it's more just like
*  a very small majority. That's like, come down. But again, it's a tiny amount of people making
*  this noise. We've been talking about it. It has an outsize influence. Well, it has people reacting
*  to it. They're bending towards it, but I think it's, it's temporary. I really do. Yes. Look,
*  you're optimistic. You think it's going to like eat its own tail? Like the ouroboros? You can never
*  be woke enough. They go after each other. They turn on each other. I don't think it's real. I
*  don't think it's real. Yeah. Look, there's certain things that people always are going to like,
*  and there's certain things that men are going to like, there's certain things that women are
*  going to like. It's just, it's just the way it is. I do think it gets sorted pretty quickly,
*  like in, in, in natural disasters. You know, I always say this, I'm like, you can call yourself
*  whatever you want. And the other interesting thing is, you know, your computer knows better
*  than you, whatever you're saying online. Yeah, they've done studies and it's like, it doesn't
*  matter what you're saying online. Your search engine knows what gender you are essentially.
*  I mean, it can generally tell like probably with a large accuracy. Oh yeah. You look at my search
*  results. It would be fucking super obvious what I am. But I think that we just live in this really
*  confusing moment in history. So I guess my fear is that the, there, the, the youth are in,
*  ingesting all this kind of, it's confusing for them. Yeah, it is. It is, but it's also there's,
*  look, as much as I like to make fun of world culture, the good thing about it is, is making
*  people more sensitive. I agree. It's making people nicer. Yeah. But not necessarily nicer
*  because some of the people that are woke are using that as an excuse to be a fucking asshole to people
*  to force compliance and be an asshole. But because of that, because of that, it's again, it's like
*  the tide going in and out and it's, it's going to find its healthy level. Yeah. Gen Z is amazing.
*  I have nephews who are Gen Z and they're so funny. I don't even know what they are. They're like,
*  they're basically like 19 and below. So, and they're just so, I don't know, they're just funny.
*  Like my, you know, three years ago, my nephew, they've, they've already taken all of this kind
*  of woke language and they've, they've metabolized it. Yeah. They're like, they were like, dude, mom,
*  she was so triggered. And they didn't mean it. Like she was, she was like getting bullied or
*  anything. It was like a girl who got a bad grade and they were already using the language. Yeah,
*  they're already taking it and memeing it. You know why? Podcasts. Yeah. Yeah. They listen to
*  podcasts. Those young kids who listen to it all the time. And there's a huge, small Ben Shapiro
*  cult of like 12 to 14 year old boys. It's no joke. You know what's really funny? The moms who hate
*  him. Well, that's why. Yeah. I mean, all my friends, I have a lot of female friends on like the West
*  side and they are all super live, you know, like cried for three days, acted like it was 9 11. I'm
*  like, did planes fly after Trump? That lady with the sock hat with the glasses. Oh yeah. I still
*  watch it every week. It's my favorite. It's my favorite. Tell me that lady didn't know a camera
*  was on her. No, but that's the fucking new. That's half the reason why she was doing it. It's this
*  book meet. You have to read the book mediated. It's my Bible for this time. And I read it in 2006,
*  Thomas Zango, Tisha. It's he wrote about it's essentially like how the, how we're, we're all
*  self-reflexive. And he talks about this, how everyone in, when everything is mediated,
*  everyone knows their role. They know what part they're playing. This book is amazing.
*  Is he, he called it shapes the world and the way you, but he calls out all, he has a chapter on
*  identity politics and it's like, he called out all of this. He was explaining all this post-modernism
*  before Jordan Peterson and all of the critical theory, all of the people there. And he's a
*  brilliant writer. When was this? When did this 2006, it came out. It's so good. And I just,
*  isn't it crazy when someone catches shit like as it's happening, they catch the smell in the air.
*  Yeah. Oh, I know where this is going. Yeah. Yeah. He, he called it and I've, I, I,
*  I probably referenced this book on every talk I have because he talks about exactly this when
*  Princess Diana died. He said, you know, everyone knew their roles. It was, and he was talking
*  about how, like the Monica Lewinsky thing is so interesting because she was like,
*  and her Ted talk, she talks about this, how she was patient zero for online mobbing. It was like
*  the first news story for the 24 hour news cycle and really the first person who got like mobbed by,
*  by everybody. Have you ever read John Ronson's book? So you've been probably shamed. Yes, I love him.
*  That book is amazing. And I, I remember cause I got on Twitter right when the Justine Sacco thing
*  happened and I was like, this is bad. What are you guys doing? I didn't know what was happening. I
*  was like, this is not good. You guys, your life is like walking into a fucking gang fight. Hey,
*  Hey, put the bottles down. Why do you have a torch? What's the fuck?
*  I know it's true. Every time I go on one of these things, they're like, how'd you end up here? Like,
*  I literally tweeted my ass into the center of the culture wars and I'm like, wait, what happened?
*  Now I'm writing about it. Oh my God. And then it is such weird times because in so many ways,
*  I mean, I went to the sex robot factory and I just wrote about this for a column that's coming out
*  and it was like that whole uncanny Valley, you know, that, you know, that I felt like I was like
*  walking in and out of it through the hole. It was a place where Whitney's yeah. Have you seen hers?
*  Yeah. And it was where she got hers done. Yeah. And it was such a weird, um, it was like,
*  it was so, you know, how they're making them like war. I'm like, as soon as these things can make
*  sandwiches, like we're fucked. It's going to happen. No, women are done. We're going to be toast.
*  Cause you see ex Machina. Yes. She's hot. Even though you could see through her skin into her
*  robot parts, she's still hot. Yeah. Like that, that whole Turing test that's going to happen.
*  Like people are going to not be able to distinguish whether or not something is a robot or a person.
*  It's going to happen. It's probably going to happen within a hundred years. And then they're
*  so funny because in the piece I was writing, I'm like, it's so weird because they're all so
*  optimistic and they're like, no, it's for the guys who are lonely. And it's like that opening scene
*  in Jurassic park where you're like, what could possibly go wrong? I wrote something a long time
*  ago where I was making fun of people who had real dolls and this guy wrote to me and it made
*  me feel bad. Did he lose his wife? Oh, no, no, no. He was just like horribly scarred from acne.
*  Oh, never get a girl. And you know, he just had just a shit roll of the dice. Yeah. Yeah. And you
*  know, he was talking, but he goes, I'll, I'll, I'll, you know, I'd be happy to talk to you about it.
*  Like sometimes, you know, you make fun of something and then someone reaches out to you and you there,
*  now you're a human that you're communicating with. Yeah. Oh, this isn't fun anymore. Well,
*  that was what Whitney was saying. You know, she's like, she was saying that she wanted to kind of
*  think they were all creeps. And then she went on their, on their message boards and they were all
*  like really lovely guys who took really good care of their dolls. And, and I think that again,
*  there's, you know, relationships and human sexuality are complicated. But when I was asking the guy in
*  charge of AI, because what creeped me out more than even the dolls hanging from the meat hooks,
*  like all that shit was that they're so with the app, you know, how I'm sure she explained
*  it, how it works, where it's like, now they're getting into, did you see the movie her?
*  Yes. Okay. So it's, that's really what they're focusing on. So that it's essentially like,
*  if you had the app and then you left to go to the podcast because it's in your schedule,
*  then the robot would be like, see you soon, Joe miss ya. And it would send a text. And so now you
*  have this relationship and really the doll is just the physical form of this persona that you
*  have a relationship with in the cloud. And I was like, okay, so bad. And I'm gonna stop for a second.
*  How can we stop? We don't have to, I guess I'll say, but can you guys talk for a second? Sure.
*  Talk to Jamie real quick. I said, go to podcasts and real bad. I'll be right back. Yeah. It's
*  jumping a restaurant talk. We're going to talk about restaurants. I mean, you can talk about that,
*  but I can't concentrate. Yeah, I can get it. I have these. When did you go to the sex doll factory?
*  Like last month. Oh, really? Yeah. Okay. The pieces in, it's coming out soon. Actually, it's in
*  spectator has a, it was, it's like the oldest magazine in the UK and they are, they launched
*  a United States version. And so they have one and then the, the next column I wrote for them is
*  about the, it's like that called the uncanny valley of the dolls. Did they show you any new,
*  anything new they're working on? I mean, it's all the same and it seems pretty, they not, you know,
*  they have like the self lubricating ones coming and like the ones that heat up and it's more of
*  the technology that they're trying to make more interactive. So it's the actual AI that's really
*  interesting. And then I think they want to move towards like getting cameras in the eyes.
*  And it was so funny because the AI guys are so funny guys who deal with that. They're just a
*  different breed. And he was like, I was on a jury and I was thinking this would be the perfect place
*  to have a sex doll with a camera in the eyes. That's your thought. Like, if only there's a sex doll
*  in the corner with that, with the cameras in the eyes. I think of a quick question. I wonder like,
*  is there any women that are working there? Is it all guys? No, no, no. And that's what was so
*  interesting is that, and I talk about this in the piece, I'm like, there's my perception,
*  which is that I'm going to this huge warehouse and it's like all these kinds of sketchy dudes
*  and it's like a dystopian kind of creep show. And then I get there and it's mostly just artists
*  and women and men and people who are, you know, like character design and they're truly artists
*  you walk in and it looks like a fucking tattoo parlor. And so you're, other than like the
*  different sets of lips and nipples on the wall, you would think you were walking into like a tattoo
*  parlor. So it's so chill. And then, and yeah, you kind of go in and out of it being like that when
*  you hear the stories of the people who lost their wife or somebody who had acne, I see that how this
*  is useful. And, and maybe like people just want to hold, like you said, they want to hold something.
*  It's incremental steps to a dissolving of reality. Reality is going to be either virtual or you're
*  going to have a combination of virtual and augmented and you're going to probably be overtaken by
*  robots. I think that fucking Unibomber guy was right. Yeah. Ted Kaczynski, you know, that guy
*  he did a bunch of acid, they fucking cooked his brain. What did he say? Well, he thought that
*  technology was going to take over the human race. That's why he was killing all those people that
*  were involved in technology. I have a theory that with the escalation of our like climate,
*  you know, whatever that, and I heard this panel back in 2000, it was like, I remember being,
*  it was all about the nature of the soul and is the soul essentially and human consciousness
*  essentially going to jump elements from carbon to silicon in order to survive the wasteland that
*  we're going to leave behind. Yeah, there's something going to happen. I think there's a new form of life
*  that's going to take place. Is that the singularity? And I think Trump was on extra Adderall when he's like,
*  I know what to do. I'm going to buy Greenland. I think he was onto something. I think that was like
*  probably the best fucking idea that he ever had. I wish people got more excited about it because
*  he came up with it and like it was dismissed and it was in and out of the news cycle in like four
*  or five days. Greenland was like, fuck you. He's like, all right. But I mean, I didn't know you could
*  buy a Greenland, but if you could, and that was like America, Northeast, like where is Greenland
*  on the map? Northwest, Northeast, way Northeast, right? Yeah. So if he was like, that's America,
*  Northeast, just like Alaska and Hawaii, we got a new one. That's a fucking great idea.
*  Cause when shit gets really warm and people start moving there and like guys, this is the shit.
*  Yeah. It's fucking 78 degrees year round. Nice and green.
*  We got a couple extra polar bears around here. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, you can defend it. It's not,
*  I mean, how big is Greenland? How huge? Big enough for all of us. Could it be American Northeast?
*  Really? Really? Let's perspective. Put them on the screen. The size of Greenland in
*  the U S. Yeah. What do you think? Oh, nevermind. I feel like it's, I didn't think it was that big.
*  Wait, nevermind. No, no, but I didn't think it was that big. Continental U S or we including Alaska?
*  Continental. Cause Alaska makes us big. Alaska's enormous. Alaska's enormous,
*  but nobody lives there. Like three people live in Alaska. Sorry, Alaska. We love you.
*  Yeah, I thought it was way bigger. Alaska's, they are barely Americans. They're awesome. Don't get
*  me wrong. I mean, they live in paradise. That's like true size is what it says. But
*  Holy shit. It's huge. Yeah, I know. But when you drop it there, it fits right in the middle. So
*  that's bigger than Texas. Yeah, dude. Texas could fit everyone in America.
*  Wow. Look at the size of it up there. Yeah. Texas is huge. People don't realize how big Australia is.
*  Australia is pretty big. It's as big as the contiguous United States,
*  but there's only as many people as less, less than as many people as Los Angeles.
*  And look at this one. Right. Yeah, that's crazy. Look at the perspective. Oh shit.
*  Why does it look, isn't that crazy? When you see the actual position, it looks way bigger than the
*  United States, but then when you, oh, that's because of like taking a round thing and flattening it out.
*  That's so stupid. I don't know why they do that. This is why the flatter there's like, yeah,
*  told you, does it work man? The ice wall. You know, the really, gave all the evidence,
*  the really crazy thing is the, oh, okay. That's the really crazy thing is how many things fit in
*  Africa. Everything fits in Africa. Almost every continent, almost every country in the world.
*  No, but if you look at like how many countries fit inside of Africa, because you see Africa,
*  you go, oh yeah, there's South America. There's Africa. Okay. They're about the same. Yeah. It
*  looks the same. But then when you see like superimposed all of the United States,
*  Europe, Asia, China, like fucking everything. Look, that's Africa. Look at all that shit.
*  Whoa. I didn't realize that. I know it's nuts. India fits in there. Everything fits in there. Oh
*  my God. This is like the whole France. Look at that. Spain. Wow. I didn't realize that Switzerland.
*  Switzerland's so tiny. Why is Switzerland even on there? Because they make good knives.
*  They make army knives. Wow. I didn't realize that. Look at China. China. China. It's crazy
*  how big Africa is. I've never been. I want to go. Have you been to India? No. Why are you scared of
*  malaria? Can't you get it? Because it kills people. Kills more people than anybody. My dad got malaria
*  when he was there. He's alive though. Is he? Yeah. Are you sure? My friend Justin, who he runs fight
*  for the forgotten charity, building wells for the Pygmies. He's gotten it three times. Oh yeah.
*  Three times. Malaria? Yeah. Did he have to take the pills that made him crazy? He took the pills
*  and it made him crazy for sure. But he got malaria. And then if he gets really sick,
*  he can get malaria again. It'll kick back in. It's like dormant in his system. Yeah. They've come a
*  long way though, because the old school pills made you like. Crazy. Yeah. The ones the soldiers
*  had to take, they were all like psychotic. Dave Foley from News Radio. I had to keep him from
*  assaulting a reporter once. He was drunk on malaria. He was drunk and needs to take malaria
*  medication. Oh no. Yeah. And he took the reporter's microphone or he took his tape recorder and shoved
*  it in his drink. And I was like, dang. Do you still act? No. Never? No. No. No. No. You just don't.
*  Last time I acted was in a Kevin James movie. Oh okay. Just because he's a buddy of mine.
*  You just don't want to do it? No. No desire. I guess I have been to Africa because Egypt.
*  Yeah. Egypt's Africa. I really want to go to Egypt. Yeah. I've been. That's where I got this ring.
*  Oh. It was amazing. Did you get it from a tomb? Is that haunted? No. It was one of my favorite trips.
*  That same science museum had this insane exhibit on Two Ton Common. I went twice. Yeah. I'm obsessed.
*  Fucking incredible. I was really obsessed with Egypt from a very young age. Just unnaturally.
*  Do you believe in past lives? How do you feel about this? I don't not believe. That's how I feel.
*  Yeah. This is what I think. You know how people are, you know, like some people have arachnophobia,
*  this unusual fear of spiders. I think that probably comes from someone in your ancestry
*  getting bitten by a spider. Oh, that's interesting. Like people have instincts, right? Animals have,
*  like Marshall, okay? Marshall has been my dog. He's pretty lovable. He's the best. He doesn't seem
*  too fierce. He's not fierce at all. He's a sweetheart. But he has instincts, right? Like he
*  lifts up his leg and pees on things. Right. He smells where other dogs have peed and he pees there
*  too. I didn't teach him how to do that. No. When he was a puppy, but when I got him when he was six
*  weeks old, he would just pee all over the place. Anytime he had to pee, he would squat down and pee.
*  But then as he got older, he has instincts. Like there's some inherent memory in his genes.
*  I want to know how they decide where to poop. If I find out one thing before I die, like if I get to
*  choose one thing, I'm like, how does my dog make this decision? I mean, I know it's instinct, but
*  what? Someone told me they face a certain way. That's not true. I've kept track.
*  I have a whole list of every direction Hope is pooping in. Well, when I run with Marshall,
*  he generally poops in the same area, like within like a hundred yards. Like wherever we run,
*  like there's this area that we come down off of this hill. It's like, this is a good spot to take
*  a shit. Yeah. And then he drops a log right there. I just want to know, is it like territorial? Is
*  there some dog that has some food that she's like outfooding where she's like, my food's better.
*  There's definitely some sort of territorial thing to it because they'll roll and shit too.
*  My dog doesn't. She's not, she won't even step in it. She's like very prissy about that stuff.
*  Marshall has rolled and other dogs shit. She doesn't want to eat it. She's not one of those
*  dogs at all. She's like, she's, she's very particular and she always has to go to the edge
*  of the, it's weird. She always goes to the edge of the curb, like, or the, you know,
*  in between the sidewalk and whatever it's called. But she, it's not the same spot every time.
*  And she's very picky. It's like, okay, fucking pick a spot. I want to know. And my whole thing
*  about past lives is I'm like, well, until you can tell me they definitively aren't true,
*  I'm going to believe they are. I think it's just more interesting.
*  What I was going to get at is that there's a memory that gets passed down through your genes.
*  And I think that...
*  So I was an Egyptian.
*  Well, there's probably some weird fucking memory that all of us have from all the different
*  ancestors that we share DNA with. It only makes sense.
*  Isn't it funny how everyone always thinks they're going to be like the king or the queen?
*  Of course.
*  And it's like, no.
*  You were sucking dick for homemade wine.
*  I was a fucking starving slave for like 10,000 generations. I know it.
*  I was a nobleman.
*  No, you weren't.
*  I ruled across a great land.
*  That's like, guys, I wrote about, I write a lot about when I was a playboy, I wrote about,
*  like, I had this experience where I was like the second wife. I wasn't a wife,
*  but I was a second in an open marriage. And all the guys think they're going to be that guy.
*  And it's like, I was reading this book and I forgot which book it was or something. And it said,
*  actually that men who had multiple wives and women had to start like not hogging all the women
*  because it was causing so much strife within the tribes.
*  So many problems.
*  Jordan Peterson talks about that too. That's one of the problems with incels
*  is that there's the men, like the alpha men, like the Jason Momoa's of the world,
*  if they wanted to. They could have a gang of women and then other guys be like, hey,
*  what about me?
*  But I kind of, honestly, I kind of liked the situation. The guy was so alpha and it almost
*  took two women to like balance them out. And from my perspective, I was like, I want a wife.
*  Me as a wife would want a wife too. I would want someone else to like,
*  it was so like, we did the gardening and like Sharon-
*  How long did this work out for?
*  It didn't work out for that long. Like a couple months.
*  A couple weeks?
*  No, no, it was a while.
*  Did you see the King of Thailand like formally got rid of his concubine? What did he call him?
*  Royal mistress.
*  Royal mistress. Yeah, not a concubine would be a whore.
*  A little older.
*  Yes.
*  A little old school.
*  Old school?
*  About the same thing I think, I'm not sure.
*  Well, he had an official royal mistress that was actually like, she had rank in the military.
*  Oh.
*  Yeah. And she apparently disrespected the queen. So you had to shut her down.
*  And he had to strip her of her power.
*  Oh.
*  And I was reading this.
*  I thought you were going somewhere else with that.
*  Strip her down.
*  Yeah. I was like-
*  Piss on her.
*  What's happening?
*  When you go to Thailand, you cannot talk shit ever. There it is. There's the freaking,
*  I don't know how to say his name.
*  Oh my God.
*  Vageralongkorn.
*  Vagel-
*  Comes no responsibility at all.
*  Well, so he has this-
*  Was that his wife?
*  Let me see the, what is the article? The king of Thailand, how do you say that?
*  Per-emp-tor-ly? I've never seen that word ever. Have you ever seen that word? You're a writer.
*  No, I don't.
*  Per-emp-tor-ly?
*  Per-emp-tor-ly?
*  Per-emp-tor-ly? Is that-
*  Dismisses his official mistress.
*  I'm not familiar with that.
*  Yeah. She was talking shit about the wife. She disrespected the wife.
*  Wow.
*  He's like, kick rocks, bitch.
*  What does it mean?
*  I don't know. Look at her name. Oh boy.
*  Now I have to, I'm going to be, I look up every word I don't know though, so now-
*  Ingratitude, misbehavior, and disloyalty. These were among the failings of, try saying her name.
*  S-I-N-E-E-N-A-T-C-C-N-E-AT. And here's the big one. W-O-N-G-V-A-G-I-R-A-P-A-K-D-I.
*  Wow.
*  I don't even want to try that one.
*  Long, but cheap.
*  Detailed in a scathing royal statement on October 21st, apparently the mistress
*  wanted to elevate herself to the same state as the queen.
*  Of course.
*  Yeah.
*  Number two always wants to be number one.
*  That was ultimately why it didn't work out.
*  Really? You wanted to be number one?
*  I didn't want to be number one because that has a lot more responsibility and I'm not really that
*  type A, but I didn't feel like, I felt like everyone's needs were being, I was like,
*  hey, are you okay? Are you okay? And no one was like, hey, is Bridget okay?
*  So I felt like my needs were the ones that got-
*  Pushed aside.
*  Pushed aside. Yeah.
*  Well, you can call that bitch and show you and her.
*  We can start a little meeting.
*  You and that whatever name is-
*  No, it was fine. It was fine. It was really just one of those things. I'm such a writer and so
*  curious.
*  She was just made that position in July. It was the first time it was done in over a century.
*  So she lost it very quickly.
*  That's really fast. She basically was like, yo, I want to be number one after like a month.
*  All right. That's a little entitled.
*  She gave it a shot.
*  Calm down.
*  What do you think then?
*  Prostate herself before the king and queen, former flight attendant who he married in May.
*  Oh, the queen's a former flight attendant.
*  Do you know that in my friend's a flight attendant and she was telling me because they
*  don't have unions and all my friends from around the world are always like, why are all the old
*  ladies up in first class? Because over in all the Asian airlines, they're pretty much done at age 30.
*  My friend works at United. She's like, you're done at 30 if you're
*  because it's a young people. It's like they want young, good looking women.
*  So they fire you?
*  I mean, they don't have unions.
*  In Asia. But they have them in America, right?
*  Yeah. We have them. Oh yeah. Yeah. That's why all the old ladies are in first class.
*  Why are these old ladies up there?
*  Like all my friends from around the world are like, I don't understand. That's where
*  the hottest people should be.
*  Well, that used to be what flight attendants were. They were almost like cocktail waitresses
*  and like bottle service.
*  It's a hard job. My best friend, I mean, their schedule is insane. I could never do it. And
*  just the way they get treated, their punching bags and their first responders. Most people
*  don't understand that they're all so well trained and they're the ones that if shit goes down,
*  they're the first responders.
*  And then they have to call out and hope a doctor's on the plane.
*  It's crazy. I mean, the stuff she's told me where she's like had to, you know, two old
*  ladies fighting over, she's like, ladies, I'm embarrassed for you. Like this is it.
*  It's also like they're a waitress who tells you what to do.
*  Yeah.
*  They're waitresses that tells you how to sit down and buckle yourself up.
*  Was that your stand up? That's in your bit where you're talking, that's hilarious.
*  I was laughing so hard because I remember getting so high and actually,
*  I hated airports when I was high. I was always like, okay, because I get anxious around security.
*  I'm the girl that could never be a drug mule. I look guilty. I look guilty if I didn't do anything.
*  I get randomly searched every time I fly. Every time.
*  You look sketchy.
*  I look sketchy. And he's the eyebrows. That's what a homeless guy told me.
*  What did you say?
*  He said my eyebrows made me look like trouble.
*  What? A homeless guy told you that? You have normal eyebrows. I don't know what the fuck he's
*  talking about. It doesn't make any sense.
*  Anyway, maybe that's why I get flagged.
*  That's why he's homeless. His shit judgment. That's why he's homeless.
*  I don't know.
*  He's the one he's calling. Jamie, you're like extra Columbus today, man.
*  Yeah, he's a home.
*  You got a Columbus shirt. You got a sea hat.
*  It's a Cleveland hat.
*  Oh, sorry.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, you're extra Ohio today.
*  Yes.
*  You're doubling down.
*  Oh, we're at Cleveland this weekend.
*  Holla, Saturday night. See you there, bitches.
*  That'll be fun.
*  Yeah.
*  That's where everybody's going.
*  I love Cleveland. Why?
*  Because now all the people can't afford to live in California, so a couple of my friends have
*  moved to Ohio, actually. They're all going back. And also where Texas is a big one. Idaho, I heard,
*  is the secret.
*  Texas is filling up, though. Don't go to Austin.
*  Idaho is the next secret one.
*  Boise?
*  They're going to be mad I told the secret.
*  I've told already.
*  Yeah.
*  Boise's pretty fucking dope.
*  Yeah. So people are leaving because it's so the cost of living here is insane.
*  The cost of living is insane and a fault line that hasn't moved in 500 years just shifted yesterday.
*  The lady that I follow on Twitter who's a seismologist debunked that it's not as big of a worry.
*  That bitch is going to be the first one to die.
*  They're just going to open up under her feet and swallow her up like a big mouth.
*  We were doing a joke about that on the dumpster fire video. I was like, you know,
*  the protesters who super glue their hand. I'm like, what have you did? They super glue their
*  hand to the fucking pavement.
*  For what?
*  For all those crazy climate protests.
*  What are you talking about? I have no knowledge of this.
*  You're saying it like I know.
*  I mean, I thought everyone saw these insane extinction rebellion videos.
*  What are they doing?
*  Can you Google this? They're Google, um, protester.
*  Oh my God. What is this crazy person doing?
*  They super glue their hands, but they all do it.
*  Look at her name. Farhana. Oh God damn it. These pop ups.
*  There's so many more. There was one girl. So somebody tweeted about how his favorite image
*  was a girl doing it and then not realizing that she had taken her backpack off yet.
*  So you see her like super glue her hand and then she goes,
*  and I'm like, why are you doing this? I don't understand what this is.
*  She super glued herself to the shell headquarters, the concrete outside of shell.
*  Can you imagine if you do that and then there's an earthquake and then you're just hanging by
*  your super glued hand over the crack.
*  But can you imagine when you want to get your hand back?
*  Super glued. Do not pull me.
*  Oh my God. Fuck you. They're glued on. Do not try to move. They have little signs.
*  How do they get their fucking glue off? Look at her. I don't know.
*  That's what I was wondering. Why are they doing this?
*  Fucking morons. Cause they're morons. It just pisses everyone off.
*  Well, you see that guy who had the dead be on the cover of his book, right?
*  Dead be on the cover of his book. He was like, he wrote that book and it's all about
*  the climate and I forgot. Yeah. I just remember the cover cause I was like, really a dead be.
*  Who was that again? That's dramatic.
*  But he scared the fuck out of me. Yeah. Yeah. Have you seen this be?
*  Look at that fucker. No. What is that? What kind of weird shit do you get?
*  Well, that was actually Maynard from tools sent me that from his fucking vineyard.
*  Oh, this one hornet wasps. Yeah. They kill tarantulas and lay their eggs inside of them.
*  Yeah. One time.
*  What's the size of that fucker? It's a goddamn bird.
*  Yeah. No, I would be. He was telling me how gross they are and how huge they are.
*  Then he fucking sent me one. I was like, all right.
*  Yeah. No. He's like, what's your address? I'm like, what?
*  This fucking comes in the mail. Yeah. You must get some weird stuff.
*  Yeah. I get some weird stuff. Yeah. I see all the pictures of the tattoos people get of you.
*  Yeah. That's the weirdest thing. There's probably hundreds of tattoos of my face on people's bodies.
*  Does that? What does that make you feel? Tell me how that makes you feel.
*  Being a therapist. Can we do this through FaceTime?
*  Being me feels real weird. You would think, oh, you're used to it. Uh-uh. I'm not used to it at all.
*  Being me is fucking strange. People that love me, people that hate me, all of it's weird.
*  All of it's weird. It's strange. All the attention. Every time people call my name,
*  like I'm about to go on stage and people cheer, I'm like, really?
*  Yeah. Yeah. It all feels strange.
*  Yeah. It never feels real. When did you start this?
*  Podcast? Yeah. 10 years ago.
*  10 years ago? In December.
*  Oh, wow. This December 24th, it'll be 10 years.
*  Oh, that's amazing. Yeah.
*  And what have you learned the most from it over the year? Did you have any, why did you start it?
*  Just for goof. Me and Brian Redband did it for fun because we used to do this thing we would
*  do in the green rooms where we would, it was on a thing called Justin TV, Justin.TV, and we would
*  flip up this laptop and we'd talk to people in the green room of like comedy clubs, just for fun.
*  Okay. And then one day I was like,
*  yeah, let's do it at my house. So he came over to my house and we did it and we were like,
*  people would ask questions. They were like fucking literally like 10 people online or a hundred
*  people. Yeah, that was like pre, I mean, definitely podcast.
*  We were doing that. There was some podcasts back then. There was like Adam from MTV. What is his
*  name again? Jamie? The guy, Adam Curry. Adam Curry was probably the first. And I think he actually
*  invented the name podcast. And then Corolla in 2000, what year is this?
*  Oh my gosh. This is 12 years ago.
*  This is the green room. Ah, Irvine improv. Yeah.
*  Oh my God. 12 years ago.
*  That is crazy. So this is what we used to do. We would be in the green room.
*  Look at little Red Band. In between shows.
*  Well, that was when Red Band had lost a ton of weight. Red Band broke up with his girlfriend
*  and decided to get sexy. I don't know. It's hard to tell. Just kill this. I don't want to see myself
*  12. Look at that beautiful beard though. So anyway, we decided to do these videos,
*  just talking to people online. And then the next thing you know, we're like,
*  let's do it next week. So we did it next week. Let's do it again. And then Brian was like,
*  people are asking us to put this on iTunes. Like, okay, let's put it on iTunes. So we started
*  putting them on iTunes. All right, let's do it every week. Let's do it every week. And then
*  it just by complete, just sort of natural occurrences by natural circumstances, it just
*  snowballed. And then other guys started doing it. And then, you know, so many comics.
*  How did it get to like this point?
*  That's what I'm saying. I don't know. I think this thing has a life of its own. I think this thing,
*  like this tarantula hawk sticks a fucking needle in that tarantula's body and impregnates it with
*  eggs. Technology impregnated me. It gave me this idea to do this. It forced me and it found what
*  I'm good at. And what I'm good at is talking to people and I'm curious. So like, if you can
*  give me a place where I can sit down for three hours and ask a guy like Sean Carroll, explain to
*  me astrophysics. Explain to me quantum mechanics. Explain to me this. How do vaccines work? How does
*  this work? How does that work? You know, what is a propulsion? What makes the sun stay hot? Like,
*  why does that work? How does the interworking of a cell phone, what is 5G? Is that bad for you? Is
*  that giving you cancer? You know, what all these, I've always been a person who asks a lot of
*  questions and likes talking to people. Yeah. And you don't seem to be too, I feel very similar to
*  you in this respect is that I'm not trying to like get any, you know, just have someone on and talk
*  to them to be like, I got you. No, that's the last thing I want to do. I just want to hear people's
*  perspective and their point of view and learn things. I mean, I laugh when I think of, when
*  you're naming all these people and I'm like, and then you have this moron. No, you're fun.
*  Joke. We tweeted away into the center of the culture war. I feel like I have gym teacher mouth
*  right now. What does that mean? I mean, white stuff in the like when you talk, you know, while
*  I call, I don't know, I always call it gym teacher mouth. No, you're fine. Okay. No worries at all.
*  I'm going to get self-conscious. Don't. Yeah. I mean, you know, gym teachers always had that.
*  I never noticed until now. Do you notice she said I know, I know exactly what you're saying.
*  I'm a basketball coach. We used to laugh as a team. Like it would just fly around and hit people
*  and shit. I feel like this is relatable. Joey Diaz gets that all the time. Like a little white
*  piece like on his lips. And you're like, do I tell him? Let him talk. No, tell him. Oh, not Joey. No,
*  no, no. Let him talk. I don't want him to be self-conscious. Yeah. I'd rather just stare at
*  the white thing on his lips. No, I think it's cool though that you've had in this time when there's
*  everybody is like these political abstractions or just two dimensional abstractions. You seem
*  to have actually like hit that zeitgeist of desire because they're like, Oh, everything,
*  everyone has a short attention span. I'm like, well, people are listening to Joe for like fucking
*  25 hours a day. I don't think people have short attention spans. I think that people can have
*  short attention spans. Like you can be distracted by a music video that constantly switches scenes
*  over and over and over again. But some people like to sit down and watch conversation. And like me,
*  I don't get bored having long conversations. I enjoy them. And I think if you're not bored
*  while you're having a long conversation, interesting conversation, the people that are
*  listening won't get bored either. But if you're bored, they'll get bored. So you have to be
*  genuinely interested. That's why the beautiful thing about having a podcast where there's no
*  one that's telling me, Hey, you have to have this person on or this guy's got a movie coming out.
*  I want you to have this person on and we're going to have this person on because she has an album
*  out. There's none of that. So if I have someone on like, Hey, Gary Clark Jr. has got a new album.
*  I love that guy. Let's bring him in. It's always someone who I genuinely think is cool. Yeah.
*  So I have real interest in talking to them. And you get to just, I mean, it's just so funny how
*  many, I was laughing because I'm like, I think a lot of my exes listen to you. So this very moment
*  right now is like sweetest revenge of all. It must be, you have, I think you had a joke about that
*  where you're like, I'm sorry to the ladies who had to come because their boyfriends made them.
*  I went to your set and it was like, it was literally like a, what do they call it? Like
*  casting, you know, central casting of like Joe Rogan fans. I was the only one in the audience
*  who didn't have a tattoo. I'm 100% sure of that. Maybe not a hundred. Not a hundred. I went and
*  bet all your chips. Yeah. It doesn't make any sense to me either. I'm the only person who didn't have
*  a Joe Rogan tattoo. And they just hold up your face at you. Oh my God. It's on their wrists.
*  They're going to slice it after I quit. Are you going to move? Are you staying in Cali? I don't
*  know. I am preparing for this thing to fall apart though. Fucking Palisades was on fire yesterday.
*  When the Palisades is on fire, that shit's rough. That's good. I've never like one of the things we
*  were thinking about, like, Hey, I'm fucking all these fires over here in the valley. Maybe we
*  should move to the Palisades. No, the Palisades catch on fire. I heard it was our son. Did you
*  hear that? I think I read that. I mean, I could be completely wrong. Let's not do any research at
*  all. Don't even Google it. Spread that rumor. I heard it was incels that were mad at Dan
*  Bilzerian's house. It was a joker premiere in someone's private home. That's what it was.
*  Yeah. No, I don't, I, I'm not sure. I go back and forth because I, that's the thing. I love it here.
*  I mean, you know what? I like Colorado. Yeah. I like Colorado a lot. It's a healthiest state.
*  Is it really? I think it's the most fit state. Again, I can be completely making this up. Fuck
*  it. Let's run with it. Makes sense. I mean, you go to Boulder. Yeah. Boulder, everybody's out there
*  jogging, hiking. I was just an Aspen. Fuck it's gorgeous there. Oh my God. Rich people know
*  what's up. Yeah, they're not stupid. They're rich. No, they know it's up. That's the place to go.
*  Have you seen the prices for houses in Aspen? Yeah. It's like they are trying to keep the riffraff out.
*  Oh yeah. I mean, and you have to, when you do that dodgy fly in, I love it. I love it. It is dodgy.
*  I know a dude whose friends died in a plane. Flying into Aspen. Yeah. Private Jack slammed
*  into the mountain. Yeah. You're flying right into the, it's snow out. It was a white out. Terrifying.
*  And they fucked up. Hit the mountain. Couldn't pull up in time. I was like, I never been to Cabo
*  until recently. And I was like, rich people know what's up. Yeah. They know what's up. Cabo's a
*  wreck though. Is it? It's everyone's so drunk. Oh. It's so ridiculous. I was in the rich people part.
*  Oh, there you go. I was like off where like Jennifer Aniston rents our house. Yeah. By the
*  golf courses. He owns a fat condo out there in Cabo. They go there all the time. It's special and
*  magical. There were lots of whales. It is beautiful. It's gorgeous. Yeah. Mexico's fucking amazing. And
*  the food. Did you see what's going on right now in Sinaloa? The Sinaloa cartels and what part of it?
*  Coolie con? I forget what part of Mexico. I've just been seeing videos on Instagram going around.
*  How do you keep track of all this shit? I don't know. I don't know. Like in between all of these
*  interviews and all the stuff you do and working out and hunting elk for dinner. Well, this is all
*  over the news though. And my friend Ed Calderon, who's been on the podcast before, he actually,
*  he runs like the Mexican anti-cartel. He's like one of those anti-cartel military guys. Oh, okay.
*  Okay. Yeah. And he explained a lot of like what's going on down there. What's going on?
*  Well, they arrested El Chapo's son. Oh, I did see that in the news. There was a gun fight.
*  Many parts of Mexico, the government has surrendered in fight against cartels. It's nuts. It's very bad.
*  It's lawless. Yeah. Well, the cartels have unlimited amounts of money because they're selling drugs to
*  white people. Yeah. White people need to stop doing drugs. White people here in America are buying all
*  the cartels, cocaine and meth. Yeah. If you care about Mexico, stop doing drugs. Stop it. That's
*  like all the hippies. I always laugh hysterically when they're like super gluing themselves and
*  getting all high. I'm like, do you have any idea? I've worked on these farms. I see what they do to
*  the environment. You're not exactly helping the environment with your weed habit. No offense to
*  all the weed smokers. I love you. Well, any large scale agriculture is devastating to the environment.
*  It's so sad what's happening with big weed up there. Because I worked over the- I can't believe
*  you call it big weed. It is big weed. It is. You don't think it is? I'm sure it is, but that
*  expression big weed is so hilarious. Weed is an industry now. It is. I worked up in the farms for
*  the transition, so I worked from when it was mom and pop just places. Now they're paving over some
*  of the most fertile soil in freaking Oregon or California so they can put these huge domes. They
*  give off all those lights so they can build- it's fucked up. It's fucked. It's big weed.
*  Anytime you have large scale agriculture, animals and the environment get fucked over. This is
*  something that vegans hate hearing this. But if you're buying grain, you're buying grain most
*  likely from large scale agriculture and that shit is fucking terrible for animals. Terrible for the
*  environment. Terrible for- you're not supposed to have thousands of acres of all one thing.
*  You're not supposed to have that. That's not normal. You can't have thousands of acres of
*  corn. That's just not normal. I always used to laugh because it's such the- they would rewash
*  the little plastic ziplock baggies at the farm and they'd be like, we're going to recycle these.
*  And there would be huge entire piles of just deer netting that you use to keep the colas up.
*  Just piles of plastic. I'm like, okay guys. I'm not sure. They use pesticides? Not at the place
*  where I was. That's good. But it was a lot of the teas they make to boost these things. Holy shit.
*  I mean, it's crazy. What's the teas? What do you mean? It's like they use all these different
*  things like fertilizers and different- and they make these huge batches of teas that they use to
*  fertilize. Tea? Like tea? Lipton tea? That's what they call it. It's not tea. It's like they just
*  call it tea and it's like a booster for the- Just nutrients essentially for the plants. Yeah.
*  And it boosts the THC? Yeah. And it boosts just the- this is all like outdoor. It's so interesting
*  that in the 1990s when I first came here, you had to have a license. I think it was like 94 or 95.
*  It became legal and I didn't start smoking until 98. What became legal? Legal medically. Oh, okay.
*  Is that long ago? Yeah. I think it was- I want to say it was 95. What year was marijuana medically
*  legal? I think it's- James is a motherfucker with that Google. He Googles better than any man that's
*  ever lived. I think it's 94. I think 94 they passed the medical marijuana laws. 96. 96. So I started
*  smoking in 98. I came here in 94. I started smoking in 98 and back then it was still sketchy. You
*  smoked for the first time in 98? No, I smoked a handful of times when I was young. Okay.
*  But between the time I was like 14 and 30, I might have smoked pot. I don't think- So you didn't
*  really start smoking until you were 30? Yeah. Oh, wow. I didn't even think it was 10 times. How do
*  you feel in your sober October? What are the biggest differences that you notice or do you
*  notice any? I feel great. Yeah. Yeah. The booze is what gets you. Booze slows you down. Definitely.
*  I feel way better without a couple of drinks, but I like a couple of drinks. I enjoy it. So it's like
*  the balancing act of- I wish I could have a couple of drinks. I don't see the point. I don't- You
*  want a bucket. You want a bucket of booze? Well, I just don't see the point. It's like decaf coffee.
*  You don't see the point of a couple of drinks? No, because I want to get- You're ready to go party.
*  Yeah. And I was saying this before we came out. I'm like, I wish I could just smoke weed because
*  I did that through- So for most of my 20s, I did everything to avoid having to get sober again,
*  and a lot of my 30s. And I definitely was trying to manage it. And there were years where I just
*  smoked weed and didn't drink. But what happens to me is that it'll be a gorgeous day like this,
*  and I'll be down in Venice, and I'll smoke some weed, and then maybe I'll get a little racy because
*  the weed is racy. And then I want to balance it out with that gorgeous looking heff from on the
*  waterfront. And next thing you know, I'm doing lines in the townhouse. That's where it goes
*  every time for me. Do you think that there's a well-oiled groove that's in your brain that once
*  you get some substances in there, like, woohoo, you know what to do here?
*  I wonder what it is because it's interesting because so many- This is why I love 12 Step,
*  because no one fucking wants to be there. And they're some of the funniest places ever. And
*  then I'll hear people come talk about 12 Step and how it doesn't work and blah, blah, blah. And I'm
*  like, it works for a lot of people. And every time I go, I get to listen to essentially some
*  fucked up story that turned into a miracle. Like some guy who was like, and then I had hookers,
*  and then I was jailed, and then now like, and you've been sober and you're like an upstanding.
*  Like these rooms are filled with people who would be menaces to society, myself included. I came out
*  of a blackout driving on the 405. Yeah, it was one of the hands down most terrifying moments of my
*  life. And I had been at Universal Studios, so I had driven all the way from Universal to the 405,
*  getting on the 10. You didn't even know how you got there. I had no recollection. Apparently,
*  I had been out with a bunch of people and I got scared when I was at the bar because there were
*  these guys following me around. I was with a bunch of like poker high rollers and I made alcoholism
*  look amazing. I did. You know what's crazy? But they were security guards. I didn't know this.
*  People love it when you can get off drugs. Like that's one addiction that people take very
*  seriously and they're happy for you when you get off of drugs or alcohol. But if you get off of
*  gambling, nobody gives a fuck. Yeah, no, no, no. Well, some people do. I mean, it's funny because
*  I've had four, I've helped four people quit smoking weed in the past year and it is gnarly.
*  And part of the problem, I know you, I know you give me this. Skeptical hippo face. I know, I know,
*  I know. You don't want to hear it. But these are people who were really addicted to it and they
*  couldn't stop. Physically or mentally? Well, I think the physical part you get over. It's just that
*  they wanted to be. It's insidious because you get laughed at. They wanted that fuzzy distance? Yeah,
*  the fuzzy distance. And it's easy. And it's like for me, what I noticed was that it was like this
*  weed seal, glass kind of ceiling made of smoke. And once I stopped quit smoking weed, I was
*  suicidally depressed for two years, like two years. Two years? I smoked for 20 years in my
*  developmental teenage years. I don't think I had any. It took you two years to get. I mean,
*  it's an oil. I think it gets in your fat. Well, I hear that before I do. I don't think there's any
*  real logic to that. No, I don't think there's any science. No. I just know from my experience that
*  it took me a while to like get back online. Got it. And I felt like I was having a hard time kind of
*  boosting up to like where I naturally like a happy, I wake up and I'm like, try a little
*  bit. I mean, I'm not a lot, but for the two first years I got sober, it was gnarly. It was ugly.
*  I think there's different people. I mean, I'm just joking around, but I'm not being addicted. I think
*  there's people that get addicted to a lot of things. Well, it's been what's the problem is that
*  people don't take it seriously. So they'll be like, oh yeah, that's not a real addiction.
*  Because it doesn't kill anybody. So when someone says that I'm addicted to potty, like, ah, get over
*  it. But it's like you won't do, but so you don't do anything. You know, I'm like, yeah, you won't
*  do anything. You won't kill anybody. You just won't do anything. And I think from my experience,
*  the clarity that I got at the is kind of priceless. I mean, I used to write this stuff and think that
*  I was just so funny or so insightful. And it was like, what the fuck was that? That's the most
*  embarrassing thing when you write something high and think it's good. You should read my journals.
*  I'm going to come back and read my journals that I wrote when I was high and thought I was so
*  insightful. And you can tell I'm just high and drunk. You're like writing thinking that I'm being
*  like so insightful. But occasionally you'll get gems. Yeah. Occasionally marijuana will let a
*  little fucking air through and you're like, oh, what is this? I found I miss it. I was saying that
*  the addict in me, it's the thing I love the most. I've always loved it the most. And the addict in
*  me, I'm like, I'm worried I'm going to like give myself cancers so that I need to see that subconsciously.
*  And then when I got sober, I did get cancer. I got Basel cell. Did you really? Yeah. But
*  Basel cell like is I was like, I guess I need to smoke weed now. My friend's like, is Basel cell
*  Bridget? Like it's not real cancer. What is Basel cell? It's, I don't know. It's like the skin cancer,
*  it's skin cancer, but it's like the least I have a scar here. It's like the least, it's not, yeah,
*  it's kind of a joke. I mean, maybe, maybe, I don't know. Maybe, maybe I'll Google this and find out
*  until it's like millions of people, but it was, my doctor made practically a joke of it. It's kind
*  of like the beta aurora of skin cancer. It's like, it wants a lot of attention, but it's,
*  I don't know if he became president. But it's completely ineffective. That guy's adorable.
*  No, he's so- His name is so close to beta too. I know, Beto. And he is. Yeah, I know. I know.
*  Do you think that he's just like using his, his like father-in-law's money?
*  Um, well, he definitely is doing that, right?
*  Is that- Isn't he? I don't know. I have no evidence.
*  Why does he think he's a crazy guy who thinks he can be president?
*  I'm starting rumors on JoeRogan.com. Let's keep starting rumors.
*  I think he started the fire in the palisades.
*  He probably gave me cancer too. He gave me skin cancer.
*  Yeah, he's the one who made you drink. Yeah. He provided the lines of the condo.
*  I do. I do. Sometimes like I watch your podcast and it's like, fuck it. I wish I could just go
*  drink whiskey with the boys like I used to and like go travel the world. I was in Sri Lanka
*  partying and it was in- Did you ever have a good night party in the world?
*  All the time. Yeah. Okay. And you had a good night where it didn't go off the rails?
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe you're not an alcoholic.
*  No. I do a whole standup routine about how when I quit drinking, my family gave me like a reverse
*  intervention because my family's also, they're so, there's a little cute aunt.
*  It's like an Irish Catholic huge family. It's just part of the culture.
*  And they were like, we're worried about you. You're not drinking enough.
*  That's hilarious. What are you, pregnant?
*  What are you, sober? Yeah. What are you, sober? Oh,
*  what are you going to get vegan now, Bridge? You're going to start using condoms?
*  What are you going to do? Save the whales? You stop using plastic straws?
*  Yep. Yep. Yeah. You fucking libtards out there.
*  That's hilarious. Yeah. Yeah. I think there's people that can't do stuff.
*  I wish I could. I tried. I mean- But you seem to be having a good time.
*  It's a mirror. I'm still nuts. All the second like wife stuff happened in sobriety. That was
*  like a crazy time. That time in my, it wasn't like college. It was like, I was like 37 years old.
*  Seems like you had a little side track. No big deal.
*  I'm grateful. It's a miracle that I did make it to getting sober. When I look from 20 to 35,
*  I mean, even those years when I moved back when I was here at 19 in the valley, it was just a lot
*  of playing dominoes and doing blow late into the- Dominoes.
*  Oh yeah. All night with a bunch of D-list porn stars and a lawyer who dealt us all of our blow.
*  Oh, that's hilarious. Yeah. I mean, and from that to like
*  dating a really rich dude and being all over Europe and drinking Dom everywhere and being in
*  Saint Tropez. I've always joked. I've made it look amazing. And people are like, why'd you quit?
*  Why'd you quit, Bridget? And they want to hear some story. Like I killed someone in a drunk driving
*  accident, something that they can't- and I'm like, I was just dying inside. Like something in me knew
*  that I could do better. Like I knew- there's like a little voice that always knew. And part of it was
*  being in rehab at 19. Like it wasn't like I had evidence that- There's plenty of hints.
*  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I can't imagine me on Twitter in 2016 with alcohol and drugs. I'd be banned.
*  I'd be canceled and I'd be banned. You could just say you had a problem with substances and now
*  you're clean. You were sick. No, I would have been banned from Twitter for sure. So you start a new
*  account. A lot of people do that. I don't know. I'm grateful you do Sober October because it does
*  make me feel- it's like the one month that I can safely not watch your podcast and not be like
*  white-knuckling it. I'm enjoying it. It's not bothering me at all. I really have- I like a
*  glass of wine with meals. Yeah, I am. And steak. I miss that too. I never had one glass of that.
*  I like a cold beer on a hot day, but I'm not having a problem. I like it. You know, and I'm just working out a lot.
*  I think too, knowing there's an end makes it easier. It does, but one thing that I'm seeing is the way I
*  feel like when I do shows at night, like tonight I have two shows. Tomorrow I have two shows. And I
*  know I'm not going to be drinking either show. So I know when I wake up in the morning, I'm going to
*  feel good. And do you notice a difference in your- is there a difference in your shows? A little bit.
*  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I'm- I probably am more coherent. My timing's probably a little better.
*  I don't know, but then maybe I'm not as loose. But by the end of the month, like right now,
*  I'm the 20th. You know, it's the 22nd. It's all gravy. Do you think that your audience would turn
*  on you if you were ever like, I'm done. Yeah. No, it would be fine. No one gives a fuck what you do.
*  It's true. You could be sober or not. So as long as you- if you're funny, if you're doing well,
*  if like the people are coming to see you and you put in the work and they're laughing, they're
*  having a good time, you put on a good show, they're not going to be mad at you. Yeah. Bridget,
*  I gotta wrap this up. It's three o'clock. It's been amazing. We did it! We did it! We did it!
*  Thank you for having me. My pleasure. We'll do it again. It was so fun. For sure. Okay. Tell people
*  your Twitter handle. Oh, at Bridget Phetasy. You can find me- Spell that out. B-R-I-D-G-E-T-P-H-E-T-A-S-Y.
*  You can find my Walk-Ins Welcome podcast anywhere. And I have the weekly Dumpster Fire show on YouTube,
*  which is bananas. Yay! Thank you. My pleasure. Thanks for doing this. It was fun. Yeah. Bye,
*  everybody. Bye. That was so fun. Thank you.
