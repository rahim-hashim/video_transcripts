# Joe Rogan Experience #2260 - Lex Fridman
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [January 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E)
*  So, Jim, what was your question? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=0.0s)]
*  It was too lex, but it was really like, because I wouldn't know. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=16.16s)]
*  Hardcore science question. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=21.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=22.76s)]
*  Based on physics. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=23.76s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=24.76s)]
*  So, Jim, if you were in space and you maybe ejaculated, is it possible that the ejaculate [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=25.76s)]
*  would propel you backwards? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=32.56s)]
*  Like send you, you know, like is it propulsion? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  Is there enough power in there to propel you? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=35.96s)]
*  There's only one way to find out. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=39.0s)]
*  Depends on how long you hold it in for, right? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=41.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  If you didn't jerk off for like four months and then you had like the mother load. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  You need something to go one way so you go the other way. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=49.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=52.36s)]
*  And Lex had an answer, but I don't know. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=53.36s)]
*  What was the answer? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=54.839999999999996s)]
*  Well, he had a thought, I guess. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=55.839999999999996s)]
*  What if you blow out at the same time? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=57.199999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=59.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=61.879999999999995s)]
*  I think in space, the like the bio dynamics of the liquids is different. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=63.239999999999995s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=67.8s)]
*  I think there's, it's actually difficult to have sex in space and to get people pregnant [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=68.8s)]
*  in space. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=74.0s)]
*  Has anybody ever gotten pregnant on the space station? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=75.0s)]
*  Are they allowed to even have sex? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=76.75999999999999s)]
*  No, nobody has officially had sex in space. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=78.28s)]
*  Officially. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=81.84s)]
*  Officially, but unofficially, of course, people have tried. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=82.84s)]
*  I wonder if they have. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=84.72s)]
*  I mean, how monitored are they? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=86.08s)]
*  There is a Wikipedia page about sex in space and it's actually pretty detailed. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=87.88s)]
*  But it's Wikipedia so you know it's half bullshit. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=92.76s)]
*  There's citations. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=95.8s)]
*  I encourage people to look into it, read in detail. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=96.8s)]
*  I mean, it's a serious problem. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=101.2s)]
*  If you want to, you know, colonize space, you probably want to have a lot of sex and [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=102.72s)]
*  get pregnant and have kids. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=107.0s)]
*  Well, don't you think they'll develop some sort of gravity generating machines? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=108.84s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=113.44s)]
*  Like Jeff Bezos talks about this a lot. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=114.88s)]
*  You know, like how you create artificial gravity in space because for Jeff Bezos, the likely [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=116.88s)]
*  way to colonize space is to have space stations. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=123.6s)]
*  Elon is more focused on colonizing planets, Mars. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=126.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=130.24s)]
*  So both are obviously going to be necessary and you need to have gravity in order to get [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=131.24s)]
*  laid. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=136.76s)]
*  Bro, the first people that make that trip. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=137.76s)]
*  Yeah, Jamie was saying he wants to go. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=139.64s)]
*  I mean, I'm not that trip, but yeah, a trip. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=145.32s)]
*  You go eventually? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=147.96s)]
*  No, why not? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=148.96s)]
*  Oh, dude, why? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=149.96s)]
*  What if you die out there? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=150.96s)]
*  Okay, we're going to die. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=151.96s)]
*  Everybody dies. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=152.96s)]
*  Yeah, but you don't want to die that way, dude. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=153.96s)]
*  If you get to decide one way to die, that's not one of the worst ways. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=156.35999999999999s)]
*  Oh, it's the worst way. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=159.16s)]
*  You're going to die in space, running out of air. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=160.16s)]
*  You don't know how it's going to happen. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=162.68s)]
*  What about reentry? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=163.68s)]
*  You could get, yeah, you could just cook instantly. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=164.68s)]
*  Could be on the way up. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=167.4s)]
*  You get hit by a micro meteorite. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=169.2s)]
*  Could be while you're asleep up there. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=172.0s)]
*  Imagine standing on Mars looking back at Earth. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=174.8s)]
*  Going, what the fuck did I do? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=177.48000000000002s)]
*  Why did I do this? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=180.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and then having kids on Mars. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=181.88s)]
*  Oh, those poor kids. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=184.0s)]
*  We came from there. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=186.16s)]
*  You think homeschooling is bad? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=187.16s)]
*  How about space schooling? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=190.04s)]
*  Just imagine the crazy shit that happens on Mars. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=191.52s)]
*  I mean, it's going to be what, 100,000 people? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=193.36s)]
*  Yeah, and so you're going to get one psycho who's going to run everything and they're [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=195.64000000000001s)]
*  going to take over. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=199.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=200.76s)]
*  Every some cult leader convinces everybody to do it his way. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=201.79999999999998s)]
*  It's going to be a sex cult, 100%. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=205.28s)]
*  100%. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=206.76s)]
*  And we're back to sex in space. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=207.76s)]
*  Right, they're going to say, listen, if Elon is their man, Elon wants to procreate every [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=209.0s)]
*  chance he can, how many kids does he have now? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=213.76s)]
*  Allegedly. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=217.32s)]
*  Double digits. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=218.32s)]
*  We don't even know how many. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=219.32s)]
*  Because they think he's got secret kids. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=220.79999999999998s)]
*  They think? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=224.04s)]
*  Who's they? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=225.04s)]
*  They, the fucking people that run the world. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=226.04s)]
*  Is there a Wikipedia page on this? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=227.84s)]
*  There probably is. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=229.12s)]
*  He's probably got secret kids. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=230.28s)]
*  Secret kids. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=232.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=233.36s)]
*  When you have, like, what does he have, like, 300 plus billion dollars? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=234.36s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=236.56s)]
*  You can have a few ladies here, there, all over the place having kids. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=237.56s)]
*  There's a lot of ladies that just want to have kids. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=242.76s)]
*  They don't want a guy around. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=244.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=245.68s)]
*  Especially when they get a little older. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=246.68s)]
*  There's a castle in the south of France with like a harem just waiting for them. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=248.48000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=253.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=254.32s)]
*  Just waiting for daddy to land his rocket ship. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=255.32s)]
*  The online official says at least 12. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=257.44s)]
*  At least 12 kids. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=260.15999999999997s)]
*  See, nobody even knows. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=261.15999999999997s)]
*  Imagine? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=262.55999999999995s)]
*  No one knows how many kids you have? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=263.55999999999995s)]
*  That's kind of crazy. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=265.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=266.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=267.0s)]
*  Well, that's the situation Genghis Khan was in, you know? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=268.0s)]
*  Well, he was doing it a little differently. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=272.32s)]
*  He was a little bit more forceful. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=274.76s)]
*  Actually, I mean, there's a lot of different perspectives on that. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=277.2s)]
*  Like, I, what's the book on Genghis Khan? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=280.52s)]
*  First of all, there's obviously the Dan Carlin, Wrath of the Khans. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=286.84s)]
*  And in that series of podcasts, he criticizes the book, Jack... [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=290.44s)]
*  Weatherford. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=294.56s)]
*  Weatherford. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=295.56s)]
*  Making of the Modern World. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=296.56s)]
*  Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=297.56s)]
*  Genghis Khan and the Mongols and the Making of the Modern World. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=300.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=303.16s)]
*  So that's the, and now, there it is. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=304.16s)]
*  Nice. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=306.56s)]
*  That is one of the things that Dan Carlin talks about that when enough time has passed [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=307.56s)]
*  that they sort of look at these marauders and murderers in a different light and saying, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=314.44s)]
*  oh, he opened up trade to the East. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=321.04s)]
*  Sure. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=323.44s)]
*  Also, killed 10% of the population of Earth, lit people on fire and launched them on catapults [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=324.44s)]
*  onto thatched roofs. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=332.2s)]
*  Well, I think actually Dan Carlin makes a really good point. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=334.44s)]
*  How long do you wait until, you know, that you could tell these kinds of stories about [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=339.64s)]
*  Hitler? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=344.16s)]
*  I think that's an example he uses. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=345.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=346.16s)]
*  Yes, that's what he uses. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=347.16s)]
*  But, you know, you want to be historically accurate here. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=348.16s)]
*  And Genghis Khan, there's a lot of different perspectives, including opening up trade and [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=349.16s)]
*  including what was the protocol based on what he was doing, the murdering. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=355.92s)]
*  So it was very clear before the invasion, he always said, you can surrender and then [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=360.44s)]
*  we would not murder anybody. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=367.92s)]
*  You just have to follow the law. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=371.96s)]
*  And the law was very, very sort of clear. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=375.82s)]
*  And it's basically enforcing a law of the land, free trade, free practice of religion. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=379.06s)]
*  And you have to pay taxes instead of to your king, you have to pay taxes to the Mongol [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=388.42s)]
*  Empire. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=393.94s)]
*  But did they really say we won't kill anyone? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=394.94s)]
*  Yes, 100%. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=396.94s)]
*  They followed that and this is very well documented. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=399.02s)]
*  Really? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=402.02s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=403.02s)]
*  So everybody could have just laid down and 10% of the world's population wouldn't be [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=404.02s)]
*  dead? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=407.09999999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=408.09999999999997s)]
*  Really? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=409.09999999999997s)]
*  So the nuance there is that sometimes they killed the upper classes. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=410.09999999999997s)]
*  Well, you know, didn't they kill the royals by like crushing them to death? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=414.94s)]
*  They'd have lunch over them? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=419.74s)]
*  They were, listen, this is a different time, but they were brutal. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=421.41999999999996s)]
*  Because they want to, they use fear as part of the military tactics, right? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=426.97999999999996s)]
*  So they want people to be terrified and they want people to talk about how terrifying the [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=432.82s)]
*  Mongol Empire is so that they forfeit more easily. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=439.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=442.65999999999997s)]
*  You know, there's a lot of aspects of it, not to say that Genghis Khan is a feminist, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=443.65999999999997s)]
*  but there's a lot of progressive aspects. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=450.05999999999995s)]
*  He put a lot of women in positions of power. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=451.65999999999997s)]
*  He gave a lot of rights to women. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=455.21999999999997s)]
*  This is a very strange perspective. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=457.46s)]
*  Yeah, but he did a lot of raping. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=458.84s)]
*  Nope. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=460.71999999999997s)]
*  There's not his kids. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=461.71999999999997s)]
*  What? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=462.71999999999997s)]
*  I mean, it's... [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=463.71999999999997s)]
*  What do you mean, nope? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=464.71999999999997s)]
*  When he would conquer these places, he would take women. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=466.71999999999997s)]
*  In a harem. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=469.71999999999997s)]
*  And he would become his new wives. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=470.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, but it wasn't their call. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=472.71999999999997s)]
*  So that's kind of rapey. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=475.35999999999996s)]
*  That's very rapey, yeah. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=477.23999999999995s)]
*  So, but there's a... [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=478.23999999999995s)]
*  If you just fucking take them and make them have your kids. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=480.23999999999995s)]
*  There's the kind of mass rape that the Soviet soldiers did at the end of World War II when [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=483.44s)]
*  they're marching towards Berlin, which is extremely violent, vicious, and sort of that [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=487.0s)]
*  kind of rape, which is part of the terror of war. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=494.72s)]
*  And then there's like creating a harem of women, right? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=498.6s)]
*  So it's a different... [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=505.12s)]
*  I think the main point is that this is something you talk about that a large percent of the [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=508.88s)]
*  population, as that one study from like 20 years ago found are descendants of Genghis [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=516.72s)]
*  Khan. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=521.56s)]
*  Huge. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=522.56s)]
*  I think the way to do that is to make everybody who is your descendant popular within the [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=523.56s)]
*  culture. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=533.16s)]
*  You can't have that many... [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=534.92s)]
*  Have your DNA propagate throughout civilization by raping. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=538.6s)]
*  You have to have everybody who... [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=543.1s)]
*  To have a high status for people that are associated with Genghis Khan. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=546.64s)]
*  You can't have that kind of thing with fear. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=551.7199999999999s)]
*  You can only do it with respect and high status. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=554.76s)]
*  And he, for several generations, created an empire that was flourishing. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=558.28s)]
*  Okay, you're kind of whitewashing that. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=563.0s)]
*  They killed a million people in Jin China and turned their bones into a stack, a pile [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=567.96s)]
*  that they recognized as snow-covered mountains from the distance. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=574.5600000000001s)]
*  That's what they thought it was until they got up on it. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=579.2800000000001s)]
*  When the Shah of Khorizm came there to check it out, he was like, where is everybody? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=581.64s)]
*  They had to abandon the roads because there were so many dead bodies that the roads had [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=587.0400000000001s)]
*  deteriorated into muck. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=591.0s)]
*  Yeah, let me actually sort of backtrack a little bit here because I'm uncomfortable [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=592.6s)]
*  because I'm deeply involved in the military affairs of modern day. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=597.6s)]
*  So there's a kind of... [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=601.96s)]
*  I was just kind of having fun. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=603.36s)]
*  Yes, there was mass murder that was happening. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=605.08s)]
*  It was vicious. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=608.52s)]
*  And we could... [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=609.52s)]
*  And I'm not a scholar of Genghis Khan. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=610.52s)]
*  I was simply saying that it's interesting how history looks at these different empires. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=613.44s)]
*  For example, we venerate the Roman Empire, not we, but ancient Greece, and they were [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=620.68s)]
*  equally, if not more brutal in their conquests and their destruction. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=626.16s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, there's never really been a time where there was a leading superpower [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=630.8399999999999s)]
*  that wasn't brutal. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=635.12s)]
*  It's I think become less and less brutal over time. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=637.52s)]
*  People document this. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=640.64s)]
*  So war, the number of people, S% of the population killed is less and less. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=641.64s)]
*  But what about Ukraine and Russia? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=647.24s)]
*  How many people have died all told between the two? [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=649.8s)]
*  It's got to be close to a million. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=653.16s)]
*  It's over a million casualties, which includes death and injuries. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=655.0799999999999s)]
*  And the estimates vary, but I think a good estimate is over 400,000 total, maybe over [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=660.52s)]
*  500,000 on both sides. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=668.8s)]
*  And the dead on the Ukraine side is probably one third or one fourth of the total dead. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=671.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=678.76s)]
*  Three quarters of them on the Russian side. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=680.72s)]
*  On the Russian side. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=681.72s)]
*  Really? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=682.72s)]
*  What do you attribute that to? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=683.72s)]
*  I think there's military scholars that understand this really well. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=684.92s)]
*  I think in general, the invading force loses more people than the defending force. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=688.68s)]
*  That's one aspect. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=695.96s)]
*  Of course, the Ukrainian military will say it's about the effectiveness of the Ukrainian [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=696.96s)]
*  military. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=702.88s)]
*  And also, one of the other things they say is that the medical capabilities, so the medics [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=705.88s)]
*  are really strong on the Ukrainian side, which is also tragic because you're able to save [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=710.8000000000001s)]
*  lives but you have the injuries, the pain of war that the veterans have to go through. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=714.88s)]
*  So they're able to save lives more effectively also. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=723.44s)]
*  But there is a big characteristic of the invading force usually loses more people. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=727.5200000000001s)]
*  What was it like going over there and interviewing Zelensky? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=732.48s)]
*  So I should say I went to Ukraine twice after February 24, 2022 invasion. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=739.0799999999999s)]
*  And maybe it's good for me to also say where I come from because it's surreal to be there [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=747.28s)]
*  for me. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=753.28s)]
*  Sure. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=754.28s)]
*  Both my parents are from Ukraine, from Kiev and Kharkiv. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=755.28s)]
*  These are towns in Ukraine, cities in Ukraine. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=758.3199999999999s)]
*  I've been there many times. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=762.2800000000001s)]
*  I myself was born in Tajikistan, speaking of Genghis Khan. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=763.2800000000001s)]
*  And I lived there, in Tajikistan. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=767.76s)]
*  And by the way, I'm regretting defending Genghis Khan in this conversation for fun. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=771.5600000000001s)]
*  You didn't really defend it. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=776.12s)]
*  I want to say that over and over again. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=779.1600000000001s)]
*  War is hell. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=782.84s)]
*  I'm almost at tension between how much Roman Empire, Caesar, and these folks are venerated. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=787.4399999999999s)]
*  And Genghis Khan is seen as this barbarian that was just destroying and raping and so [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=793.76s)]
*  on. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=798.1999999999999s)]
*  They were all horrible, vicious, warmongers. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=799.1999999999999s)]
*  All of them. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=803.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=804.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=805.24s)]
*  Anyway, Tajikistan and I lived for a time in Kiev and I lived for a time in Moscow. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=806.24s)]
*  I have family in Ukraine. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=811.4s)]
*  I have family in Russia. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=812.96s)]
*  And I should say in World War II, a lot of my family was slaughtered in Babi Yar, which [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=817.5600000000001s)]
*  is a ravine in Kiev, where they gather people around the Nazis. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=825.44s)]
*  And they just put them in this ravine and just shot them and put another layer of humans, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=831.72s)]
*  told them to get naked and face down, lay face down and slaughter and slaughter like [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=837.24s)]
*  this. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=840.52s)]
*  It's mass, mass, mass graves, mass slaughter. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=841.52s)]
*  And my grandfather fought the Nazis. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=846.0400000000001s)]
*  He's a machine gunner, which is one of the few that survives, which is the reason I'm [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=849.0400000000001s)]
*  here, that they basically tried to hold off the Nazi armada. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=856.5600000000001s)]
*  And that the surreal aspect of all of this is the same land. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=862.84s)]
*  I just still remember the song 22 June, at 4 o'clock, in the bombing, they told us that [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=867.0400000000001s)]
*  it's 22 June, at 4 a.m., the bombing of Kiev began. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=874.8s)]
*  So this is in 1941, June 22. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=883.7199999999999s)]
*  Just imagine, speaking of Genghis Khan, complete surprise, just the Nazi armada, just coming, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=886.68s)]
*  Operation Barbarossa, this massive military force invading your land. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=895.88s)]
*  And there's the greatest, the biggest battles of all time were on this land. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=903.0s)]
*  The Battle of Kiev, the Battle of Stalingrad, the Battle of Moscow, we're talking about [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=907.52s)]
*  hundreds of thousands, millions of people just slaughtering each other. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=911.4399999999999s)]
*  And the way Hitler, of course, approached the battle, and so did Stalin, is nobody surrenders. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=916.76s)]
*  There's no, it's all in, slaughter. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=922.72s)]
*  It doesn't matter if it's winter, it doesn't matter if there's no guns, it doesn't matter. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=926.4s)]
*  It's just victory or death on both sides. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=930.52s)]
*  And so it's just brutal war. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=934.52s)]
*  So this is the land, right? [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=936.4s)]
*  And I have, you know, for a lot of people in this land, this history is part of them, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=938.68s)]
*  it's part of their blood. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=943.16s)]
*  They remember these struggles, they remember this political, this geopolitical, this military, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=945.52s)]
*  this social, this is real. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=952.36s)]
*  This is like, imagine, because recent, imagine the United States living maybe a few decades [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=954.64s)]
*  after the Civil War. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=960.6s)]
*  You remember, you remember that, you know, you have relatives that died, you remember [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=961.88s)]
*  the real hatred, the real tensions, the real battle. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=968.3199999999999s)]
*  So yeah, it was surreal to be back there and to try to do what I was doing, which is to [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=973.28s)]
*  push for peace. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=982.12s)]
*  Since there's probably a lot to say about this war, I should say that I interviewed [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=984.28s)]
*  Vladimir Zelensky and I will be traveling to Russia to interview Vladimir Putin. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=995.04s)]
*  And I'm aware of the risks, I accept the risks. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1005.28s)]
*  And the goal, the mission is to just push for peace, to do my small part in pushing [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1012.68s)]
*  for peace. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1016.72s)]
*  And that's what I was trying to do in this conversation. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1017.72s)]
*  And it required just a huge amount of preparation. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1020.56s)]
*  For people who don't know, maybe I'll lay out where there was opportunities for peace. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1024.24s)]
*  So since the beginning of the war, February 24, 2022, I think there was three moments [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1030.2s)]
*  to make peace. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1037.16s)]
*  From the perspective of Ukraine, you want to make peace from strength. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1039.28s)]
*  So when you're in a position of strength, the first time to make peace was March and [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1043.8s)]
*  April of 2022, when the Ukrainian forces were able to successfully defend the North, defend [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1049.4s)]
*  Kiev. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1055.92s)]
*  There's this huge optimism, this belief that we're going to push back this gigantic Russian [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1057.16s)]
*  military. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1063.3200000000002s)]
*  That's a place for leverage and the confidence both of the U.S. funding, the European militaries, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1064.72s)]
*  and the Ukrainian military that we can win this. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1073.28s)]
*  This is when you make peace, when there is a perception and a reality of strength. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1076.52s)]
*  The second time was in the fall of 2022, when there was a successful counteroffensive by [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1083.44s)]
*  the Ukrainian forces that recaptured Kharkiv and Kherson. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1091.0400000000002s)]
*  This is the south and the east of Ukraine. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1096.4s)]
*  And there was this real sense that the Ukrainian forces can defeat the Russian forces. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1099.68s)]
*  Huge optimism. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1107.52s)]
*  A lot of pressure from the U.S. to make peace then. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1109.2s)]
*  This is the strength and perhaps the weakness of Vladimir Zelensky, who I do think is a [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1112.54s)]
*  historic figure and a great leader, is that he, one, deeply emotionally feels the suffering [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1119.06s)]
*  of the people and the loss that war creates. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1129.02s)]
*  And he single-handedly has to unite the nation and carry the will of a people and the morale [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1133.02s)]
*  of a people, has to lift the morale of a people. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1138.62s)]
*  And that kind of man struggles to make peace, because he understands he wants justice, not peace. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1141.54s)]
*  And so from a position of strength there, he wants to go further, recapture all of the [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1149.26s)]
*  land that he sees belongs to Ukraine. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1154.7s)]
*  But that's exactly when you make peace. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1157.06s)]
*  And so his very strength, a man that stayed in Kiev, that said, you know, fuck you, we're [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1160.6599999999999s)]
*  not going to, we're going to win this. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1168.94s)]
*  That kind of man that lifted a whole nation, that united a whole nation, that man has also [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1172.94s)]
*  struggled to make peace. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1177.26s)]
*  And so the third time to make peace, after all of that, the Russian military regrouped [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1179.46s)]
*  and has been capturing land gradually. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1186.2s)]
*  So the third time to make peace is now. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1193.1000000000001s)]
*  The Trump administration, there's a momentum. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1197.42s)]
*  They want to make peace. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1200.38s)]
*  He's a great dealmaker. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1203.26s)]
*  He wants to end wars in all parts of the world. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1205.8200000000002s)]
*  He's made the deal in Gaza now. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1209.5800000000002s)]
*  Made the deal in Gaza. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1212.46s)]
*  And that's a super complicated situation too, because they made a ceasefire deal with the [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1213.6200000000001s)]
*  hostages. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1218.22s)]
*  But like... [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1219.22s)]
*  But isn't it amazing that the Biden administration had two years, couldn't get anything done? [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1220.3000000000002s)]
*  And Trump kids had done it a day. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1227.82s)]
*  He was saying that he was going to be able to do that. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1229.78s)]
*  And everybody dismissed it. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1231.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1233.62s)]
*  And I think there's a political battle now taking credit for who made the ceasefire, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1234.62s)]
*  which I think is silly. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1239.9399999999998s)]
*  It's... [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1240.9399999999998s)]
*  Of course you can have that. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1241.9399999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1242.9399999999998s)]
*  Biden is the president. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1243.9399999999998s)]
*  He's still the president for another few days. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1244.9399999999998s)]
*  The point is, with Donald Trump, there's a real will and a momentum to make peace. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1248.34s)]
*  There's a respect. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1254.26s)]
*  There's a fear. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1255.26s)]
*  Whatever you think about Donald Trump, he is this person that world leaders respect [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1257.22s)]
*  in the full meaning of the word respect. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1263.42s)]
*  Not like admire, but fear. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1266.1s)]
*  I think both Zelensky and Putin fear Donald Trump. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1270.42s)]
*  And that's a great person to then make peace. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1275.26s)]
*  Because he has the leverage... [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1279.74s)]
*  All of them believe, Putin and Zelensky, that Trump can do some crazy shit. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1281.14s)]
*  And he probably would, but he doesn't want to. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1286.8200000000002s)]
*  Right, he doesn't want to. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1288.6200000000001s)]
*  This is the difference. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1289.6200000000001s)]
*  That's a very unique position that he's in, where they're afraid of him, but yet he wants [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1290.6200000000001s)]
*  peace. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1295.46s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1296.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1297.46s)]
*  And so this is the time. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1298.46s)]
*  And if you don't make peace now, what's going to happen is the funding from US and the support [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1299.46s)]
*  from US is going to dwindle gradually. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1303.7800000000002s)]
*  And Putin is willing and able to just wait and to let the war continue for months and [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1306.8999999999999s)]
*  for years. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1314.5s)]
*  And meanwhile, people are dying every single day. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1317.1s)]
*  Thousands of people. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1322.3799999999999s)]
*  What's horrible about this war too is there's GoPro footage. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1323.3799999999999s)]
*  There's a lot of cellphone footage. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1326.5s)]
*  There's a lot of GoPro footage. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1328.82s)]
*  I've watched too much of it, unfortunately. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1329.82s)]
*  But it's rough, man. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1333.82s)]
*  It's a horrible war. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1336.74s)]
*  And it's a war that's so confusing over here, especially to the uninitiated, for the people [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1337.74s)]
*  that are just reading the newspaper and getting a sort of a cursory understanding of what [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1342.78s)]
*  happened. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1348.34s)]
*  Russia invaded. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1349.34s)]
*  Why? [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1350.34s)]
*  What'd they do? [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1351.34s)]
*  And then you got to get into the whole US-backed coup in 2014, and then you have to think about [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1352.34s)]
*  NATO and the agreement that was made the fall of, you know, when the wall came down in Berlin, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1357.66s)]
*  the agreement that NATO would not push forth and move closer to Russia, which they violated [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1367.3000000000002s)]
*  over and over and over again. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1373.78s)]
*  The whole thing is so complicated that it takes forever just to sort of get an understanding [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1375.9s)]
*  of the pieces that are involved. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1382.22s)]
*  Forget about who's responsible for what, but just like how many different things are happening [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1384.38s)]
*  you know, simultaneously that are forcing Putin's hand, now Zelensky's hand, and it's [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1390.74s)]
*  just to be on this side of the world watching it take place, it's almost unbelievable. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1397.38s)]
*  It's so hard to believe that Russia and Ukraine, which were both a part of the Soviet Union, [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1402.6200000000001s)]
*  just not that long ago, while during my lifetime, now they're at war. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1408.74s)]
*  I should say that I believe, so how do you handle situations like this? [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1414.22s)]
*  I believe US actually gave not enough money to Ukraine. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1419.3s)]
*  They should have given more money, hit really hard, and then make peace. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1423.94s)]
*  This is the point. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1428.78s)]
*  A month or two after the start of the war, you can learn the same kind of lesson with [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1430.14s)]
*  Iraq and Afghanistan. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1433.74s)]
*  There's no reason those invasions, those military operations. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1435.7s)]
*  There's no other way. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1439.78s)]
*  There's no other way than just give money. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1441.22s)]
*  Give money and hit hard. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1443.18s)]
*  There's no other way. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1444.98s)]
*  What about... [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1446.8200000000002s)]
*  Avoid it. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1447.8200000000002s)]
*  What about have NATO back out? [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1448.8200000000002s)]
*  Well, a lot of this is about diplomatic rhetoric. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1451.22s)]
*  And yes, NATO was consistently talking shit to Putin. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1456.3400000000001s)]
*  And that's not, like a lot of this is about diplomacy. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1460.14s)]
*  And you can't just pressure with words. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1463.5s)]
*  For some people, it seems almost silly that you need to show respect to world leaders, [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1471.34s)]
*  but there needs to be shown real respect. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1477.7s)]
*  Putin has laid out the interests of the Russian Federation. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1480.5s)]
*  He said he's been very clear about what the interests are. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1484.74s)]
*  They want their security to be respected. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1488.46s)]
*  They want their nation to be respected. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1490.5s)]
*  He's very clear. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1492.3799999999999s)]
*  And simply at the negotiation table, he just needs to be respected. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1494.58s)]
*  This perspective needs to be understood and heard. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1499.3799999999999s)]
*  You can't just say Putin is evil, bad guy, authoritarian, hates freedom. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1502.26s)]
*  We need to destroy him. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1508.62s)]
*  This kind of this whole vibe and energy you come with this idealistic sense that you bring [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1509.8999999999999s)]
*  to the table. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1515.4599999999998s)]
*  You have to respect leaders. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1516.86s)]
*  You have to respect Xi Jinping. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1518.02s)]
*  You have to respect Putin when you're at the negotiation table, not when you're on Twitter [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1519.02s)]
*  and X or talking shit or historians or activists. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1523.54s)]
*  You can criticize as much as you want, as vicious as you want. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1527.06s)]
*  You can mock. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1530.58s)]
*  Artists can mock as much as they want. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1531.58s)]
*  Comedians, it doesn't matter. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1533.1399999999999s)]
*  When you're a world leader and you come to the table, you have to show respect. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1534.5s)]
*  You have to treat other world leaders, as funny as it's to say, the way you want to [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1538.74s)]
*  be treated, with respect. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1542.82s)]
*  That's not funny at all. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1544.74s)]
*  Yeah, it makes sense. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1545.74s)]
*  If you want to get things done. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1546.74s)]
*  If you want to get things done, and more importantly, if you want in this war for the death to end, [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1549.06s)]
*  one of the things I kept pushing in an almost childlike way was Zelensky, is getting him [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1556.3s)]
*  to open himself up for peace because he kept shutting it down. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1562.84s)]
*  He kept mocking Putin. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1568.8999999999999s)]
*  He kept criticizing Putin, which is okay. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1569.8999999999999s)]
*  It's okay to sort of criticize and say that there's war crimes, that there's real vicious [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1573.04s)]
*  violence and destruction happening. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1580.02s)]
*  Along that, there has to be a door open of respect, of I'm willing to come to the table [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1583.1799999999998s)]
*  to negotiate and respect the other nation's interests, as opposed to saying I'm only going [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1588.02s)]
*  to talk to the United States. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1596.6599999999999s)]
*  You have to be open to negotiate. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1598.1s)]
*  Because, unfortunately, this is the motherfucker of peace. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1600.82s)]
*  You have to compromise. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1605.54s)]
*  You have to sit across the table as a world leader with a person you might fucking hate. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1606.94s)]
*  Because unlike Putin, I should say, Zelensky goes to the front. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1613.74s)]
*  He talks to the soldiers. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1619.0800000000002s)]
*  He sees the dead bodies. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1620.74s)]
*  He talks to the civilians, the mothers that lost their children, the wives that lost their [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1622.46s)]
*  husband. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1627.6200000000001s)]
*  This person who's an empath, who's an emotional being, he's wearing all that in his mind. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1629.46s)]
*  There's a real pain there. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1634.66s)]
*  He's tortured, tormented by this. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1636.58s)]
*  If you're a leader, you have to put all that aside. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1639.34s)]
*  And you have to sit and save your nation by compromising. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1642.6599999999999s)]
*  That's it. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1647.6599999999999s)]
*  And that's the hard thing of it. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1648.6599999999999s)]
*  Especially now there's an opportunity where the Trump figure rolls in who wants to make [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1650.54s)]
*  peace. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1656.98s)]
*  You have to use this opportunity. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1659.1s)]
*  And it's tough. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1661.06s)]
*  It's very, very tough. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1662.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1663.06s)]
*  You're putting it mildly. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1664.54s)]
*  Very tough. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1666.86s)]
*  What do you think Trump can do now? [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1668.3799999999999s)]
*  What could possibly, if Zelensky wants victory, they want revenge, what can Trump do to sort [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1671.7s)]
*  of bring peace to the table? [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1679.8799999999999s)]
*  I think some of these notions sound naive, but literally meet, which they haven't been [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1684.1399999999999s)]
*  meeting. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1692.98s)]
*  With Putin, meet with Zelensky. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1694.9s)]
*  They haven't been meeting at all? [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1695.9s)]
*  No. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1696.9s)]
*  So Zelensky comes down, they've been meeting with Zelensky, but there is no meeting with [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1697.9s)]
*  Putin. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1702.22s)]
*  I think the right thing to do is to go to, whether it's Switzerland or Turkey, Istanbul [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1703.22s)]
*  or Minsk. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1708.94s)]
*  The biggest thing for me would be literally the three of them sit together. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1713.18s)]
*  I think I trust in Trump's negotiation ability and the carrot and the stick of the United [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1717.8600000000001s)]
*  States military and the United States economy for being able to control oil prices, being [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1728.38s)]
*  able to control trade with tariffs, being able to threaten military force and funding [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1734.8600000000001s)]
*  and so on, plus sanctions, all of this. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1741.14s)]
*  You can roll in with that carrot and stick, implied or made implicit or explicit, and [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1744.6599999999999s)]
*  just sit at the table and talk like human beings and show each other respect. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1750.02s)]
*  That is one of the things that actually COVID did. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=1757.58s)]

*  They're coming from the outside, but you need that. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2206.02s)]
*  The thing is it's a really complicated tension. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2209.78s)]
*  You don't, during the war with martial law, you do want to suspend elections potentially. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2214.82s)]
*  It's a really difficult trade off. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2222.7400000000002s)]
*  The United States has the same thing. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2224.5800000000004s)]
*  If we were to be invaded, I don't know by who, this is not, you know, if Canada invaded, [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2226.7400000000002s)]
*  I don't want to make a joke out of this, but there's going to be a more, yeah. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2232.7000000000003s)]
*  That would be a quick fight. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2235.9s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2238.3s)]
*  There would be a martial law where elections would be delayed or suspended and so on. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2240.3399999999997s)]
*  So all those criticisms, all those concerns can only be dealt with once you make peace. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2246.62s)]
*  And in terms of corruption, just my, there's a lot of people that know Zelensky well and [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2253.22s)]
*  this has been my impression having met him. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2259.2999999999997s)]
*  I don't think he, and I've not heard anybody that knows him well say that he's personally [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2267.42s)]
*  corrupt. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2271.54s)]
*  This is really important. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2272.54s)]
*  He himself is not personally corrupt and he legitimately is fighting corruption. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2274.38s)]
*  Now he's in a system that has corruption. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2279.58s)]
*  Russia has corruption. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2282.82s)]
*  It's really difficult to weed out corruption, but he legitimately, at least to me that's [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2283.82s)]
*  really important that he as a single human being and the people really close around him, [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2288.7400000000002s)]
*  like really close. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2293.54s)]
*  You also start to seep in, of course, when you go further out. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2295.66s)]
*  But in that direct human being, that he is not personally corrupt. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2299.54s)]
*  He, like financially speaking, he singularly believes in the idea of Ukraine as a sovereign [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2305.7s)]
*  nation and he's willing to die for that idea. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2314.7s)]
*  That is his strength and that is also his weakness when it's time to make peace. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2317.94s)]
*  When you are preparing to do something like this and you are doing your research, you're [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2324.14s)]
*  getting ready to go do it, what are your concerns other than your own physical safety, of course? [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2332.62s)]
*  What is your, like ultimately, what's your concerns? [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2340.22s)]
*  What are your goals when you're setting out to do this? [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2343.3799999999997s)]
*  This is very different than any other kind of podcast interview. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2345.7799999999997s)]
*  There's no other format really where a world leader in the middle of a huge international [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2353.46s)]
*  conflict is going to sit down for three hours and talk to an American scientist, which is [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2362.2200000000003s)]
*  weird too, right? [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2371.54s)]
*  It's like, why are you doing it? [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2373.02s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2375.3s)]
*  This guy who works in AI just decides he's going to start a podcast. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2377.06s)]
*  The podcast becomes very successful and all of a sudden he's like, I'd like to talk to [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2381.82s)]
*  everybody. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2385.86s)]
*  I'd like to go over and talk to Zelensky and talk to Putin and everybody's like, why you? [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2386.86s)]
*  What the fuck are you doing? [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2392.38s)]
*  So you get a lot of that and then unfortunately for you, you read the comments. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2394.02s)]
*  So you get sucked into all that negativity. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2398.44s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, there's a lot to say there. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2400.5s)]
*  First of all, on the comments side, I always have a little Joe Rogan on my shoulder saying, [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2403.54s)]
*  don't read the comments. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2407.1000000000004s)]
*  Don't read the comments. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2408.1000000000004s)]
*  In this situation, it's especially intense. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2410.58s)]
*  I should say, privately, after I did the conversation with Zelensky, every single person that knows [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2414.66s)]
*  the situation well knows me personally, has written to me and it's all been really positive. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2420.98s)]
*  Really positive. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2428.06s)]
*  Almost like in the desert wanting water positive because there's a lot of voices that are afraid [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2429.06s)]
*  to speak that want peace. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2434.9399999999996s)]
*  Online, this is something we talked about online a little bit, there's just like these [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2438.82s)]
*  like swarms of people that are like... [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2443.46s)]
*  Not even necessarily people. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2446.86s)]
*  I don't want to sort of go too far in that territory assuming that anybody who criticized [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2449.1000000000004s)]
*  me is a bot. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2453.7000000000003s)]
*  No, no. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2454.7000000000003s)]
*  But there is... [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2455.7000000000003s)]
*  We're not saying that, but there's an enormous element of that that's real. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2456.7000000000003s)]
*  Whether it's bots or whether it's hired people, paid propagandists, the conversation is not [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2459.98s)]
*  a pure conversation between people expressing their ideas. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2466.42s)]
*  There's a lot of propaganda online and it's very confusing to try to discern what the [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2470.42s)]
*  percentage is. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2476.1800000000003s)]
*  We've talked about this a bunch of times on the podcast, but there was a former FBI analyst [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2477.1800000000003s)]
*  who estimated that it's on Twitter alone. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2481.86s)]
*  This is before the purchase. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2485.02s)]
*  He believed it was around 80%. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2486.34s)]
*  So 80% fake accounts. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2488.5s)]
*  Not just propaganda, like government propaganda, but most certainly corporations are hiring [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2491.02s)]
*  people to do similar things. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2497.54s)]
*  I'm sure there's companies that will do that for public figures, actors, people that are [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2499.26s)]
*  involved in conflict. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2506.82s)]
*  This is part of the Blake Lively dispute is that she is accusing that Justin Baldoni actor [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2508.94s)]
*  of an organized attack on her, which is probably what it feels like anyway when you're involved [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2517.34s)]
*  in something on social media, like, oh my God, this is organized or they're attacking [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2523.6600000000003s)]
*  you. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2527.5s)]
*  But it's a very confusing landscape. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2528.5s)]
*  Ideally what we would want with social media is different people, informed and uninformed, [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2533.94s)]
*  but at least expressing their ideas on things and exchanging information back and forth [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2540.98s)]
*  and talking. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2546.22s)]
*  It's not the whole story though. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2547.8599999999997s)]
*  There's a lot of other players involved that are not real. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2550.18s)]
*  There's AI for sure. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2556.46s)]
*  There's definitely large language models that are involved in this back and forth with automation. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2559.22s)]
*  They look out for certain code words and these accounts attack certain ideas. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2567.02s)]
*  So it's hard to know what the actual will of the people is. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2574.34s)]
*  Yeah, it's definitely true. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2578.78s)]
*  I've seen a lot of evidence of this that there's Ukrainian bot farms and Russian bot farms. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2581.42s)]
*  Have you spoke to Elon about this? [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2586.7400000000002s)]
*  About bot farms? [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2588.9s)]
*  Yeah, because he knows a lot more now, of course, because there was the big concern [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2589.9s)]
*  when he was buying Twitter. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2593.34s)]
*  They were trying to say there was only 5% bots. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2594.82s)]
*  They were doing that on an extremely low sample size. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2597.98s)]
*  They were doing it off of 100 people. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2599.9s)]
*  So they got 100 people and out of those 100 people, 5 of them they determined were bots [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2601.54s)]
*  and so they went with 5%, which is just ridiculous. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2607.1s)]
*  You're dealing with how many people are on Twitter every day? [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2609.42s)]
*  What's the total Twitter audience? [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2613.18s)]
*  It's not as big as Facebook, right? [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2615.98s)]
*  Facebook is 3.2 billion worldwide, which is unbelievable. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2617.86s)]
*  I think X has a small number, but very influential and very active. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2623.1s)]
*  Very active, very influential. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2629.2599999999998s)]
*  245 daily active. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2632.26s)]
*  What is the total amount of accounts on it though? [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2636.6600000000003s)]
*  Because there's daily active and then there's just people that just read them. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2640.3s)]
*  There's a lot of people that just read. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2643.78s)]
*  541.56 million monthly active users. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2646.5800000000004s)]
*  So again, that's active users. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2652.1400000000003s)]
*  So total users. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2656.14s)]
*  What's the total users? [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2659.06s)]
*  See, it's all active. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2660.54s)]
*  I want to know what counts. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2665.06s)]
*  They delete accounts all the time. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2666.46s)]
*  Right. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2672.14s)]
*  Yeah, they definitely do. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2673.14s)]
*  So they must have some sort of a system where they weed out bots. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2674.66s)]
*  There's a lot of concern right now on Twitter about censorship. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2678.7799999999997s)]
*  I try to stay out of Twitter as much as I can, honestly, [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2683.7799999999997s)]
*  because I think it's bad for your mental health. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2687.2999999999997s)]
*  I really do. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2689.5s)]
*  I think people just barking at each other all day is not good to absorb. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2690.4199999999996s)]
*  I want to absorb real people that I interact with. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2696.5s)]
*  I want to, I mean, I try to pay attention to the news. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2699.1s)]
*  I try to pay attention to whatever controversial ideas are out there and [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2702.22s)]
*  try to see what I think. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2706.98s)]
*  But I don't think it's good to dive in to social media all day. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2709.58s)]
*  I think it's uniquely bad. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2714.62s)]
*  And I think so many people are involved in it and [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2718.02s)]
*  they don't realize that they're poisoning their brain. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2720.14s)]
*  Just like they would poison their body if they're eating junk food all day. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2722.58s)]
*  I think it's genuinely bad for you. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2726.14s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, and you and I are, and also in a particular, doing a podcast, [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2728.82s)]
*  and we're also very different human beings. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2734.42s)]
*  I would say your psychological fortitude is pretty strong. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2736.18s)]
*  I'm more, I wear my heart on my sleeve maybe a little bit more, and [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2743.06s)]
*  when if I, shit gets to me. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2746.8999999999996s)]
*  And when you try to put compassion out there in the world in the way I did, [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2753.7799999999997s)]
*  especially with this conversation with Zelensky, the attacks. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2758.74s)]
*  You just have to recognize who the kind of people that are doing that are. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2761.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2764.7799999999997s)]
*  Those are just really weak people. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2765.5s)]
*  Really weak, psychologically damaged, [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2767.5s)]
*  mentally ill people that are probably medicated. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2771.1s)]
*  I, sort of to push back, I think some of them are actually good, [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2775.02s)]
*  sophisticated people, they're just acting not their best selves. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2781.38s)]
*  Like I've seen this, there's people that are like, I know them personally, and [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2783.86s)]
*  online, they just, like the worst shit comes out of them. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2787.98s)]
*  Yeah, well, because they're mentally ill. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2791.06s)]
*  But then all of us are a bit mentally ill. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2793.8599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, well we're all a little mentally ill. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2795.7s)]
*  Like no one is enlightened that I've met. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2797.2999999999997s)]
*  I've never met one person who's perfect, right? [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2799.7799999999997s)]
*  I don't think it's possible with this journey that we're on, [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2802.14s)]
*  as these meat vehicles, these soul carrying meat vehicles, [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2805.62s)]
*  navigating a very confusing world. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2810.14s)]
*  I don't think it's possible to be perfect. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2812.2999999999997s)]
*  But you can have a desire to be a good person, and some people don't have that. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2814.8199999999997s)]
*  And the excuse that they always use is, I mean, this is the Donald Trump excuse. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2819.9s)]
*  You do anything you can to stop Hitler, right? [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2825.6200000000003s)]
*  And this is why they want to conflate, and [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2830.46s)]
*  they always want to pretend that everyone's Hitler. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2832.98s)]
*  The problem with that is that just after a while, it's crying wolf, and [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2836.26s)]
*  people are like, this is a bullshit game you're playing, and [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2839.34s)]
*  you're just using it as an excuse. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2842.34s)]
*  And Elon's talked about this a lot, and he's absolutely correct, [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2843.7000000000003s)]
*  is that people use woke ideology as an excuse to be an asshole. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2848.34s)]
*  And it's really just people that are assholes that are attaching themselves to [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2854.98s)]
*  things that make them feel righteous. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2858.5800000000004s)]
*  And so they wrap themselves in this idea to give them virtue, and [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2860.78s)]
*  to allow them to say the most awful things about other people that have [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2865.82s)]
*  different perspectives. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2870.86s)]
*  And then just by nature, if you're doing that, you're doing the wrong thing. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2872.26s)]
*  You're a bad person. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2877.02s)]
*  You can justify it all you want. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2878.28s)]
*  You can find people that agree with you all you want. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2879.76s)]
*  But those people are also on the wrong track, rather. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2882.0s)]
*  The people that are listening to you and agreeing with you, [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2884.92s)]
*  they're on the wrong track. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2886.88s)]
*  They're the wrong track if we want to be collectively a kind, [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2887.88s)]
*  compassionate, cohesive society, a community of human beings that all [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2892.8s)]
*  live together. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2897.0800000000004s)]
*  That's totally possible. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2898.2000000000003s)]
*  If you can do it in small groups of people, [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2900.1600000000003s)]
*  you can do it in enormous groups of people. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2902.44s)]
*  It just has to be an ethic that gets promoted. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2904.0800000000004s)]
*  It has to be something that you see people that you admire adhere to, and [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2907.2s)]
*  you do it as well. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2913.2s)]
*  Whenever someone goes outside of that, and [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2914.44s)]
*  whenever someone starts making horrific, unfounded personal attacks, [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2918.24s)]
*  because someone has a different political ideology, or [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2923.48s)]
*  just going after them every day, all day long, you're just broken. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2926.92s)]
*  You're on the wrong path, period. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2932.3199999999997s)]
*  And intelligent, aware people that have control of their emotions recognize that, [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2934.84s)]
*  and they're not gonna take your perspective seriously. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2939.96s)]
*  So you're gonna be less and less effective with what you do. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2941.8s)]
*  And in general, the failure mode is to paint the world, [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2946.7200000000003s)]
*  to draw a line between good and evil. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2951.04s)]
*  Whether it's the line in geography, Russians, Putin is evil, or [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2953.2000000000003s)]
*  if it's Trump, Trump is evil. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2957.88s)]
*  The version of that is Hitler. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2960.4s)]
*  I'm a big proponent of Solzhenitsyn's famous, [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2962.36s)]
*  the author of Gulag Archipelago, that the line between good and [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2967.88s)]
*  evil runs through the heart of every man, that all of us have that in us. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2973.0s)]
*  And it is good to be humbled by that reality. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2977.92s)]
*  And if you are humbled by that reality, [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2984.32s)]
*  then you're not going to see any other people as purely evil or purely good. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2986.36s)]
*  All of that kind of thing is used to just hate others. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2992.32s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, and even when it's unfounded. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=2999.56s)]
*  Even like I'm watching the Pete Hegseth, the confirmation hearings. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3004.52s)]
*  And these ignorant people are going after his tattoo, [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3011.6s)]
*  not even knowing what the tattoo is. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3015.8399999999997s)]
*  And trying to pretend that it's some sort of radical, [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3018.48s)]
*  hateful tattoo when it's just an ancient Christian tattoo. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3022.92s)]
*  It's so strange. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3027.92s)]
*  I mean, that tattoo's in churches. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3028.8799999999997s)]
*  That symbol's in churches. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3031.92s)]
*  That symbol's been around for a long fucking time. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3033.72s)]
*  It's just a Christian tattoo. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3038.08s)]
*  And I was watching the Piers Morgan show. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3041.16s)]
*  And Piers Morgan had Michael Knowles and these two super whack, and [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3044.84s)]
*  Dave Rubin and two super wacky leftist people that didn't know what the tattoo was. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3051.0s)]
*  And they were criticizing it, and Piers Morgan kept on going, [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3055.8s)]
*  what is the tattoo? [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3058.0s)]
*  What is it? [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3059.36s)]
*  Tell me what it is. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3060.08s)]
*  And the guy would go, you're not answering the question. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3060.6s)]
*  Go back to it. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3063.08s)]
*  What is it? [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3064.0s)]
*  Well, let's look it up. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3064.52s)]
*  He's like, no, no, no, don't look it up. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3065.4s)]
*  I want you to tell me. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3066.8s)]
*  If you're saying it's offensive. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3067.8s)]
*  And so then the woman chimes in and Michael Knowles just clowns her. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3069.36s)]
*  Just absolutely knows the history of the tattoo, including, [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3074.76s)]
*  she's talking about it before it existed before Islam. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3079.76s)]
*  And she's criticizing what it is. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3085.7200000000003s)]
*  And he's like, do you understand that Islam didn't exist when this tattoo, [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3088.2000000000003s)]
*  when this symbol existed? [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3092.5600000000004s)]
*  It's not an anti-Muslim symbol because there was no Muslims when this symbol was created. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3094.8s)]
*  This is bonkers. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3100.6000000000004s)]
*  And they are all in, digging their heels in, pretending, [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3102.92s)]
*  just trying to win this conversation. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3106.5200000000004s)]
*  Just trying to win. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3109.1600000000003s)]
*  And Piers Morgan's doing that. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3110.6800000000003s)]
*  He's like the Jerry Springer of political ideology now. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3111.76s)]
*  He just has people get on the show and yell at each other. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3114.6400000000003s)]
*  It's very entertaining, and he gets great sound bites out of it. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3116.76s)]
*  It's kind of genius in terms of an engagement perspective. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3119.1200000000003s)]
*  If you looked at your show, it's just like, how do I get more engagement? [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3122.52s)]
*  Well, that's how you do it. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3125.64s)]
*  You get some wacky leftists gonna say nutty things. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3127.28s)]
*  You get some right wing persons gonna say nutty things, and [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3129.96s)]
*  you get them all together yelling at each other. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3132.8s)]
*  I wish he did less of that. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3134.48s)]
*  I should say that Piers Morgan, I think, is a great interviewer. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3135.56s)]
*  He's a legit a great interviewer, but he also has, [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3138.2400000000002s)]
*  he can put on his Jerry Springer hat on too. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3142.32s)]
*  He's making money. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3144.16s)]
*  Listen. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3145.4s)]
*  I mean. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3146.16s)]
*  He does both. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3147.12s)]
*  He does do long form, great interviews. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3148.36s)]
*  Sure. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3150.4s)]
*  He's found his lane. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3151.08s)]
*  His lane is Jerry Springer. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3153.1600000000003s)]
*  But he's doing a good job exposing these people. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3154.04s)]
*  It's very valuable. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3157.56s)]
*  That conversation was very valuable for me. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3159.04s)]
*  Cuz this is adorable, watching this guy flounder around, [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3161.36s)]
*  trying to come up with a reason why this tattoo is so offensive. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3165.48s)]
*  Yeah, but see, what I don't like about that is that guy's floundering, but [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3169.2400000000002s)]
*  there could be actually facets to that person outside of this ridiculousness [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3173.8s)]
*  that's interesting. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3177.7200000000003s)]
*  Right, but you gotta cleanse that from your mind, son. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3178.84s)]
*  They do. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3181.72s)]
*  If you wanna be the guy who's on television talking about important issues, [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3182.3199999999997s)]
*  and you've got this stupid thing in your head where you're arguing about [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3187.0s)]
*  a tattoo that you don't even understand. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3189.72s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3191.52s)]
*  You gotta cleanse that stupidity out of your fucking mind. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3192.04s)]
*  Sometimes the best way to do that is to get clowned on television. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3195.04s)]
*  Sure. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3198.56s)]
*  So you got exposed, she got exposed. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3199.08s)]
*  They both looked like morons. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3201.2799999999997s)]
*  And then Michael Nolas, who did a fantastic job of smiling, [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3203.12s)]
*  never raising his voice, calmly explaining it. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3207.8s)]
*  Have you seen it? [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3211.7200000000003s)]
*  No, I haven't. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3212.44s)]
*  See if you can find it, Janet. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3213.1600000000003s)]
*  It's pretty wonderful. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3214.48s)]
*  Michael Nolas is a pro. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3215.36s)]
*  He's a pro. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3217.4s)]
*  The way he handled it was remarkable. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3218.36s)]
*  And I know people criticize that guy, but fucking people criticize everybody. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3220.88s)]
*  I'm just saying, in this moment- [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3224.88s)]
*  Don't read the comments, Joe. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3226.4s)]
*  Yeah, don't read the comments. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3227.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3228.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, even about other people, right? [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3230.44s)]
*  Well, that's the thing. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3232.0800000000004s)]
*  I think you said that, you sometimes read comments from friends of yours. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3233.84s)]
*  Yeah, I don't even like doing that. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3237.6s)]
*  I try not to do that, too. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3239.08s)]
*  This is the thing that bothers me about comments, is I don't read them. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3240.2799999999997s)]
*  But my mom will read them, and she'll text me something like, [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3244.64s)]
*  don't listen to what people say. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3249.3199999999997s)]
*  It's OK. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3250.7999999999997s)]
*  My mom will send me things. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3251.64s)]
*  Is this true? [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3253.12s)]
*  I'm like, mom, come on. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3254.04s)]
*  This is the clip. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3255.72s)]
*  Yeah, this is it. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3256.24s)]
*  He, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3257.24s)]
*  This is wonderful. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3260.96s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3262.04s)]
*  The two people on the far right of the screen, the lady in the pink jacket and [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3262.72s)]
*  the dude with the beard, they're fucked. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3265.92s)]
*  They got cooked. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3267.76s)]
*  You could accuse Pete of as being too alert and energetic. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3268.7200000000003s)]
*  I found it overwhelming, actually, while I was there, tired, trying to dust the sand [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3272.0s)]
*  out of my eyes. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3276.36s)]
*  But you you suggest that the graduate of Princeton and Harvard, who for decades has [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3277.16s)]
*  been in the U.S. military, served his country honorably, that he's somehow [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3282.16s)]
*  unqualified to work at the Pentagon. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3286.12s)]
*  The most egregious accusation you make against him, though, is that he's an [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3289.36s)]
*  extremist because he has a tattoo. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3293.4s)]
*  Could you tell us what the tattoo is? [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3295.36s)]
*  The tattoos specifically, I did not make the allegation that he's an extremist. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3298.6800000000003s)]
*  It was actually you repeated the allegation. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3302.88s)]
*  So what's the tattoo insider threat? [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3304.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3307.56s)]
*  So what's the tattoo? [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3307.92s)]
*  I can tell you it was his fellow. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3308.6s)]
*  I don't have a job. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3310.1200000000003s)]
*  I don't think it's a job. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3311.1600000000003s)]
*  I have a job. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3312.6800000000003s)]
*  You raise a job. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3313.2000000000003s)]
*  I have a job. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3314.48s)]
*  It's a fair question. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3316.2000000000003s)]
*  What is this? [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3317.1600000000003s)]
*  That's what you're talking about. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3317.76s)]
*  It was just calling. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3319.44s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait, wait. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3320.6400000000003s)]
*  Do you think? [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3321.1200000000003s)]
*  I am. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3321.7599999999998s)]
*  What simple question. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3322.2799999999997s)]
*  What is this tattoo that you're so upset about? [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3323.8799999999997s)]
*  I wasn't the one upset about it. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3326.8799999999997s)]
*  I was talking about his fellow colleague. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3328.2s)]
*  This is exactly what I said. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3330.3599999999997s)]
*  His fellow colleague. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3331.2799999999997s)]
*  Do you know what it was? [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3332.12s)]
*  In the U.S. Army called him out as a potential insider threat. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3332.92s)]
*  What is the tattoo? [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3336.68s)]
*  You don't want to answer that. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3337.68s)]
*  What is the tattoo? [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3338.7599999999998s)]
*  I called him an extremist based upon his own book. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3339.72s)]
*  Read the book. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3342.7999999999997s)]
*  What is the tattoo? [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3343.3199999999997s)]
*  His own words. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3344.52s)]
*  If you don't know what the tattoo is, just admit it. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3345.3199999999997s)]
*  Oh, my Lord. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3347.6s)]
*  Listen, this is awesome. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3349.04s)]
*  I want to know what the tattoo is. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3350.04s)]
*  Watch your hands. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3351.04s)]
*  I'm happy to endure. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3352.04s)]
*  No, I'm genuinely intrigued. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3353.04s)]
*  Do you know what it is? [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3354.04s)]
*  We've got a panelist. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3355.04s)]
*  When the lady talks, it's even more brutal. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3356.04s)]
*  She hasn't spoken yet. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3357.04s)]
*  A woman hasn't spoken yet. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3358.04s)]
*  It's genuinely painful. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3359.04s)]
*  A woman hasn't spoken yet. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3360.04s)]

*  Do you? [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3367.04s)]
*  I did hear him answer it, but they were all talking over each other. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3368.04s)]
*  Did he say the words? [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3371.04s)]
*  Yeah, they weren't talking about the cross. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3373.04s)]

*  Yeah, well, she is talking about that as well. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3376.04s)]
*  But it'll go on to that. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3378.04s)]
*  I actually know what that tattoo is or not. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3379.04s)]
*  Listen, what I do know is I read his book. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3382.04s)]
*  Do you? [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3384.04s)]
*  And in his book, if you read it, it's called American Crusade. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3385.04s)]
*  In his book, wait a second. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3387.04s)]
*  Be honest. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3389.04s)]
*  Be honest. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3390.04s)]
*  I am, look. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3391.04s)]
*  This is Jerry Spring. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3392.04s)]
*  I'm running through. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3393.04s)]
*  No one's going to crucify you if you don't know the answer. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3394.04s)]
*  But do you know the answer? [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3397.04s)]
*  Putting our national security at risk for Pete Hexen. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3398.04s)]
*  I am telling you everything, and you guys are finding ways to spend. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3401.04s)]
*  Why are you guys okay with a man who has an NDA with a woman? [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3404.04s)]
*  We're simply asking you, do you know what the tattoo is that you've got so upset about? [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3407.04s)]
*  No, it goes further. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3412.04s)]
*  See if you can find where the woman's speaking, because it gets even more brutal. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3414.04s)]
*  Because she's incorrect, and Michael Knowles corrects her. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3418.04s)]
*  And when he corrects her, it's fucking great. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3421.04s)]
*  It's a good way to expose. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3424.04s)]
*  See if you can find the other one, Jamie. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3425.04s)]
*  Very narrow. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3427.04s)]
*  I'm a change agent and a. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3428.04s)]
*  That's going to be in here. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3430.04s)]
*  I got to figure out where. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3432.04s)]
*  I missed the whole show. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3433.04s)]
*  It's an hour long show. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3434.04s)]
*  Well, I'll talk to them and click right there. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3435.04s)]
*  I'll know where it is. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3437.04s)]
*  What is the what is the answer? [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3440.04s)]
*  This falls along a threat as an insider. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3442.04s)]
*  I'm going back to Michael. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3445.04s)]
*  In 2021, Pete Hexen as a potential insider. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3446.04s)]
*  You had 98 chances to answer and you failed the test. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3449.04s)]
*  I'm going to Michael. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3452.04s)]
*  I'm going to Michael. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3454.04s)]
*  Don't talk over each other. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3455.04s)]
*  Michael. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3456.04s)]
*  The tattoo in question. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3457.04s)]
*  The tattoo in question. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3458.04s)]
*  Here it goes. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3459.04s)]
*  Is called a Jerusalem cross. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3460.04s)]
*  This is a medieval Christian symbol goes back a long time. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3462.04s)]
*  In fact, at Jimmy Carter's funeral, there was a Jerusalem cross on the floor of the [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3465.04s)]
*  cathedral and on the program for the funeral. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3469.04s)]
*  There's one other tattoo that some have suggested could be extremist. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3471.04s)]
*  It's the phrase Deus volt, which is a medieval Christian slogan, a long traditional [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3475.04s)]
*  slogan that refers to God's will. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3480.04s)]
*  And it goes back a long way. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3482.04s)]
*  These are very traditional, very mainstream Christian symbols that not only are not [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3484.04s)]
*  extreme in any way, but which even the people who want to accuse him of extremism [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3489.04s)]
*  couldn't possibly name. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3494.04s)]
*  That is pathetic. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3495.04s)]
*  All right. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3496.04s)]
*  His insider guardsman did it, which is what I said. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3497.04s)]
*  And also I said that he called himself too extreme for the U.S. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3500.04s)]
*  military in his book. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3503.04s)]
*  That's pathetic. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3504.04s)]
*  OK, is Pete Hexen lying that he's too extreme in his book? [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3505.04s)]
*  Let me go to Julie. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3509.04s)]
*  He's been waiting for radical leftists. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3510.04s)]
*  Let me go to Julie. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3512.04s)]
*  Is he lying? [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3513.04s)]
*  Be gentlemanly, please. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3514.04s)]
*  We have a lady who's not spoken. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3515.04s)]
*  Julie, be very patiently. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3517.04s)]
*  Your view of this. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3518.04s)]
*  I'll tell you what, before you answer, I know you said in your substack about this. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3519.04s)]
*  Under normal circumstances, he, Pete Hexen, would be precluded from serving in any leadership [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3524.04s)]
*  role. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3530.04s)]
*  So explain why you said that. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3531.04s)]
*  Well, let me, I will explain in one second. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3534.04s)]
*  Let me go back to something that was said in the very beginning that he spent more than [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3536.04s)]
*  10 years at Fox News, and that's what qualifies him to be in this position that he wants to [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3539.04s)]
*  be in. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3544.04s)]
*  I spent more than 10 years at Fox News. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3546.04s)]
*  I don't think I'm qualified to run the DOD whatsoever based on my time at Fox News. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3548.04s)]
*  I didn't see that as what makes him. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3552.04s)]
*  I said that was one of the things. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3553.04s)]
*  If you, if you, well, I don't think that's even a remote qualification. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3554.04s)]
*  That's one. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3558.04s)]
*  Two. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3559.04s)]
*  Being able to communicate ideas as the Secretary of Defense and explain policy is actually [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3560.04s)]
*  a very big part of the job. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3564.04s)]
*  There are plenty, there are plenty of qualified Republicans out there who can run the DOD [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3565.04s)]
*  who also are good on television. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3571.04s)]
*  It does not need to be Pete Hexeth. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3573.04s)]
*  Secondly, again, you talked about NDAs. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3575.04s)]
*  I am bound by an NDA at Fox News. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3578.04s)]
*  If I were not bound by an NDA and Fox News wanted to release me from that NDA, I could [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3580.04s)]
*  tell you about my time with Pete Hexeth. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3584.04s)]
*  Unfortunately, that's not possible. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3586.04s)]
*  But I will say that the reason that there are so many people who anonymously came forward [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3587.04s)]
*  at Fox News is that because they're also bound by confidentiality provisions, which one [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3591.04s)]
*  third of all American workers need to sign on their first day of work. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3595.04s)]
*  And if they were to go public, they could get sued. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3599.04s)]
*  The reason this accuser is not heard from is because, according to The New Yorker, she [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3602.04s)]
*  tried desperately to meet with Joni Ernst on the committee and Joni Ernst turned her [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3606.04s)]
*  down. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3612.04s)]
*  So the reason that she has not been able to come out publicly is because she has an NDA [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3613.04s)]
*  and even privately she could not meet with a senator on this committee who is also a [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3618.04s)]
*  rape survivor to share her story because that rape survivor did not want to hear from a [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3623.04s)]
*  woman who was going to put her potentially in a position to vote against Pete Hexeth. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3627.04s)]
*  Pete Hexeth has written himself while at Princeton saying that women who are passed out, if you [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3631.04s)]
*  have sex with them while they're unconscious, that's not really rape. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3638.04s)]
*  Right? [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3642.04s)]
*  Now, the American military has a tremendous sexual... [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3643.04s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3647.04s)]
*  Well, it doesn't sound true, but yeah. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3648.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3650.04s)]
*  It's hard to say, but scoot ahead to where they start discussing the tattoo. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3651.04s)]
*  I don't know where to... [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3655.04s)]
*  It's in the same flow. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3656.04s)]
*  It's not that far away. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3658.04s)]
*  This is definitely not a good format though. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3660.04s)]
*  No. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3662.04s)]
*  Well, at least they're letting her talk. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3663.04s)]
*  You can just go have your way with them. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3664.04s)]
*  Not really. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3666.04s)]
*  So I don't know which soldiers you've been talking to who think Pete Hexeth is a great [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3667.04s)]
*  thing for the military. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3670.04s)]
*  There are not... [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3671.04s)]
*  There is not one woman out there who cares about being assaulted on deployment who thinks [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3672.04s)]
*  that this is the person that needs to be in charge of the United States military. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3677.04s)]
*  And as for the cross that you talked about, yes, Davis Volt, which is the cross that he [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3681.04s)]
*  has and the slogan that he has. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3685.04s)]
*  Davis Volt is a phrase. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3687.04s)]
*  It is an old Christian cross. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3688.04s)]
*  The Jerusalem Cross. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3689.04s)]
*  The phrase, excuse me, the phrase. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3690.04s)]
*  The phrase, however, was uttered by crusaders as they were slaughtering Jews and Muslims [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3692.04s)]
*  during the Second Crusade specifically. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3698.04s)]
*  So it's not just a random cross. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3700.04s)]
*  That is not true. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3702.04s)]
*  It's not just a random phrase. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3703.04s)]
*  That is not true. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3704.04s)]
*  The phrase... [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3705.04s)]
*  It's not true. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3706.04s)]
*  It is true. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3707.04s)]
*  The phrase was uttered after the Council of Claremont when Pope Urban II declared the [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3708.04s)]
*  crusade. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3712.04s)]
*  But it's been rendered in Latin as Davis Volt. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3714.04s)]
*  It has nothing to do with slaughtering Jews. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3717.04s)]
*  It has nothing to do with slaughtering Muslims because the Muslims had invaded Europe, not [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3719.04s)]
*  the other way around. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3723.04s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3725.04s)]
*  Are you really saying that the reason the crusade, which was sent to the Holy Land to [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3726.04s)]
*  liberate the Holy Land, from whom? [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3730.04s)]
*  From Jews and Muslims. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3732.04s)]
*  And that is a phrase... [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3734.04s)]
*  The crusade began because the Eastern Emperor... [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3735.04s)]
*  I'll tell you why the crusade began. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3736.04s)]
*  The crusade began because the Eastern Emperor asked for help from the Western Pope because [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3737.04s)]
*  the Seljuk Turks were slaughtering Christians in the Holy Land because those lands were [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3742.04s)]
*  Christian before the Muslims invaded in the 7th century. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3746.04s)]
*  So that's why. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3749.04s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3750.04s)]
*  Those crusades... [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3751.04s)]
*  Good to know Michael's pro-crusade. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3752.04s)]
*  You'll get along really well with Peter Dixon. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3753.04s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3754.04s)]
*  Those lands... [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3755.04s)]
*  No, no. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3756.04s)]
*  Keep going. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3757.04s)]
*  Those lands became Christian after the first crusade, okay? [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3758.04s)]
*  So let's be very clear. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3761.04s)]
*  No, no. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3762.04s)]
*  The lands were Christian in the first and second centuries and then the Muslims... [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3763.04s)]
*  Islam didn't exist before the 7th century. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3767.04s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3769.04s)]
*  Okay. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3770.04s)]
*  Listen, listen. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3771.04s)]
*  See? [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3772.04s)]
*  I can go all day if you want to talk about the crusades, but the point is... [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3773.04s)]
*  I gotta use your literature. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3776.04s)]
*  Okay. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3777.04s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3778.04s)]
*  Michael was quite fascinating, actually. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3779.04s)]
*  Maybe we should switch the debate. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3780.04s)]
*  But what that has to do with Pete... what that has to do with Pete Hexeth is it's not [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3781.04s)]
*  that he has a random cross that talks about his faith in Jesus Christ. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3784.68s)]
*  He used a very specific terminology. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3788.56s)]
*  But putting all of that aside... [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3791.08s)]
*  A phrase that was first uttered to defend persecuted Christians in the Middle East just [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3792.08s)]
*  like they're being persecuted today. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3794.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3796.44s)]
*  Okay. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3797.44s)]
*  And that's who you want as the Secretary of Defense. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3798.84s)]
*  Wonderful. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3800.84s)]
*  Yes, someone who defends the person... [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3801.84s)]
*  If you want to talk about the crusades... [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3802.84s)]
*  Judy, finish your point and I'll go to Michael... to Dave. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3803.84s)]
*  My point is that I cannot even believe that something the Vatican apologized for is something [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3808.84s)]
*  you're defending, which is the slaughter of Jews and Muslims during the crusades. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3814.2000000000003s)]
*  What did the Vatican apologize for? [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3818.0s)]
*  Excuse me. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3819.0s)]
*  The Vatican said the crusade... [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3820.0s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3821.0s)]
*  Oh, my Jesus. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3822.0s)]
*  You know what? [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3823.0s)]
*  Why don't you give me a call after this and I will walk you through exactly what the Vatican [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3824.0s)]
*  apologized for. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3826.0s)]
*  All right. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3827.0s)]
*  Time out. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3828.56s)]
*  Time out. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3829.56s)]
*  We'll do a separate crusade debate another time. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3830.56s)]
*  Let me bring Dave Rubin in. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3832.56s)]
*  The worst way to have conversations about important things... [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3834.36s)]
*  I'm getting a headache from this. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3836.52s)]
*  Fuck these people. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3838.36s)]
*  Fuck that whole panel. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3839.36s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3840.36s)]
*  But you can't talk like this. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3841.36s)]
*  Each of those individual people... [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3844.12s)]
*  I'm not sure about the second government... [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3845.56s)]
*  Even the woman would be a fascinating four or five-hour conversation. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3848.04s)]
*  Yes. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3851.08s)]
*  You should probably have her on. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3852.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3853.08s)]
*  Well, her and McEnals and Piers Morgan, yes. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3854.08s)]
*  I'm so exhausted with this fucking bullshit. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3857.92s)]
*  I know. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3860.7400000000002s)]
*  I'm angry right now. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3861.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3862.7400000000002s)]
*  I want to play more for you. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3863.7400000000002s)]
*  Published a column saying, sex with unconscious women isn't rape. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3866.9s)]
*  Jesus. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3870.62s)]
*  Imagine not just thinking that but publishing it. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3871.62s)]
*  What did he actually say? [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3876.42s)]
*  If you want to read it, we can read it. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3877.42s)]
*  Well, rape, in quotes, intercourse. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3880.42s)]
*  The musing yet mandatory orientation program revolved entirely around whether in an instance [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3884.66s)]
*  of sexual intercourse constituted rape. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3889.8999999999996s)]
*  The actual instance portrayed in the skit was in fact... [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3893.3399999999997s)]
*  Oh, it was a skit? [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3896.98s)]
*  In fact, not a clear case of rape, at least not in my home state. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3899.2999999999997s)]
*  So this is Hexis saying this. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3902.7799999999997s)]
*  In short, though intercourse was not consented to, there was no duress because the girl drank [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3904.94s)]
*  herself into unconsciousness. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3909.42s)]
*  Both criteria must be satisfied for rape. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3911.3399999999997s)]
*  Unfortunately, the panelists never cited any legal definition of rape. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3914.02s)]
*  Yet the panel, all females in the session I attended, claimed that rape it was. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3918.14s)]
*  Huh. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3923.14s)]
*  What year was this? [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3924.38s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3925.38s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3926.38s)]
*  So are they talking about... [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3927.38s)]
*  This is what's confusing. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3928.38s)]
*  Are they talk... [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3929.38s)]
*  It says a skit and then it says they're talking about a legal definition of rape. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3930.38s)]
*  Has the legal definition changed over the years? [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3937.14s)]
*  When was this? [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3940.5s)]
*  Is he talking about a legal definition or is he talking about his own opinion? [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3941.9s)]
*  There's a giant difference between the two of them, right? [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3945.38s)]
*  Especially if you take it something out of context. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3947.54s)]
*  You don't know if he elaborated. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3949.62s)]
*  Article for his college newspaper stating that having sex with unconscious women isn't [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3951.78s)]
*  rape because the criteria for rape isn't met. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3955.42s)]
*  So this is in his college newspaper. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3959.5s)]
*  So how old is he? [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3961.18s)]
*  Is he like 50? [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3962.18s)]
*  How old is Pete Hegseth? [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3964.1s)]
*  Yeah, he's up there, right? [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3965.1s)]
*  Which is really weird to think that... [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3970.82s)]
*  44. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3973.34s)]
*  So college would have been around 2000-ish? [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3974.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3977.34s)]
*  I remember in 2000-ish, I remember when we were doing the podcast, there was a brief [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3978.34s)]
*  moment of time where people were talking about if a man had sex with a woman and they had [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3985.02s)]
*  both been drinking, that it was rape. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3990.6600000000003s)]
*  That the woman could not consent because she was drunk. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3993.82s)]
*  But the man's drunk too, right? [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=3997.6200000000003s)]
*  So it gets weird. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4000.1s)]
*  We understand traditionally men are pursuing women and that applying someone with alcohol [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4001.74s)]
*  is a famous thing that people do. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4008.46s)]
*  It's kind of a weird legal thing. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4012.06s)]
*  Come on, one more drink. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4014.02s)]
*  Have another drink. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4015.02s)]
*  Have another drink. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4016.02s)]
*  And we all know that when people get drunk, they do stupid shit. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4017.14s)]
*  But we don't know what happened if you're both drunk. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4020.7s)]
*  So this is what I'm getting at is that 2000, these conversations are already being had. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4027.02s)]
*  The question is like, is he saying this from his personal perspective? [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4032.22s)]
*  Or is he saying it from a legal perspective? [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4037.72s)]
*  I don't know what else was in the text. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4040.1s)]
*  I'm trying to be as charitable as possible. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4041.9s)]
*  Because if more was in the... [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4044.22s)]
*  That's a reprehensible act. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4046.5s)]
*  Did he say anything like that? [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4048.3s)]
*  Or was it just specifically talking about the legal definition? [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4050.06s)]
*  Because he said in his state, right? [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4054.18s)]
*  Also, it says to be clear, he did not write it himself. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4056.62s)]
*  He published it. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4060.5s)]
*  That's what this says. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4063.5s)]
*  In short, he did not publish such a column while he held the role of publisher. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4064.5s)]
*  He did not write it himself. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4070.58s)]
*  He did not write it. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4071.58s)]
*  It was written by someone else. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4072.58s)]
*  So he just published someone's opinions. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4074.62s)]
*  That's very different. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4078.4199999999996s)]
*  That's very, very, very different. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4080.02s)]
*  She said he said that. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4082.54s)]
*  That's not what he said at all. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4084.7799999999997s)]
*  See that right there. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4087.1s)]
*  I'm just so exhausted. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4088.1s)]
*  That's exhausting. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4089.7799999999997s)]
*  Both like the thing about Trump with both sides. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4090.7799999999997s)]
*  But that right there is crazy because my opinion of him shifted briefly when I was looking... [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4092.98s)]
*  I was watching Daniel Negrano, the great poker player, was on Tim Poole's show. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4098.5s)]
*  And they were talking about his shift in political ideologies. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4103.74s)]
*  And then a lot of it came from when they were accusing Trump of saying that thing that Obama [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4107.94s)]
*  repeated falsely during the campaign was that he was talking about white nationalists and [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4115.219999999999s)]
*  neo-Nazis and saying there's very fine people on both sides. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4122.7s)]
*  And Negrano had heard that. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4126.179999999999s)]
*  He had heard the clip where Trump said it, where it was edited. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4128.46s)]
*  He had never seen the full thing. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4131.58s)]
*  And then once he saw the full thing, he was like, what the fuck? [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4133.219999999999s)]
*  And it immediately made him realize, oh my God, they're lying. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4137.18s)]
*  They're lying. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4140.660000000001s)]
*  And then he talked about how Obama repeated... [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4141.860000000001s)]
*  This is years after Daniel had known it was false. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4144.54s)]
*  Obama repeating it at the campaign speeches. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4148.54s)]
*  And then Obama sitting right next to Trump and they're joking around with each other. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4151.9800000000005s)]
*  Hey, pal, I know you're a neo-Nazi lover. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4154.860000000001s)]
*  You fucking rascal, I had you win. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4157.9400000000005s)]
*  What that lady did on that show, and then when we find out that Hegseth didn't actually [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4162.94s)]
*  write that, he just published it. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4167.5s)]
*  And he published it in college as a 20-year-old or whatever he was. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4170.26s)]
*  I think there should be also room for that lady to then change her mind and apologize. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4175.3s)]
*  Because a lot of us parrot, including probably you and I. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4180.26s)]
*  Never. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4184.66s)]
*  How dare you? [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4185.66s)]
*  Parrot bullshit we see online. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4186.66s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4187.98s)]
*  And then we should give each other room to say, I fucked up. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4189.459999999999s)]
*  People don't want to say that. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4193.58s)]
*  This is what they have to understand. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4195.2s)]
*  Even people I don't like, listen to me. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4196.639999999999s)]
*  There's strength in that. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4199.74s)]
*  It's better than digging your heels in. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4201.9s)]
*  There's strength in saying, I was uninformed or I was misinformed. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4204.5s)]
*  I fucked up. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4208.459999999999s)]
*  I've said it before. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4209.459999999999s)]
*  It's important to do. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4210.86s)]
*  You got to do it. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4211.86s)]
*  Because you can't have an erroneous idea in your head and repeat it over and over again. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4212.86s)]
*  You can't have an incorrect, false opinion that you have defended and now you can't ever [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4216.5s)]
*  accept even with new information that shows that it's not true. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4222.62s)]
*  I should also say, because it's fucking sitting in my head on this topic, I'm probably going [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4226.54s)]
*  to do a five-plus-hour interview with Jack Weatherford on Genghis Khan. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4233.06s)]
*  And I read his book. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4238.26s)]
*  And I'm not proud of the way I formulated my for the fuck of it. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4239.86s)]
*  In the beginning of it? [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4244.78s)]
*  In the beginning, I'm still bothered by the looseness with which I talked about rape. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4246.0599999999995s)]
*  And I don't think I have in me the eloquence or the skill to improve on that. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4253.98s)]
*  I think in general, it's trying to find the right words to describe the historically accurate [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4260.0599999999995s)]
*  thing, the data that we have, and then the narratives. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4269.54s)]
*  I think the point Jack Weatherford makes is that we keep oscillating back and forth on Genghis Khan. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4276.22s)]
*  He's this epic, great conqueror. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4281.22s)]
*  Currently Alexander the Great has that good vibes all around him. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4285.02s)]
*  Nobody talks about him as a horrible human. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4289.26s)]
*  Horrible human. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4291.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4292.9s)]
*  But currently, Genghis Khan has this kind of barbarian, evil, just rapist. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4293.9s)]
*  Well, they're so good at it. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4301.5s)]
*  They were so good at murder. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4303.9s)]
*  They were so good at war. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4305.299999999999s)]
*  I mean, just so uniquely good at military strategy. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4306.299999999999s)]
*  So it's about, it always kept the army to about 100,000. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4310.219999999999s)]
*  It's small. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4314.299999999999s)]
*  So it's 100,000 horse. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4315.7s)]
*  Each soldier had five horses, so four spare horses with them. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4317.179999999999s)]
*  So imagine it's 500,000 horses. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4320.86s)]
*  Which they use their blood to fuel them. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4322.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah, they would consume their blood. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4324.5s)]
*  They use that for food. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4325.5s)]
*  So it's very portable. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4327.0199999999995s)]
*  They're not bringing, logistically, the whole, I mean, just imagine this armada moving at [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4328.099999999999s)]
*  like, they can move like 50 miles a day. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4335.02s)]
*  This entire army, and they don't have to follow the roads, which all the military would follow [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4339.54s)]
*  the roads. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4344.02s)]
*  So you can go around, you can surround, you can, and they did the, as you know, they can [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4345.02s)]
*  retreat, feign retreat, and then attack from the sides. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4348.66s)]
*  It's the blitzkrieg that's the- [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4353.06s)]
*  Genius stuff. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4354.78s)]
*  And a lot of people, including Dan Carlin, say it's the greatest military in history. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4356.14s)]
*  It would defeat every single military, including Napoleon. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4360.94s)]
*  With the muskets and everything. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4365.38s)]
*  They would destroy Napoleon, and then of course in the 20th century. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4366.38s)]
*  You know what they didn't defeat? [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4369.62s)]
*  Samurais. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4371.62s)]
*  Right, but they never really fought. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4372.62s)]
*  They did. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4376.14s)]
*  Twice they fought, but it's not a real battle. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4377.14s)]
*  These guys are fucking crazy. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4379.06s)]
*  They thought they were crazy. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4381.5s)]
*  These guys were like practicing their whole lives for one-on-one combat with swords. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4382.62s)]
*  As far as I know, they never really had a full-on battle. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4387.66s)]
*  I wish they did. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4389.74s)]
*  There were some battles. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4390.74s)]
*  There were battles on an island, one of the islands outside of Japan, but the Japanese [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4392.0599999999995s)]
*  successfully held off the Mongols. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4395.3s)]
*  And they were like one of the only civilizations to ever pull that off. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4397.139999999999s)]
*  I think one of the issues with the Mongols, except Kublai Khan, is they were not good [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4400.74s)]
*  with water. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4405.7s)]
*  They didn't know how to, the ship thing was not- [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4406.7s)]
*  Oh. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4408.46s)]
*  What a big mistake. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4409.46s)]
*  Imagine if they got as good with water as they were with horses. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4411.46s)]
*  That would have been a real problem. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4414.7s)]
*  Well, a lot of things they had advantage on, like for example, they could ride on ice. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4415.7s)]
*  And so- [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4419.5s)]
*  How'd they do that? [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4420.5s)]
*  They, in Mongolia, these people like ride horses- [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4422.26s)]
*  Did they have different horseshoes? [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4425.5s)]
*  Did they even shoe their horses back then? [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4426.5s)]
*  No, I don't think so. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4428.9s)]
*  Really? [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4429.9s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4430.9s)]
*  It's all, like they don't have- [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4431.9s)]
*  When did they start shoeing horses? [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4432.9s)]
*  That's a good question. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4434.9s)]
*  But that doesn't feel like a Mongol thing. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4437.9s)]
*  I mean, people can ride the mounted archery. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4439.9s)]
*  Oh my god. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4442.9s)]
*  I'm sure you know about this. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4443.9s)]
*  The mounted archery is so insane. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4445.42s)]
*  They had the ability to hang off the side of the horse so they would shoot from under [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4447.5s)]
*  the horse's neck. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4452.0s)]
*  So they were completely defended by the horse and they were shooting arrows. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4453.54s)]
*  And their bows were 160 pounds. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4458.14s)]
*  So you had to be- [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4461.42s)]
*  They said that a lot of the skeletons they find from that era, their bones are deformed [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4462.42s)]
*  because your whole body has just been pulling 160 pounds with your right arm or your left [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4468.74s)]
*  arm like your whole life. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4474.06s)]
*  So your right side is like insanely muscled and your bones are all twisted and thicker [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4476.14s)]
*  and denser tendons and everything because they've been doing that since they were children. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4483.8s)]
*  They were- [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4488.02s)]
*  They started out at like two years old. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4489.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4490.02s)]
*  Insanely formidable army. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4491.02s)]
*  Insanely formidable. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4492.02s)]
*  But here's something to take into consideration when we're saying about how Genghis Khan's [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4493.02s)]
*  genes were spread. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4498.1s)]
*  Just right off the bat, it's all awful. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4502.700000000001s)]
*  All horrible. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4504.900000000001s)]
*  No one ever got killed by anybody ever. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4506.66s)]
*  It's all awful. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4507.82s)]
*  All war is hell. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4508.82s)]
*  All of it. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4509.82s)]
*  All is hell. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4510.82s)]
*  There was so much of it going on throughout human history that women would- there was [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4512.339999999999s)]
*  a survival mechanism in accepting this conqueror as your new husband when he slaughtered your [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4519.679999999999s)]
*  husband. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4527.259999999999s)]
*  This is the only way your genes passed on. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4528.259999999999s)]
*  So these women were able- I mean, even if they said they fell in love with him, even [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4530.62s)]
*  if they did marry him, even if they were happy to marry him, there was almost an evolutionary [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4535.82s)]
*  requirement because we slaughtered each other so much that if you wanted your genes to pass [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4543.219999999999s)]
*  on you had to accept the slaughter of your former mate. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4549.0599999999995s)]
*  In modern day society we would call that rape. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4553.299999999999s)]
*  But it's- you have to use different words for that time because there is rape where [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4556.259999999999s)]
*  as violent, rape as part of war, as part of a mechanism of terror. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4563.7s)]
*  I think even as just part of society up until a few thousand years ago or even a few hundred [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4568.78s)]
*  years ago, I think human beings- I've had a bunch of friends who've served overseas [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4574.94s)]
*  and the stories they tell from Afghanistan, especially with the child raping, is fucking [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4582.0199999999995s)]
*  bone-curdling. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4589.54s)]
*  Bone-curdling, you just want to leave the room when they're talking. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4591.82s)]
*  You don't even want to hear this. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4596.0599999999995s)]
*  You don't want to think that this is happening and it's happening right now because it's [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4597.0599999999995s)]
*  an old culture. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4600.78s)]
*  It's an old culture and it's separate from the rest of the world. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4603.2s)]
*  It's very remote, very difficult to access. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4606.9s)]
*  You have warlords and herders who are living in these nomadic tribes to this day. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4609.9s)]
*  Not much different than when Alexander the Great conquered it. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4615.0599999999995s)]
*  So I should say that Genghis Khan, from everything I understand, was not progressive but he was [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4617.68s)]
*  very pragmatic. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4624.12s)]
*  This is why he- [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4625.64s)]
*  Allowed all religions. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4626.9400000000005s)]
*  All religions, which is Thomas Jefferson, I should say, deeply admired Genghis Khan for [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4628.400000000001s)]
*  this, the freedom of religion. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4634.88s)]
*  And he didn't just say freedom of religion, it's freedom of an individual to practice [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4636.16s)]
*  any religion they want, which is like individualism. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4640.9800000000005s)]
*  It's a really revolutionary, badass idea for that time, for that place. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4644.84s)]
*  Well he recognized strength and the value of accepting strength and taking it. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4649.52s)]
*  And there's strength in unity. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4655.4800000000005s)]
*  There's strength in community. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4656.88s)]
*  If people can worship whatever they want but all be united under one banner, it's better [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4657.88s)]
*  than dividing everybody. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4663.320000000001s)]
*  In the feminist thing that I mentioned, he would put women in power. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4665.6s)]
*  Why? [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4670.240000000001s)]
*  Is he a feminist? [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4671.240000000001s)]
*  No. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4672.240000000001s)]
*  He said that women are able to- men conquer better, in his perspective, and women rule [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4673.24s)]
*  better because they keep a stable society. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4680.04s)]
*  So he would do- he would marry a woman to the king of the place and then send the king [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4682.8s)]
*  off to fight, the ruler to fight, knowing for sure he's going to die. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4690.92s)]
*  But the woman is now ruling. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4695.28s)]
*  And then there's a lot of progressive things about- there were a lot to show their face, [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4697.46s)]
*  especially in the Persian lands where they conquered. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4701.68s)]
*  They're allowed to wear these fancy headdresses. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4704.4400000000005s)]
*  They could floss a little. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4708.76s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4710.72s)]
*  I'm excited about that. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4711.72s)]
*  New rules. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4712.72s)]
*  And the other thing, on the- the tricky thing is the Mongolian tribes, where Genghis Khan [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4713.72s)]
*  came up, by the way, came up from nothing. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4724.240000000001s)]
*  Father slaughtered. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4727.240000000001s)]
*  I mean, this is from nothing. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4728.8s)]
*  They all- that was a common practice to steal wives, to steal women. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4732.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4736.24s)]
*  Well, he had one of his wives stolen and she came back pregnant. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4737.24s)]
*  That was like the origin story. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4740.0s)]
*  The origin story of Genghis Khan, right, is like his- the love of his life, who was married [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4743.76s)]
*  to him for his whole life that he proposed, or he said, you're gonna- we're gonna marry [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4749.5599999999995s)]
*  at nine years old. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4755.04s)]
*  He was kidnapped and he had to raise an army in order to rescue her back. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4758.360000000001s)]
*  That was the sort of the split in the road. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4764.8s)]
*  He would have been a normal Mongol, but here he has to raise an army to rescue her back. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4768.64s)]
*  And then he realized he's really fucking good at this whole rescue thing. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4773.68s)]
*  But it started with, you know- [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4777.88s)]
*  That's so crazy. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4779.88s)]
*  It's a real love story. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4780.88s)]
*  You know- [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4781.88s)]
*  What? [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4782.88s)]
*  What I could find is that the horses were unshoe-ed. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4783.88s)]
*  Un-shoed. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4784.88s)]
*  They did do something that this says here. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4785.96s)]
*  They used some sort of skin to cover it. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4787.96s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4790.56s)]
*  Allow to dry in place in order to acquire the shape of a hoof. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4791.56s)]
*  Perfect the technique to cover the hoof, which offered greater abilities to their armies [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4795.16s)]
*  to move faster and more efficiently than their opponents. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4798.88s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4801.400000000001s)]
*  Horseshoes were around for at least two or three hundred years before them, so they probably [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4802.400000000001s)]
*  knew about them. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4805.88s)]
*  Skins. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4806.88s)]
*  That's interesting. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4807.88s)]
*  What you're saying about him developing the ability and like really, hey, I'm really good [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4808.88s)]
*  at this. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4812.52s)]
*  Do you know the Somali Pirates origin story? [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4814.160000000001s)]
*  No. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4818.400000000001s)]
*  The Somali Pirates called themselves the People's Coast Guard of Somalia. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4819.400000000001s)]
*  They were defending their waters against Europeans dumping toxic waste in the ocean. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4824.080000000001s)]
*  They were fishermen. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4829.400000000001s)]
*  So they had found that these ships were dumping water and killing all their fish and said [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4830.92s)]
*  these motherfuckers, we're going to hold them responsible. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4836.6s)]
*  So they boarded these ships, kidnapped them and said, hey, you have to pay us. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4839.48s)]
*  We've lost all this money from all our fish. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4843.76s)]
*  We don't have any fish. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4846.24s)]
*  Give us money or we'll kill these motherfuckers. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4847.48s)]
*  And they gave them money and they said, hey, let's start kidnapping people. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4849.96s)]
*  This is way better. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4854.68s)]
*  And then, you know, there's obviously there's a narcotic aspect to it because of cat, because [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4856.24s)]
*  the widespread use of this narcotic cat, which is like an amphetamine that they get. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4860.68s)]
*  Is it a leaf? [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4865.84s)]
*  K-H-A-T? [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4866.84s)]
*  That's like, you know, the guy on the boat. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4868.68s)]
*  Look at me. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4870.72s)]
*  I'm the captain now. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4871.72s)]
*  That guy's cracked out. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4873.08s)]
*  I mean, they're all real skinny. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4874.52s)]
*  And what's really important in that dynamic is who is the leader that emerges. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4877.32s)]
*  That's the interesting thing about Genghis Khan. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4880.4400000000005s)]
*  He became super powerful. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4882.360000000001s)]
*  That person could have been incompetent. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4884.4400000000005s)]
*  Genghis Khan could have been a bunch of different people. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4887.68s)]
*  He instilled one of the really revolutionary things is meritocracy. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4889.96s)]
*  By the way, he appointed his kids, several people, including Marcus Aurelius wrote fancy [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4894.0s)]
*  meditations. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4901.64s)]
*  He failed as emperor by appointing his kids. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4903.72s)]
*  Before him, the five emperors all appointed generals based on merit. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4909.4400000000005s)]
*  So Genghis Khan always appointed based on merit. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4915.56s)]
*  Who's the best person here to lead the groups? [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4917.96s)]
*  Which is a revolutionary idea for the time because it was usually based on kin, like [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4922.86s)]
*  your relationship, your brothers, your sisters, your father, and so on. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4927.46s)]
*  That was really important. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4930.54s)]
*  And the other thing I mentioned is about the tribes, the origin story is everybody would [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4932.259999999999s)]
*  kidnap and actual rape the women. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4937.78s)]
*  They would steal women in the Mongol Empire. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4941.259999999999s)]
*  As soon as he won over the entire original Mongolia, he banned. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4944.099999999999s)]
*  That was a strict rule. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4950.54s)]
*  There's no kidnapping of wives. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4952.18s)]
*  That was a rule for Mongolia and that rule propagated everywhere. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4954.1s)]
*  That's wild. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4958.620000000001s)]
*  It's like, this is what got us into this shit. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4959.620000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4961.540000000001s)]
*  So which is one of the pieces of evidence where they're like, it's like there was a lot of [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4962.540000000001s)]
*  cracking down on the whole rape thing. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4966.780000000001s)]
*  But there's a caveat of like, well, why is there so many dead bodies where like the atmosphere [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4969.540000000001s)]
*  changed? [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4975.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4976.9800000000005s)]
*  Why is the carbon footprint different than the human race during the time that he was [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4977.9800000000005s)]
*  alive? [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4980.9800000000005s)]
*  It's interesting because we also have to look at things in a perspective of living in the [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4982.94s)]
*  year 1200 or what is it? [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4987.0199999999995s)]
*  1240s? [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4989.0199999999995s)]
*  Like when was he around? [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4990.0199999999995s)]
*  I should know this 12 or 13. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4991.0199999999995s)]
*  So yeah, well, Jamie will find out. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4996.0599999999995s)]
*  So you have to, it's very hard to do and it's not apologizing for these people. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=4998.66s)]
*  I'm not like saying that we should apply the way they looked at the world today. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5002.82s)]
*  I think the way we look at the world is infinitely better and we're moving in an infinitely better [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5006.339999999999s)]
*  direction. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5010.139999999999s)]
*  I think we have like large extremes that go in one direction and things push back in the [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5011.3s)]
*  other direction too far. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5015.700000000001s)]
*  There's an overcorrection and then they balance out. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5016.860000000001s)]
*  I think we're generally moving in a direction of a more kind, more peaceful society. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5019.34s)]
*  I think we're better. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5025.14s)]
*  That said, 1200 years ago, the world was hell. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5026.900000000001s)]
*  There was no newspapers. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5030.18s)]
*  No one could read. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5031.22s)]
*  Okay. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5032.22s)]
*  Where did you get your information from? [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5033.22s)]
*  You got your information from priests and from generals and you know, you shared information [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5034.22s)]
*  with your farmers. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5038.42s)]
*  The world was horrific. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5041.14s)]
*  People fought with bows and arrows and cannons and catapults and murder was commonplace. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5043.34s)]
*  If you were 12 years old, you'd probably seen a few people killed already. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5050.02s)]
*  It was a different time to be alive. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5054.08s)]
*  Diseases would kill everybody. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5056.9s)]
*  There was no medicine. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5058.3s)]
*  You broke your leg, you're dead. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5059.78s)]
*  You know, you get infected, you're dead. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5061.66s)]
*  It was just, the world was a very, very different place. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5064.12s)]
*  It was so, so dangerous and so fucking terrifying and people relied on their base instincts [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5068.96s)]
*  and the worst aspects of humanity. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5075.599999999999s)]
*  They relied on that to survive because that was all around you. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5079.44s)]
*  You had to become a monster if you wanted to live in monstrous times. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5083.28s)]
*  That's why the rule of law had to be enforced in a brutal way. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5087.5199999999995s)]
*  One of the really powerful things he did is protect merchants, people that traded. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5092.32s)]
*  If you fuck with people that trade, that on the Silk Road, you're going to get slaughtered. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5096.04s)]
*  It's not like there's going to be a process, you get slaughtered. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5103.28s)]
*  In fact, one of the reasons, I hesitate to say this because people are projecting to [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5107.04s)]
*  the future, but he slaughtered, he took Kiev and slaughtered people because they broke [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5114.5599999999995s)]
*  the rule of, I forget the term for this, but the people that are sent out to communicate [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5121.28s)]
*  before the battle starts. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5127.32s)]
*  The ambassadors. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5129.0s)]
*  The ambassadors. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5130.0s)]
*  The rule is you don't fuck with them. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5131.28s)]
*  The Kievan residents killed them. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5134.639999999999s)]
*  That's where you break the rule, it's like that's it. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5139.08s)]
*  Then it's total war. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5143.12s)]
*  You had to do that. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5144.599999999999s)]
*  I mean, you don't have to do that, but that is one of the- [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5145.599999999999s)]
*  Well, if you're living back then, you have to do that. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5148.4s)]
*  But the result is complete slaughter. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5154.4s)]
*  By the way, thank you for rescuing me. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5156.2s)]
*  I said a bunch of stupid shit, and you're adding more complexity and depth and nuance. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5162.48s)]
*  Well, we just got started. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5167.4s)]
*  I love you, brother. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5169.4s)]
*  I love you too. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5170.4s)]
*  I love you to death, man. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5171.4s)]
*  You know how you, when you begin a podcast, I don't know if you're like this, but for [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5172.88s)]
*  me, I got to get cooking. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5178.28s)]
*  Sometimes that's one of the reasons why I like to talk to people. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5181.72s)]
*  I like to talk sometimes like 15 minutes even before we go on air. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5183.8s)]
*  The danger is they're going to say something and I'm going to ask them to repeat it. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5186.92s)]
*  I don't want that. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5189.96s)]
*  So sometimes I'll come in hot and I'm like, let's just go right now. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5191.12s)]
*  But you don't know we're going to talk about the Mongols and rape. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5195.48s)]
*  And so then all of a sudden, we're in this very intense conversation about the responsibility [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5201.2s)]
*  you have as a podcaster, which is a crazy thing to say, but you do, you have probably [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5207.64s)]
*  more responsibility than anybody. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5211.64s)]
*  And then this subject comes up in the middle of that. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5213.76s)]
*  And then you will like, uh, and before that, we were joking about ejaculating in space. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5217.56s)]
*  Yeah, that's how we started it. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5224.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, bro. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5225.84s)]
*  I mean, we used to have open up some of the most serious conversations this podcast ever [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5226.84s)]
*  had with a flashlight ad. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5230.84s)]
*  Yeah, their early days of the podcast. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5232.84s)]
*  That was the only sponsor we had. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5236.04s)]
*  So it's like, um, you know, this is again, you reacting to criticism, right? [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5238.16s)]
*  It's like the fear of the criticism of you yourself, knowing you could have done a better [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5246.2s)]
*  job of explaining that had you prepared something, which is really the difference between off [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5251.68s)]
*  the cuff conversations and like your, your actual well considered thoughts on things [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5256.96s)]
*  expressed in the best way possible, which is what you would do if you're going to write [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5263.780000000001s)]
*  it out, if you're going to write a sub stack piece about it. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5266.38s)]
*  Well, one of the things I'm trying to do for myself personally, I think a lot of people [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5268.62s)]
*  have to do this when young kids have to do this is figure out how to create like a psychological [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5272.02s)]
*  framework where I'm not affected by the internet. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5277.38s)]
*  It sounds like ridiculous to say, but you say, don't read the comments, but they, they [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5281.740000000001s)]
*  get, they come at you like they, they'll find their way. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5285.54s)]
*  And I need to, but it doesn't work. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5289.3s)]
*  Nobody's good at it. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5293.14s)]
*  Even Elon's not good at it. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5294.14s)]
*  Just post and ghost, post and ghost, post things that you think are interesting and just get [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5295.26s)]
*  out of there. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5300.38s)]
*  Don't read stuff about yourself. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5301.38s)]
*  Someone said this, I think it was Anthony Hopkins. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5302.82s)]
*  He was talking about someone's opinion of him. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5304.14s)]
*  He said, uh, that doesn't concern me. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5305.94s)]
*  Uh, no, wasn't Anthony Hopkins. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5308.0199999999995s)]
*  I think it was, but he was like, um, their opinions of me are not my business. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5310.38s)]
*  But let's, let's add to this little puzzle. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5316.0199999999995s)]
*  What if a bunch of your friends say you're getting canceled online? [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5318.86s)]
*  By the way, Tucker Carlson is good at this. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5322.02s)]
*  He doesn't read anything. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5323.42s)]
*  Yeah. He doesn't even have social media. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5325.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5326.860000000001s)]
*  I know. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5327.860000000001s)]
*  I always want to send him things like this. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5328.860000000001s)]
*  Motherfuckers. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5329.860000000001s)]
*  I don't even look at this. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5330.860000000001s)]
*  Uh, what if like all your friends have read the thing, right? [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5331.860000000001s)]
*  Like that your, or your parents or so on your loved ones, like, and they're, the thing [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5336.26s)]
*  could be just a bunch of lies about you. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5343.46s)]
*  Sure. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5346.1s)]
*  Like what that's a, that like for me, that's a little bit of a tricky thing. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5347.1s)]
*  Well, that's not something you should ignore, right? [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5351.179999999999s)]
*  If you want to make a statement, there's nothing wrong with that. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5353.0599999999995s)]
*  What I'm saying is don't regularly, regularly engage in people's opinions of the product [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5355.54s)]
*  that you put out. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5361.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5362.0599999999995s)]
*  I don't think it's healthy for you because I think, first of all, does, you know, I've [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5363.0599999999995s)]
*  said this before, I'm only kind of joking, but I'm kind of serious. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5366.46s)]
*  Most people commenting are losers. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5370.339999999999s)]
*  Sorry. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5372.5s)]
*  If you're doing it all the time and you're doing it in a negative way all the time, this [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5373.759999999999s)]
*  is not everybody. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5376.82s)]
*  There's a lot of like really well thought out commentary on YouTube videos that I see [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5378.179999999999s)]
*  on if occasionally I'll read someone's Instagram page and I'll read my friends comments. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5382.139999999999s)]
*  Some people are brilliant. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5387.82s)]
*  Don't get me wrong, but it is a haven for fuckheads. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5389.0199999999995s)]
*  It's a place where people can go and just try to insult people and say the most negative [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5393.46s)]
*  thing possible. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5398.46s)]
*  And they generally, I think there's generally a lot of like dull minded people that gravitate [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5399.9s)]
*  towards the negativity. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5406.86s)]
*  You know, where that differs is Christians, which is interesting. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5408.98s)]
*  Like a lot of like low wattage Christians are still super nice, you know, and they'll [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5414.0599999999995s)]
*  just praise Jesus and look for forgiveness, the real ones, right? [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5420.9s)]
*  Which is a great thing that we should all aspire to. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5424.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, like the default state is super nice. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5425.78s)]
*  Yes, the default state. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5427.78s)]
*  What you're supposed to do if you really follow Jesus's teaching is like be completely nonviolent [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5429.299999999999s)]
*  and be a beautiful person and love everybody like it's your brother. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5433.58s)]
*  That's what he wants. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5437.42s)]
*  That's like, you know, and if you follow that, but there's just too many assholes and too [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5438.9s)]
*  many disgruntled people out there that have terrible lives. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5444.98s)]
*  You know, the most manly lives of quiet desperation, the Thoreau line that I fucking love so dearly. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5448.42s)]
*  It's such a great line. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5454.54s)]
*  That's so true and maybe even more true today because of the unnatural world in which we're [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5455.98s)]
*  thrust in. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5462.68s)]
*  So not only are people doing things that they hate most of the time, but they're also engaging [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5463.68s)]
*  with their phone more than they are with people. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5469.4400000000005s)]
*  So they're engaging in this very bizarre nonphysical way that is detached from any human interaction, [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5471.88s)]
*  detached from emotions, eye contact, the feel of being with someone, the back and forth [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5478.88s)]
*  of a conversation between two people. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5484.96s)]
*  Like if you and I were going to disagree about something, if there was like some political [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5487.16s)]
*  thing or some social thing that you and I disagreed about, we could sit and just, I [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5492.54s)]
*  want to know why you think the way you think. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5497.82s)]
*  Like I want to know. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5500.66s)]
*  Like if you think of a thing and I disagree with it, the first thing I want to know is, [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5501.88s)]
*  and this is not something I always had. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5506.22s)]
*  I got way better at this in my life as I've gotten older and had more conversations with [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5507.58s)]
*  people. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5512.34s)]
*  You got to like absolutely know what this person thinks. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5513.34s)]
*  Don't like attack it. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5518.06s)]
*  Don't twist it around. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5519.3s)]
*  Don't distort it. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5521.1s)]
*  You have to kind of steel man it. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5522.4s)]
*  You have to be as charitable to that position as possible. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5524.08s)]
*  And then occasionally when you find things that you disagree with, you have to stop and [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5527.44s)]
*  you have to say, okay, here's my problem with this. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5532.48s)]
*  And it has to be done in good faith. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5535.799999999999s)]
*  You have to be doing it not to win. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5537.7s)]
*  You have to be doing it to figure out what's right. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5539.88s)]
*  And everybody's so fucking attached to their opinions and their ideology that most of the [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5543.0s)]
*  Most conversations are had where one person, at least on social media, one person's trying [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5549.24s)]
*  to win. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5554.16s)]
*  You're trying to win all the time. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5555.16s)]
*  You're playing this stupid game. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5556.599999999999s)]
*  It's a dumb ass game where everybody's a loser. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5558.4s)]
*  But we just watched the Piers Morgan thing. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5560.36s)]
*  That's the same thing. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5562.2s)]
*  It clearly pulled in your attention. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5563.2s)]
*  I love it. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5564.36s)]
*  You're aware of it. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5565.36s)]
*  See, you love it. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5566.36s)]
*  You're part of the problem, Joe. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5567.36s)]
*  Oh, 100%. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5569.4s)]
*  I'm a huge part of the problem. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5570.4s)]
*  Don't get me wrong. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5571.759999999999s)]
*  Meaning you're a human being. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5572.759999999999s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5574.16s)]
*  Also, how much do I contribute to people wasting their time? [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5575.16s)]
*  TikTok reels, Instagram reels, Twitter things. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5579.12s)]
*  How many fucking Twitter articles get written about every stupid thing I said? [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5582.84s)]
*  For three days, Dragon Believer was trending. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5586.16s)]
*  Just because some wacky old lady thinks I believe in dragons. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5591.16s)]
*  But this is just the nature of the world. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5596.44s)]
*  I love that aspect of the internet. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5598.4s)]
*  I love the wacky shit. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5600.5199999999995s)]
*  Even the Ukraine war footage, which is horrible, what it's doing is giving you a more nuanced [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5602.8s)]
*  version of the world. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5608.88s)]
*  And some of it's not good. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5611.12s)]
*  I watched a video today of a guy who got killed by a tiger. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5612.280000000001s)]
*  Well, he didn't get killed by a tiger. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5614.92s)]
*  He got torn apart by a tiger. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5616.08s)]

*  Would a tiger bit your face? [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5623.96s)]
*  You want to say it? [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5624.96s)]

*  And I'm going to try to communicate only with encrypted apps from now on. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5638.0s)]
*  Hey, use WhatsApp, Signal. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5643.52s)]
*  It's just sort of like limiting Twitter replies to registered accounts. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5645.04s)]
*  You know, people like to do that. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5649.68s)]

*  And it has been, like legitimately, it's been one of the worst aspects of modern life for me. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5689.4s)]
*  It's like every fucking day, me and Tom are sending each other guys getting killed by assassins. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5697.4s)]
*  Nice. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5704.4s)]
*  It's every day. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5705.4s)]
*  There's so many footage, so many videos of cartel members whacking people. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5707.679999999999s)]
*  Like after a while, you're like, holy shit, I don't know if I could do this anymore. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5712.639999999999s)]
*  Like every day, someone's getting run over by a truck. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5718.24s)]
*  Every day. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5720.24s)]
*  And you're, that's, so here it is. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5721.24s)]
*  So this guy, they're shooting at the, give me some volume so I can hear this. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5723.08s)]
*  So they shot at the tigers just before this because this guy had been bitten up. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5728.92s)]
*  And so, see they're shooting at him right now. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5734.16s)]
*  The tiger's like, nah, bitch. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5736.12s)]
*  And the tiger's just biting down on this guy. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5739.12s)]
*  So this is what the guy looked like. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5749.12s)]
*  This is his wounds. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5753.12s)]
*  Wow. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5756.12s)]
*  He's not dead. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5757.12s)]
*  Bro. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5759.12s)]
*  Look at his head. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5760.12s)]
*  I mean his bone is exposed. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5761.12s)]
*  No, he's moving. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5764.12s)]
*  Yeah, no, he's alive, dude. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5765.12s)]
*  Look at his face. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5767.12s)]
*  Watch this show his face. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5769.12s)]
*  So this guy climbed into a wildlife enclosure. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5773.08s)]
*  Those were not wild tigers. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5779.08s)]
*  It was, they were, you know, I don't want to say tamed. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5781.08s)]
*  They're not tamed. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5785.08s)]
*  But there's some, in some way at least minimized in their effectiveness. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5786.08s)]
*  You know, our buddy Paul sent me that. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5792.08s)]
*  Paul Rosely sent me that. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5795.08s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5796.08s)]
*  So this does remind me of the jungle. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5797.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5799.08s)]
*  Our buddy Paul is fearless. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5801.04s)]
*  He's a bad motherfucker. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5804.04s)]
*  Paul Rosely's a bad motherfucker. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5806.04s)]
*  That guy is literally putting his money where his mouth is, where his life is, trying to [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5809.04s)]
*  save the Amazon, like living in it, helping people, you know, hiring people to guard it, [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5815.04s)]
*  taking people that were chopping the wood, chopping the trees down, and then giving them [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5823.04s)]
*  a new job to protect the trees. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5829.0s)]
*  It's fucking amazing. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5830.0s)]
*  And he feels the pain. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5831.0s)]
*  Like he literally like physically feels the pain of lost trees. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5833.0s)]
*  He sent me something. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5836.0s)]
*  I don't even know if I'm allowed to talk about it, but if we're not, I'll edit it out afterwards. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5837.0s)]
*  But he sent me a video. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5843.0s)]
*  I can't show the video, but he sent me a video of an uncontacted tribe that he discovered. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5844.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5848.0s)]
*  Did he send you that? [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5849.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5850.0s)]
*  Fucking insane. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5851.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's insane. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5852.0s)]
*  Just complete uncontacted tribe naked in the forest, hundreds of them, and they're like [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5854.96s)]
*  pushing these boats filled with bananas out to them to give them food. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5861.96s)]
*  The reason, we could probably talk about it, they try not to show it so that people don't [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5864.96s)]
*  show up and try to find them. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5869.96s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5870.96s)]
*  You want to kind of protect them. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5871.96s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5872.96s)]
*  That's why I don't know if we could even talk about it, but he has brought up the uncontacted [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5873.96s)]
*  tribes before on the show, and one of his friends was murdered by one. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5875.96s)]
*  One of the tribes, these guys drop off food to these people, and one day they're like, [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5881.92s)]
*  you know what, enough. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5884.92s)]
*  Whap. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5885.92s)]
*  I'm just going to kill you. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5886.92s)]
*  Fuck you. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5887.92s)]
*  I don't trust you. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5888.92s)]
*  Yeah, we hung out. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5889.92s)]
*  We talked to a guy that works with Paul that has a scar from a spear. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5890.92s)]
*  Jeez. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5897.92s)]
*  Jeez. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5898.92s)]
*  Bro. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5899.92s)]
*  At least 100 uncontacted groups in the rainforest. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5900.92s)]
*  Unbelievable, man. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5904.92s)]
*  They're living like they were living 20,000 years ago. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5905.92s)]
*  Completely uncontacted. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5910.56s)]
*  That is, to me, one of the most fascinating aspects of human life today. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5913.56s)]
*  It's not just that we're on the verge of quantum computing and AI becoming sentient. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5920.320000000001s)]
*  We're coexisting at the same time with people that have a completely subsistence-based lifestyle [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5926.24s)]
*  with the stuff that's around them. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5934.4s)]
*  Stone tools, literally. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5938.5599999999995s)]
*  Pointed sticks for spears. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5940.96s)]
*  They've been doing this for thousands and thousands of years, and they're living at [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5943.28s)]
*  the same time as smartphone addiction. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5948.88s)]
*  Not only that, those people probably, their roots go, they could be the original civilization. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=5952.28s)]

*  tribal warfare but now has nuclear bombs, that's us. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6014.4s)]
*  Also dick pics. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6017.88s)]

*  They would be studying us the same way we're studying these folks. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6032.52s)]
*  Same thing. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6035.56s)]
*  When we find out a guy got hit with a spear, like, oh, fuck, what happened? [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6036.56s)]
*  These people are crazy. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6040.68s)]
*  You got to be careful. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6041.68s)]
*  When Paul was saying that they were there and they realized that the tribe was close, [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6043.56s)]
*  they were starting to hear things and they realized they were probably being hunted and [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6047.72s)]
*  they just got the fuck out of there as quick as they could. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6051.0s)]
*  That's terrifying. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6054.04s)]
*  I do not want to wake up to news on my feed that Paul Rosalie got killed by an uncontact [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6056.68s)]
*  tribe. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6063.64s)]
*  Well, he's a, I mean, that guy leaps into adventure. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6064.64s)]
*  I've gotten the chance to hang out with him and it's great. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6067.56s)]
*  There's certain people, I haven't met many people like him in the way that you've described [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6071.400000000001s)]
*  but also in the way where he sees, Ilan is a little bit like this actually, like he sees [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6075.8s)]
*  the opportunity for adventure and he just leaps into it. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6081.84s)]
*  There's not like a deep, deliberate process of strategy and planning and so on. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6085.56s)]
*  It's just something pulls at him and that's a really fun person to be with. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6090.96s)]
*  But couple that with just extreme competence. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6094.6s)]
*  He's good at surviving. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6097.88s)]
*  He's good at taking risks and good at surviving. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6101.76s)]
*  So like the uncontacted tribes or the crazy shit we did in the jungle, just like getting [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6104.44s)]
*  lost and almost dying, all that kind of stuff. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6110.08s)]
*  And he's a really nice guy. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6113.08s)]
*  Super nice. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6115.28s)]
*  Really nice guy and it's just like there's something to that. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6116.28s)]
*  He's an actual good person. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6119.12s)]
*  He's really doing this for a good cause. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6121.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6123.28s)]
*  And it's not just the Amazon rainforest. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6124.96s)]
*  He's also going to Africa and India and sort of trying to save nature. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6127.919999999999s)]
*  I mean, you go out hunting, the forest is a bit different than like the Amazon rainforest. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6135.16s)]
*  Their life is a lot different. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6141.88s)]
*  It's like real intense. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6143.24s)]
*  There's a lot. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6144.72s)]
*  You're in the middle of a soup of life. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6146.08s)]
*  When you have that much life, just think about the amount of insects. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6149.04s)]
*  You were around it, the buzzing at night. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6154.5199999999995s)]
*  Explain that, what that sounds like. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6157.48s)]
*  It's an orchestra. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6159.76s)]
*  It's millions of little organisms. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6160.76s)]
*  Screaming. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6163.76s)]
*  There's no silence at night. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6164.76s)]

*  They're all fucking. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6167.0s)]
*  They're all screaming and fucking and killing each other. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6168.0s)]
*  And it's all life eats life all around you. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6173.08s)]
*  It's life eating life. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6175.200000000001s)]
*  And one of the ways to experience that is the sound. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6177.360000000001s)]
*  The other way is just standing there, stuff starts crawling on you pretty quickly. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6180.72s)]
*  Did you get bit by a bullet ant? [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6186.72s)]

*  to feel like failure and to understand that this doesn't make you a bad person. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6415.16s)]
*  These are just the lessons of life and the energy that comes with doing something well [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6420.839999999999s)]

*  and feeling filled with misery and regret. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6429.879999999999s)]
*  And that's a difficult thing when you're sleeping on silk sheets. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6433.32s)]

*  sheets. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6444.48s)]

*  That's because they start getting rich, you know, and then, you know, just chill a little [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6450.759999999999s)]
*  bit. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6455.24s)]

*  I don't think you should do it. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6469.4s)]
*  You shouldn't be mean to your kid just so they can be a bad ass fighter. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6472.0s)]
*  Well, I think it's also there's probably a balance you can hit. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6476.12s)]
*  But a lot of these folks, because they had nothing, they want to spoil their kids. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6479.48s)]
*  They go too far in the other direction. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6484.36s)]
*  Yeah, it's harder to be a strict parent. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6486.88s)]

*  If you just look at in terms of just like the sheer numbers of human beings they sent [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6530.04s)]

*  This is the thing that the sheer number of people that died that had nothing to do with [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6741.68s)]
*  it is crazy. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6749.92s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6751.84s)]
*  I think the most recent estimate, and they don't even know because there's so many people [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6752.84s)]
*  that are under rubble. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6756.280000000001s)]
*  The most recent estimate was somewhere north of 60,000 people. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6757.88s)]
*  And how many of them are kids? [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6765.92s)]
*  Like what's the number of kids that have been killed by missiles that had done nothing wrong? [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6768.92s)]
*  What's that number? [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6774.36s)]
*  And those kids have families. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6775.36s)]
*  And those kids have mothers and brothers and sisters and some people that lived and some [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6776.8s)]
*  people that died. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6780.04s)]
*  And whoever makes it out of that, you want to radicalize somebody. [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6781.72s)]
*  You want to radicalize somebody to just want nothing but revenge. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6786.32s)]
*  I can think of no better way. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6792.84s)]
*  No better way. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6795.08s)]
*  And here Donald Trump is tasked with going in there and trying to make peace. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6797.74s)]
*  I think I'm pretty optimistic about just knowing the skill set of all the people involved in [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6802.139999999999s)]
*  Israel, Palestine, in Russia, Ukraine. [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6810.38s)]
*  I'm pretty optimistic about. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6812.62s)]
*  I can't believe those people, those hostages are still alive. [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6814.0199999999995s)]
*  How many of them are still alive now? [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6818.0599999999995s)]
*  I don't know what the exact numbers are, but it's crazy that they were not freed sooner. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6819.54s)]
*  The whole thing is horrible from top to bottom, including all the people that have decided [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6826.34s)]
*  what happened. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6834.22s)]
*  People that are saying it was definitely a false flag. [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6835.860000000001s)]
*  These things are complicated. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6838.62s)]
*  These things are complicated. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6841.42s)]
*  Whenever something horrible happens and someone fucked up, Israel is the most protected place [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6844.06s)]
*  on earth. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6849.66s)]
*  It's one of the most secure countries on earth. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6850.66s)]
*  For them to let something like that happen is just a huge fuck up. [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6853.74s)]
*  But what I had heard was that there was also a lot of troops that were stationed near where [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6857.98s)]
*  there were protests. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6863.86s)]
*  So there was a lot of protests about Netanyahu before October 7th happened, but most people [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6866.38s)]
*  weren't even aware of. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6871.7s)]
*  There was hundreds of thousands of people in the streets protesting Netanyahu before [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6872.7s)]
*  October 7th. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6877.179999999999s)]
*  So then October 7th comes and then all of a sudden, now whenever you have any sort of [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6879.36s)]
*  military engagement, any sort of, you're at war right now, when those things happen, one [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6884.28s)]
*  of the first things that happens is all the protests and all the bullshit stops because [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6892.04s)]
*  now a bunch of people got killed. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6897.28s)]
*  And when anything like that happens and you are now involved in a countrywide assault [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6899.5199999999995s)]
*  on this other country, everything else gets put aside. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6906.04s)]
*  And so the big conspiracy fear has always been when a leader knows that they're going [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6908.88s)]
*  to get pushed out, they'll start a false flag or start a war. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6914.2s)]
*  So they look at October 7th and they say they let that happen. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6918.72s)]
*  Or they say they had knowledge of it, they knew it was going to happen, they knew it, [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6922.2s)]
*  but they wanted an excuse to raise Gaza. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6926.26s)]
*  They wanted an excuse to just have a full on bombing campaign against Hamas. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6929.62s)]
*  I mean, you definitely need to look at the incentives there. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6933.759999999999s)]
*  That is one of the concerns in Ukraine for President Zelensky. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6936.2s)]
*  The prospect of ending the war, because right now the country is unified. [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6943.32s)]
*  If you end the war and you have elections, now you have to face a lot of the consequences [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6948.12s)]
*  internally about the potential discovery of corruption, about the suspension of democracy, [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6952.0s)]
*  about all of these things. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6957.04s)]
*  And the same thing with Netanyahu, who, by the way, also they want to do a three hour [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6958.84s)]
*  podcast with me. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6965.16s)]
*  I talked to him before October 7th for an hour. [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6967.28s)]
*  I regret talking to him for an hour. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6969.96s)]
*  One of the things I really learned a lot from you and from just myself, you can't do. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6974.0s)]
*  One of the things I really don't like, what happened with me talking to Donald Trump is [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6979.4400000000005s)]
*  like 40 minutes with Donald Trump. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6983.96s)]
*  It was a mistake. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6987.76s)]
*  There was a... [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6988.76s)]
*  I was almost willing to do that with Kamala Harris. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6989.76s)]
*  I was entertaining the 45 minute one. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6994.12s)]
*  I was entertaining because I was like, maybe if I could just come in at a 10 to work my [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=6996.400000000001s)]
*  brain up, really come in and just engage with her real quick. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7001.400000000001s)]
*  I wanted to get loose. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7007.360000000001s)]
*  The problem is I want to see how you are as a real person. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7010.42s)]
*  I think actually genuinely with you and Kamala Harris, I think 45 minutes is horrible, but [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7014.599999999999s)]
*  I think you're so skilled and compassionate. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7019.719999999999s)]
*  It's fun to talk to you. [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7023.5199999999995s)]
*  I think you would just end up being much, much longer. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7025.16s)]
*  That's the hope. [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7028.08s)]
*  If that's the hope, yeah. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7029.08s)]
*  There would be questions though, and some questions would be very complicated, like [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7031.04s)]
*  the immigration question. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7034.879999999999s)]
*  I would say what's happening? [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7037.08s)]
*  What is happening? [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7039.12s)]
*  Do you think that there should be limitations to this? [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7040.12s)]
*  Do you think it should be stopped? [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7042.8s)]
*  All right. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7043.8s)]
*  Do you think we should round up all the people that we know that are terrorists that made [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7044.8s)]
*  it across? [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7047.400000000001s)]
*  Are we keeping track of them? [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7048.400000000001s)]
*  Do we know how many? [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7049.68s)]
*  Do we know what happened? [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7050.84s)]
*  Do we know why it happened? [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7051.84s)]
*  Why are people opposed to the idea of cracking down on border patrol, making more soldiers [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7053.2s)]
*  available, putting walls up everywhere? [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7060.12s)]
*  What is the reason to not do this? [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7062.0s)]
*  Tell me what you're thinking. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7063.96s)]
*  When people start talking about labor, they're talking about bringing in labor and then our [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7065.52s)]
*  population is lower. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7069.4800000000005s)]
*  Chuck Schumer brought that up. [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7071.04s)]

*  We don't. [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7080.32s)]
*  Is there is that really what the problem is that Americans aren't willing to do jobs and [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7081.719999999999s)]

*  How about just make legal immigration easier for poor people that are trying to get over [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7088.36s)]
*  here? How would just scratch, scan them, screen them, make sure that they're not fucking [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7092.16s)]
*  murderers, make sure that our cartel members and then let them in easier. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7096.4s)]

*  The idea of bringing like the best people in the world here. Yeah. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7178.8s)]
*  But also Mark Andreessen talks about this. [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7181.5599999999995s)]
*  Like we need to make sure we recruit like the Midwest, the farm boys. [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7184.68s)]
*  Get them to like do epic shit inside, you know, Americans. [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7190.52s)]
*  Well, here's step one. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7194.84s)]
*  Ramp up the fucking education system. [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7197.12s)]
*  Yeah. Jesus Christ. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7199.160000000001s)]
*  At what point in time do we not say how far do we have to slip down the list [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7200.8s)]
*  of like the best performing students in the world before someone comes along and says, hey, [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7206.68s)]
*  the whole thing about this place is if our kids are losers, [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7211.16s)]
*  they're going to grow up to become loser adults. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7215.56s)]
*  Make it way easier to be a winner. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7217.76s)]
*  What's the best way to do that? Have a way better education system. [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7221.360000000001s)]
*  Just imagine if they completely revamped the education system in this country, [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7224.8s)]
*  just poured a shitload of money and had the wisest minds [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7229.400000000001s)]
*  come up with a brilliant strategy for more creative ways of approaching learning. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7233.6s)]
*  Pushing people into viable pathways that maybe didn't even exist [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7240.48s)]
*  when the education system was structured, because things have changed so much in the world [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7244.4s)]
*  that you could probably do a way better job than we're doing, [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7248.4s)]
*  which would make people come out of that. [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7251.92s)]
*  They would emerge better qualified people. [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7254.36s)]
*  So we would get more shit done in America. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7257.28s)]
*  So America would prosper overall. [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7259.24s)]
*  The GDP would grow. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7261.44s)]
*  The fucking everything would be better. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7262.76s)]
*  You'd have less poverty. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7264.48s)]
*  You have more. This is that's where they need to start. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7266.24s)]
*  It's not just let in all the immigrants. [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7269.56s)]
*  How about fix what we got here and then expand that outward? [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7271.88s)]
*  Like, make this place the best it can be [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7276.64s)]
*  and then expand that idea out to the rest of the world. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7280.08s)]
*  So instead of like letting everybody walk here from third world countries [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7283.0s)]
*  because third world countries suck, expand what's better out to the rest of the world. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7287.44s)]
*  And a big part of that is actually culturally changing, [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7292.76s)]
*  accepting, celebrating, venerating meritocracy. [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7296.92s)]
*  Yes. The guy in the class, see, I, you know, [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7300.2s)]
*  having gone to school in the Soviet Union, like I was good at math [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7304.08s)]
*  and I was actually, believe it or not, super cool [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7308.0s)]
*  because I was good at math in class when I was like, whoa, [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7311.44s)]
*  like I was the cool kid because I was good at math. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7314.2s)]
*  Like I was getting like in America, we had a girlfriend when I was young. [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7316.639999999999s)]
*  Isn't that fun? But no, no, no, I think it's wrong. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7320.4s)]
*  I mean, they're wrong. [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7322.92s)]
*  You should get violent. You should. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7323.88s)]
*  But I think they're wrong because but it's a fascinating thing [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7325.36s)]
*  to make fun of the smart kid. [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7328.24s)]
*  I mean, especially math, a fucking robot over there. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7331.96s)]
*  Science. But actually, just now weird. [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7334.88s)]
*  But honestly, even. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7337.44s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, in all walks of life, sports is a little better. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7340.32s)]
*  We do celebrate great athletes, but there's still kind of [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7344.719999999999s)]
*  the participation trophy thing. [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7348.12s)]
*  There's still a kind of sense where. [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7350.0s)]
*  We want to help the people that aren't quite as good at a thing. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7352.88s)]
*  That's only with little kids, though. [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7356.16s)]
*  Sports sports are. But it's not there. [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7358.0s)]
*  How little sports once kids get into like the teenage years, [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7362.0s)]
*  sports is a meritocracy. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7366.12s)]
*  Yes. But culturally, do we really say like this is like [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7368.08s)]
*  this is amazing that this person is winning? [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7372.36s)]
*  Yeah, we do get there. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7375.4400000000005s)]
*  I want to take you to a Texas football game with Texas. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7376.96s)]
*  It's different. I mean, Texas. [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7379.32s)]
*  This is what America should be. [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7380.96s)]
*  This is what America should be. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7382.96s)]
*  It's all that it should all be fired up. [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7384.24s)]
*  But not just about football. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7386.52s)]
*  No, but all kinds of things. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7389.12s)]
*  Everything music. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7390.56s)]
*  Here's the problem. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7391.88s)]
*  Football, like physics, quarterbacks get laid. [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7392.8s)]
*  All right. That's a handsome guy. [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7395.88s)]
*  That's what I'm trying to tell you. [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7396.96s)]
*  OK, scientists, physicists used to be in the Soviet Union. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7398.2s)]
*  We'll get a lot of pussy. [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7401.76s)]
*  What about Feynman? [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7402.92s)]
*  Well, he got yes. Yeah. [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7404.56s)]
*  But he's another one. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7406.28s)]
*  Those guys were freaks, right? [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7407.12s)]
*  Oppenheimer, you saw the movie. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7408.400000000001s)]
*  He was a freak. [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7409.84s)]
*  Those guys were studs because they were the smart people. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7410.92s)]
*  And there was a lot of grad students that wanted to fuck the professor. [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7413.88s)]
*  And that was normal stuff back then. [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7416.96s)]
*  But I don't know if they were studs in the general population. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7419.32s)]
*  They were studs in a way they were like, look, [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7423.36s)]
*  Einstein was a national hero. [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7426.88s)]
*  Right. There's no one like that today. [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7429.12s)]
*  There's no one scientist that's a groundbreaking research of theory [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7431.08s)]
*  of relativity where everybody's aware of it. [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7435.56s)]
*  There's nothing like that. [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7437.76s)]
*  We celebrate people like maybe like Neil deGrasse Tyson, [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7439.0s)]
*  who are communicators of science. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7441.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but not to the same extent. [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7443.04s)]
*  Like he's he's he's criticized way more than Einstein ever was. [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7444.360000000001s)]
*  Einstein was pretty celebrated. [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7448.72s)]
*  It's just and even Feynman, like for the people that knew him, [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7450.76s)]
*  like he was a he was a cultural figure. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7455.6s)]
*  He wasn't an obscure name. [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7458.64s)]
*  Like if you brought up Richard Feynman, most people that like [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7460.76s)]
*  watched the news and read newspapers probably know who he is. [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7464.04s)]
*  If they were in their 30s. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7467.6s)]
*  That's not the case today for, you know, say someone who's [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7469.200000000001s)]
*  groundbreaking research with AI or someone who's involved [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7472.240000000001s)]
*  in quantum computing or just is just a few of these science [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7475.84s)]
*  communicators, you know, Brian Cox, like guys like him were great at it [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7479.6s)]
*  in terms of like space, you know, and some guys are better at it [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7484.360000000001s)]
*  in terms of like talking about AI or talking about [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7487.52s)]
*  all just all the different emerging technologies, [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7491.4800000000005s)]
*  because there's so many of them. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7494.320000000001s)]
*  But there's no one person who's like our other than Elon. [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7495.84s)]
*  But Elon's such a unique character. [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7499.92s)]
*  You can't even like you can't put him in the same category as an Einstein, [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7502.84s)]
*  because he's just like a cultural weirdness. [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7506.68s)]
*  Like, who is this guy like making memes, cracking jokes, [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7509.4400000000005s)]
*  dunking on people, telling people to go fuck themselves, buys Twitter, [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7513.4400000000005s)]
*  you know, it runs a bunch of different companies simultaneously [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7518.04s)]
*  while playing video games constantly. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7521.96s)]
*  It's like that doesn't fit in anywhere else. [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7523.72s)]
*  That's like a very unique thing that exists. [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7526.64s)]
*  This Elon Musk guy. [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7530.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's one of the most unique human beings in all of history. [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7531.280000000001s)]
*  But you can even move to like even the Jeff Bezos, who, by the way, [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7534.240000000001s)]
*  successfully launched the first rocket yesterday to orbit. [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7538.76s)]
*  Yeah, which is which is incredible. Amazing. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7544.0s)]
*  Even he is gets like I think that that should be that that should be venerated. [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7546.16s)]
*  Sure, but he's not the guy that's making the [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7551.32s)]
*  he's not doing the calculations and designing and engineering the machines. [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7554.92s)]
*  Like Werner von Braun was. [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7559.0s)]
*  So it's like what we're fascinated by today is different. [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7560.4s)]
*  And it's like we're fascinated by these public figures [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7564.88s)]
*  that talk about the work that's being that's going on. [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7567.4s)]
*  But the people that are actually doing it, there's not like one stand out. [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7569.84s)]
*  Although to say both Jeff Bezos and Elon are legit good engineers, like they [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7573.5599999999995s)]
*  to see them on the factory floor, they know what they're doing. [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7578.76s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. But like the thing about Elon is weird. [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7580.92s)]
*  It's like he just has so many things you get you get confused. [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7583.4400000000005s)]
*  Like how can you do this? [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7586.28s)]
*  And I was talking about possibly buying TikTok. [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7587.52s)]
*  Yeah, like I wonder if they would go after him if you do that. [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7589.72s)]
*  Would that be like a minute? [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7592.4800000000005s)]
*  But but Bezos or rather a sort of Zuckerberg, rather, they bought Instagram. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7593.64s)]
*  Right. So they have Facebook and Instagram. [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7600.04s)]
*  Right. And then like why couldn't you have TikTok and Twitter? [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7601.88s)]
*  What are you talking about? Monopoly wise? Yeah. [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7605.92s)]
*  Oh, yeah. I don't think they'll go after them. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7607.8s)]
*  They're trying to split up Google right now. [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7609.76s)]
*  Alphabet really like to make maybe Chrome or YouTube its own business. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7611.2s)]
*  Hmm. I think there's an argument. [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7617.4800000000005s)]
*  There's some argument, but like they the crazy thing about YouTube is how effective it is. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7620.16s)]
*  Right. Like YouTube is just think it's like seems so straightforward. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7625.280000000001s)]
*  You just have a place where people can upload videos. [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7629.92s)]
*  OK, that's straightforward. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7632.6s)]
*  Everybody should be able to make one of those. [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7634.360000000001s)]
*  By the way, no, there's just one really hard to actually pull that off. [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7636.280000000001s)]
*  On the engineering side, to be able to like, oh, yeah, just there's there's just no other place like it to be able to host how much data, the scale, just the volume, the volume of fucking data that comes into their site every day. [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7639.56s)]
*  Yeah, it just and then there's people, of course, online sort of criticizing YouTube for censorship, blah, blah, blah. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7654.280000000001s)]
*  And I'm like, oh, they should. [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7660.0s)]
*  They should. But like, hey, more people need to be like this. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7661.200000000001s)]
*  This fucking thing exists. [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7665.400000000001s)]
*  It's like Wi-Fi on the airplane. [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7666.56s)]
*  It's like this is there's no other platform like YouTube in terms of like the set of features, the community they create, the search and discovery. [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7668.36s)]
*  Yeah. Do you think Apple regrets having it being one of the first built in apps on the iPhone that could have had a lot to do with the growth? [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7675.84s)]
*  Well, definitely did, I'm sure they didn't make it, but they included it. [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7683.28s)]
*  Right. [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7686.92s)]
*  Also, Google Maps was too, so they made their own. [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7687.68s)]
*  Well, I mean, you probably want to have the best shit on your phone if you want people to buy it. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7690.08s)]
*  You're kind of trapped. [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7695.24s)]
*  Everybody knows YouTube is the best shit. [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7696.5199999999995s)]
*  And if you get YouTube on an Android phone natively, instantly, which you can when you get an Android phone, it already has YouTube loaded onto it. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7698.639999999999s)]
*  Why wouldn't you load it on an iPhone? [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7706.5199999999995s)]
*  Everybody uses YouTube. [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7708.04s)]
*  You got to pick your battles. [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7709.28s)]
*  It was 2007, though. [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7710.28s)]
*  That's true. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7712.28s)]
*  You can only have three minute videos. [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7713.4s)]
*  You're right. [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7714.48s)]
*  They probably didn't realize how big YouTube is going to be. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7715.48s)]
*  Right. [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7718.48s)]
*  But what they did do that's the sneakiest thing that drives me crazy is the 30 percent. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7719.639999999999s)]
*  So if you start an app, you put an app in the app store, the Apple store, they get 30 percent. [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7724.04s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7731.4s)]
*  Because YouTube dominates so much, if people get censored, that's really painful. [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7733.32s)]
*  Like that. [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7737.799999999999s)]
*  Like that's not. [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7738.48s)]
*  Well, they're so in control of the video market. [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7739.5599999999995s)]
*  And, you know, I don't envy it. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7744.0s)]
*  It's got to be an insane place to try to manage. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7745.799999999999s)]
*  But it's just kind of wild that no one else has been able to come up with anything even remotely close. [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7750.0s)]
*  You know, you've got Rumble. [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7755.0s)]
*  They do really well. [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7756.0s)]
*  But it's like Rumble's like a like a very conservative, Ivermectin using libertarian sort of space. [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7757.4s)]
*  The opposite of Blue Sky. [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7764.719999999999s)]
*  Like Blue Sky is like. [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7765.799999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7768.879999999999s)]
*  But there's a lot of like left wing shows on Rumble. [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7769.44s)]
*  Rumble is essentially like a legitimate free free speech platform. [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7771.28s)]
*  They don't censor left wing views. [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7774.799999999999s)]
*  You know, isn't breaking points. [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7776.96s)]
*  Are they on Rumble? [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7778.92s)]
*  I watch them on YouTube. [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7781.84s)]
*  Twitch for a while, though, was kind of close. [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7783.280000000001s)]
*  And then Amazon bought it. [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7785.360000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7786.2s)]
*  Right. [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7786.84s)]
*  Twitch was close. [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7787.2s)]
*  I mean, but then when Amazon bought it, it's something like Twitch kind of disappeared. [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7788.2s)]
*  It's still a thing, but it doesn't make money. [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7791.64s)]
*  It's not profitable, which I arguably neither is YouTube. [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7793.56s)]
*  But once you put it in. [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7796.360000000001s)]
*  But isn't that crazy? [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7797.16s)]
*  Like if they didn't buy it, maybe it would have been because Twitch was huge. [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7797.6s)]
*  It still is. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7800.96s)]
*  Really? [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7802.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7802.400000000001s)]
*  I mean, that's all that's what kids watch. [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7802.6s)]
*  But a lot of kids, they stream everywhere now. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7804.56s)]
*  Right. [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7807.400000000001s)]
*  And there's a bunch of like is video games different? [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7807.84s)]
*  I feel like a bunch of different. [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7810.0s)]
*  Twitch became more. [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7811.08s)]
*  It was just in TV and it's kind of reverted back to it now. [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7812.2s)]
*  Like most of the popular stuff is IRL streaming people walking around, going places, [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7814.96s)]
*  doing streaming, going, you know, doing nonsense. [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7819.24s)]
*  It's so weird. [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7822.6s)]
*  And so what are the video games streamed on? [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7823.76s)]
*  What does everybody like? [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7827.320000000001s)]
*  It's still that there's been a few other ones that have tried people like YouTube tried to do it. [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7828.280000000001s)]
*  Facebook tried to do it. [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7831.96s)]
*  Microsoft tried to do it. [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7833.0s)]
*  It didn't work. [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7834.360000000001s)]
*  Which is still. [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7834.92s)]
*  I watch video games streams on YouTube. [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7836.04s)]
*  So YouTube still a few there. [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7837.96s)]
*  Twitter is now trying to do it. [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7839.320000000001s)]
*  But like the Microsoft one went away. [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7840.320000000001s)]
*  YouTube doesn't really advertise the live streaming stuff very well. [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7843.120000000001s)]
*  You can find it. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7847.8s)]
*  But it's so. [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7848.76s)]
*  So essentially it's just Twitch for video games. [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7849.4400000000005s)]
*  It's dominant for sure. [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7853.400000000001s)]
*  Dominant. [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7854.6s)]
*  OK. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7855.56s)]
*  So Twitch didn't go away. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7855.92s)]
*  I'm just old. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7857.4400000000005s)]
*  So it's I thought there was a bunch of new ones that were good though that people were using. [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7858.360000000001s)]
*  Took off. [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7864.04s)]
*  Everyone sort of went back to Twitch after they. [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7866.16s)]
*  So was that a deal where they like get like a famous streamer and they say hey we're going to give you money to come over to this new platform. [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7867.88s)]
*  Then they try to start the platform. [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7873.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7874.92s)]
*  I mean it's a good idea. [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7875.08s)]
*  You buy everyone to come over and hopefully everyone sticks. [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7875.76s)]
*  Just didn't stick. [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7878.8s)]
*  Just think about the resources you would have to have if you wanted to take on YouTube. [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7880.2s)]
*  Like look if Elon had decided like OK we need to turn X into the new YouTube. [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7884.599999999999s)]
*  Well he kind of wants to do that. [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7890.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7892.32s)]
*  Which is kind of what he wanted to start a separate app because Twitch or excuse me X is still mostly people exchanging information mostly exchanging hyperlinks. [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7892.96s)]
*  The closest thing it's to is like Tick Tock on the video. [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7904.360000000001s)]
*  The short video clips is good. [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7908.160000000001s)]
*  So I can see actually you're buying Tick Tock. [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7911.12s)]
*  It makes it makes total sense and integrating into X. [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7913.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7915.8s)]
*  But in terms of long form content it's just not quite there because you have to implement all of these features. [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7916.4400000000005s)]
*  And it is engineering wise really difficult to have that much video. [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7921.719999999999s)]
*  You can. [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7928.4s)]
*  We can upload we upload hours at a time. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7929.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7931.4s)]
*  Hours. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7931.88s)]
*  So think about it like each one of our shows is at least two hours three hours mostly. [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7932.5199999999995s)]
*  That's so much fucking data. [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7937.36s)]
*  If you're letting everybody do that how much are you paying for bandwidth. [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7940.0s)]
*  What is that like because it's free. [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7944.48s)]
*  And then you have to get ads and you have to like put and then the ads like hey we don't want anybody saying fuck. [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7946.44s)]
*  Oh shit. [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7950.88s)]
*  All right. [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7952.08s)]
*  Put up a filter get rid of all the fuck so that Paul Moll of can sell their fucking hand soap. [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7952.4800000000005s)]
*  Whatever it is whoever is getting upset at us. [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7959.56s)]
*  Oh did someone talk about the vaccine. [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7962.04s)]
*  Yeah you can't get an ad because we're trying to sell vaccine and so don't be a cocksucker. [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7963.88s)]
*  Don't ruin my giant business that I've created on your data. [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7968.24s)]
*  But it is surprising that nobody's built a competitor not even close as any just shows how incredible the teams are. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7972.12s)]
*  Well they they nailed it. [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7977.52s)]
*  This is what they did. [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7979.28s)]
*  They made the perfect algorithm to constantly show you things you're interested in. [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7979.96s)]
*  You know when I go to my YouTube feed they're right every day. [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7985.84s)]
*  Every day they're right. [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7989.4800000000005s)]
*  I'm like oh I'm interested in that. [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7990.36s)]
*  When was that built. [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7992.72s)]
*  Look at that. [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7994.2s)]
*  Is that real. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7995.4400000000005s)]
*  This is what they got me every fucking day. [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7996.72s)]
*  Yeah I actually tweeted complaining a little bit about YouTube recently and we had a whole meeting. [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=7999.16s)]
*  What were you complaining about. [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8004.32s)]
*  So they have this incredible I don't want to complain about Wi-Fi on the airplane before seeing the positive. [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8005.719999999999s)]
*  So they have this incredible feature called MLA multi-language audio. [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8010.88s)]
*  I don't know if you know about this but you can have multiple tracks of audio for a single podcast a video in different languages. [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8014.92s)]
*  So I had to do that for as in last interview that's overdubbed into three languages for the different. [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8022.16s)]
*  Did you use AI to do that or did you hire people. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8028.36s)]
*  So did both but in this case you did AI because of the voice cloning you want. [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8031.6s)]
*  There's something really intimate and powerful about hearing the person speak. [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8036.68s)]
*  And I've just found out that you know for example on audio people listen to the Zelensky interview. [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8042.240000000001s)]
*  It's dubbed into English. [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8048.96s)]
*  She's speaking Russian or Ukrainian. [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8050.0s)]
*  They listen and they enjoy it like they've they've they've you could see the numbers you could see how they write to me personal messages how they. [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8052.240000000001s)]
*  You know on Instagram stories they're listening to it in English. [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8060.36s)]
*  Right. [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8063.92s)]
*  And they're able to listen to it for a prolonged period of time like it's in English. [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8064.44s)]
*  Did you review it and listen to it make sure the context translates correctly. [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8068.5199999999995s)]
*  So I should give a shout out to a company called 11 Labs that do the voice cloning that do the translation and this what's called text to speech. [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8074.759999999999s)]
*  They're incredible people not just the product actually there's certain companies that I work with. [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8082.48s)]
*  Nothing frustrates me more than incompetence and nothing excites me more than competence. [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8089.0s)]
*  Like they're just sweet people by the way like stayed up crazy hours through the holidays. [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8094.84s)]
*  A lot of big companies like take like two months off. [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8100.44s)]
*  They're just there's you know they're nine to five. [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8104.0s)]
*  They're all very polite. [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8106.76s)]
*  There's a manager of a manager and there's meetings and it's slow and there's this bureaucracy. [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8108.24s)]
*  And with 11 Labs with a lot of startups good startups you like. [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8113.12s)]
*  Have this just vibrancy and kindness and everybody is excited all that kind of stuff. [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8118.48s)]
*  Anyway they do the text to speech you know you have like text on the page that you can speak in the Joe Rogan voice. [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8123.32s)]
*  I mean you're aware of this. [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8131.88s)]
*  So if you want to translate you first translate the transcribe the original language. [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8133.92s)]
*  Try translate it on the page and then text the speech bring it to life in that other different language. [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8140.839999999999s)]
*  The translation step is the tricky one is the hardest one where a human should correct and help. [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8149.04s)]
*  I got I read for me. [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8155.48s)]
*  We had very little time to do this. [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8159.08s)]
*  We had to do it really rapidly but you get into trouble. [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8161.12s)]
*  So for example he said time did you have. [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8164.12s)]
*  I don't remember the exact number of days but probably five or six days to do everything. [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8166.0s)]
*  So in three languages in three languages and he and I did the asshole thing which is we kept switching languages sentence to sentence. [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8171.280000000001s)]
*  Oh no. [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8180.04s)]
*  We kept and like and he was swearing Russian mid sentence. [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8180.52s)]
*  So of course the translator is like sweating because the most of the sentence is Ukrainian and then he says fuck or go fuck. [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8184.280000000001s)]
*  He swore a lot. [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8190.72s)]
*  That part would be in Russian the swear. [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8191.76s)]
*  So you have to catch all that. [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8196.44s)]
*  You have to not make mistakes and some of it there was AI in the loop went to figure out because nobody really has done this kind of thing before. [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8197.48s)]
*  So we have to figure it all out and mistakes can be made when you're rushing like this rushing like this like I just did. [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8203.4s)]
*  By the way me saying that I'm not a Russian. [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8215.2s)]
*  I just did. [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8218.400000000001s)]
*  By the way me saying that could be transcribed into me saying Russian and like that. [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8220.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8225.76s)]
*  So for example we said he was talking about corruption sensitive topic. [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8226.32s)]
*  He said something like anybody who we caught doing something with the weapons or being corrupt we would be the exact term is beat them on the hands. [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8229.880000000001s)]
*  He was speaking Ukrainian which in Ukrainian means will crack down on them. [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8245.12s)]
*  That was automatically translated to slap them on the wrist which which makes sense as a direct literal translation right. [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8250.16s)]
*  Beat them on the hands slap them on the wrist makes sense. [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8257.92s)]
*  But like and I didn't catch it. [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8260.560000000001s)]
*  I'm not sleeping. [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8263.04s)]
*  I'm like reading it. [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8263.960000000001s)]
*  I speak all the languages so like I'm trying to like figure out this puzzle and we didn't catch it. [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8265.12s)]
*  And then of course like a lot of people got really mad and they spoke up you know that you know the Internet in general is like how can you translate this. [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8271.480000000001s)]
*  Are you. [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8281.6s)]
*  Of course it must be because I'm a Putin shale. [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8282.640000000001s)]
*  I'm getting funded. [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8285.0s)]
*  Translating. [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8286.4s)]
*  But yeah that's you see it's very there could be sensitive moments like you had a lot of really high profile figures here there could be sensitive moments if translated could do a lot of damage on the flip side. [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8287.640000000001s)]
*  It makes it accessible especially for important conversations and makes it accessible to people that really need to hear it. [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8298.960000000001s)]
*  Why were you under such a time constraint. [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8305.08s)]
*  Because the the seriousness of the conversation like the every single day there's major missile. [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8308.48s)]
*  Right. [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8315.4s)]
*  So did you. [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8316.36s)]
*  It just you didn't have a five day deadline you just it took you five days to do it. [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8317.6s)]
*  Yes. [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8322.16s)]
*  And. [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8322.68s)]
*  The. [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8324.56s)]
*  I don't want to. [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8325.4s)]
*  Sort of put it on them but the president's Alonso office was asking like when this was coming out they were really pushing it and they were implying probably correctly that there's just going to be a lot of dynamic stuff happening on the on the peace negotiations. [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8326.04s)]
*  So he wanted to use this as a statement and the same because you know the Kremlin watched it so everybody's watching it and like it's part of the puzzle pieces that they're using to figure out when we're going to meet when we're going to what are going to be the outlines of a of a treaty. [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8344.88s)]
*  You know so like you have to take it very seriously but then you know I've learned a lot because I. [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8362.08s)]
*  You need to probably hire more. [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8367.519999999999s)]
*  And trust everybody involved and turn it around much quicker you know. [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8369.96s)]
*  You know me but in terms of production everything the team is one person and then there's now folks happening with helping with editing but it's just tiny team there's no. [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8376.0s)]
*  And so for things like this you have to take it seriously you have to like maybe have like a special special force team that kind of steps up right helps. [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8388.08s)]
*  A group of people that are translators you could really count on to get it right. [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8397.240000000002s)]
*  Because a lot of the view it but you would want to have to personally review it anyway. [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8402.400000000001s)]
*  100% but that you want the translators you trust to do a good job and one of the things we learned really quickly is you can't just get any translator there. [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8406.480000000001s)]
*  I mean translation is an art it truly is and like people were they were translating it it's like open my comedy. [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8414.720000000001s)]
*  Right it really like. [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8422.0s)]
*  Right right right. [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8423.320000000002s)]
*  Right it really like right right right. [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8424.12s)]
*  You think even the same joke in the mouth of different comics would just be way different right and the way they were translating it was cold they were missing the points that would not have shown the context. [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8426.56s)]
*  Of the highway is genius. [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8440.44s)]
*  Yeah yeah but the translation piece of the AI is still needs the human and needs the human to fix it. [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8442.72s)]
*  And how does the human emphasize emotion like if he has a specific intonation if the way he's like he's talking about how does the. [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8449.96s)]
*  How does AI know how to say the words in translation and which ones to emphasize. [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8462.4s)]
*  So this is where 11 labs is really incredible but they uses the actual words to figure out the intonation. [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8468.279999999999s)]
*  So the OK so the translation of the words. [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8475.16s)]
*  Right the original word hearing the word. [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8478.52s)]
*  No it's always working on the text. [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8481.24s)]
*  So let's just stick with English for now. [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8483.36s)]
*  Before I say translation text on the page. [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8485.68s)]
*  I've. [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8490.84s)]
*  Like I have a Dwight Eisenhower speech here every gun that is made every warship launched every rocket fire signifies. [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8492.36s)]
*  That feels like a serious thing like we can probably infer how to read that if I gave you that text you would infer the heaviness the timing. [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8499.359999999999s)]
*  Right. [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8506.48s)]
*  And the AI is pretty good at doing that not perfect and you can. [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8506.76s)]
*  What if you delivered that speech like Hitler. [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8510.0s)]
*  Like I want to know like how are they getting that like when. [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8516.0s)]
*  Would would yell about stuff and then they had a translation of it in English. [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8520.119999999999s)]
*  And so there are they doing it off text or they're doing off the sound of the like when he's saying the words and translating it. [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8525.92s)]
*  Because then you would know he's conveying a certain amount of emotion or are they editing it in post and saying he's got to be louder here he's yelling. [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8533.32s)]
*  Is a human involved in that. [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8543.16s)]
*  Or is a human involved in every part of that. [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8544.6s)]
*  So they're setting the hyper parameters of like how they are like how loud is it how like dynamic it is they can they can change all of that and they can change specific they can basically generate you know like five different options for the sentence and then. [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8546.560000000001s)]
*  That's so crazy. [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8562.2s)]
*  But that is an art form right. [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8563.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8564.720000000001s)]
*  But it really is so crazy that we're not going to be able to tell if you said something. [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8565.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8570.44s)]
*  Like we're kind of there. [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8571.279999999999s)]
*  There's there's real cheap ones of me selling everything I see all the time on Instagram. [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8573.4s)]
*  Like you know different rappers and country western songs and go to this plus go to this restaurant like you just generate them from a I. [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8579.08s)]
*  But you can still kind of tell. [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8587.64s)]
*  But then I've seen some ones. [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8589.359999999999s)]
*  I'm sure you've seen that one of the one guy where it's a completely A.I. [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8591.44s)]
*  Generated thing voice and everything and he's talking and he's telling you like this is completely A.I. [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8594.24s)]
*  Generated and you probably can't believe this but it's true. [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8599.4s)]
*  He's explaining how it's done and it's nuts. [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8602.24s)]
*  It's so realistic. [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8605.28s)]
*  And I mean I should say like from my experience with this Lenski conversation it's dubbed into all these languages is dubbed into English. [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8607.0s)]
*  He's speaking Ukrainian and Russian. [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8614.0s)]
*  There's a lot of people like I've seen this that think he's speaking English. [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8616.44s)]
*  Just because it's so close. [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8621.08s)]
*  Right. [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8622.8s)]
*  It's his voice. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8623.44s)]
*  Crazy. [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8624.52s)]
*  And so like now I have this responsibility. [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8625.2s)]
*  Here I am with my fucking exhausted sleep deprived translating like his exact words I could put whatever words in his mouth. [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8627.88s)]
*  Like I could have the slap on the wrist thing I fuck you know. [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8635.0s)]
*  Let me just take responsibility I guess I fucked up. [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8639.24s)]
*  You know it's three hours it's very tough to like. [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8641.44s)]
*  Right. [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8643.48s)]
*  But like I could have you know put in like I like dicks in there. [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8644.8s)]
*  Just just throw it in there you know just for fun. [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8651.2s)]
*  That's kind of crazy right. [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8653.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8655.24s)]
*  And it's out and there's a lot of people that believe like OK this is what he's saying. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8655.72s)]
*  Right. [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8659.24s)]
*  So I mean there's a huge responsibility with that and I think that's why people trust a particular podcast and so on like you're not going to fuck with that responsibility. [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8659.92s)]
*  Right. [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8668.48s)]
*  No you're very aware of it and you take it very seriously. [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8668.8s)]
*  Yeah but it's still hard to decide who and how to talk to is really really difficult to think through the Zelensky conversations think difficult to think about whether to talk to Putin or not and how to talk to him it's difficult to think about Benjamin Netanyahu to talk to him after October 7th. [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8673.640000000001s)]
*  He's one of the most universally hated people on the planet now. [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8689.32s)]
*  Right. [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8691.960000000001s)]
*  And it's like OK so how do you. [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8692.48s)]
*  Right. [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8694.08s)]
*  Talk to him. [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8694.68s)]
*  And what what do you get him to say about the innocent people that have been killed. [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8695.84s)]
*  But he has a certain perspective which I should say that a lot of people inside Israel probably support. [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8700.72s)]
*  It's I mean I should also say not now but earlier in Qatar when the Hamas was in Qatar they were interested in doing a podcast. [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8709.64s)]
*  The the members of Hamas who are not in hiding so the representatives were interested in doing a podcast and they decided not to because it's like everyone knows what Hamas is it's almost like easy when I do a podcast but it was like well that just feels I mean you are platforming hate there that's in a way where you can't properly dissect and present and act on it. [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8719.44s)]
*  Analyze and push and pull. [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8749.44s)]
*  You can't criticize them. [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8751.76s)]
*  You're not going to be in a position where you can criticize them. [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8754.16s)]
*  Well I should say in Qatar it's safe. [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8758.16s)]
*  What's up. [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8760.800000000001s)]
*  In Qatar it's safe. [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8762.44s)]
*  So there I could criticize. [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8764.08s)]
*  In fact one of the ways I would imagine talking to Hamas is pushing them actually pretty hard. [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8765.36s)]
*  In that case I would actually push hard and they would probably because a lot of them are kind of just a pretty shallow and insane. [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8770.0s)]
*  So like they would just get really angry like there's a real anger. [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8779.28s)]
*  They would not come off as one of the fears talking to dictators. [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8783.24s)]
*  Is just the charisma. [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8788.64s)]
*  This is like they would you know my opening statement to Netanyahu was you know a lot of people hate you. [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8790.880000000001s)]
*  When I talk to them and all this a lot of people are protesting outside. [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8800.36s)]
*  There's a lot of people that hate you. [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8803.64s)]
*  What do you get to say. [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8805.6s)]
*  What do you have to say to those people. [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8807.199999999999s)]
*  That's the opening thing. [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8809.32s)]
*  He says like he said something like everybody loves me. [[02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8810.439999999999s)]
*  I just gave a talk in Iran and 20 million people listen to me and they love me. [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8815.279999999999s)]
*  So this is like so how do you talk to a person where the reality is like well no no there are there's people that love you. [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8822.84s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8831.96s)]
*  But there's quite a lot of people outside that don't they don't love you. [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8833.24s)]
*  What did you expect him when you brought that up. [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8838.32s)]
*  Did you have expectations. [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8841.44s)]
*  Would you expect him to say. [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8843.44s)]
*  I expected for him to analyze where that hate comes from to start to empathize fake or not to understand that perspective and to understand the perspective maybe of the Palestinians or the Gazans that hate him. [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8845.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8860.56s)]
*  And then maybe make the case of Israel like. [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8861.039999999999s)]
*  After steel manning the Palestinian case say well listen we're like this tiny country that everybody's shooting rockets at. [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8865.439999999999s)]
*  Make then make the case for Israel the historic case the military case the geopolitical case. [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8872.8s)]
*  Right. [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8878.119999999999s)]
*  But he did it was there was like everybody loves me. [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8878.599999999999s)]
*  But in that answer. [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8883.24s)]
*  You think he really believed that. [[02:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8884.92s)]
*  Yeah yeah. [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8886.439999999999s)]
*  He believed it. [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8887.4s)]
*  He's locked in. [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8888.279999999999s)]
*  Locked in but or I mean it's complicated. [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8889.599999999999s)]
*  He's just so. [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8893.16s)]
*  That was definitely a wall. [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8895.72s)]
*  How much more time does he have in power. [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8897.16s)]
*  I mean that's a it's a consistent minute by minute thing. [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8899.96s)]
*  He as long as he is being elected. [[02:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8902.519999999999s)]
*  And it's the same question for Zelensky. [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8907.119999999999s)]
*  How long does he have in power. [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8909.48s)]
*  It's the same question. [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8911.599999999999s)]
*  When when is Israel have their elections again. [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8912.519999999999s)]
*  Are they doing that while they're in the middle of this conflict. [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8915.839999999998s)]
*  I'm not deeply familiar with like the dynamics of it but I think they can have elections at any time. [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8919.2s)]
*  Like there's a there's coalitions. [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8923.880000000001s)]
*  Form that can I think it's a bunch of countries have this kind of thing. [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8926.0s)]
*  So I think there's elections coming up. [[02:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8930.0s)]
*  There might be a martial law type of situation forgive me I'm not exactly sure but it is basically under constant internal political pressure where he can lose power. [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8934.320000000002s)]
*  Are you aware at all of his political opponents. [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8943.76s)]
*  Yeah there's a there's a bunch there's a bunch of there's a bunch of people. [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8948.36s)]
*  I mean they have to walk a tightrope because there is a lot of fear and anger inside of Israel now. [[02:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8954.240000000002s)]
*  Like you said after October 7th there's like an existential fear when. [[02:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8960.0s)]
*  The whole assumption of the Israeli people was that like this kind of attack cannot possibly happen. [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8966.04s)]
*  Right. With Iron Dome and the defenses. [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8971.880000000001s)]
*  And so you have a more. [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8974.88s)]
*  There's more room this capacity to elect more radical people that are more right wing they're more aggressive they're more militaristic. [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8977.72s)]
*  Well this is why we want to make big reasons why people. [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8985.44s)]
*  Love to dive into the false flag narrative because they find an incentive for people to allow something to take place because if you allow something to take place and you sacrifice a certain percentage of your population. [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=8989.92s)]
*  You you have now new rules and you have much more power and you have a society that's behind you now because there's a reason why they want to fight. [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9001.56s)]
*  And this is why anytime there's anything that ever happens there's a bunch of people think it's a false flag. [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9012.960000000001s)]
*  Bunch of people think 9-11 was a false flag and then there's real ones that we know about like Operation Northwoods didn't happen but they really did sign joint chiefs of staff signed a proposal. [[02:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9018.04s)]
*  Where they wanted to blow up American airliner and blame Cuba we wanted to arm Cuban friendlies and attack Guantanamo Bay and they wanted to invade Cuba under false pretenses of a false flag. [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9030.76s)]
*  We really do stuff like that. [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9045.32s)]
*  It's it's a and I say by we I mean humans humans in power Nero burned Rome like Hitler burned the Reichstag. [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9047.76s)]
*  There's there's false flags that they create these situations to force people to fight. [[02:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9055.08s)]
*  And that's a real thing but it's also. [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9062.32s)]
*  It's also like people get caught with their pants down too so it's like it's hard to know what's what. [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9068.119999999999s)]

*  I think it was for a couple of hours. [[02:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9593.039999999999s)]
*  Maybe it's possible. [[02:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9596.88s)]
*  Maybe we're going to find out soon right. [[02:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9598.439999999999s)]
*  Hopefully unless they go through Antarctica. [[02:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9600.519999999999s)]
*  There's so it's like a donut. [[02:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9603.919999999998s)]
*  That's what it is. [[02:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9605.519999999999s)]
*  The intense band of radiation is like a donut. [[02:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9606.039999999999s)]
*  But apparently the actual amount of radiation is not that intense. [[02:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9609.88s)]
*  I mean again speaking as a massage agent. [[02:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9614.72s)]
*  Depends on who you're asking. [[02:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9617.32s)]
*  Van Allen thought it was pretty fucking intense. [[02:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9618.64s)]
*  And also there was Operation Starfish Prime. [[02:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9620.96s)]
*  Do you know about that. [[02:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9623.279999999999s)]
*  Operation Starfish Prime they were trying to blow a hole through the radiation belt. [[02:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9625.279999999999s)]
*  So they launched nuclear weapons into space and detonated them and had the opposite effect. [[02:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9628.68s)]
*  Like supercharged the radiation belt made it more radioactive. [[02:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9634.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9640.32s)]
*  Operation Starfish Prime. [[02:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9640.76s)]
*  Google that. [[02:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9641.92s)]
*  What's that. [[02:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9644.08s)]
*  I think it's temporary. [[02:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9644.439999999999s)]
*  Like it just dissipated. [[02:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9645.48s)]
*  Oh yeah yeah yeah. [[02:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9646.88s)]
*  Jamie is also a massage. [[02:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9647.48s)]
*  No no he's right. [[02:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9649.720000000001s)]
*  No he's right. [[02:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9650.720000000001s)]
*  But I mean like when they measured it when they measured it was like way more radiation they didn't blow a hole through it at all. [[02:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9651.44s)]
*  They fucked it up. [[02:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9657.560000000001s)]
*  They supercharged it. [[02:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9658.480000000001s)]
*  But just the fact that they were trying to do that they were trying to blow up nuclear weapons in space like if I was the aliens that's when I would start showing up. [[02:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9660.44s)]
*  Like look at these fucking assholes. [[02:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9669.04s)]
*  High altitude nuclear tests. [[02:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9671.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9673.04s)]
*  What are people doing. [[02:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9673.800000000001s)]
*  Not only that it shut off the power in Hawaii. [[02:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9675.2s)]
*  It fucked Hawaii up. [[02:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9677.800000000001s)]
*  Hawaii had like a brown out like these guys are psychopaths. [[02:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9679.68s)]
*  Can you imagine like sitting at a table with a bunch of generals and this guy comes in with a cigar. [[02:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9684.16s)]
*  I want to launch a fucking nuke in space. [[02:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9689.92s)]
*  I want to see what happens. [[02:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9692.76s)]
*  I just want to see what happens. [[02:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9693.92s)]
*  You know what my favorite one of those is. [[02:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9696.04s)]
*  The very first detonation of the very first nuclear bomb. [[02:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9697.76s)]
*  There was a non zero chance that that bomb was going to destroy the entire atmosphere of the earth. [[02:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9700.84s)]
*  Just imagine what that feels like right. [[02:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9706.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9708.68s)]
*  And they were like let's see. [[02:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9709.199999999999s)]
*  Let's see. [[02:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9710.64s)]
*  Boom. [[02:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9711.359999999999s)]
*  No. [[02:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9712.119999999999s)]
*  We're still here. [[02:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9712.6s)]
*  They're reasonably sure that it wasn't going to do that. [[02:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9713.32s)]
*  But you know you've never done that before. [[02:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9716.359999999999s)]
*  Who knows. [[02:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9718.52s)]
*  And there's a lot of people asking the question of like in the war in Ukraine whether Putin is willing to use even tactical nuclear weapons. [[02:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9719.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9728.279999999999s)]
*  Just send a statement. [[02:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9728.6s)]
*  That's an open question. [[02:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9729.96s)]
*  It is an open question. [[02:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9731.039999999999s)]
*  And it's like a terrifying possibility. [[02:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9732.199999999999s)]
*  We I think generationally have forgotten what nuclear weapons are. [[02:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9733.8s)]
*  Right. [[02:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9738.199999999999s)]
*  Like most people think it's like a fun tech talk meme. [[02:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9739.16s)]
*  Right. [[02:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9742.279999999999s)]
*  The mushroom call could just. [[02:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9743.599999999999s)]
*  And then and then what happens next. [[02:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9745.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9747.92s)]
*  What are the two back and forth back and forth. [[02:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9748.24s)]
*  Now everything's gone. [[02:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9750.8s)]
*  Everything's gone like that. [[02:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9752.08s)]
*  And that's why I'm excited about Starship launches because the back of the back. [[02:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9754.48s)]
*  Get the fuck out of here. [[02:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9758.88s)]
*  Let's live on the sex cult on Mars. [[02:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9761.279999999999s)]
*  No I prefer the sex cult. [[02:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9763.96s)]
*  Right. [[02:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9768.08s)]
*  But if you had to be a person who lived and Earth was going to blow you'd probably try it. [[02:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9768.4s)]
*  You try you'd say listen maybe we can maybe I'm going to be the fucking Davy Crockett of Mars. [[02:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9774.8s)]
*  And then years from now this will be a mall. [[02:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9781.64s)]
*  And everybody remember when Lex came over on the rocket. [[02:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9783.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9786.759999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9787.359999999999s)]
*  I mean it's really is exciting to see what kind of societies form on Mars. [[02:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9787.96s)]
*  Even just a hundred people a thousand people ten thousand people a hundred thousand people. [[02:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9791.88s)]
*  What are the prospects of terraforming. [[02:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9795.48s)]
*  Because the problem is like Mars is too far from the sun. [[02:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9799.0s)]
*  Like it's just not warm enough. [[02:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9802.039999999999s)]
*  Like so what are they going to do in terms of like oxygen. [[02:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9804.2s)]
*  And do you know Terrence Howard the actor. [[02:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9807.84s)]
*  You know Terrence Howard's theory. [[02:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9810.56s)]
*  He's got a great theory. [[02:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9812.68s)]
*  It's really interesting theory. [[02:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9813.96s)]
*  He thinks that all solar systems that instead of it being like a collection of debris. [[02:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9816.0s)]
*  From the outer galaxies is that too. [[02:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9825.16s)]
*  But what it really is is the sun is ejecting matter. [[02:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9828.96s)]
*  And we know that right. [[02:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9833.88s)]
*  So after millions and millions of years of sun ejecting matter the matter coalesces and becomes a planet. [[02:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9834.8s)]
*  As it gets further and further from the sun it becomes more hospitable to life. [[02:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9841.24s)]
*  As it gets into that Goldilocks zone where Earth is it peoples. [[02:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9846.56s)]
*  And then he thinks that this is happening all throughout the galaxy. [[02:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9851.4s)]
*  That planets get to a certain stage and then they people. [[02:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9854.76s)]
*  And then those planets are slowly going to move further and further out of get away further and get colder and colder. [[02:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9857.640000000001s)]
*  And it's up to these creatures to figure out how to get the fuck out of there before it becomes inhospitable. [[02:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9864.52s)]
*  And that's where the advanced civilizations come in. [[02:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9871.800000000001s)]
*  And this is why he thinks the most advanced civilizations are on the planets of the furthest from the sun. [[02:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9874.960000000001s)]
*  Because they're the ones who have adapted and figured out a way to exist off of some other form of energy other than just sunlight. [[02:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9879.64s)]
*  What does he have an idea about which planets in our solar system might be people. [[02:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9886.52s)]
*  Probably used to be Mars Mars. [[02:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9890.16s)]
*  Still or no. [[02:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9892.56s)]
*  No there's nothing on there now. [[02:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9893.56s)]
*  I mean it's not. [[02:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9895.359999999999s)]
*  But there could have been it was an atmosphere. [[02:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9896.84s)]
*  It could be life there now there's water there. [[02:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9899.0s)]
*  There could be. [[02:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9901.039999999999s)]
*  Well there's probably some sort of bacterial life right. [[02:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9902.16s)]
*  There's probably the real question is is there any evidence that there was other life. [[02:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9905.160000000002s)]
*  Like think about how difficult it is for us to find like dinosaur bones right. [[02:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9910.400000000001s)]
*  Like dinosaurs have to become a fossil. [[02:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9914.480000000001s)]
*  It's like it's a very complicated process. [[02:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9916.44s)]
*  They have to die in mud or something. [[02:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9918.28s)]
*  They have to get covered up and then they calcify. [[02:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9919.960000000001s)]
*  And if you don't know when you get a fossil the bone that's fossilized it's not really that bone. [[02:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9922.6s)]
*  What it is is it's been re mineralized by all the earth elements. [[02:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9928.68s)]
*  And so it's kind of a different thing but it's in the shape of the bone. [[02:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9933.24s)]
*  That's fossilized bone. [[02:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9937.88s)]
*  And what if you're talking about like 30 million years 50 million years 100 million years 200 [[02:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9939.8s)]
*  million years a billion years. [[02:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9947.0s)]
*  What if Mars a billion years ago had life on it. [[02:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9949.4s)]
*  What would be left. [[02:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9952.96s)]
*  Nothing. [[02:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9954.08s)]
*  I mean in that case nothing. [[02:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9954.76s)]
*  What would be left. [[02:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9956.2s)]
*  Like Earth is four point something billion years old right. [[02:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9957.2s)]
*  How old is Mars. [[02:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9960.84s)]
*  Do we know. [[02:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9962.16s)]
*  How old is Mars. [[02:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9963.2s)]
*  Yeah that's good estimates for that. [[02:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9963.88s)]
*  Like is Mars older. [[02:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9965.039999999999s)]
*  I believe it's older yeah. [[02:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9966.56s)]
*  So that's pretty similar. [[02:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9969.2s)]
*  Right. [[02:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9971.68s)]
*  When did the solar system start forming. [[02:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9972.28s)]
*  See these are just wild guesses by a bunch of fucking eggheads. [[02:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9974.52s)]
*  The solar system formed four point five billion years ago. [[02:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9977.24s)]
*  Bunch of eggheads with wild guesses. [[02:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9978.76s)]
*  I'm going with Terence Howard. [[02:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9981.28s)]
*  I think he's right. [[02:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9982.96s)]
*  I think. [[02:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9983.96s)]
*  What a brilliant idea though. [[02:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9984.72s)]
*  I'm offended you call him an actor. [[02:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9986.08s)]
*  He could be a mathematician physicist. [[02:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9987.4s)]
*  He's a lot of things. [[02:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9989.8s)]
*  Brilliant guy. [[02:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9991.24s)]
*  His conversation with you with Eric with Eric Weinstein and and you was just as art. [[02:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9992.08s)]
*  It's a good conversation. [[02:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9998.56s)]
*  Some conversations are art. [[02:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=9999.4s)]
*  Yeah that was a good one because he's a good guy. [[02:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10000.8s)]
*  He's a good guy and Eric's a very good guy the way he handled it. [[02:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10003.759999999998s)]
*  You know he was stern and very clear and obvious that who is right. [[02:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10006.679999999998s)]
*  But very kind and very friendly which is a quality that Eric has like the ability to do that especially when you're talking about something that's so [[02:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10012.439999999999s)]
*  incredibly complex and esoteric. [[02:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10021.36s)]
*  You know like you're talking about like super complicated math and he's showing it to him. [[02:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10024.16s)]
*  Do you know how to do this. [[02:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10028.56s)]
*  When you're showing on the board and you can tell he doesn't know how to do this. [[02:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10029.88s)]
*  He's like let me explain how this works. [[02:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10032.119999999999s)]
*  And then you realize like oh boy self taught. [[02:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10033.96s)]
*  You know this is the thing like there's a lot of brilliant people that just don't get the correct education but they're still brilliant. [[02:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10036.92s)]
*  Yeah the raw horsepowers. [[02:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10042.88s)]
*  Yes the raw horsepowers there. [[02:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10044.84s)]
*  Yeah but I think this theory that he has about planets peopling. [[02:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10046.68s)]
*  I find it so fascinating. [[02:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10051.16s)]
*  I couldn't stop thinking about it for days. [[02:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10052.44s)]
*  I was like I think he's right. [[02:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10055.04s)]
*  Yeah I mean we're going to find out. [[02:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10058.0s)]
*  We're going to find like even if you discover bacteria on Mars. [[02:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10059.52s)]
*  That that's going to change everything. [[02:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10064.04s)]
*  OK. [[02:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10067.4s)]
*  I'm convinced that there's alien life throughout the even the galaxy. [[02:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10068.720000000001s)]
*  But that's a really open question. [[02:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10073.0s)]
*  And most people don't think so. [[02:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10075.04s)]
*  You know what I think. [[02:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10076.800000000001s)]
*  I don't think it gets past where we are very often. [[02:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10078.0s)]
*  I think it probably fucks up a lot. [[02:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10083.24s)]
*  I think it's too difficult to harness the power of the sun while you're a tribal monkey and not blow yourself up or fuck things up horribly or just get involved in natural disasters he didn't adequately prepare for. [[02:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10085.56s)]
*  I mean we're still not prepared at all for asteroid impacts. [[02:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10099.119999999999s)]
*  I mean yeah young address impact theory is very recent. [[02:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10102.6s)]
*  Yeah and also super volcanoes. [[02:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10105.359999999999s)]
*  We're not prepared at all. [[02:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10107.0s)]
*  If we have a super volcano of Yellowstone blows which it's gonna one of these is gonna one of the big ones is going to blow. [[02:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10108.359999999999s)]
*  They just do. [[02:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10113.8s)]
*  They might blow 100000 years from now. [[02:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10114.56s)]
*  It might blow next week. [[02:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10116.56s)]
*  They fucking happen. [[02:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10118.519999999999s)]
*  And we're not prepared. [[02:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10119.679999999998s)]
*  We're not prepared for that. [[02:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10120.72s)]
*  Even if you just look at the L.A. [[02:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10121.56s)]
*  fire started to interrupt like imagine the chaos that's going to be created. [[02:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10122.919999999998s)]
*  Oh and imagine the L.A. [[02:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10127.32s)]
*  fires with no fire department. [[02:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10128.4s)]
*  Right. [[02:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10130.4s)]
*  OK. [[02:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10130.8s)]
*  Imagine that. [[02:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10131.16s)]
*  Imagine that there's no one out there trying to put that fire out. [[02:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10131.839999999998s)]
*  That would be fucking insane. [[02:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10135.48s)]
*  And you know I think civilization has probably gone through a gang of those before. [[02:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10137.800000000001s)]
*  I think Graham Hancock is much as he gets criticized I think he's on to something. [[02:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10143.64s)]
*  I think Randall Carlson is as well. [[02:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10148.4s)]
*  I think they're on to something. [[02:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10150.32s)]
*  I think this part's probably the end of the ice age is probably asteroid impacts. [[02:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10151.6s)]
*  There's too much physical evidence that corresponds with the timeline for it to be ignored. [[02:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10156.12s)]
*  I mean it's a pretty accepted theory now. [[02:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10161.160000000002s)]
*  The Younger Dryas Impact Theory. [[02:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10163.880000000001s)]
*  It's just like what happened during that time and what existed before that time and all [[02:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10165.08s)]
*  the stuff that we see a few thousand years later. [[02:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10169.400000000001s)]
*  Is that a reimagining of civilization out of complete and utter chaos. [[02:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10171.240000000002s)]
*  Because I think it might be and it might be one of the reasons why we're so fucking [[02:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10176.08s)]
*  barbaric. [[02:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10179.52s)]
*  It might be that our ancestors were the ones who survived the most horrific time in [[02:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10180.84s)]
*  history where we got hit by asteroids and civilization just evaporated [[02:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10186.960000000001s)]
*  instantaneously. [[02:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10193.0s)]
*  Millions of people probably instantaneously died. [[02:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10193.8s)]
*  We were left with chaos in a completely different climate. [[02:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10196.72s)]
*  Places that were covered in ice are now raging rivers. [[02:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10199.92s)]
*  The whole thing's fucked. [[02:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10204.0s)]
*  All the animals are dead. [[02:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10205.16s)]
*  Most people you know that are anywhere near the impact are dead. [[02:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10206.76s)]
*  People get washed away in the floods. [[02:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10210.2s)]
*  Entire civilizations just instantaneously flooded and destroyed. [[02:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10211.880000000001s)]
*  That could happen again. [[02:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10218.32s)]
*  That could happen again tomorrow. [[02:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10219.68s)]
*  That could happen again next month. [[02:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10221.52s)]
*  It's we're in the shooting gallery. [[02:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10223.48s)]
*  We're in the shooting gallery of the universe and I bet that's pretty common. [[02:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10226.48s)]
*  So I bet the race is to try to get intelligent enough that you can do all these different [[02:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10230.16s)]
*  things but also intelligent enough that you abandon these ancient primal instincts that [[02:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10236.960000000001s)]
*  you have. [[02:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10241.76s)]
*  And that's where we're we're at the cusp of that. [[02:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10243.48s)]
*  We're at the cusp of our tribal chaos mixed in with impossible knowledge. [[02:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10247.28s)]
*  And it's all like happening at the same time. [[02:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10255.92s)]
*  And so this is wild race that's going on and people like you and people like me and [[02:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10258.08s)]
*  people that are hopeful. [[02:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10262.880000000001s)]
*  We hope we get it right. [[02:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10264.2s)]
*  We hope we get it right. [[02:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10266.24s)]
*  But we might not get it right. [[02:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10267.24s)]
*  And I think out there in the universe I think it's probably more likely that people [[02:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10268.56s)]
*  don't get it right than do get it right. [[02:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10272.199999999999s)]
*  And if they do get wiped out. [[02:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10275.56s)]
*  I mean we got the Toba volcano. [[02:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10277.44s)]
*  We got down somewhere around 70,000 years ago to a few thousand people on earth. [[02:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10279.28s)]
*  What are those motherfuckers like? [[02:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10284.96s)]
*  Like Jesus Christ those are our ancestors. [[02:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10286.88s)]
*  Those people must have been brutal. [[02:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10289.48s)]
*  Well that's one of the things I've just seen even on the smaller scale of the war in [[02:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10292.0s)]
*  Ukraine is you know your house or the city gets destroyed and people adapt [[02:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10296.08s)]
*  immediately like the tough people rise up like he changes you immediately. [[02:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10303.96s)]
*  There's a resilience to the human spirit. [[02:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10308.32s)]
*  It's crazy. [[02:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10310.4s)]
*  You can adjust. [[02:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10311.48s)]
*  So if an asteroid hits earth like the United States you know say 70 percent of [[02:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10312.08s)]
*  people dead. [[02:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10318.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10319.56s)]
*  You get an unlocked power that like your character in the video game has. [[02:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10320.32s)]

*  How are you going to stop. [[02:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10718.84s)]
*  If it really is encrypted if they can't read it right. [[02:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10720.12s)]
*  This is WhatsApp. [[02:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10723.0s)]
*  If you use WhatsApp if you and I message each other on WhatsApp no one can read [[02:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10724.28s)]
*  it but us. [[02:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10728.08s)]
*  But the government wants the back door. [[02:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10729.48s)]
*  That's what they wanted with Telegram. [[02:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10730.84s)]
*  But that's crazy because you could use that back door in all kinds of ways. [[02:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10732.32s)]
*  They use that back door for signal. [[02:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10736.28s)]
*  That's how they found out that Tucker Carlson was talking to Putin's people [[02:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10738.08s)]
*  about setting up an interview. [[02:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10741.28s)]
*  He was like we know you did it on signals. [[02:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10745.0s)]
*  Tucker's like I didn't even know you could do that. [[02:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10747.04s)]
*  That's what Tucker says. [[02:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10748.92s)]
*  You think Tucker's lying. [[02:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10750.12s)]
*  How dare you. [[02:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10751.08s)]

*  Well Tucker said they read his signal. [[02:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10767.72s)]
*  Well it's very possible. [[02:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10769.679999999998s)]
*  But technologically I'm not sure how it's possible to do that. [[02:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10772.08s)]
*  I mean it's possible. [[02:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10774.4s)]
*  But the way it's been explained to me is even though your phone is encrypted it's [[02:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10776.8s)]
*  not encrypted to you. [[02:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10781.72s)]
*  Like you see it. [[02:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10782.56s)]
*  Like you see it messages you. [[02:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10783.359999999999s)]
*  It's encrypted peer to peer. [[02:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10784.679999999998s)]
*  Right. [[02:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10786.16s)]
*  So if they can just see your phone. [[02:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10786.56s)]
*  You mean this is all they have to do is screen. [[02:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10789.199999999999s)]
*  100 percent. [[02:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10790.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10791.439999999999s)]
*  Not just screen recording. [[02:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10791.92s)]
*  Get access to your phone. [[02:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10793.119999999999s)]

*  But signals. [[02:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10797.0s)]
*  Signal communications and encrypted. [[02:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10797.84s)]
*  It's difficult. [[03:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10800.08s)]
*  I mean it's possible it's difficult. [[03:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10800.76s)]
*  But it's not through signal. [[03:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10802.039999999999s)]
*  If you're going through the phone. [[03:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10803.4s)]
*  So if you're using Pegasus you're just compromising the entire phone. [[03:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10804.52s)]
*  If signals on that phone you know the passwords already. [[03:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10807.84s)]
*  You go into signal you can go into anything. [[03:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10811.24s)]
*  Oh in that way. [[03:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10812.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10813.68s)]
*  You have access to the phone. [[03:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10814.199999999999s)]
*  But that's right. [[03:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10815.6s)]
*  That's that's legitimate hacking. [[03:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10816.800000000001s)]
*  Right. [[03:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10818.28s)]
*  Right. [[03:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10818.720000000001s)]
*  But this is what they're doing. [[03:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10818.84s)]
*  Right. [[03:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10819.960000000001s)]
*  Like. [[03:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10820.4s)]
*  That's not what they wanted with telegram. [[03:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10822.92s)]
*  They wanted to legitimately like full on backdoor. [[03:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10824.28s)]
*  But Gavin De Becker has explained this to me. [[03:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10826.6s)]
*  He said with with Pegasus one you needed to click a link. [[03:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10828.92s)]
*  Right. [[03:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10833.12s)]
*  There's this. [[03:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10833.36s)]
*  This is the Jeff Bezos thing. [[03:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10833.92s)]
*  Someone sent him a bad link on WhatsApp. [[03:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10835.28s)]
*  He clicked it. [[03:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10837.2s)]
*  They had access to his phone. [[03:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10838.08s)]
*  They are compromising information on him. [[03:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10839.24s)]
*  With Pegasus two they just need your phone number. [[03:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10842.16s)]
*  So they got your phone number. [[03:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10845.6s)]
*  Boom. [[03:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10846.560000000001s)]

*  That's it. [[03:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10847.36s)]
*  And so if that's the case if you have a. [[03:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10848.76s)]
*  An app like signal like I would assume they could read your [[03:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10852.880000000001s)]
*  signal. [[03:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10856.16s)]
*  Because it's like right there on your phone like if you already [[03:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10858.08s)]
*  got the phone open and they've got a compromise where they can [[03:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10860.08s)]

*  So they want to hate on you by attacking your shitty. [[03:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10943.240000000002s)]
*  But it's just hilarious because like well they got you. [[03:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10945.960000000001s)]
*  You gave them a little rope. [[03:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10948.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10949.52s)]
*  And they hung you with it. [[03:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10949.720000000001s)]
*  But like what I'm saying is that's not a big deal. [[03:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10951.240000000002s)]
*  The bigger deal is like if you grew up with that. [[03:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10953.36s)]
*  So there's like you said when you're 14 or 16. [[03:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10956.0s)]
*  Yeah exactly. [[03:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10959.36s)]
*  It's even the piece like you know that that stuff like the [[03:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10960.52s)]
*  article all that kind of stuff you can even. [[03:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10963.24s)]
*  I mean one of the big things we have to do is allow people to [[03:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10965.36s)]
*  evolve and just say you know yeah yeah that was shit poetry. [[03:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10967.720000000001s)]
*  Well I'm still horrible. [[03:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10971.04s)]
*  I'm worse at poetry now but like that was embarrassing that I [[03:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10972.24s)]
*  would be publishing. [[03:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10975.24s)]
*  I think that these people that attack almost all of them are [[03:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10976.880000000001s)]
*  leftists. [[03:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10979.68s)]
*  And I think leftism is a religion just like being a [[03:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10980.4s)]
*  Christian is religion in that there's like there's a way that [[03:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10985.199999999999s)]
*  you approach it. [[03:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10989.36s)]
*  Mark Andreessen says it best. [[03:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10991.0s)]
*  He was describing that it has all the attributes of a cult. [[03:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10992.88s)]
*  And I think people have a default system in their mind. [[03:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=10997.56s)]
*  We all do that we fall into that gives us like a religious like [[03:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11002.6s)]
*  adherence to some ideas. [[03:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11007.039999999999s)]
*  And the thing that this cult is lacking which is paramount [[03:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11009.0s)]
*  Christianity is forgiveness. [[03:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11014.199999999999s)]
*  There's no route road to redemption. [[03:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11016.88s)]
*  Everyone is ostracized and kicked out. [[03:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11020.36s)]
*  And what you wind up doing is you wind up cannibalizing your [[03:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11022.88s)]
*  own thing. [[03:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11025.64s)]
*  You can never be left enough. [[03:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11026.119999999999s)]
*  There's always crazy people that are like far to the end of it. [[03:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11027.36s)]
*  And every ideological group gets defined by its most extreme [[03:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11029.96s)]
*  members. [[03:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11033.68s)]
*  That's why when people think about far right people who do [[03:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11034.92s)]
*  you think the worst people you think of like people who want [[03:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11037.04s)]
*  war war mongers assholes stupid people on you know uneducated. [[03:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11039.080000000002s)]
*  That's what people think of when they think like the worst they [[03:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11044.960000000001s)]
*  think of like white nationalists. [[03:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11046.92s)]
*  That's what they think of when they think of far right. [[03:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11048.560000000001s)]
*  So you can kind of like you flavor everything else in the [[03:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11050.640000000001s)]
*  group by the worst members of the group. [[03:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11053.320000000002s)]
*  And if you don't have forgiveness in your religion like [[03:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11056.080000000002s)]
*  you have a fucking terrible religion if you don't have a [[03:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11059.240000000002s)]
*  path to redemption and you want extreme adherence to dogma. [[03:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11061.12s)]
*  Even if like even if whatever this idea was ideology that you're [[03:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11067.160000000002s)]
*  pushing it's like clearly clearly destructive to a bunch of [[03:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11070.68s)]
*  humans. [[03:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11074.880000000001s)]
*  That's what they're dealing with. [[03:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11076.84s)]
*  It's like people fall into thought patterns man that most [[03:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11077.84s)]
*  people are too busy to formalize their own opinion. [[03:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11081.080000000002s)]
*  So they develop opinions to sort of merge with the people that [[03:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11084.560000000001s)]
*  they're in touch with all the time. [[03:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11087.92s)]
*  And if you get stuck in one of those fucking woke hives like [[03:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11090.0s)]
*  you're you're basically surrounded by mentally ill people [[03:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11094.52s)]
*  that are preaching in a logical version of the world that no [[03:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11097.96s)]
*  one no one believes could ever exist. [[03:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11101.32s)]
*  I hope there there will be left wing leaders that emerge that [[03:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11105.56s)]
*  kind of shed that. [[03:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11110.119999999999s)]
*  I think they will have to just by virtue of their survival. [[03:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11111.56s)]
*  I think the woke thing is so widely rejected now. [[03:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11115.039999999999s)]
*  And when I say the woke thing I mean this this what Elon calls [[03:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11118.84s)]
*  the mind virus the crazy aspect of it like your kid knows it's [[03:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11121.880000000001s)]
*  trans when it's to that kind of shit like the people that are [[03:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11125.76s)]
*  just far off the rails. [[03:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11128.56s)]
*  That's going to die off. [[03:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11132.16s)]
*  It's just it's just too nutty and it doesn't make any sense [[03:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11133.4s)]
*  and it's ultimately destructive to a lot of different groups of [[03:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11137.36s)]
*  people. [[03:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11139.960000000001s)]
*  And it's not fair. [[03:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11140.56s)]
*  It's like the trans women in sports things the most unfair [[03:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11141.8s)]
*  aspect of it. [[03:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11145.960000000001s)]
*  That one that one's so crazy when you see people argue for it [[03:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11146.64s)]
*  inclusivity like you're out of your fucking mind like you're [[03:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11150.92s)]
*  out of your mind and the inability to discern who's a [[03:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11154.2s)]
*  pervert and who's actually trans like the impossible nature [[03:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11156.76s)]
*  and then just green lighting perverts to do whatever they [[03:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11160.56s)]
*  want. [[03:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11163.64s)]
*  And that you know my concern is I do think the woke ism is [[03:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11164.08s)]
*  either dying or dead. [[03:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11168.76s)]
*  My concern is those folks who are now looking for a new [[03:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11170.28s)]
*  religion. [[03:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11172.72s)]
*  There's people like that on the right. [[03:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11173.32s)]
*  I think they're mostly rejected. [[03:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11174.52s)]
*  No there's a lot of people like that on the right. [[03:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11176.96s)]
*  The right has a woke right. [[03:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11178.6s)]

*  There's there's an aspect of the right that attacks other people [[03:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11185.32s)]
*  on the right especially now because the right has like more [[03:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11187.76s)]
*  attention than ever before. [[03:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11190.56s)]
*  There's like there's a whole always going to be a group in any [[03:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11192.039999999999s)]
*  sort of ideology. [[03:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11194.96s)]
*  There's going to be a group of people that use the opportunity [[03:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11195.92s)]
*  to attack people to elevate themselves. [[03:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11200.24s)]
*  Yeah I think Mark Andreessen going up five minutes. [[03:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11203.279999999999s)]
*  I think Mark Andreessen calls the battle I think on the right [[03:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11207.64s)]
*  maybe between the techno libertarians versus the [[03:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11210.52s)]
*  nationalists. [[03:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11215.32s)]
*  So there's these like protectionist people that say [[03:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11216.32s)]
*  like no more immigration. [[03:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11218.92s)]

*  ideas. [[03:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11224.8s)]
*  These people that say we need to fucking build. [[03:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E&t=11225.68s)]
