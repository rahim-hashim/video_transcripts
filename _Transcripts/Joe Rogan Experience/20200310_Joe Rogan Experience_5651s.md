# Joe Rogan Experience #1439 - Michael Osterholm
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [March 10, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3URhJx0NSw)
*  All right, here we go. So what you said when you sat down was absolutely perfect. The timing
*  could not have been better. Well, tell everybody what you do, Michael.
*  Well, thank you. I'm, for lack of a better term, a medical detective. I've spent my whole
*  career tracking infectious diseases down, trying to stop them, trying to understand where they
*  come from so we can make sure they don't happen in the first place. But most of all, trying
*  to respond to situations just like this.
*  Just like this. And just off the bat, how serious is this? Is this something that we need to be
*  terrified of? Or is this overblown? Or how do you stand on this?
*  Well, first of all, you have to understand the timing of it in the sense that it's just beginning.
*  And so in terms of what hurt, pain, suffering, death has happened so far is really just beginning.
*  This is going to unfold for months to come yet. And that's, I think, what people don't quite yet
*  understand. What we saw in China, I'm convinced as are many of my colleagues, as soon as they
*  release all of these social distances, these mandated stay-in homes, haven't left their home in
*  weeks and weeks kind of thing, when they go back to work, they're on planes, trains, subways, buses,
*  crowded spaces, manufacturing plants, even China is going to come back again. And so this really
*  is acting like an influenza virus, something that transmits very, very easily through the air.
*  We now have data to show that you're infectious before you even get sick. And in some cases,
*  quite highly infectious, just breathing is all that you need to do. So from this perspective,
*  I can understand why people would say, well, wait a minute, flu kills a lot more itself every year
*  than this does. And I remind people this is just the beginning. Probably the best guesstimate we
*  have right now on what limited data we have would say this is going to be at least 10 to 15 times
*  worse than the worst seasonal flu year we see.
*  10 to 15 times worse in terms of fatalities?
*  Yeah, yeah. And just illness. In fact, I just brought some numbers. We conservatively estimate
*  that this could require 48 million hospitalizations, 96 million cases actually occurring,
*  over 480,000 deaths that can occur over the next three to seven months with this situation. So this
*  is not one that to take lightly. And I think that's what I can understand if you say it was
*  only 10 deaths or 20 deaths or 50 deaths. Just remember, two weeks ago, we were talking about
*  almost no cases in the United States. And now that we're testing for it, and watching the spread
*  as it's unfolding, those numbers are going up astronomically. Three weeks ago, Italy was just
*  living life just fine. Now they're literally in a virtual shutdown in the northern parts of Italy.
*  And that's the challenge with an infectious disease like this. It can spread very quickly. And it
*  also can affect people. I think maybe to put this into modern terms, because this is something we
*  think of often when we think of, you know, pre antibiotic days, you know, the old time medicine,
*  we have an employee at our Center for infectious disease research and policy at the University of
*  Minnesota. And she has a dear friend who lives in Milan, Italy. And she works at a hospital there.
*  And she texted us to this employee of ours last night. And this was an email that came out
*  yesterday from one of their physicians in Milan at the largest hospital there. He said, I just got a
*  very disturbing message from a cardiologist at one of the Milan's largest hospitals, they're deciding
*  who they have to let die. They aren't screening the staff anymore, because they need all hands on deck.
*  And they have a very small areas of the hospital dedicated to non COVID patients, where they still
*  screen doctors, everybody else is dedicated to COVID patients. So even if they're positive, meaning
*  that they're sick, they don't end but they don't have a severe cough or fever, then they have to
*  work. He says that, that they're seeing an alarming number of cases in the 40 something range rage.
*  And as horrible cases. So we need to stop thinking that this is an old person's disease. This is
*  what I'm going to unfold, not just in Wuhan, it's unfolding in Milan, it's unfolding here in Seattle.
*  And this is what's going to continue to rollingly unfold throughout the world.
*  Yeah, where did this rumor come from that it's a an old person's disease? Is it just because the
*  majority of the people that have died from it so far have been older?
*  Yes. In fact, that's the primary risk factor for dying is being old and then having certain underlying
*  health problems. For example, in China, those men over the age of 70, who also smoked were 8 to 10% of
*  them died. 65% of older Chinese men smoke. The case fatality rate or the percentage of people who die
*  and women that same age group was only about 2%. In that case, very few women smoke. Now the
*  challenge we have is that that's the Chinese data. But there are a series of risk factors that we
*  worry about that if they overlay on this disease are going to cause bad outcomes. And we happen to
*  be right at ground zero for one of the major ones here in this country, that's obesity. We know that
*  obesity is just like smoking in terms of its ability to really cause severe, life threatening
*  disease. And 45% of our population today over the age of 45 in this country are obese or severely
*  obese, and there's men and women. So one of the concerns we have is we're going to see more of
*  these, what I guess I would call very serious and life threatening cases occur in our country
*  because of a different set of risk factors than we saw in China.
*  Now, you mentioned that there's some sort of an incubation period before people become sick,
*  they're still contagious. What is this incubation period and how do we know about it?
*  When we call something an incubation period, we're talking about from the time you and I got
*  exposed, meaning I was in a room breathing the air that somebody else who was infected with the
*  virus was expelling out, I breathed it in. How long from that time period till the time period
*  that you get sick? And what is that? That's what we call the incubation period. So that's when case
*  numbers can double or triple in every so many days. In this case, it's about four days. So and we
*  actually have data there from people who are exposed one time or one time only. And we know
*  when they were exposed, where they were exposed, and how soon do they get sick afterwards. So the
*  chauffeur in the car where an individual was sick, or showing symptoms, then the chauffeur gets it
*  four days later. You know, they were there one time and one time only.
*  And if the chauffeur does not show any symptoms, he's still contagious, he could still be
*  contagious too. And that's one of the things that's challenging here is you and I might get exposed
*  to somebody who is totally asymptomatic, no symptoms. That virus that appeared, well, that's not
*  a very strong virus. But in fact, when it infects us, it could kill us. So we've seen cases of fatal
*  disease that were exposed to people that had minor symptoms themselves.
*  Wow.
*  This is what's unfolding here. And this is where I think is such an important. And I said why the
*  timing is so important, because, you know, Joe, we've really got to get information out to the
*  public. There is so much misinformation right now. And, you know, we're going to be in this for a
*  while. This is not going to happen overnight. And I worry, I keep telling people we're handling this
*  like it's a corona blizzard, you know, two or three days, we're back to normal. This is a corona
*  virus winter. And we're going to have the next three months or more, six months or more, that are
*  going to be like this. And you know, so far, this thing has been unfolding exactly as we predicted
*  it. We and our center put out a piece on January 20th and said this is going to spread worldwide.
*  At the time, people said, no, it's just China. We put out a piece the first week of February and
*  said this is going to pop probably the last week of February, first week of March, because what
*  happens is it has what's called an R naught or a doubling time of these every four days. So to
*  increases doubling every four days. So if you go from two to four to eight to 16, it takes a while
*  to build up. But when you start going from 500 to 1000 to 2000 to 4000, that's what we're seeing
*  happen in places like Italy. We're beginning to see it in some ways up in Seattle. That's what
*  happened in China. And you know, when people are confronted with that, suddenly, this low risk
*  phenomena that everybody talks about isn't so low anymore. And that's what we need to prepare
*  people for.
*  Now, what can be done? Like, what can the average person do? I see people walking around with
*  masks on wearing gloves. Is that nonsense?
*  Largely. Yes. First of all, let's step back. The primary mechanism for transmission is just the
*  respiratory route. It's just breathing. In studies in Germany, which just have been published,
*  literally in the last 24 hours, they actually followed a group of people who had been exposed
*  to somebody in an automobile manufacturing plant. And then they had nine people that with this
*  exposure, he said, if you have any symptoms at all, contact us, we want to follow up with them.
*  They all agreed. Well, they got infected. And so in the very first hours, just feeling bad sore
*  throat, they went in and sampled the throats, their their saliva, their nose for virus, they did
*  blood, they did stool, they did urine. And they found that at that very moment, when they first
*  got sick, they had incredibly high levels of virus, sometimes 10,000 times that we saw with SARS
*  in their throats, meaning they were infectious at that point already. And they hadn't even had
*  symptoms yet of really any nature. They weren't coughing yet. And that's where we're concerned,
*  because that's the kind of transmission it's, you know, I always have said, trying to stop
*  influence virus transmission, like trying to stop the wind, you know, we've never had anything
*  successfully do that, other than vaccine, and we don't have a vaccine here. So what's happening is
*  that people in public spaces are getting infected. And the way you need to address that is,
*  unfortunately, if you're older, over 55, you have some underlying health problems, which,
*  unfortunately, a lot of Americans do, we have obesity, then right now, you don't want to be in
*  large public spaces and trying to potentially get infected. So you can take care of that part.
*  As far as what can public health do, we're not going to we can talk about this, we're not going
*  to have a vaccine anytime soon. That's happy talk. What we you know, we can close schools,
*  one of the big challenges we have right now, if we close schools, what do we accomplish
*  in influenza virus, when we close schools during outbreaks, because it turns out kids are get
*  infected in school, and they're like little virus reactors, you know, they come home, and they
*  transmit it to mom and dad and brothers and sisters. And so we close school sometimes,
*  it's Christmas breaks are always great for kind of putting the dampening effect on flu.
*  In this case, kids are not getting sick very often at all, which is one of the really good news
*  features of this disease. In China, only 2.1% of the cases were under 18, 19 years of age.
*  And why is that?
*  You know, we don't completely know. And I'm going to come back in a second, because they're getting
*  infected, it turns out one study showed that they still get infected with the virus, but they don't
*  get sick. And we have that happen. There's a disease called infectious hepatitis hepatitis A,
*  where we have outbreaks in daycares. And the way we know we have an outbreak is because it's
*  transmitted through the stool fecal oral, is mom and dad and the daycare providers all get sick.
*  And the kids, those symptoms we go in and test the kids are all positive. So some diseases will
*  manifest, my primary when you're adult, but not as a child, this one appears to be the same.
*  So do we close schools or not? If we're not really spreading the disease, because it turns out that
*  if we close schools, we had a recent study done showed that 38% of nurses today in this country
*  who are working in the medical care area have kids in school. And if suddenly we're closed
*  schools for two or three months, who's going to take care of those kids? One fourth of the
*  American population has no sick leave. If we close schools, they don't get paid if they have to stay
*  home. So when you ask what can we do, we have to really be thoughtful about what we do. Are we
*  doing more harm than good by closing schools, for example, even though everybody will say, oh, we
*  got to do everything we can. Or do we just tell people, you know, it's going to be limiting your
*  contact as much as you can. And that's really about what we can do. And limiting the contact,
*  is that really going to help? It does because it's like putting rods in a reaction. If you don't have
*  as much close contact, you can not transmit as much. If I'm sitting in a room with 100 people,
*  and we're kind of sharing air, the transmission is remarkable. Right here, off the coast of
*  California, you've got your cruise ship. Cruise ships are notorious for recirculating air inside
*  the inner cabins. We've had a number of outbreaks. That's why they're having these outbreaks on
*  cruise ships. And then you leave them on there. I think the cruelest human experiment we've done
*  in a long time with humans is leave them on these ships, get them off right away. Should they get
*  them off? Absolutely. What should they do with them? Well, they can put them in quarantines of some kind
*  if they want and follow up on them. But you're guaranteed they're all going to keep getting
*  infected day after day. It seems like we're not really prepared for something like this, although
*  the CDC has been telling us for a long time that we should be. You know, we are not prepared at all
*  in the sense, you know, I wrote the book Deadliest Enemies that was published in 2017.
*  Thank you. Thank you. Go get it. No. And panic. You know, chapter 13, the title of the chapter was
*  SARS and MERS, a harbinger of things to come. You know, we've predicted this. And then I wrote a
*  chapter on there, what a flu pandemic would look like if it emerged in China. And if you read it,
*  it's exactly what's happened. The supply chains went down, China locked down the country, it
*  spread to other countries, people all pointed fingers. And, you know, it's the kind of thing
*  where we hear it and hear it, but we don't get prepared. You know, five years ago, I gave a talk
*  at the Mayo Clinic. First time I talked about this, I've talked many times afterwards. And I
*  showed a slide of Puerto Rico, a picture of Puerto Rico. And then I showed the map. And then I showed
*  a picture of a building in Puerto Rico, a nondescript building. And I said, this is our next big
*  disaster. Turns out that 85% of all the world's production of IV bags was saline that we need
*  desperately were made in these plants in Puerto Rico. And all we needed was one category five
*  hurricane to come through and take it out. Maria came through a year and a half ago, and the world
*  went into a major crisis with shortage of IV bags. Now, that was so obvious that was going to happen.
*  And yet we don't prepare. That's so foolish. I know, I agree. And that's what hopefully this is
*  a wake up call, the business community, I hopefully will wake up. You know, one of the other things
*  we're doing right now, Joe, this is really one of the things that has me most concerned about this
*  whole situation is our group has been studying for the last year and a half with support from
*  the Walton Family Foundation looking at critical drug shortages. It turns out that we identified
*  153 drugs in this country that people need right now or they die. I mean, it's on the crash card.
*  It's acute critical drugs. 100% of them are generic. All of them basically are made offshore
*  in the United States. And a large part of them are made in China and India. And at this point,
*  we have shortages anyway every day, just before this crisis happened. Now these supply chains
*  have gone down. Our group is actively helping the United States government try to figure out,
*  you know, where they're going to get these drugs. Now, just think of this. If I came to you and said
*  the Defense Department was going to outsource all its munitions production to China, you'd look at
*  me and say, come on. You know what? The U.S. Defense Department has no more access to these
*  drugs than anybody else. They are beholden to China for these drugs. 690,000 Americans have
*  end-stage renal disease right now. Most of their primary drugs are coming from China.
*  And now with the shutdown and what's happening with this, and this is what I talked about in
*  the book, why I was so concerned, because we are at risk. So even the situations unfold,
*  it's not just about what the virus does to you. It's about what the entire system is rigged up
*  to be and what this virus does once it gets into it. Jesus, you're making me nervous.
*  Well, but that's before we get done here. We're going to talk about what we can do to get people
*  not nervous because this is too late. No, no, no. What I mean is we're going to bring you around to
*  take, you know, it's my job is not to scare you out of your wits, scary into your wits.
*  Let me ask you something about sauna use. One of the things that I read was that if you are
*  in contact that 20 minutes in a sauna, in a really hot sauna is very good for killing some of the
*  virus. Is that bullshit? Yes. Jesus Christ, these people. Yeah, there was some sauna facts
*  thing that was being pushed around that it's great for flu and all sorts of infectious diseases.
*  Actually, it's great for you. I mean, it makes you feel good, but we don't have any evidence
*  that makes any difference in infectious disease. Why is it so it doesn't have any impact at all?
*  The idea was that the breathing in of the very hot air, 180 degree air for 20 minutes
*  will kill some of the virus. See, if that temperature of 180 degree air got really into
*  your lungs, your lungs would be fried. You'd be dead. So what happens is just from the time
*  you breathe it in and what you mix it with the air there, it's kind of like taking a cup of hot
*  water and putting it into a bathtub of cold water. And so what happens by the time you get done,
*  it's not that hot. And so in this case, your lungs couldn't stand even 110 to 20 degree heat
*  without causing severe damage. And so it doesn't kill the virus at all.
*  So it would the virus would have to be like just in your mouth or something like that.
*  Even then, no, no, no. Jesus, Michael.
*  That's unfortunate. Because that was that was exciting. I was reading that I was like,
*  don't stop using the sauna. It's a good thing for your skin and everything else. But yeah,
*  but it's not going to help you with this one. So how does it cool the air down? What's what's
*  happening in terms of your lungs? Yeah, well, you basically it's a mixture of you know,
*  when you breathe out, you don't breathe all the air out. Okay, I mean, you're you've that would
*  you'd almost be dead. You couldn't do the tidal volume. So what happens is every breath.
*  In other words, you have so much air in your lungs already. When you breathe out, you breathe
*  just a little bit of it out. And each time you bring more in out in and out. And so when this
*  mixes in the hot air like that, or the very cold air, you know, Minnesota, when you're 45 below zero,
*  we have the same problem. We don't freeze our lungs. Okay. You know, when we breathe in may
*  feel cold. And so it's just there's so much in there that it mixes with the other air. And it
*  ultimately doesn't the temperature your lungs don't change. Even if you're doing like some crazy
*  deep breathing exercises, we slowly exhale all the air out, there's nothing left and then breathe it
*  all the way in. I might I've given you my best shot at it. It's not gonna make much difference.
*  Sorry. I've always wondered that about like people that are in like Alberta, it's like 50 degrees
*  below zero. Like how do they do that? Yeah, well, we do it all the time. Well, we don't anymore in
*  Minnesota. It's getting warmer there every winter. But yeah, problem. Yeah, we we we surely know what
*  cold air is like. Well, so much for that myth. Myth number two. Well, I don't say myth, I should
*  say rumor was that this was something from some sort of a biological weapons thing that was leaked.
*  Right, because Wuhan is some area, a part of China that they actually do work on biological weapons.
*  And we've heard that loud and clear. And let me just give a little bit background and more to my
*  career. Back in the early 1990s, I got very involved in the whole area of biodefense and
*  bioterrorism, by warfare. It turned out I was involved with helping to interview and get
*  information from some of the Russian bio weaponers after the wall fell and Russia collapsed. We had
*  all these experts coming out who'd been spending their whole lives making bio weapons. And it became
*  very clear to me, this is really a serious challenge. And as part of my work, I spent a
*  lot of time in this area. And I actually, through a series of serendipitous events became a personal
*  advisor to His Majesty King Hussein of Jordan before he died on this topic. I got really into it.
*  I wrote a book that was published in 9-11 of 2000 called Living Terror is What Our Country Needs to
*  Notice Five, the Coming Bio-Terrorist Catastrophe. And I think I bought eight of the 12 copies that
*  were sold that year afterwards. And then when 9-11 happened, of course, then it became really
*  prominent. And then I went on to serve on a group here in the United States that was basically the
*  National Science Advisory Board of Biosecurity Safety Issues. So I've had a lot of experience
*  in this area. And so I bring that to the table and I tell you, there is no evidence whatsoever
*  that this is a bioweapon or that it was accidentally released from the Wuhan lab.
*  Today, with the genetics we have on these viruses and how we can do testing, we can almost date them
*  almost like carbon testing. So radiocarbon, you want to know how old a block is or something like
*  that. This thing clearly jumped from an animal species probably the third week of November to
*  humans. And pangolins, these scaly, anteater-like animals are a very good source because we have
*  coronaviruses just like those in these animals. And it got into a human. So, you know, we've
*  surely had a lot of challenges with that, but I don't believe that there's any evidence linking
*  this to one, an intentional release or an accidental release or that it's an engineered
*  bug. It's not. My friend Duncan and I did a show back in 2012-ish, somewhere around there with
*  Sci-Fi where we went to the CDC in Galveston and we talked to them about that very thing. And they
*  said the real concern, the real concern is just actual diseases. It's not man-made diseases.
*  It's just naturally occurring diseases. That's exactly it. I mean, look, you know,
*  we could not have crafted a virus like this to do what it's doing. I mean, we don't have the creative
*  imagination or the skill set. If somebody said, okay, I want to find a virus that will take out
*  a lot of people, okay, this one, Mother Nature does it so much better than we could ever do it.
*  And, you know, whether it was Ebola, whether it's this one or it's antibiotic resistance, any of
*  these things. I mean, you know, you and I were talking earlier about the potential for chronic
*  wasting disease to be a problem for humans. You know, Mother Nature is doing it pretty well on
*  her own. The chronic wasting one really scares me because there's so many people that have a
*  vested interest in dismissing it. I had our good friend Doug Durin on the podcast with, I don't
*  remember the gentleman that he brought with him. Brian Richards. Thank you. Brian Richards who
*  explained the science behind it. And there are so many people that are dismissing this because either
*  they enjoy deer hunting or they want captive servants to be something that are still something
*  that you could be released on private property because people grow and breed deer and then sell
*  them to ranchers who want deer in their properties, particularly large deer. And I mean, guys that I
*  have talked to that are dismissing it, I can see the chain of events that they want it to be not
*  a concern. But if you see what it's doing to deer, it's terrifying. It's 100% fatal. The DNA exists
*  on plants for years. They leak it out of their saliva. They leave traces of it everywhere. And
*  in Doug's area, there's some near somewhere near there. There's like 50% infection rates.
*  Right. Listen, I think this is really a significant challenge. I was involved back in the 1990s.
*  And into the 1980s when Mad Cow first emerged in England. And at the time, was asked to give
*  an assessment when this was all this bovine spongiform cephalopathy and other pre-ons.
*  These pre-ons are what causes disease. And you know, people want to dismiss it that people
*  weren't going to get sick. Well, then we realized 10 years later, all these human cases started to
*  show up that were from those exposures 10 years before. And it took a while before those pre-ons
*  obviously changed in the cattle to get to the point where they'd infect humans. Well, the same
*  thing is happening with deer. If you look back on the deer population that were infected 30 years ago
*  and you look at it today, the pre-ons are constantly changing. They're mutating. They're
*  new strains. And they're getting more human-like all the time. And one of the things our center is
*  doing is working on that very issue of trying to help people understand that the studies were done
*  15 or 20 years ago looking at how infectious these might be for humans were really well done.
*  They were good, but they had different strains. And over time, these strains are looking to be
*  more and more like they could infect humans, or they could even infect cattle, which would be
*  another huge challenge if that happened. And so I think your point's a really good one. And we know
*  today that there are probably at least 17,000 deer that were consumed in the past year that were
*  actually positive for this prion and people want to head and aid them anyway. So I worry about that
*  That's terrifying. So these people have these pre-ons in their system now, but then currently
*  they're not making the jump to cause, what is it, Jakobs-Kruetzfeld disease?
*  Yeah, it's kind of a... We don't know that humans are getting infected. One of the challenges,
*  we don't have a test unless you die. And then that's a heck of a way to have to get a test.
*  So one of the challenges is you don't know this until you actually show up with the signs and
*  symptoms. And so one of the things that we're looking at carefully is doing surveillance or
*  disease detection among people that might present with this. If it's going to happen,
*  I suspect the naturally occurring prion-related diseases, like the Jakobs disease you just
*  mentioned, occurs typically in older people over 70. If you suddenly start seeing a 40-year-old or
*  a 50-year-old or 60-year-olds even with this disease, then you got to start thinking what
*  else is going on. And so that'll help us detect it in cases. But then we've already failed. Then
*  we've had 10 years worth of transmission or more potentially before we get the first human cases
*  like we did with Mad Cow. And so our message has been right now, hunting is really important.
*  It is a very important part of our society. Frankly, it's the way we manage deer herds,
*  thank God. It's a huge economic boon for running the kinds of DNRs, etc. We have... We balance the
*  back, as you know, from sportsmen on these licenses. And so we don't want to stop hunting.
*  But we've got to make sure that we make sure that people aren't getting infected. And one of the
*  things that our group at the University of Minnesota is working on is tests now that are
*  almost like point of detection tests. So if you shoot an animal, could you know very quickly
*  that it's positive or not? And then you'd know not to process that animal or eat it.
*  And that's what we need to get at. Well, not only that, the prions, what's terrifying is
*  that how invulnerable they are, how ridiculously vigorous they are when you can boil them.
*  A thousand degree temperature for hours and hours and they're fine. That's right. When they're
*  when they're sanitizing medical equipment that they've used on mad cow patients, or whether it's
*  cows or humans with these prions, they've been able to do it three times. So try to sterilize
*  these things like the sterilization process you wear the wood. What is the temperature that they
*  do it for? Well, they do it both time temperature and pressure, but it's in the hundreds and degrees
*  and it's under high pressure. And I've actually been involved with several cases where these very
*  equipment you're talking about were accidentally used on somebody who had Croisott-Yacob disease.
*  They had to landfill it. They couldn't even sterilize it. Yeah, that's what's insane.
*  Like you can't kill these things. It's pretty hard. That's why, you know, we want to make sure
*  that if you're eating deer cervids right now that we have to make sure they're tested. And I think
*  the other point you raised is a good one. We've been very concerned about the movement of this
*  disease by cervid farming. We've had far too many examples and Doug has shared that with you, you
*  know, just the extent to which we see, you know, state by state by state slowly getting, you know,
*  picked off because somebody moved a trophy deer from state A to state B and it was infected and
*  it got out or others got out of the pens and then it affects locals. Yeah. Now has that made the jump
*  to bison or elk or any of those other animals yet? Not yet. It's several kinds of deer, you know,
*  but not those. New deer so far. There has been some cases in the West. It's primarily
*  white tails, right? Exactly. Yeah. And then there's been a deer in Korea, the type of deer there and
*  one in the Scandinavian countries. One? Yeah. I mean, I mean, different kinds of deer types that
*  are there. Yeah. Yeah. So the one we worry about right now is getting into the caribou in northern
*  Canada. Right now, the range of the deer that are infected in the provinces of Canada is right
*  bodied up next to caribou. And of course, if you're not a hunter, you wouldn't know this,
*  but caribou, obviously the herds are remarkable, unlike, you know, white tails, which that matter
*  elk. If you got it into caribou, it would likely spread very quickly. And as you know, the native
*  populations, caribou are key. They're key to their livelihood. Yeah. So you wouldn't want to see it
*  get into caribou. Now, I didn't even know that it was in Canada. What parts of Canada has it been?
*  Throughout a number of provinces. I think there's four provinces now it's in. It's in its skin is
*  spreading. It's the same phenomena that a combination of deer movement with servant farming.
*  And then once it's in an area, it'll keep migrating a bit and a bit as these animals move somewhere.
*  But, you know, as we know, deer don't fly for 1000 miles every season. Okay, so it's not that kind
*  of movement. If humans, if we're going to see a big movement, it's humans are doing it.
*  As our good friend, Doug Durin has been doing all this work to try to alert people about it. And also
*  they're putting up these testing places where hunters can bring in a deer and have the deer
*  tested. How much of that is available to people around the country though? Not nearly enough.
*  And that's what we need to work on is if you don't make it easy and convenient, as you know,
*  it's not going to get done. And so, you know, it's hard enough to convince people that there's really
*  a problem, because people don't want to believe it, even if they know that there's, you know,
*  CWD in deer in the area, and we have some like that. But I think the tide is changing more and
*  more people are sensitive to it. They want to have access to testing quickly. But if it's going
*  to take you a month and a half to get the test back, you know what it is about processing. Is it
*  that long? Well, in some cases, they get so busy because, you know, unlike laboratory testing for
*  an entire year, where I do one 12th in January, one 12th in February, etc, etc. You know, deer season
*  typically is very concentrated in just a couple of weeks to a month in the fall. And so the problem
*  is all the animals come in at that time, so your lab capacity has to handle that huge surge all at
*  one time. And so some days it takes a while to get it back. So these hunters just hope they don't
*  take a bite during that time. Yeah, and we hope that these prions don't ultimately infect people
*  and jump. And what if they do, you know, I worry what will happen to deer hunting as we know it,
*  because probably a lot of people will, you know, not continue. And we need that desperately for herd
*  management. I mean, it's the way we do it. Well, what they're doing in Doug's area is they're
*  actively trying to eliminate a lot of deer and try to lower drastically lower the numbers,
*  particularly of bucks, which I guess they wander more. Yep, they do. Yeah. Yeah. It's all really
*  scary stuff. Because if they do make the jump to humans, I mean, it has made the jump to I believe
*  mice. Is that the case? Well, what happened was originally it didn't. And so that was some of the
*  data that was used to support. It's not a problem. Right now. These what we call humanized mice or
*  basically much more like a human. We're now seeing that jump occurring and these new strains. See,
*  the strains that again were around 20 years ago, not the same ones today, because as these
*  prions continue to pass from animal to animal to animal, they go through these little minor
*  mutations and they're getting more and more and more like what a human transmissible prion might
*  look like. So in these mice studies now that are really made to mimic a human, we're starting to
*  see that jump. Yeah. And folks, if you've never seen a deer with CWD, you should go and Google
*  it because it's terrifying the idea that that could make that jump to human beings and people
*  pouring saliva out of their mouths and their whole body just wasted away to skin and bones.
*  Right. That's what we're looking at. I mean, that's why it's called chronic wasting disease
*  because the animals literally waste away. We actually have a major resource center on our
*  website, free of charge, open, and it's all in chronic waste and disease. So people want to go
*  there. It's www.cidrap.umn.edu and you can go there and all these pictures, all the kinds of
*  that. Can you repeat that again? What is it again? www.cidrap.umn.edu. www.cidrap.umn.edu.
*  Just Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, cidrap.umn.edu.
*  .umn.edu. And we have a lot of information. There it is. There it is. That's it. You got it
*  right there. That's it. Yep. And we've got a lot of information on there also about coronaviruses.
*  We have a whole resource center just for the coronaviruses too. Novel coronavirus. There you go.
*  So for the average person that is sitting around reading these articles that say don't worry or
*  reading these articles that say this is the end of humanity, what could these people do? Like what
*  could they do and what do they do if they get infected? Well, first of all, neither of those
*  kind of articles are correct and we have to make sure that we get that message out to people that
*  it's there. We need straight talk right now. You know, and part of it is it's so hard to hear from
*  people as well as experts what's going to happen or not happen. You know, and let me just give you
*  an example because we've heard a lot about, well, it's going to go away with the coronavirus with
*  the seasons. Okay, when it warms up, it'll go away. Well, you know, the other coronaviruses that we
*  have that we've had to worry about was SARS, which appeared in 2003 in China. And when that
*  came out of China in February 2003, it took us a little while to figure out that these people
*  really aren't that infectious till day five or six of their illness. And then they really crash and
*  burn and many of them would die. But what we did was basically by knowing that identify these cases
*  in their context quickly. And so if they had symptoms, brought them in, put them in these
*  isolation rooms, they wouldn't infect anybody else. And it took until June to bring that under
*  control. That had nothing to do with the seasons. MERS, which is another coronavirus that's in the
*  Middle East, it's in the Arabian Peninsula. The natural reservoir for that is camels. In China,
*  by the way, SARS, it was palm sieverts and we a type of animal food that we got out of the markets
*  there. In the Arabian Peninsula, we're not going to euthanize 1.7 camels, you know, try to get rid
*  of 1.7 camels, you know, to go to MERS. And there it's 110 degrees out and this virus is transmitted.
*  Fine, thank you. I mean, it goes from animals to people, it goes in the hospitals. There's no
*  evidence that seasonal there. So that's a good myth to expose right away. This is not something
*  that's going to cure up when it gets warm. You know, if it does, it won't be because there's a
*  model for it. What will it be? Because how does a how does something like SARS run through a
*  population and stop being around anymore? Well, it wouldn't have. But had we had good public health,
*  had we had, you know, the same kind of transmission we're seeing with this coronavirus
*  where you're infectious before you ever get sick, where you're highly infectious. Remember with SARS
*  now, you didn't really get infectious till you're in six or, you know, six days of illness and you
*  knew that you were in trouble and then you could isolate you. And we didn't understand that at first
*  and we transmitted virus transmitted. So that's why SARS stopped. MERS stops because we don't get
*  rid of the camels. So it keeps hitting humans day after day. But then when they go to the hospital,
*  we no longer allow those individuals to transmit to others in the hospital because we do what we
*  call good infection control. Soon as they get there, they're in special rooms with special masks and
*  all this kind of thing. And so in that regard, these coronavirus can be stopped. This one's not,
*  as I said, at the top of the program, this is like trying to stop the wind. Influenza transmission,
*  you never hear anybody saying in a bad seasonal flu year, you know, we're going to stop this one.
*  If you don't have a vaccine that works, you don't. It's just breathing. That's all it is.
*  So what's best case scenario here? Well, I think as I laid out to you before,
*  you know, this could be 10 times worse than a really bad seasonal flu year. And I'll grant you,
*  it will hit, you know, primarily the older population and those underlying health problems.
*  But as I mentioned also, you know, we have a lot of people who have other risk factors,
*  obesity, high blood pressure, another risk factor where you can have a really bad outcome with this.
*  And so we don't quite know what it's going to do yet. I think, you know, we've been right on the
*  mark predicting where it's going to be to this day. I think from here on out, I can tell you it's
*  going to stay around for months. It's not going to go away tomorrow. We got to stop thinking about
*  if we just get through tomorrow, that's it. So if we're going to go to schools, we're going to
*  tell people not to go into public, we're going to cancel big events. How long are we prepared to do
*  that? What are we going to do? We have to ask ourselves that. I think the big thing is eventually
*  enough people get infected where it'll be like putting reactors in the rods, you know, rods in
*  the reaction, I should say, and then that stops it by itself. But so because if you're if two of the
*  three of us in this room are immune right now to it because we've had it and recovered and had
*  protection because of natural protection, then I couldn't transmit to anybody. So that's what's
*  going to happen if you get enough people get infected. Ultimately, then it'll slow down,
*  stop transmission that way. But that's a heck of a price to pay to get there. Is it safe to say
*  that we're fairly fortunate that this isn't something like the Spanish flu or something
*  that's really ruthlessly deadly? Well, that's where I think we have to be really careful.
*  Just to back up about point one percent of people who get seasonal flu die and grants
*  just mostly older or younger people. OK, that's one out of a thousand with this one right now.
*  In China, we're seeing between two and three percent of the people die. And some say, well,
*  that's way too high. It's not going to be that high. It's going to be lower. But again,
*  and they say that because we didn't pick up all the milder illnesses. OK. But on the other hand,
*  we have a lot of additional people in countries like ours that have even more risk factors for
*  having bad outcomes in China. And so Spanish flu, the one you mentioned in 1918, that was about a
*  three to three point two percent case fatality rate. Now, it did preferentially impact 18 to
*  25 year olds. They were the hardest hit group. And why was that? Well, you know, it has to do
*  with your immune response. Again, we think that what happened is when this virus got into you,
*  it created what we call a cytokine storm, which is an antibody response in your body that's out of
*  control. And it basically you destroy yourself and it sets this thing up to trigger it off.
*  So the healthier people had the more adverse reaction to it. Exactly. Or the other group that
*  has had a real challenge with that are pregnant women. And pregnant women have a very unique issue.
*  One is, of course, they have some constriction of their lungs just by the very physical mass.
*  But also their immune system is really at a heightened state at that point. There's a part
*  of that immune system. That woman says, this is not all me. Get rid of this. It's like a rejection
*  of a graft. And the other part saying this is the most precious cargo I'll ever carry. You know,
*  I got to make sure I don't lose it. And when that virus got in between those two, it started again
*  that same kind of cytokine storm. Now the thing that concerns us about this, what we saw in
*  1918, I mentioned just 3 plus percent. This one could be as high as 2 percent. So it's somewhere
*  between a really bad flu year at 0.1 percent. And it could be as high up here, you know,
*  getting closer to 1918 like. And that's the numbers I just gave you a few minutes ago from the
*  American Hospital Association of 480,000 deaths here in this country over the next 6 to 12 months.
*  Pete Slauson What can someone do to shore up their immune system while this is all going on?
*  Dr. John B. Rees Well, a couple things. First of all, just being as healthy as you can be.
*  You know, wait, wait. You know, I'm getting up there right now where, you know, it becomes
*  more and more of a challenge to stay in good shape. You know, the more you can do to do that,
*  something you know all about, you know, is keeping in shape is really important.
*  Second thing is if you're on medications, like for high blood pressure, don't miss them. Take
*  those drugs because they're really important even though they may not appear, you know, you don't
*  have any symptoms of high blood pressure or something like that. And then I think just,
*  you know, getting sleep and eating a healthy diet. And that's about what we can do today to help get
*  you prepared for this. Pete Slauson
*  Is there anything else someone could do, like maybe IV vitamin drips or anything that's going
*  to really boost your system? Dr. John B. Rees
*  No, you know, when you look at all the things that might be there, and I'm happy and willing
*  to accept any and all that might help, but we don't really have any data that those substantially
*  impact on your immune system to make it that much better. Pete Slauson
*  Is that the case because not that many people do it though?
*  Dr. John B. Rees No, actually there's been study. Yeah, it's been studied. It's been studied.
*  I mean, a good example is, you know, and I was one of those people that thought, boy, this is a great
*  thing, probiotics, you know, things. Turns out that we've studied this with regard to antibiotic
*  resistance and does it help your gut, etc. And it turns out that the probiotic users were no
*  difference than the non-probiotic users. Pete Slauson
*  In terms of recovery from antibiotics? Dr. John B. Rees
*  No, and the issue of if you're going to kind of compete out the bad bugs, so by getting a good,
*  healthy gut flora, the bugs here, you would actually reduce the chance of picking up a bad
*  bug. And it turned out there was no difference. The people-
*  Pete Slauson But how would they do a study like that? The
*  only way I think they would do a study like that accurately is infect someone that is the same
*  person, like have the same person with no probiotics and then have them with probiotics.
*  Dr. John B. Rees And the studies that have been done are
*  very close to that. But what they did is they used two different groups of people. Those people used
*  probiotics, this group did not. And then they looked at all their illnesses and they got stool
*  samples on everybody. Pete Slauson
*  How large is the group? Dr. John B. Rees
*  I don't have the numbers in front of me. They're pretty sizable because I was disappointed. I mean,
*  I was thinking so myself. Yeah. So I mean, I think though, but I think the key message here is that,
*  you know, we're going to get through this, but right now we do have some real challenges before
*  us. What we can't tell people is it's all safe. You know, every time I hear people say the risk
*  is low right now, it reminds me of what would happen if there was this huge low pressure system,
*  you know, five days off the coast, the Gulf, and there was 90 degree water between that system and
*  the beach and there was no wind shears in the Northern Hemisphere that's likely going to knock
*  it off. But we tell the people standing on the beach that day, we have low risk of anything.
*  But we know five days from now it's coming. And so what we need to do is help this American
*  population or the world for that matter understand we're going to be in some hurt for the next few
*  months and we have got to get better prepared. How are we going to, how are we going to work?
*  Where are we going to work? We can't stop working. We need, we need our lights on. We need health.
*  We need food. So a bunch of things people should do that's going to boost their immune system that
*  we know of, right? Like get sleep, drastically lower your alcohol intake, drink a lot of water,
*  take vitamins, those kinds of things, things that are going to keep your body healthy.
*  Yep, that's you nailed. So in that sense, sauna will help you a little bit because it does,
*  what relaxes you? Relaxes you, it also boosts up your heat shock proteins.
*  And now if you're in Minnesota, we'd say there's a two part requirement that you got to go from
*  the sauna to the ice water back to the sauna. You had to do both. Yeah, people love that, right?
*  We do it all the time. Well, the Russians invented that, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Does that,
*  have you ever done that? I have. My son has a, and daughter have a beautiful lake place up in
*  Northern Wisconsin. They got a sauna like literally 12 feet from the lake and there's a spring right
*  there. So in the winter time, the lake actually stays open. So we go right from the sauna and the
*  hot tub right to the water and back. Oh wow. Even when it's frozen? Oh yeah. It's well, because
*  it's not frozen right there where the spring is. So you literally can go right into it. So,
*  and then you run right back into the hot tub. That's when you sleep well. When you've done a
*  couple of those rounds, you sleep really well. Yeah. Yeah. I would imagine your body's freaking
*  out. Yeah. I love the sauna, but I haven't had any opportunity to jump into a lake right afterwards.
*  Okay. Well, we'll have to, no, just not any like you had to have an ice covered. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Then you really get, then you get it. Yeah. That's the real feeling. Yeah. Well, what else can people
*  do in terms of all this hand sanitizer, jazz and masks? Is that all? Yeah. The hand sanitizers
*  actually are a great thing for stopping a lot of infectious diseases. They actually are really
*  good. They're good for your hands, you know, in terms of the skin, they kill the bad bugs, but
*  the whole issue of using your hands touching your face that people all concentrate on. Yes. The data
*  is actually very weak that this kind of virus is going to be transmitted that way. So I wouldn't
*  tell you to stop using hand sanitizers, but don't think it's going to have a big impact on this bug.
*  Do you see that viral video that's going around that woman who was giving the address at the
*  behest of the White House and she tells people not to touch their face and then immediately licks
*  her finger and turns the page? Yeah, I saw that. I saw that. Well, why is she telling people not to
*  touch their faces? Cause you know, well, the thought was is that there are receptors around your eye
*  right here that actually for this virus could get in and then get into your body. And you know,
*  the data we have on this is so sparse to say that that's the case. I think the primary thing about
*  hand washing is legitimate, but one of the things people want to do something, they want to be able
*  to think they're doing something. And so we tell them, wash your hands often and to present this,
*  prevent this disease. And I feel like we're not being really honest with the people that the data
*  and we've looked at this very carefully really is about just breathing air. And that's a hard thing
*  to stop. So keep doing the hand washing, but don't think that that's going to stop this disease.
*  But you asked about the mask. It's going to stop other stuff. Yes. The masks. There's two kinds.
*  Basically the surgical mask, which just fits over. And the reason it's called a surgical mask is
*  because it's loose fitting just fits, you know, a tie ties behind you. It was worn by surgeons so
*  that they don't cough or drip into your wound. And it was never made to protect you from bugs coming
*  in. So those little spaces on the sides, that's not a problem if I'm breathing into the cloth right in
*  front of my nose, but in terms of the air coming in on the side, they're not, they're not effective
*  at all. So people wear them. They look like they're doing something. They're not. Now, if you are sick,
*  they may help a little bit from you transmitting because if you cough, then you cough right into
*  that cloth and it'll, some of it will embed in there and not get out around. The other one though
*  is called an N95 respirator, but for all intents and purposes, it looks like a mask. It's just tight
*  face fitting. It has a seal, you know, at the nose, et cetera. That's an apocalypse mask.
*  It could be. I don't know what those are, but that could be. Okay. I'm just saying that that's how
*  I look at it. Okay. Okay. Well, they're actually, we use them all the time in healthcare all the time
*  and they use them in actually about 90% of them are using industry. So when they're grinding things
*  or asbestos, et cetera, you know, they don't breathe in all these parts. So if we have one of those that'll
*  do something, they're very effective. They're very effective. The problem is we have a big shortage.
*  You know, right now we have hospitals that are down to just a couple of days worth of these masks,
*  those respirators, and it's because we don't stockpile anything in this country. You know,
*  hospitals don't have the money to do that. Those preppers right now are so excited.
*  All the preppers across the country. I knew it. I knew the day would come. Yeah, well, they are.
*  They are. And peaches and... Well, you know, but this is really important because how healthcare
*  workers go is how the country, I think, will see where we're going. You know, there've been over
*  4,000 healthcare workers in China who are infected, many of them on their job, and a number of them
*  died. And if in this country we have a real challenge delivering healthcare because we're
*  overwhelmed and then we have healthcare workers picking up the infection, like we talked about
*  the group in Milan, and we don't have the protection for them, I really believe that's when the public
*  will say, wait a minute, what's going on here? And that's where I think the challenge... So we
*  really have to protect our healthcare workers. They are the frontline people. And the biggest
*  problem we have is a lot of these cases need intensive care medicine, which we only have a
*  limited number of beds for. But this is really sophisticated medicine. So when one of those
*  people get infected, a doctor or a nurse working in intensive care, it's not like you just took out
*  another soldier. You took out a special forces person. You just can't bring somebody in from
*  family practice or wherever and put them in there. And so we've got to protect these workers. And I'm
*  really concerned that that's one of the areas we've not done. Nobody stockpiles. We have no,
*  capacity to make lots of them all of a sudden. Prior to this event, the hospital purchasing
*  agent would go online, click a button, send me 5,000 of these, and it would be there the next
*  morning. Has anyone contacted you before this or since in particular and asked for your advice
*  as to how they can better prepare? Like in terms of like the president? The president hasn't,
*  but I know a number of the people who are working in the White House. And they've contacted you? Oh
*  yeah. Well, you know, I've served roles in the last five presidential administrations. I worked
*  for two Republican governors, two Democratic governors, as you appreciate one independent
*  Rassler. I worked for two when he was governor, Jesse. Oh, and that's right. Yeah. And so, you
*  know, I've never had a partisan, you know, I'm just a private in the public health army. And so I
*  actually served as a science envoy for this administration in the state department last year,
*  you know, and still in my full-time job at the university. And so I've never been, I mean,
*  I'm there to give the best advice I can. And so I've talked to a lot of these people there at the
*  CDC, at Health and Human Services, etc. So yeah, we've given a lot of advice. And do you think
*  there's anything that you could do now that could help them make sure that we don't have these
*  shortages of masks and shortages of medicine and IV bags and something that could be done to,
*  I mean, you obviously you've laid out all these problems and you laid it out in your book here
*  that people can buy right now. Go pick it up on Amazon, right? Is there an audio version of it
*  as well? There is. All right. Do you read it? The book? Yes. Yeah. You know, you know, I have.
*  I don't know. I don't read it myself. No, there's actually a really good voice. It's not mine.
*  Well, it should be you, man. That drives me crazy. Someone else does it. Yeah. No, you know,
*  this is the challenge we have is today in this environment, everything's just in time delivery.
*  I mean, look at when you mean you go online and you whatever place you're adding from Amazon
*  wherever you expect it there the next day. Yeah, people forget that we don't have that capacity
*  today to suddenly make lots of things. So right now, all the mass manufacturers in North America
*  are working 110 percent time. But if they were trying to fill all the orders they've gotten just
*  in the last few weeks would take him years and years with the capacity they have. And you can't
*  go build these new machines to make mask overnight. So this is something that should be set in advance
*  of anything like this. Any pandemic happening like long in advance, we should be prepared.
*  You know, think about the issue with defense. You know, we prepare all the time well in advance.
*  We don't build an aircraft carrier at the moment. We think we're going to go to battle.
*  We look at what all do we need. We don't do that in public health. We've tried. And so,
*  you know, it's stockpiling 500 million of these in ninety fives would have been the difference
*  between night and day. And when you look at the price of one of those versus one airplane,
*  not even close. If you look at the things like that, it's like these medications. I don't think
*  about our own defense department. Employees are at risk of running out of these critical drugs
*  because they get them from China. I mean, what a vulnerability. Yeah. So what we need to do is take
*  a step back after when we can start now, but we're not going to fix it now is to say, what are the
*  key things that we should do? Vaccines. You know, if we had been serious about this, we might very
*  well have had a coronavirus vaccine that whether it works specifically for this strain, whether it
*  worked for SARS, but right after SARS happened in 2003, everybody was hot on a new vaccine.
*  And then when it went away, the interest weighed. Is it something like the flu where, you know,
*  sometimes when they come up with a flu vaccine, it doesn't necessarily address the current strain?
*  Yeah, it could be. And that's where a coronavirus family vaccine may not match up right here now,
*  but it could. And the flu, and you've really hit an important point. There's one where, you know,
*  we do have an imperfect vaccine, but it still does a lot of good. You know, 50 percent of the
*  people are protected. That's a heck of a lot better than zero. If we had a vaccine right now
*  that 50 percent of the people could be protected against this virus, man, think of all the lives
*  we'd save. So the bottom line message is we can't wait until the crisis to fix these things. You
*  know what? We spend about point zero zero zero one percent in public health compared to our
*  defense department. And yet look how vulnerable the is the bugs. It's not a war. Yeah, it's not
*  a missile. It's bringing down the world economy right now. It's a darn virus. And so this is where
*  I think that's what I tried to say in my book was all about that. I went into what we needed to do.
*  In fact, I hate it when people come up and say we're screwed. You know, my whole bottom line is,
*  what are you going to do about it then? And that's what I laid out a whole plan in here,
*  like these vaccines, like the stockpiles of mass. You know, we should have a plan in place already.
*  What are we going to do with our schools when they close? Are we going to really close schools?
*  Let's not try to make this on the fly. You know, I just mentioned if we close schools,
*  we are going to really hurt some people and people may die in health care facilities,
*  hospitals because we don't have enough nurses or health care workers. Why have to make that
*  decision all of a sudden? We could have planned for that a long time ago. And so I think hopefully
*  this is a wake up call because, you know, nobody I think really believe this. I got to tell you,
*  you know, the market today, as you know, on this particular day crashed badly. And, you know,
*  I think that up till 10 days ago, the market didn't even think this was a possibility. They
*  just, if you look at it, it was flying high. On Friday, I did a briefing for over 400 major
*  financial investors around the world. And, you know, I, you know, how I'm talking to you right
*  now, you know, I'm not trying to be scary. I'm just trying to tell the facts and make sure people
*  understand it. The questions I got from these people almost remind me of a six year old who
*  was afraid to have to go through it on a dark, dark hallway. You know, and, and, and I thought,
*  I actually said to friends and colleagues Friday night, I said, you know what? Monday's market's
*  not going to look good because I could hear the fear in these people. Okay. Well, we shouldn't be
*  there. We should be, what are we going to do? We have a problem, you know, it's like a forest fire,
*  whatever. We got a problem. What are we going to do about it financially? How are we going to get
*  through this? You know, where are we going to go with it? No plans again. It's caught everybody by
*  surprise. I mean, you were the one of the few people that wanted to deal with this issue. You know,
*  we set this up several weeks ago. You guys saw it coming, you know, and, and I think that's where
*  the country hasn't seen it. Now they're getting it. Well, I'm paranoid. Well, I seek the advice
*  of experts whenever possible. And what, what I was seeing was that there was a lot of weird
*  misinformation and conflicting information. A lot of people saying, don't worry. And a lot of people
*  that were terrified. I'm like, okay, I got to talk to an expert. And luckily you were willing
*  to sit down with us and, and, and help us out. Well, and you know, and the other thing I think
*  that, you know, I, maybe it's a function of age, but you know, straight talk is so important.
*  And I, you know, I, I'm so tired of having people say to me, oh, if you tell them this stuff, they're
*  going to panic. And I say, well, what's panic? Have you seen anybody riding in the streets yet?
*  Have you seen cars turned over smash? Have you seen people hurting themselves over this issue?
*  They're concerned, but they want legitimate information. And so what you need to do is just
*  tell them the truth. And we have many experiences like that. A few years ago, when I was at the
*  state health department in Minnesota, we had a big outbreak of meningitis, a type of brain infection,
*  bacterial brain infection. And a number of high school students were very sick. All of a sudden
*  in one day they were in a hospital and this community of a 20,000 people were on edge. And
*  so we had a big town meeting. Several thousand people showed up and I addressed them and gave
*  them everything I knew about meningitis, what we're going to do about it, et cetera. And then
*  towards the end of the talk, I said, and I just need to let you know about one out of every seven
*  cases of this dies. And people look at me and say, why did you tell them that? And I said,
*  because they needed to know it. Two days later, one of them died. And you know what? Everybody in
*  town was terribly sad, very emotional, but they all said, we knew it. We knew it. You told us.
*  And then they got on with dealing with it. We vaccinated the whole town, 20,000 people. We
*  vaccinated one weekend for this bacterial meningitis, but it was because they had faith in us because we
*  told them the truth. And we said what we know and what we didn't know. And so that's what we need to
*  do here. We need to just have straight talk. Don't tell them it's low risk. That's like the hurricane.
*  Okay. You know, I would be really bad at you if I thought you were a hurricane forecaster and you
*  knew this was coming, but you kept telling me, oh, it's low risk. Don't worry about it.
*  Right. Yeah. Once it hit. Yeah. So that's what we need to do today is just say, this is going to be
*  challenging and we're going to get through it though. We are going to get through it.
*  I hope this wakes people up to the value of vaccines too. There's so many wackos out there
*  that think that vaccines are a scam or they're dangerous or there's so many people out there
*  that won't vaccinate their children. I know. And that's one of your best shows you ever did
*  was Peter Hotez. He's a dear friend of mine. He's a, I do too. He's a dear friend of mine,
*  as you and you know, he is one of the champions out there on this very issue. I couldn't agree
*  with you more. I think that's really an important point that, you know, we got to get this idea.
*  These vaccines can be lifesaving. If we had one right now, think how different
*  the situation would be in the world right now. It would be radically different, but
*  you see the measles making a comeback and directly attributed to a lack of vaccines.
*  You know what? And it's not only the vaccines themselves, but it's the prioritization of
*  vaccines. I mean, you know, one of the real tragic stories right now in Africa is we are just
*  finally bringing to a close this outbreak of Ebola in the democratic public of the Congo,
*  far northeast part of the Congo, you know, 20 some thou or 2, 2, 800 people have died from this.
*  Okay. Bad been going on for almost two years and everybody talks about that. And I understand why
*  Ebola is a challenge, but you know, that during that same time period, over 7,000 kids in that
*  same area have died from measles because everybody was preoccupied trying to deal with Ebola.
*  And those deaths were totally preventable, totally preventable. So, I mean, I think that's,
*  you know, I have to say, and you know, this, I'm already on this show, so I'm not trying to
*  thank you for what you do say about vaccines because people listen to you and we need every
*  positive voice because we have so many crazy voices out there right now. So paranoid and
*  delusional and they want it all to be a conspiracy. There's been an amazing medical innovation
*  in human culture and that's vaccines. It's amazing what it's done and have there been adverse
*  effects on people? Of course, everything, everything that people do, there's some people
*  that are going to react in a bad way. It doesn't mean it's not a positive thing. And there's a
*  reason why the cases of polio are so tiny. There's a reason why smallpox went away. It's because of
*  vaccines. Absolutely. And, you know, that's one of the challenges you know today between the
*  anti-science misinformation that's out there, but then when they don't see it. Yes. And the reason
*  they don't see it is because we did vaccinate until we get enough people not vaccinated. And
*  then look what happened. There's a famous photo of two twins from the early 20th century. One of them
*  has smallpox and one of them was vaccinated. Have you seen that? I have, I have, I have.
*  It's a black and white photo. It's a very telling. Jamie will find it because it's,
*  people need to see it. That, that, that is the difference. Yep, yep, yep. That's it. Right there.
*  That's the one. One kid whose body is just devastated by what looks like he's like pebbles
*  glued to his skin all over his body, his face, his hands, and then his brother right next to him with
*  nothing. And you know what's really important to note here is that in that body, all those things
*  are very painful, but what's going on inside the body is equally bad. Yeah. And so you're exactly
*  right. I couldn't agree with you more that, you know, this is, this is really an important point.
*  Yeah. Diseases are terrifying. They're really terrifying. Yeah. And when something like this
*  can be prevented and the reason why people don't do it is because they're paranoid of vaccines and
*  they get that information from some wacko website or some person who really has no business talking
*  about it. You know, whether it's the people out there that think it causes diseases or that it's
*  a government plot or that it's a medical scam because just trying to raise, raise money, it's
*  just all of it, all of it's very, very disturbing, but it's a part of people. You know, the human
*  beings, for whatever reason, there's a percentage of us that lean towards conspiratorial thinking
*  and they lean towards thinking that there's some sort of a plot against them or the government's
*  against them. And it's just, you've got to listen to the medical experts. You know, and I hope that
*  if there's any good to come out of this terrible coronavirus situation is that there's a wake up
*  call. If we'd had a vaccine for this or one that even worked partially, think how different we'd be.
*  And you know what we got new other ones coming like this. We have to use our creative imagination.
*  As I said in the book, the chapter on coronavirus is the title is SARS and MERS, a harbinger of
*  things to come. I mean, we can use our creative imagination to say we should be funding these
*  things almost like we pay for our fire department. Imagine if we had to go out and buy a fire truck
*  and when the 911 call came in. We need to do it now. It's kind of disturbing that it's chapter 13
*  though. I know it was. Well, actually, would you do me a favor? You're going to really be like this.
*  Okay, open up to chapter 13. Okay. And when you look at it's towards the end there.
*  When you read the quote that goes with it. Okay.
*  125. Okay. So I every chapter started not with just a title, but a quote.
*  And I think you'll find this one quite interesting.
*  Right.
*  Bio-terror opening Pandora's box. That's not it. That's not the chapter.
*  That's not it? Yes. Chapter 13. You're close.
*  There it is. Okay. SARS and MERS, a harbinger of things to come.
*  But look at the quote underneath it.
*  These make me look smarter.
*  Roger Kipling.
*  And the dawn comes up like thunder water. China. Cross the bay. China.
*  China.
*  Did you put that in there because you really thought that a lot of this stuff was going to
*  come out of China or was that just because it's a great quote?
*  Exactly. No, this is exactly what we're talking about.
*  Why China?
*  Because they have this incredibly large population, 2 billion.
*  They've got this food supply that is largely wildlife that comes into these markets where
*  there's this incredible contact between people and these animals.
*  And the crowded nature of that society. I mean, I think one of the things that surprises people
*  when they go to China, 15 million population cities are common over there.
*  I mean, we think of the United States, we think of LA and New York, and that's big.
*  Over there, I mean, in Wuhan, a city of 15 million, the entire metropolitan area is 60 million.
*  And so you have people crowded so closely together that if you add in the bugs coming
*  from these animals and then the potential for this kind of contact where it spreads quickly,
*  China has been a bacterial and viral soup vessel for a long time.
*  That's again why we have to protect ourselves here because
*  a bug anywhere in the world today can be a bug everywhere tomorrow.
*  In particular when you're dealing with a massive number like these kind of cities.
*  So these wet, they call them wet markets?
*  Yep, wet markets. Yep.
*  So that's what it is. A lot of it is wildlife.
*  Oh, it's incredible. You know, I've hunted my life. I've always loved to fly fish.
*  I love the outdoors. Okay. I could never have imagined the animals.
*  I've spent time in these markets. I remember one day, spending a day in the Bangkok,
*  Thailand market, and it was about a mile by mile, half wild, big, I mean, in these tight aisles.
*  Every animal imaginable to humans, and I swear to God, there were some out of the movies, I think,
*  that were in there. And they're all just right on top of each other.
*  And I actually have a picture that I show in some of my lectures. There was a situation where there
*  all these chickens in a cage, 15 or 20 of them, okay, in a big wire cage, and it sat on top of a
*  wire cage full of ferrets. And ferrets are actually an animal model from a flu standpoint
*  that they do really well in getting infected with flu viruses. If you wanted to create the perfect
*  experiment that no university research group would let you do is you'd put birds and ferrets
*  like that together. And that's just common. That's just common. That's common.
*  And so birds and ferrets together, it's something that's infecting the birds,
*  could jump to the ferrets or rise to the versa. Ferrets could breathe it out and we could get
*  infected. Oh, Christ. And so these markets, and I don't know what's going to happen here, but
*  for the first time we really saw the Chinese, after this outbreak in Wuhan, really start to put
*  down some markers on what they're going to do to supervise these markets. I mean, they still have
*  to eat. But I think this is a dangerous practice where we see it. But you know, it happens. Look
*  at Africa with Ebola. Bush meat is still very important. And there's so much of the world that
*  that's their primary food supply. And when they say bush meat, it's basically everything.
*  Everything from bats. We think bat was the primary source of this outbreak in West Africa,
*  was a human bat that was consumed. They eat them all the time. Do they really? Yeah. Yeah.
*  So, and some of them are pretty big bats. They're literally three feet, link spans. They're big.
*  And so, you know, that's one of the challenges we have with with China. We know that this is
*  going to happen. It's going to occur. We think of the flu virus is the same way. And that's why we
*  need new and better flu vaccines. You know, this could just as easily be a flu pandemic. The same
*  thing like 1918. So these wet markets, they just have all these animals hanging out. And some of
*  them are still alive. So many of them are alive. And then they'll actually prepare them for you
*  right there. They basically kill them and gut them and so forth. You got some pictures up there.
*  Bazaar, Wuhan, West market menu shows over 100 wild animals sold as food link with virus unclear.
*  Exactly. It's pretty amazing. Yeah. Let's see some images. Whoa, look at that. Look at that list.
*  I know. Peacocks. Yeah. People are eating peacocks. Oh, yeah, absolutely. Deer, crocodiles,
*  turkey swans eating swans. How dare you kangaroos, squirrels, snails, foxes, foxes and
*  civet cats were the cause of the SARS outbreak. Yeah. Ostriches. I've had that pretty delicious.
*  Yeah. I'm a hypocrite. Look at me eating ostriches, centipedes, geese, hedgehogs, goats. Jesus.
*  So yeah, it's a challenge. That's normal. Yeah. So do we have a video of the market? I want to see.
*  Whoa, look at that freaky looking salamander. Look at the size of that sucker. Big. Yep. That's a
*  huge salamander. I want lights for you first. The pictures I was finding are dark. Yeah. Yeah. Come
*  on. What do you got? Cages of turtles and cages of bunnies. Let's see it. Wow. This wet market is very,
*  very strange. So, and these are enormous markets. Oh, they're huge. And the number of people in them
*  is incredible. I mean, there are many. Where are they getting the animals from? They're getting them from the wild?
*  Rural area, from rural areas. Yeah. Yeah. And are they growing these things and farming them or are they just catching them?
*  Some cases both. Some cases both. Like a lot of the seafood today is actually being farmed.
*  So this is really like a giant Petri dish. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's almost, wow. Fish. You're looking,
*  that fish looks not that fresh. Whoa. What's all that stuff? Rabbits and rabbits. I couldn't tell you what all that is.
*  Yeah. Jesus. But you're getting an idea. Laying them on the ground. Of why, you know, if we can't stop that,
*  we surely can try. But if we can't stop it, we need to stop the infectious diseases coming from those
*  animals to us. Look at them all wearing masks. That's hilarious. That was, I think, with the
*  outbreak was that that might have been since the other. Are those gigantic things a mollusk? What is that?
*  What are those things? Can't tell. Those look like giant mollusks. Yeah, they are, right? Because look,
*  no, because look at the ones behind. I think you're right. They look like huge muscles. Wow.
*  Look at those suckers behind them. Wow. Yeah. There's a lot of people in China. They got to eat.
*  That's where it gets weird, right? This is like, how do you tell them that they've been doing,
*  they've been doing this for who knows how long? How do you tell them to stop doing it? Or is,
*  is that impossible? And is it more possible to just accelerate our vaccine program and try to
*  preemptively create something to address coronaviruses, to address various, various
*  different, what other viruses are we concerned about other than coronaviruses? I think it's both.
*  I think the next most, not even next, it's still, it's a co-virus you might call influenza. I mean,
*  there have been 10 influenza pandemics in the last 250 years, and each one of them was a little
*  different, but some of them have been horribly bad. Back in the 1500s even, there was a major
*  pandemic that occurred where Spanish cities were described as nearly, almost totally depopulated.
*  And so these viruses pop out, and that's why we need new and better flu vaccines. And we're
*  actually working on one now, but it's still a ways off. But having those would really prevent the big
*  calamities, meaning some of the things are going to happen. They're not good, but they're not going
*  to bring down supply chains and threaten governments and so forth. And so I think the
*  priority vaccines we need to get are for those diseases that we know could. Is the flu injection
*  the most effective way, or is a mist as effective? Like, I know they do the mist up the nose.
*  Yeah, turns out that what research we have, and our group was involved with some of it, the flu
*  mist in the nose works really well in children mostly, because they haven't been infected yet
*  themselves. They don't have any protection, and so that virus really multiplies in the nose.
*  Remember, this virus is adapted not to multiply in your lungs, because the nose is colder than
*  the lung. And so it'll grow here. If you swallow it, it won't grow in your lungs.
*  If you've already been infected once, then you actually have some interference in your nose.
*  There's a little bit of protection there. So it works well in kids who haven't been infected before,
*  adults not so well. For us, the injection works best. And you know, I'm happy to report that,
*  although I'm not happy to report it. Being an old man, now I can even get the high dose vaccine
*  over age 60. So they are actually, you know, the best we have. The high dose vaccine is better?
*  Yeah, it's better than the regular vaccine in terms of protection. When you hit a certain age?
*  Yeah, when you get a little older, you need the higher dose because your immune system is
*  starting to wane. You know, just naturally having less. I wasn't aware that there was a low dose.
*  Yeah, there's a high dose. There's a higher dose vaccine now. So where do you get it? Like,
*  if a person's listening to this and they like any doctor's office, and they will usually say
*  that to you if you're over 60, you can get this vaccine. So they'll actually do that for you.
*  So run out, get a vaccine because to now it's pretty much over. The flu season's waning. I mean,
*  if you hadn't gotten it, you should have had it a couple of months ago. Okay. This one's waning.
*  Now we've had a bad flu season, a really bad one, but for the last couple of weeks, the numbers are
*  coming way down. So what can a person do other than the vaccine to prevent getting the flu?
*  That's primarily it. Again, it's an issue of who you're around, you know,
*  and your body's overall health. Yep. And just keep healthy as you can. And then I think the other
*  key piece though is if you do get the flu and you have really bad muscle aches, one of the things
*  about it, real influenza is not just sniffles. You feel like you got hit by a Mack truck.
*  If after several days, you still are really feeling bad, really bad. And you haven't seen
*  a physician by then you should because that's when you get the complications occurring,
*  the bacterial pneumonias that occur subsequent. And if you get those treated earlier than later,
*  you can actually do a lot to keep somebody from dying. So, you know, if you don't feel a lot better
*  in two days, I mean, if you, if you catch it really early, you can get a medication for flu.
*  There's actually a medication that will reduce your illness a bit. But if you're, if you're sick
*  for more than a couple of days, not better, you absolutely should see a doctor so you don't have
*  these other complications. And what can a doctor do once you? Any family practitioner would know
*  what to look for and whether or not your lungs are starting to fill up. You know, they'll listen
*  to your lungs to make sure you're not developing pneumonia. And what would they do for you?
*  They would likely give you an antibiotic based on what you had because you are then the problem
*  with flu is it's not just the flu virus, but then you get secondary bacterial pneumonia from the
*  damage in the lungs. And so they can prevent that. A lot of older people in particular will
*  die from actually what we call secondary pneumonia to having had influenza. They wouldn't have gotten
*  the pneumonia if they had not had flu, but then they do. Now we were talking earlier about
*  probiotics. Do is there a benefit of probiotics once you've taken antibiotics to reflourish
*  your gut flora? You know, that's where the studies really at this point have demonstrated that it's
*  very temporary. In other words, if you're taking probiotics, you can get a boost initially,
*  but it doesn't sustain itself over time. And then the natural flora comes back. I mean, the gut
*  microbes will come back as they've been reduced. But what I'm saying is, is it beneficial to people
*  if they do take a probiotic after antibiotics? Because antibiotics do have a devastating effect
*  on your flora. Yeah. Kills the bad stuff, but it also kills a lot of the good stuff, right? Yeah.
*  So is it beneficial for people once they have taken an antibiotic to take probiotics to sort
*  of reflourish, at least temporary? Yeah. And that's what I'm saying is that it doesn't,
*  the data don't support that it stays. In other words, you get a short-term boost
*  and it gives you some of the new good bacteria, but they don't stay around. But what if you just
*  keep taking it? Even then, they just don't stay around. Your normal gut flora will come back and
*  take over. So the probiotics in themselves are not giving you that long-term boost. So you don't
*  think there's any benefit to having even a short-term boost? Well, you know, it's again,
*  surely I'm not going to profess to be the expert in probiotics, but I'll tell you that the data
*  we have doesn't show that they have a big boost and that they actually help you long-term or
*  short-term, meaning that it makes any difference. Now, there's one exception to that where I would
*  say, and this is a very different thing than probiotics, but we actually have a disease
*  called Clostridium difficile, which is a bad bacteria that happens when you've taken away
*  too many antibiotics and it colonizes your gut because you don't have competing organisms there.
*  And then you can die from this. There are treatments for that called actually fecal
*  transplants. Yeah, I've heard of that. And that's where actually there you take it little capsules,
*  but it's actually drinking poop, well, purified, purified bugs from the poop. You're right. But
*  you take that and that's, that's, that kind of is what you're talking about. That does have a real
*  benefit. And there is clear evidence that if you take those, those fecal transplants, as opposed to
*  just probiotics as such, that that can have a major positive impact on your recovery from things like
*  Clostridium difficile infection. And so more and more institutions now actually are doing
*  fecal transplants, which you'd never thought that that would be one thing you do one day.
*  But for those who've had this problem, they're, they're life-saving. They're amazing. Maybe we
*  should change the name. That would, although on the other hand, you don't forget it if you,
*  right? You don't forget it. Yeah, you don't forget if it's a fecal transplant, but that's what's
*  going to be nerve wracking to people. Yeah. Yeah. You know, once you're that sick, boy,
*  it feels good to take it. It does, you know. Have you done it? I've never done it. I've never had a
*  problem where I've had to, but, but for the, I've known people who have been desperately sick,
*  who have taken them and have really done much better, much, much better. I want to ask you
*  about Lyme disease. Sure. Lyme disease is a scary one, right? And I mean, so many of my friends in
*  the East coast have it. It's really terrifying that, that, that part of the country in particular
*  seems to be like really badly infected with these, these ticks that carry this disease.
*  What can people do to prevent that? And what, what can we, there's no vaccine for Lyme disease. And
*  I know there was at one point in time, but people were having an issue with, I mean,
*  a good friend of mine, her dad actually got Lyme disease from the vaccine before they discontinued
*  it. What can someone do to sort of protect themselves? Yeah. Well, Lyme disease in and of
*  itself is a fascinating story. I've actually been involved with it since its early discovery in the
*  1980s and Minnesota, Wisconsin was a big focus, the upper Midwest. And this is a story that I think
*  you'll find interesting is, is that even though it was discovered primarily in the Eastern part of
*  the United States named after Lyme, Connecticut, it's a disease that actually probably originated
*  in the upper Midwest. And I tell you that because it turns out that there is a focus in Northern
*  Wisconsin and East central Minnesota where there's Lyme disease, there's another disease called
*  anaplasmosis, there's another disease, babesia, et cetera, that all seem to have a similar kind of
*  tick human deer kind of component. And back in the CCC days of the 1930s, the white tail deer population
*  had been virtually totally depopulated from the Northeast. And so they actually trapped deer in
*  Northern Wisconsin and took them out and deposited them in New York and Connecticut and so forth.
*  And most of those deer are actually deer that, you know, today their great-great-great-great-great
*  grandfather came from Wisconsin. Wow. And guess what? When you move deer, you move ticks. In fact,
*  I was involved with a study that the Wisconsin Division of Health did and a colleague of mine,
*  the late Jeff Davis, where up in Northern Wisconsin, as deer would come into the check station,
*  they would actually measure the number of ticks that were attached to the nape of the neck,
*  okay? And they had a thing drawn. And they asked hunters who were driving back to Madison and
*  Milwaukee if they would be willing to check in at a station down there for just a second,
*  and then they were going to count the ticks again. And it turned out that as the vehicles come rolling
*  down from Highway 51 from Northern Wisconsin, get on the Interstate 90-94 and go to Milwaukee or
*  Madison, the ticks just kept falling off. By the time they got to Madison or Milwaukee, the ticks
*  were almost all gone. Well, guess lo and behold where all the Lyme disease and so forth started
*  to show up right along the interstate corridor. Wow. Because the ticks were coming off and then
*  they were getting into the local deer in that population. And so it's exactly what you said,
*  the ticks are moving. They're moving. Okay, they've moved and they're now infected. So I think that
*  this Lyme disease issue is a key one. Lyme disease is really an important disease. It's real,
*  no question about it. The challenge we have is that there's a lot of people that assume that
*  they have chronic Lyme infection. And you know, the data on that is just really, really not there to
*  support that these people are chronically infected, but they do have an immune response likely that
*  occurs where it sets up this trigger. And so they're sick. They actually have something,
*  but it's not treating it again for the bacteria infection. It's the fact that this body, your
*  own body's immune system, as we've talked about several times today, starts attacking you.
*  So I think it's a similar picture we see with chronic fatigue syndrome, same kind of thing.
*  These people really are sick. They really do have problems, but it's not something you can treat.
*  So when people, I have a challenge because when people take IV antibiotics at extended periods
*  of time for Lyme disease, you know, the data, there's four different studies now that have been
*  done where people have had what we call a double blind placebo controlled trial where half got
*  the drug, half got an IV, but no drug. And it turned out all four of these studies in Lyme disease,
*  the people who got the, just the placebo did just the same as the people who got the drug.
*  And I worry that we're using antibiotics a lot there. And this is where I just mentioned
*  earlier about claustromedificil. We actually had a patient in Minnesota that died from the IV
*  treatment for what was chronic Lyme disease and wouldn't have been helpful. And so we need a lot
*  more research in this area to figure out what are these people getting? What is it that we can shut
*  off so that they don't have this chronic Lyme disease picture knowing that it's not actually
*  just you had to treat them more. Treatment's not going to help them with the antibiotics anymore.
*  And so I think that that's an area that we just need a lot more work in and numbers are growing,
*  as you know. Yeah. So we don't, we don't know what's happening. Well, there's a, we have enough data
*  to say your immune system is really cranked up, but your immune system is, you know, reacting to
*  something. Yeah. It's like rheumatoid arthritis. A lot of things, you know, we, you know, thank
*  God for our immune system is what fights off all the bad things we have, but sometimes that immune
*  system gets turned on too much. And then it takes on us. Okay. And, and it goes back to the
*  coronavirus. So that's why a lot of these people are dying right now is this over vigorous immune
*  response. And Lyme disease is kind of that same inciting event where we have evidence now that
*  you could be infected with the bacteria, but if we treat you, it's not like, it's like every other
*  bacteria, you can really get rid of it, but you still have this chronic illness that's occurring.
*  And what I think is hard is, is that we see people who have this, who are desperate to have somebody
*  understand what they have, and they end up going to people who take real advantage of them,
*  clinicians who charge them an arm and a leg for things that are not going to help them.
*  And what we need is a lot more research on what is actually going on and what kind of drugs can we
*  use to reverse this immune system disorder? I have a friend of mine who's a UFC fighter, Jim Miller,
*  and he's, he's got Lyme disease and it's pretty bad. He takes a stack of pills. I don't know what
*  he takes every day. Yeah. What do you think someone is taking and what, what, what benefit would they
*  get from that? I couldn't tell it without, I mean, I'm not, you know, without knowing what it's there,
*  but again, more often than not, if he's been adequately treated, it's not that the bacteria
*  is still growing in him like it might be for a lot of it's an autoimmune, it's autoimmune,
*  which is real. I mean, that's the other thing is I think these people just want to be legitimized
*  and said, you know, I'm really sick, right? And I'm not, it's not something I'm, you know, mentally
*  ill about whatever, but then we've got to figure out what it is that you have. And so we really
*  don't know. We don't know yet. We don't know. Wow. But it's been around for so long. I know,
*  but this is where we need a lot more research about this in terms of what is it that's making
*  these people like this. And this is really important. And is there anything they can do
*  to eradicate the ticks? You know, this is another thing you'll find interesting. In Minnesota,
*  prior to the arrival of the first white men, the native Americans burnt much of our state all the
*  time. The prairies through much of the territory, even in northern Wisconsin, northern Minnesota,
*  we had the classic, you know, pine forest fire would wipe through. And with that, it would open
*  up so much of the forest that you'd have a very different kind of, of, of mammals, population,
*  deer, et cetera, et cetera. And with the suppression of fire, what's happened is we now have,
*  instead of having these old growth forests, we have all this younger, you know, non pine or any
*  kind of like the oak trees of the upper Midwest are all disappearing because oak trees need
*  sunlight and fires. What kept they were very resistant to fire. And so the old oak forest
*  and so forth would, would survive because of fire. Whereas today with no fire, you know, the elms and
*  the maples and everything else comes in and the buckthorn and all that kind of stuff and takes
*  over. So, so what's happening is in our state of Minnesota is we have a really good example of
*  this is we're losing our moose. And the big primary reason is brainworm. It's a type of
*  parasite that's common in white tailed deer, but causes no problems in moose. It actually causes
*  a brain infection and it kills them. And guess why it's happening? Cause the deer range has moved
*  farther and farther north in Minnesota. I'm sorry. The, the, the has moved farther in
*  middle of Minnesota because of lack of fire, cause the forest is changing. So now where there only
*  used to be moose, we're seeing deer and moose and where that intersection is, we're starting to see
*  moose developed as brainworm infection because it's from the deer. So the tick population has
*  changed too. And it's largely due to the fire, lack of fire in many places in the Northeast,
*  never used to be like it was. We had fire all the time that would clear out these areas. And it was
*  just part of natural everything. So, so one of the challenges we have with ticks is they're here.
*  We're not going to change how we live suburbs and trees and all of that. Could controlled burns
*  eliminate a lot of them? They do, because what they do is they just don't eliminate the ticks.
*  But what they do is they eliminate, for example, the whitefield mice in all these different
*  species that are important to the ticks. And then they bring in different species that will,
*  will be there. So, I mean, this is a big debate in Minnesota right now. I mean, we're, we're losing
*  all these moose to brainworm. Ironically, the mooser population is expanding dramatically in
*  Isle Royal. Why? Because there's no deer out there. And so they're not getting brainworm out there.
*  So people have said, you know, we're going to lose our moose. Well, it's the deer. So, so fire
*  actually has helped the moose in areas in Northern Minnesota, where there's been a lot of fire.
*  The moose population is growing because the deer are not there because exactly those mammals,
*  those rodents and so forth are very different in burnt out areas than they are in fire in non
*  burnt out areas. Well, they do control burns in some states. I got a friend who was hunting in
*  Washington state a couple of years ago and he said it was really weird because there's these
*  massive fires in the distance that were actually being controlled. They do it on purpose. Yeah,
*  which is a lot better than having the out of control fires where you have so much fuel. Yeah.
*  And you know, if you haven't had a forest fire in 8500 years in an area, the fuel in there is huge.
*  And so actually, they do that in Northern Minnesota, too. They're doing control burns
*  and the prairies, of course, we do control burns all the time. So the problem with the East Coast
*  is you're dealing with a lot of these sort of almost residential areas that have all these ticks.
*  Yeah, you can't. Yeah. And there you can't there. We have to find ways that that's that's where we
*  really have to have vaccines and treatments for these diseases. We're not get rid of the ticks.
*  So we have to do is figure out, I mean, wouldn't it be incredible if we have a cocktail vaccine for
*  Babesia for Lyme disease for us we need. Is there any kind of an animal that eats ticks?
*  Birds. Yeah, birds will eat them. But not enough. Not enough. No, they're they're doing very well.
*  Thank you. Ticks do very well. And that's another issue. You know, for some of the larger mammals,
*  as you know, tick predation can get so heavy, particularly in in certain times of the year that
*  that really literally takes a lot of blood out of these large animals, even though they're so big.
*  Yeah, that's a lot of blood. I went down a rabbit hole the other day online and I saw this one deer
*  that was covered in these frisbee size patches of ticks. That's exactly it. They're all swollen.
*  Also, and they're full of blood. Oh, so disgusting. And it happens day after day. So it is a hit on
*  them. It's a real hit on them. To pull up a picture of that just to freak people out that are watching
*  online. Just they need to see this. Yeah, yeah. It's pretty amazing. It's one of those things that
*  when you talk about ticks and you talk about Lyme disease, most people their eyes glaze over.
*  They don't even care. It's not affecting me until someone in your family has it. Yeah. There's a
*  guy that I know who was a former UFC fighter, Marcus Davis, who he put he had his wife got
*  Lyme disease and he spent hundreds of thousands of dollars trying to trying to help burn and
*  do something about treatments and all these different things for it. Yeah, it's a it's a real
*  challenge. It's a challenge. And this is another area again, you know, when you think of the amount
*  of money we lose in just lost time, let alone pain and suffering. Yeah. What an investment to make in
*  this. I mean, this this is the kind of thing. This is where infectious diseases really need a
*  renaissance. I mean, well, we do a lot here. We pulled up a chart of the United States where they
*  showed the areas that are affected by these ticks and what what percentage of ticks carry Lyme
*  disease they've tested. And some places in the northeast, it's in the 60 percent. Oh, exactly.
*  Yeah, it is. It's huge. And it's growing and it's growing. I mean, you understand how wildlife has
*  changed. I mean, look at to think that we have all these wild coyote populations in New York City now.
*  Yes. I mean, it's amazing how animals city in the country. Yeah. You know what the rats aren't doing,
*  the coyotes are taken out. And it's it's it's a challenge. I mean, these are infectious disease
*  issues, too. They're they're very real. They have coyotes in Central Park. They do. Yeah, absolutely.
*  They have in the Bronx. They have them. And it's weird. It's weird to see because this is something
*  that just didn't exist before. Look at this. Oh, there's that's for a good one. That's OK. Yeah,
*  that's OK. That's not not that's not the best I've seen, but it's gross enough. Yeah, it is. It gives
*  you a good sense of it, though. Yeah. Dan Flores, who has been a guest on the podcast before, has a
*  great book called Coyote America that sort of details how this came to be and how these coyotes
*  have. Oh, look at that. All over that poor deer. Look at the eye. Look at the eye and the fawn.
*  Yeah. Yeah. They're disgusting. Yeah. But the coyotes, about how when they got rid of the wolves
*  and they tried to do the same to the coyote, they just actually expanded their territory.
*  They're sneaky, very clever little animals. Adaption. Yeah. Just like microbes, adaption.
*  Is there anything else that we should cover? No, I mean, I think I thank you for covering this issue
*  on infectious diseases. We can use all the help we can to get people to be aware of what's out there
*  and what's coming and just keeping the message straight. And we're going to get through this.
*  But at the same time, it's going to be a challenge. You know, today you have an underlying health
*  problem and you're particularly over age 50, 55. I'd say avoid big crowds if you can. And that's
*  going to be really important. And know that we're going to work on the critical drug supply to make
*  sure that people aren't without drugs that save their lives every day. That's going to be a big
*  challenge. One more question. How long does it take to develop a vaccine for this coronavirus?
*  Well, you know, when I'm asked that question, I don't mean to sound glib again, but I can make
*  a vaccine for it overnight. The question is, is it safe and effective? And that's the challenge.
*  We have right now questions about how do you make immunity to a coronavirus and what kind of vaccine
*  do you have to have that brings in all the different parts of the immune system? So we don't know that
*  yet. So some of this research is going to have to be basic to that. The second thing we have to worry
*  about is safety. There's a condition in humans called antibody dependent enhancement, ADE.
*  And it turns out that if you have no antibody or an immune response, you'll get the disease. If you
*  have a lot, you're protected. But if you have this in between level and then you get the disease,
*  it actually enhances the disease. Immune response is really destructive. And in fact, there was just
*  a couple of years ago, a major recall of dinghy vaccine, a type of vaccine we use for mosquito
*  infection in the Philippines where kids who got the vaccine actually made just a little bit of
*  antibody. And when they got the real disease, it made them a lot sicker. And so we found with the
*  2003 SARS vaccine that there was an ADE component to it when we made it in animals. And so we're
*  going to have to really study this to be sure it's safe. And as you said earlier, we can surely make
*  mistakes. We need to do everything we can not to. And so I think between getting the effectiveness
*  and the safety data together, we're years out. I mean, maybe two years. Yeah, this is not going to
*  happen soon. It's wishful thinking. I go back to SARS in 2003 and look at every
*  event, Zika. 2015, we said, oh, we'll have a vaccine for it in no time. Here we are five years
*  later, we have no vaccine. And so this is one of the challenges we have. We have to complete the job.
*  You know, it's like we start on something and then we forget that it's important because it kind of
*  goes away for a while, but only to come back. And so this is part of that picture we talked about.
*  And this is what Peter Hotez talks a lot about. You know, we got to finish the job on these things.
*  You know, I worry that we'll get through this situation and then people say, oh, we're done.
*  And then we'll forget until the next one comes along. And so this is where vaccine research and
*  development is really important. How do they test for safety? So once they come up with a potential
*  vaccine, how do they make sure that it's safe? Well, you do it gradually. First of all, you put
*  it into animals to see, and you know enough about them, how their immune responses, what do they do?
*  Then you put it into a few humans, 30 humans, you know, they volunteer willingly knowing to see what
*  kind of reactions they have. Why don't we just take really bad people that are in jail
*  and practice on them? Well, I don't know if that's doable here in this country without
*  their informed consent. So I'll just... I think Trump can fix that. If anybody, if we have a shot
*  at doing that with any president, it's Trump. Just start with rapists. Yeah. So anyway, the bottom
*  line though is, is that then they gradually work their way up to larger studies where, you know,
*  if something happens one every thousand people, you have to study a lot of people before you know
*  the chance that you might find that. You can't do it in 30 people. So that's why it's going to take
*  a while. And you know, they'll test it on more and more people and they're going as fast as they can.
*  It's not like there's anybody dragging their feet. It's just that, you know, I jokingly say it's like
*  if the Iowa farmer wanted to harvest his corn in half the time, it doesn't mean by planting twice
*  as many acres, he can do that. You know, plant in April, you still can't harvest till October.
*  That's a good point. That's what this is. It's going to take us this long to get this vaccine.
*  Well, Michael, I appreciate you and I appreciate your time and your book, Deadliest Enemy. People
*  can go out and buy it and thank you for informing us. And thanks for being here.
*  It means a lot to us. Thank you very much. Thanks. Thank you. Bye.
*  Oh, I'd love to. I'd love to get a picture with you.
