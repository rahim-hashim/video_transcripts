# JRE MMA Show #157 with Craig Jones
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [May 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzAxtfdDHnY)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day.
*  What's going on?
*  I like the one ear side.
*  Thank you, yeah.
*  That's professional.
*  A lot of guys do that.
*  It helped my hearing.
*  It's fading in my old age.
*  Do you have fucked up ears because of the cauliflower?
*  Does it fuck up your hearing?
*  Yeah, just one of them.
*  I thought it was cool until the inner ear started to swell and it was messing with my hearing
*  and I was like, that's not cool anymore.
*  Did you get it fixed?
*  I just faced it at the women I'm talking to.
*  Did you get it fixed?
*  Oh, it eventually drained out but it's as good as it's going to get I think.
*  Yeah, I always wore ear guards.
*  I was always scared of the ears because there's a design.
*  It helps capture sound and bring it into your ear.
*  I didn't know the AirPods were coming through a curve ball and how cool this was.
*  Oh right, because you can't stuff them in there.
*  I jam them in but it popped back out.
*  Yeah, you've got to wear it over the ears.
*  So let's talk about your tournament.
*  The tournament or what?
*  Where did this come from first of all?
*  Because you've competed at Abu Dhabi.
*  This is what I don't understand.
*  You're going to go head to head with ADCC which is the biggest grappling organization in the world.
*  By the way, that's Gordon Ryan's belt up there.
*  If you want to look at it.
*  Gordon Ryan, oh man, I might take that home with me.
*  How can I get the money to buy it?
*  Well, I mean what started it?
*  Well, obviously you can't win a tournament.
*  You put your own tournament on that you can win and probably lose anyway.
*  I mean really it's for the growth of the sport.
*  We're getting some beef involved, some two pack biggie, Drake Kendrick energy to this.
*  But really to compensate the athletes well and to raise some money for charity along the way.
*  And who's funding this thing?
*  That's one of those things, you know.
*  Your girl takes a trip to the UAE.
*  She comes back with a handbag.
*  You don't talk about it.
*  You don't have to ask me questions.
*  You brought with you a million dollars in cash, which I've never seen before.
*  I've never seen a million dollars in one place.
*  I've never even seen a million dollar check.
*  Should we tip this out?
*  Yeah, I guess tip it out.
*  Let's make sure we don't spill any.
*  Ladies and gentlemen, that is one million dollars in cash.
*  All stays.
*  That is so ridiculous.
*  Look at that.
*  That's so crazy.
*  Wow.
*  Whoever is running this really trust you.
*  They shouldn't.
*  Those are loose.
*  Like a lot of these are just kind of flying around.
*  Flapping around here, you know.
*  They have way too much faith in me.
*  Yeah, a lot of faith in you.
*  I mean this was to prove I had the idea.
*  I was like, I'll bring a prop million dollars on Joe Rogan.
*  But people will.
*  I was thinking then they already don't believe I have the money.
*  So if I pulled out a prop million and you were like, oh, that's fake money.
*  Then I'm like, oh, my tournament's fucked.
*  So we had to source out to do some bad things for that.
*  So how's one even get a million dollars out of a bank?
*  That's got to be a pain in the ass, right?
*  Yes.
*  So my buddy that's helping me out with this basically called his man.
*  He said, I need a million dollars on Thursday.
*  They said, yo, that takes two to three weeks.
*  And he's like, get me the million on Thursday or I'll find a bank that can.
*  And I mean that put the energy in him to get it.
*  Here we are.
*  So what does this guy do that he has all this loot?
*  I really don't want to say.
*  I'm going to keep it all directed at me.
*  It's all above board legal.
*  You know what I mean?
*  But we're sort of keeping it mysterious.
*  I want any negative energy towards the tournament come in my direction, not the anonymous sugar daddy in the background.
*  OK.
*  So you don't want to say like what the business is or does the business profit off of this at all?
*  Does this benefit the business to do this?
*  Whatever you say.
*  I mean, we're running as a nonprofit.
*  So like obviously for people that want to support the sport of Jiu Jitsu, like we're going to donate basically all the ticket sales of this event towards different charities.
*  So we really want to do this as a nonprofit because my thoughts were if Jiu Jitsu doesn't make a profit, we might as well make a nonprofit.
*  OK.
*  Well, does Jiu Jitsu make no profit?
*  Like Abu Dhabi doesn't turn a profit, right?
*  It's done primarily because of the sheikh's love of the sport.
*  Like the yeah, it's like a passion project.
*  But I mean, sort of my problem with the latest event is like we're selling so many tickets and they their event is in T-Mobile.
*  T-Mobile is super expensive.
*  As far as I know, I remember their event organizer posted the amount they paid for T-Mobile and it was basically two of these.
*  So I was just to rent out the event.
*  So I was just to rent out the venue, just to rent out.
*  And then you were at the Thomas and Mac.
*  Yeah. So the previous event were at they were at Thomas and Mac.
*  So I just thought, hey, I might as well check how much Thomas and Mac cost.
*  And it was a lot cheaper.
*  So in my opinion, we're really doing this because the prize money has been the same for so long.
*  A lot of events don't pay a lot of money.
*  But obviously, ADCC is the biggest.
*  Right.
*  And this sells a lot of tickets sales, but really they made a lateral move in the venue that didn't really grow much in the way of seeding and none of that money really.
*  How much does Thomas and Mac seat?
*  I think we'll have about 11,000 seats for this one.
*  And T-Mobile is what 18?
*  I think 18. Yeah.
*  So not not massive difference.
*  And really, ADCC prize money stayed the same.
*  So their prize money, you have to win four matches to get 10K.
*  Not that I'd know because I could never fucking win it.
*  But we're going to pay.
*  We're going to do two divisions and pay 100 times that amount of money to the division winners.
*  So 10K is the winner of ADCC.
*  And we're going to pay 10,001 dollars to show up to our tournament.
*  10,001.
*  Throw an extra dollar.
*  That's for me personally.
*  So anybody who competes gets 10,000 dollars.
*  Really?
*  So even if you just get smoked?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I'm thinking of the other guys like me in these tournaments that don't make the final compensate everyone.
*  Well, that is nice.
*  But ADCC has never made money.
*  Right.
*  So for them, raising the money would just be losing more money.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, but if I mean, if if you could sell 11,000 seats, you know what I mean?
*  Like if you could sell streaming rights to an event, I feel like some of that should go back towards the athletes rather than just spending it all on production.
*  Like a lot of people talk about the cost of production and it's important to grow a sport.
*  But I really feel like at least the athlete compensation should go up a little bit.
*  You know, like in terms of ticket sales, some of that should go back towards the athletes.
*  Even if the ADCC is not making any money at all?
*  But in terms of they do make money, but it's where they spend it.
*  They choose to spend it on production rather than the athletes.
*  Right.
*  But it's not profitable.
*  Like it's in terms of the organization itself is not really profitable.
*  I don't believe.
*  Well, I would imagine if they chose Thomas and Mack with the streaming rights and the cost of the venue like that they've spent on T-Mobile, for sure they would have made a profit off this event.
*  You could curtail production costs down.
*  Like it's not going to be that crazy if you choose the right venue.
*  My opinion is grappling is amazing, but I don't think we're ready for T-Mobile.
*  That's that's a massive, expensive venue.
*  Right.
*  Well, the Thomas and Mack was very impressive last year.
*  It was very impressive.
*  The the whole overall production and just the scope of it and the amount of fans that came out to watch ADCC.
*  It was pretty impressive.
*  Crazy.
*  Yes.
*  I've never competed in that many in front of that many people before.
*  It was awesome.
*  It was awesome spectacle.
*  That was basically my opinion is like, why are we making a lateral move in my opinion when we could still keep the same venue?
*  So what was the idea about going head to head with ADCC?
*  If you want to grow the sport, wouldn't it be better to do it in an alternative weekend?
*  That way the people that compete at ADCC can also compete at your event.
*  Well, we kind of we I mean, yeah, obviously athletes can't do both.
*  But in terms of for the fans, the fans will be able to go to our event Friday, Saturday, still see ADCC finals on Sunday.
*  But in terms of doing it at the same weekend, we're I mean, we're really trying to make a stand that like the athletes can unify in this sense and we can get compensated better.
*  Because again, none of I mean, not the athletes care where we compete.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like we were like, as the sport grows, grappling is growing.
*  Obviously, thanks to people like you, you've blown it up.
*  Whenever you shout us out, our followers go up.
*  So I mean, the events are getting more eyes on it.
*  People are more ticket sales.
*  Like we should get at least some token gesture of a payment increase.
*  Well, I think the best case scenario out of this is that ADCC does ramp it up and that the sport does get more eyeballs because people are aware of this huge increase in pay.
*  And then I always feel a competition is good.
*  I just don't necessarily like the idea of going head to head because I feel like it just kind of messes with the athletes because, you know, it puts them in a situation where they have to choose.
*  First of all, between ADCC and the Craig Jones Invitational.
*  And if they do that, ADCC is going to probably hold a grudge.
*  I mean, hopefully not.
*  Well, hopefully they won't.
*  But likely they will.
*  I mean, it doesn't make sense that they would.
*  I mean, if you're kind of crippling their organization by taking the elite guys and offering them potential for like how many people are going to jump ship?
*  Do you know?
*  I mean, who have we got confirmed already?
*  We've got Fionn Davies past champion.
*  The Taka brothers were the first two with a Nikki Ryan.
*  I'm going to announce today Nikki Rod's jumping across.
*  We got Luke Rockhold in there.
*  We threw him in because he's just he's honestly pretty impressive.
*  He tapped me out in the gym.
*  I was like, fuck it.
*  We'll throw him in.
*  In terms of the under, we've got Joseph Chen.
*  So, I mean, a lot of people are going to make the move.
*  And what's interesting to me, I can't say any names in particular, but a lot of the old legends obviously want to be a part of this event.
*  I think they believe they want to support the cause.
*  You know, I mean, and you say make the athletes make a choice.
*  I mean, really, they should be able to make the choice if there's an event with such a huge amount of prize money on display.
*  You know, the argument is prestige versus prize money.
*  And my argument is the prize money is there.
*  That becomes the most prestigious event.
*  Yeah, it does.
*  It does ramp up the prestige.
*  But will this happen again?
*  Is this a one time thing or are you guys planning on doing multiple ones of these?
*  Yeah, we want to do it.
*  We don't need 80 CC every two years.
*  So most of the time, guys have to wait every two.
*  We want to do it every year.
*  Well, that would be good.
*  Then there would be a year where it's not in competition.
*  We don't want to just kill another organization and then I just disappear off into the sunset, maybe sneak a couple million.
*  But we want to do it every year for sure.
*  The goal is really to raise money for charities and do some film projects around the world using Jiu Jitsu really helping out some underprivileged kids and stuff.
*  Well, the whole idea of using it for charity is beautiful.
*  That's amazing.
*  But is this guy willing to fork up this kind of like does he have a commitment to do this more than once?
*  I mean, basically, he says if we do a good job of this one, you can do it every year.
*  He's super invested in sport.
*  Jiu Jitsu loves it.
*  And this guy's just throwing loot away, throwing a lot of loot away.
*  Thank God.
*  Thank God.
*  That's a crazy thing to commit to, though.
*  I mean, even no matter how rich you are, I mean, because if you're giving away three million dollars in prize money, is that what it is?
*  Yes.
*  So I mean, so how's it go?
*  We basically got a budget of three million and we decided to give two point three million of that to the athletes and the rest.
*  We're going to spend on production.
*  Obviously, we're going to have sponsors come in.
*  We're going to work with particular sponsors.
*  But we're going to again, the ticket sales that's going to charity.
*  We're really allowing some of the athletes to choose.
*  Like if we have an influential grappler and stuff, we're not really trying to leverage the money we have.
*  We're saying, hey, if we get you on board, we're happy to donate a percentage of the ticket sales to a charity of your choice.
*  So we give them a bit of freedom in who they want to help.
*  Well, that's nice.
*  And if this does go well, like what is what's the when you say go well, like what are the guys?
*  What are we trying to achieve in terms of like going well to do this again?
*  I mean, based on the investment and how much money we can raise for charities really to go there.
*  Like if we can sell out Thomas and Mack and we can demonstrate that we can do this in a cost effective way, we can bring in more sponsors.
*  Definitely going to keep doing this every year.
*  Well, like I said, I think competition is always great.
*  And I think just more eyeballs and more people paying attention to it is great for the sport.
*  Obviously, I love Jiu Jitsu.
*  And I think, you know, the athletes getting paid a million dollars to win first place is fantastic because, you know, we both know that most athletes don't make much money off of actual competition.
*  The money that they do make, they usually make in seminars and only fans.
*  Yeah, that's you.
*  Yeah, that's a lot of underwear.
*  So, you know, only fans and what else?
*  I guess DVDs.
*  Yeah, I mean, that's the number one revenue source for athletes would be.
*  Revenue source for athletes would be instructional.
*  But like, again, that's like you can win the biggest tournaments in the world.
*  It doesn't necessarily translate to seminars, doesn't translate to instructional.
*  That's the sad thing.
*  It's like you hold certain events so high that you're like, when I win that, I'm going to make it.
*  But then there'll be some asshole like me that never won, but outsells you.
*  It doesn't make you know what I mean?
*  It's like it's not your life's not set if you win one of these events.
*  But if you win a million as a grappler, you're pretty well set up, especially if you're like a grappler from a poorer country.
*  Like a million US and Brazil is going to go a long, long way.
*  And also it's it's just going to elevate the whole profile of the sport.
*  Just people knowing that a million dollars is going towards the first place.
*  Grapplers and then like has UFC Fight Pass had a positive impact?
*  Is that helped at all?
*  For sure.
*  I mean, obviously it helps so much.
*  My dreams always taken on MMA guys, you know, like they got the cloud, they got the big names.
*  So obviously UFC Fight Pass helped that happen.
*  But I mean, Tetchy's put a lot of work to the Fight Pass events and those are very, very popular.
*  I think that would be the pinnacle of sort of professional super fight events.
*  And what is like like if you fight in UFC Fight Pass, like what is a big payday UFC Fight Pass?
*  I know some of the athletes might get I don't know when I should say it.
*  Tetchy will kill me.
*  But I mean, it's broad.
*  Like I could go from 10 to six six figures, really.
*  And again, that's I mean, that's the thing.
*  When you compete for an event like a tournament, you might face four guys like for me personally,
*  I might face four guys that I could have made much more money facing off in a super fight setting.
*  So really, like in terms of the investment, the commitment, the training, the time to prepare for potentially four opponents to win something like $10,000.
*  When if I just had four super fights, right, make so much more money.
*  Obviously, I don't wouldn't get the medal and the amount of money that you're going to spend in camp anyway, just with nutrition supplements, steroids, the damage to do to your body.
*  All the jazz, everything, everything.
*  You mean you're spending $10,000 anyway.
*  Your blood pressure goes up, your liver values go up, you push it to the you red line up for a thing like ADCC.
*  Well, that is the craziest thing about the sport is that steroids are openly tolerated.
*  It's probably the only elite professional sport where particularly because of Gordon, because Gordon's been so open about steroids that everyone knows that the athletes are on juice.
*  Well, I'm sponsored by a local company called Evertime.
*  This is the sad thing.
*  I tell people, hey, I'm on TRT and I'm sponsored by them and no one believes me.
*  They're like, you look so out of shape.
*  There's no way he's just joking.
*  And I'm like, no, believe me, I'm taking serious.
*  I mean, sometimes.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Honestly, I'm the worst example of athlete ever.
*  I don't stretch, don't do any recovery.
*  I don't sleep.
*  You don't stretch at all.
*  No, I just go easy.
*  The first round, I feel like them pushing on my legs.
*  Hip mobility.
*  I think if you get a bad injury, that's a sign maybe it's time to hang it up.
*  So when you train, all you do is just jujitsu.
*  You don't like I do a little bit of lifting, but man, fucking I don't even track anything.
*  I'll just be like, oh, that seems like enough lifting for today.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, that's it.
*  Do you ever wonder if you did hire a serious strength and conditioning coach and really get after it, it would make a difference in your performance?
*  Maybe, but I mean, like I mean, if there's a million dollars on the line, maybe, but that's the way to put it.
*  But it's your whole life.
*  I mean, you're a professional jujitsu guy.
*  I mean, I love the technique and the strategy aspect of it.
*  You know, like sometimes when I've lifted or taken more steroids than usual, it's like I'm starting to overly rely on my strength.
*  What I love about jujitsu is laying traps, tricking people, making people feel silly.
*  That's the part I like.
*  Right.
*  Rather than just I want to look jacked just for me.
*  But don't you think even with the laying traps and just overall your ability to move would be enhanced?
*  It's true.
*  But if I mean, if I look to Jack, no one to buy the instructionals, I'd be like, I can't fucking do with that guy.
*  I've got to look like a weathered old man out there.
*  Wow.
*  That's a crazy approach.
*  We got we got another announcement here today.
*  Another biggest super fight in grappling history.
*  We signed it.
*  Actually, I signed this maybe an hour and a half ago.
*  So I got the OK.
*  Yeah.
*  But busted out.
*  Oh, the biggest super fight in grappling history.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, it might be one of the biggest events in what is the biggest so far so far.
*  It's probably Gordon and Galval.
*  And in terms of how much of a shesha.
*  Yeah.
*  But now we're talking the most decorated female athlete of all time.
*  Gabby Garcia has put pen to paper to face me on my own event.
*  So we're talking 10, 11 time world champion, four time ADCC champion.
*  You have been joking around about this forever.
*  This is actually going to happen.
*  100 percent going to happen.
*  We booked it.
*  We signed this contract earlier.
*  So like I mean, I had to do a lot of things to get it done.
*  You know, what do you have to do to talk to Gabby?
*  I had to talk to Gabby a lot.
*  I had to go over there, give her a back rub.
*  Do you have to dance with her?
*  I mean, it's getting this done.
*  Like she's like Harvey Weinstein producer, you know, but I'll do it for the fans.
*  But we got that booked.
*  I mean, she's really going to happen.
*  Yeah.
*  She's six, four, 250 pounds.
*  I don't know what she weighs.
*  Yeah.
*  So I'll take her on.
*  Wow.
*  I feel good.
*  I probably won't train for I'll be playing in the STEM events.
*  You won't train?
*  I wouldn't train that hard.
*  I'm happy she's doing it.
*  But like, oh, it took a long time.
*  We've been talking about this for two and a half years.
*  Feels like an arranged marriage or something.
*  I know.
*  I was always thinking that it was just a joke.
*  I know we're going to get we've got to get rid of the sexual tension somehow, you know?
*  So we're going to throw down one way.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, that's in the contract.
*  If I lose, I have to do some things.
*  Oh, no.
*  Maybe sell that on our OnlyFans.
*  But good luck.
*  Good luck.
*  So when this all goes down, are you going to stream it live and how are you going to do that?
*  Free on YouTube.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, we want to put it free on YouTube because we like everything I want to do about this event is to grow the sport.
*  So like, did you see scoring is confusing?
*  It's hard to keep up.
*  Some events don't even know their own scoring.
*  And to be honest, I compete in events where I don't even know the rules.
*  You know, I'm just hoping for the best.
*  But this one we're going to do for the lead up matches, the nonfinals qualifying matches, three by five minute rounds.
*  And we're going to have the judges score according to your traditional jujitsu.
*  You know, like if you get a good position, it might be if there's a four point discrepancy, something like that.
*  Are you using a specific rule set or you guys making your own?
*  Making our own one.
*  We want to make it make it our own completely.
*  So we want to take what you do to guys already know.
*  So we'll have three judges use some sort of pre-existing points system.
*  We'll have the judges translate into a 10 point system so that MMA fans will understand.
*  So say if there's a after round one, the guy finishes on the other guy's back, the ref stops.
*  We get up, we have a minute break.
*  That's a strong position.
*  We'll score that a 10 eight and we'll do open scoring.
*  So you guys are used to knowing the score as the match progresses.
*  They don't like the surprises like MMA surprise at the end.
*  You just you guys. They don't want things to be too different.
*  So we're basically keeping it very similar to what they already understand while trying to introduce it in a way that's friendly to fans that you know, because fans are going to be like, what the fuck's happening?
*  And he won the round tonight.
*  I wish that MMA had open scoring because it would expose a lot of really bad scoring.
*  You know where you're at.
*  Yeah, because there's so many times where it's just not.
*  And the argument against it, I think, is silly because the argument against it is that the person would coast if they were ahead.
*  But my feeling is that would make the person who's behind really get after it because they know they're behind.
*  You know, and then in fights where you know a guy's ahead and the guy's getting tooled up, that's already the case.
*  There's no, you know, like if like Adesanya is fighting somebody and he's just dominating the fight.
*  We all know that. We all know that.
*  And the only thing that could fuck him is a bad judge.
*  Some crazy judge.
*  Yeah. And we've seen that. We've seen like two scores that are like, that's right.
*  And then one score, one judge is like, what the fuck was that guy watching?
*  That's the guy we're going to hire for our event.
*  That guy's going to be cheap.
*  Why? That guy's going to be dangerous.
*  Why 10-8? Like, I don't even like 10-8 for MMA. I think it sucks.
*  I mean, just for a way that we can grow, like we can have an easy to digest.
*  I mean, I guess MMA is still pretty confusing, but we want MMA fans.
*  We want to steal MMA fans.
*  Like that's my whole strategy is I'll take on guys in the UFC because I know that drug test it and I'm not.
*  And I'll be like, and they're famous. It's like a perfect matchup.
*  But we want to do that because we want to steal their fans.
*  And we're also changing. It's very fucking expensive, actually.
*  Every jujitsu event is basically on an elevated stage or just on mats.
*  And we have this problem where there's all these weird resets, like guys might fall off the stage.
*  Yeah. They crash into the table.
*  So inspired by karate combat, we're going to do a rectangular mat space with that angled wall because there's no there's nowhere to run.
*  And we're going to call this rectangular mat space the alley.
*  Basically, only heads of back alley to fight or fuck sometimes.
*  But isn't the angled wall a bit of a problem?
*  I saw your match with Phil Bro. Yeah.
*  And the angled wall, like all of a sudden he's fucked because you're just going to go down.
*  It's not like a wall like a wall.
*  I don't like the cage in MMA. I've said multiple times.
*  I really think they should be fighting in a basketball court.
*  Just make it all matted up. Have a long red line.
*  We're going to bring it back 30 by 40. It's going to be massive.
*  That is big. Yeah.
*  So we heard the basketball court, but we threw some angles on the end.
*  Well, punishes them. We want to punish guys for backing up.
*  So like again, like you said, with a cage, they back up, but they remain vertical and guys are so like you can use that angle to not get taken down.
*  But if you back up, if you're running away, we want it to be detrimental to you while not having any referee interruption.
*  So if I'm if I'm like you said, I see I won the first round 10, 8, I'm coasting, I'm backing up that guy can chase me.
*  There's nowhere I can go. And if I back up, it's detrimental to me.
*  I want to ask you a specific question about the Phil Bro fight because he posted his arm down to like against the angle.
*  And I was like, well, you're kind of fucked if you're doing that.
*  And then you threw up the triangle and you trapped him.
*  But like, did you train for that?
*  Like, so this is this is the setup.
*  And this is in karate combat, which is, by the way, in Austin this Thursday.
*  I'm going to go down and check that out.
*  So like this, like when he posted his arm down, I'm like, oh, no, that's honestly, here's the funny thing about it is asking the promoter said to me goes, bro, we've got to sell the angled wall for grappling.
*  He's like, can you try to submit him off the wall?
*  And I was like, fuck you. I'll do that.
*  But I was like, I was like, I've got no plans of that.
*  They asked you to do it.
*  They said they said that'd be cool if he could do it.
*  And then afterwards, he's like, did you plan that?
*  I was like, yeah, sure.
*  But I mean, anytime someone posts a hand on the ground, we have an overhook and we can put weight on that hand.
*  They can't lift it off the ground so we can shoot a triangle pretty easy.
*  Yeah. Well, as soon as I saw him, I've got an overhook.
*  Yeah, we'll get the Russian tire.
*  As soon as I see him put that right hand on the floor, I was like, we can do something flying.
*  And I saw because of the angle, you can be a bit more brave.
*  You know, like it's not as it's not a sharp a fall.
*  Right. Like I'm I'm 32.
*  I probably shouldn't be doing flying shit, but you throw an angle in there.
*  I'll give it a crack.
*  Well, especially with everything padded up like that on the walls.
*  Yeah.
*  But man, me and Phil were laughing before this match.
*  Like we would. I had a couple of beers before this.
*  I thought we're just going to have a good time.
*  You had a couple of beers before the match.
*  Phil said he was going to drink a tequila shot to start the match.
*  But then I saw him put water in his cup.
*  I was like, I've been misled here.
*  And then we went out there and his I didn't even know the time of the match.
*  There was eight minutes and the guys that got 12 minute match.
*  Oh, fuck. And then his coach started cornering serious.
*  I thought, what have I got myself into?
*  So I thought better give it a crowd.
*  We're going to have fun play around a bit.
*  But he was he was ready to go.
*  You really had a couple of beers.
*  Yeah, I do do sometimes, you know.
*  Do you really take the edge off? Yeah.
*  Does it fuck with your performance at all?
*  You know what?
*  I never know what helps my performance or makes it worse.
*  You know, I never have taken the edge off might help.
*  I think so because I do a long training camp.
*  Sometimes I'm like thinking every day, putting pressure on myself.
*  But like I finished that match and because I hit a flying thing, we just got hammered that night.
*  I was celebrating.
*  Then the next day I have to face Lovato next week.
*  I thought, what have I done?
*  But so it's like sometimes I guess the John Jones approach, you know, having some fun the week before takes the edge off, relaxes me.
*  Ilya Toporya does that too.
*  He gets drunk on Thursday night when he weighs in on Friday.
*  That's why I don't like what he did to my man, but I respect the drinking of the wine for sure.
*  Yeah.
*  That fight.
*  I wanted to talk to you about that too.
*  I want to talk to you about just the Volkanovsky fight and training him in general.
*  Like, did you try?
*  Did you try in any way to discourage him from taking the Makachev fight on 10 days notice?
*  No, I mean, I'm not involved in that process at all.
*  You know, like I got the call that it was happening.
*  Like he called me.
*  I mean, I was jet-lagged at the time.
*  I just got into Austin for a day and I get a call at 4 a.m. from Vox.
*  He's like, I think I have Makachev booked in two weeks.
*  And I was like, fuck it.
*  Tell me I'll just book the next flight.
*  I just got on the plane down there.
*  So I'm not involved in the matchmaking decision process at all.
*  Were you apprehensive about him taking that fight on such short notice?
*  I mean, I wouldn't say apprehensive.
*  I like believe in him fully.
*  I knew it would be a very difficult challenge.
*  I didn't know what sort of shape he was in at the time.
*  I hadn't seen him for a while, but like I believe in him that he can do it.
*  And it's like I'm going to just do everything I can to get him ready for that moment.
*  And yeah, I mean, it is the risk of the game, you know, especially you take a short notice fight like that.
*  Had he been training at all?
*  I honestly don't know.
*  I don't think he like he wasn't in the same shape he was for the previous Makachev fight.
*  The previous Makachev fight I was down in Wollongong with his team freestyle for like six to eight weeks helping him prepare for that one.
*  But I mean, this one, yes, such short notice.
*  Well, that made it such a huge difference that the six to eight weeks, just the fact that he was able to survive on the ground the way he was.
*  And not just that, but just not just survive, but be completely safe.
*  He was never even close to being threatened with a submission, you know, and the fact that he was like laughing it off and punching him from behind.
*  It's crazy. Yeah.
*  I mean, I can't take too much credit for that.
*  The guy just is an animal. Yeah, he's just a monster.
*  So hard to hold down even for me to hold down.
*  I don't get it. I'm like, fuck you.
*  One forty five. This shouldn't be the case.
*  Rugby. Yes.
*  Some rugby energy.
*  Well, also, he used to weigh two hundred and fourteen pounds and you still got those fucking tendons from being a big gorilla.
*  That's true. Yeah.
*  The rugby days. That's crazy.
*  I mean, I trained when I trained at his gym.
*  One of the rugby players come in, actually, and I was just fucking around rolling with him and he put me in a chin strap and I was stuck.
*  I was like, fuck, thank God.
*  These guys make real money in other sports.
*  I have to deal with this shit.
*  Yeah, it's a hard fucking sport, man.
*  That's a hard sport that Americans don't necessarily appreciate.
*  They don't understand.
*  Like those are guys that could compete in the NFL.
*  And they said they're playing rugby because they live in a different country.
*  But it's when Volkanovsky fought the first time and he was perfectly prepared.
*  It was an amazing fight. I thought he won.
*  I thought it was very close, but I thought he won.
*  I gave I think round two was the difference and I could see round two going either way, but I gave it to Volk.
*  But I was like when when they announced it, the rematch part of me was like, oh, that's great fight.
*  But the other part of me was like, this is the number one.
*  In my opinion, this is the fight for number one pound for pound.
*  Right. I believe Volk won the first fight, although very close.
*  It's only as a robbery, but very close.
*  And I think that puts him as the number one pound for pound fighter in the world.
*  And then he loses the fight to Islam.
*  He gets caught with that head kick and then he gets knocked out by Toporia.
*  Now he's not even in the conversation anymore.
*  So this is a short amount of time, you know, and then everything kind of falls apart.
*  And I think it wouldn't have fallen apart if not for the rematch.
*  It wasn't for the if he just waited for Toporia, I think I kind of think that head kick has a factor.
*  I mean, to get brained like that with a shin to the dome, which is the worst way to get knocked out.
*  You know, it's so much power in legs.
*  I mean, your legs are you're carrying your legs are carrying your body around all day.
*  I don't think people that have never been kicked understand how much more power is in a leg.
*  Yeah, I wouldn't know.
*  You get head kicked like that and then you fight the guy who's obviously the most dangerous boxer in the division in the next fight and get KO'd.
*  I mean, yeah, it's crazy.
*  I don't know if I've had a couple of concussions from grappling like accidents, but I don't use.
*  And yeah, actually always that one asshole, you know, going crazy.
*  But I don't know really the effects of that.
*  It's so hard to judge.
*  Like, it's like, I don't know what testing they can do, but it's like they can't do much.
*  Unfortunately, they do.
*  There are some tests, but the reality is every time you get knocked out, it's easier for that person to get knocked out again.
*  And psychology, I think for the opponents like for me, coaching folks like there were matches where like even with the fights when like, say,
*  we'll take Adam in the sub and it's like when he keeps doing these impossible things, you believe in the myth of your guy more and more.
*  What other fighters do to they go?
*  Couldn't we couldn't submit him?
*  Look how deep or take his heart is just unstoppable.
*  But I think when a guy gets clipped like that, everyone else goes, they suddenly have a bit more self-belief.
*  So I think yes, it's like two factors.
*  Yeah, I think you're probably right.
*  But I think to poor you thought he was going to do that to him anyway.
*  But I would just love to have seen him fully recover from that.
*  Like when Manny Pacquiao got knocked out by Marquez, Freddie Roach wouldn't let him do anything for a year.
*  He's like, you're going to take one year off.
*  He's like, this is the only way you have to.
*  And Freddie Roach, who has trauma induced Parkinson's from his boxing career, he's well aware of the impact of brain damage.
*  And, you know, it's it's so tricky because I'm just such a huge Valk fan that I just look here.
*  I wish I had his ear.
*  I don't know if you would have listened to me.
*  But if I had his ear, I think that's what makes those guys special.
*  Those that they don't they're like, it's the self-belief.
*  100 percent. That's what makes you a champion.
*  You cannot become a Volkanovsky without this unstoppable belief in yourself.
*  Me and him are the complete opposite.
*  If someone was like, bro, you're probably going to lose.
*  I'm like, yeah, you make a good point.
*  I'm like, how much are they paying me?
*  You know, we're complete opposite.
*  And he takes everything super serious, sporting everything.
*  I don't know how we've blended together.
*  I'm able to coach him somehow.
*  Well, you're very technical.
*  I mean, the thing about your, you know, joking around and being silly about it all is like you are.
*  But your technique is very, very good.
*  Obviously, you obviously are one of the elite guys in the world when it comes to technique.
*  So it's not you are serious.
*  Yeah, I mean, personality type, you know.
*  But I guess we have the Australian Australian bond.
*  He has faith in me, more faith in me than the guy that gave me this, I think they both probably shouldn't know.
*  What is Volk up to now?
*  I think he's in Thailand training at Bang Tao with his folks, wrestling coach, Frank Heekman.
*  They have a gym in Thailand, so he's out in Bang Tao getting some work in.
*  I want to get him a grappling match.
*  I said to him, I said, man, like, if we're going to take some time away because the concussions, let's get you a grappling match.
*  And my thought was how like cool would it be to see him and Ortega have a grappling match?
*  Oh, my God, that would be incredible.
*  I would just love to see it in that setting because Ortega, obviously, struggles to submit him in MMA.
*  Yeah.
*  Let's see what happens in a grappling match.
*  Right. With no gloves, too.
*  Yeah, that would be very interesting.
*  Ortega is very good on the ground.
*  He's very sneaky, too.
*  Yes. Yeah, he's super slick.
*  He pulls, he catches some crazy shit out there.
*  He'll be losing a fight like two, three rounds, get one look at a guillotine.
*  It's crazy.
*  No, and his guillotine is fucking deaf.
*  I mean, when Volkonovsky got out of that, the mountain guillotine, his face looked like a grape and just would not tap.
*  I had no idea how he got out.
*  But I told everyone I was like, yeah, obviously, that's me by the DVD.
*  Support his grappling coach.
*  I take credit for that.
*  He's an animal.
*  Ninety nine point nine percent of the world would have tapped.
*  He's like that in the gym.
*  I remember I would choke him in the gym sometimes and he'll go from putting his chin in to taking it out as your grips in the ground.
*  As your grips in there, like you try and switch it from like, I guess, like the front choke to the to the blood vessels.
*  He just changes how you choke him and can survive down there.
*  Wow.
*  I don't know how he does it.
*  You should teach me that shit.
*  I think it's just his brain.
*  Yeah, too tough.
*  Yeah.
*  He's a fucking animal.
*  And so does he have a plan to come back?
*  Does he?
*  I don't. I don't know what's going on.
*  I imagine it's probably Holloway versus Toporia.
*  I think that's going to happen.
*  And then I hope personally, we get Vox a grappling match.
*  Maybe we get him at this event.
*  I'm hoping we get him.
*  We get some MMA guys at this event.
*  Is he thinking about doing something like that?
*  He has a whole lot of time, right?
*  When is this?
*  This is August 16th, 17th.
*  Yes.
*  Not much time.
*  But I mean, if he's in shape, he's training, he's out Bangtown, Thailand, get some rounds in.
*  I think it's fine, especially against another MMA guy.
*  They both have the same type of training.
*  You know, it's not like he's taking on a pure grappler that's only grappling.
*  So do you have a budget to do something like that, to do superfights as well?
*  Actually, yeah.
*  So we're going to start taking sponsors to try and get more superfights.
*  And I'm in talks with some legends of the game right now, like some guys that you'd be shocked.
*  Can you say?
*  I wouldn't say any names, but potentially I'll tell you.
*  Can you say the names of the rhyme?
*  One of them has a Mexican-sounded last name, but I'll talk to you about that after.
*  Okay.
*  I know that one.
*  Yeah, all the legends.
*  So many people want to come out of retirement for this.
*  I think they just know, like, especially when I explain the rules, explain that it's in that alley, like the sunken floor, you know, they like that format.
*  Obviously you throw a million dollars in Instagram, you get some messages, you know what I mean?
*  You get some, uh, Hey brother, what's going on?
*  You know?
*  Yeah. I think people are going to be shocked at how good Luke Rockhold is.
*  Yeah, he, man, he's so tough.
*  He's very good on the ground.
*  I remember when he got Weidman down and mounted him and Weidman could not get up.
*  I was like, this is his ground game is very underrated because he's just known as an MMA guy.
*  And he's going to come train with us.
*  He's going to come to beat in five weeks.
*  So he's going to prepare with us for this event.
*  So we'll watch him and Nicky Rod kill each other every day.
*  I'll love to watch that shit.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  I always wondered how he would have done if he had gone straight grappling because the people that I know that train with them said, dude, I think he could have competed with the best in the world as a grappler, just as a pure grappler.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, he look at the guys he's training with, Khabib and Islam, Cain Velasquez, DC, all those guys.
*  It's like people think it's like MMA is in isolation.
*  Like those skills won't translate.
*  They translate, especially with athletes like that, especially in such a grappling dominated camp.
*  He's going to surprise some people.
*  What I keep laughing about is like it's a million dollars for first place, 10,000 for second place.
*  I'm like, who's tapping?
*  Right. For a million dollars.
*  Yeah.
*  I think what we're going to do, I haven't finalized this yet, but I think if you're in a submission in the round ends, we keep going.
*  Get out of the submission.
*  Well, there's been so many times where guys were almost submitted where you think, yeah, this guy, I let him out of that arm bar to join the team.
*  Look at that.
*  I didn't get any money out of that.
*  How bad was his arm fucked up after that?
*  That arm bar was so tight.
*  Well, that was the funny thing, right?
*  Is that was EBI.
*  Like what's the prize of EBI?
*  Well, he had had some, if I had submitted him, I would have won 15 K and I think he had only had two submissions in regulation.
*  So he was, he only made 10 K.
*  So I like, we could have made a business still there, bro.
*  Just let it go.
*  But man, his arm popped on the day.
*  He said it was fine.
*  Next week I show up.
*  We both competing in another event again.
*  And there was like three, four locker rooms and I would just travel by myself.
*  I wouldn't even have a coach.
*  I just post an Instagram story.
*  Who can corner me for this event?
*  Like the one against Gordon, I had Denny Broker boss and he was saying 10th Planet stuff to me and I didn't even know what language he was speaking in the corner there.
*  All right.
*  So I was confused.
*  Yeah.
*  He's saying do these things.
*  I'm like, what's happening, bro?
*  And then I show up to this next event.
*  Yeah.
*  Cause I grappling in New York and of all the locker rooms, they threw me in there with the Danahoe guys.
*  And I'm just like, this is a bit weird.
*  Like I had this guy in our bar last week.
*  Then he choked me and now it's just me in a locker room with them.
*  It was very awkward, but then broke the ice and I came into training the next week.
*  And you were with them for a long time.
*  You were with them for like what?
*  Five years with Danahoe.
*  Two years, two years.
*  So what did it start before Puerto Rico?
*  Yes.
*  Yeah.
*  I lived in New York for, oh, I mean, man, my memory's hazy, but we did put it.
*  We survived Puerto Rico for six months.
*  And before that was I would come and go from New York.
*  I was probably with the team two and a half years.
*  But yeah, things get weird out there in the jungle.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, everyone's confused as to what happened with you guys.
*  That's what like there's no real version of the truth.
*  We've got a book deal.
*  We've got a movie deal coming out.
*  I'm going to exploit that story to the bitter end.
*  You have a book deal for real?
*  No, I'm joking.
*  But I could.
*  The story's weird enough.
*  What happened with you guys?
*  I mean, there's so many things we really can't discuss.
*  A lot of problems, obviously a lot of problems.
*  Obviously, two brothers split up was going to be some serious issues there.
*  But yeah, it's not really my place to say.
*  But hopefully one day it comes out.
*  I think it'll be an interesting story.
*  Who knows?
*  This shit might kick things off.
*  It might be World War III again.
*  So when you left, like, did you leave to start your own place?
*  When you guys started B Team, was that the plan all along?
*  No, I honestly never even wanted to start a gym.
*  I'd already told the guys like at Danahurst that I was like, hey, I'm going to,
*  this will be my last ADCC.
*  And then I just want to travel around, see the world, visit interesting destinations,
*  teach seminars.
*  Like I felt like I'd already built a brand.
*  But then when the team split, I felt like I sort of wanted to help them kickstart something.
*  So we came here, we started the B Team.
*  I've been with the B Team.
*  We've had the B Team two, three years.
*  But I'm not there too much anymore.
*  You know, I helped kickstart.
*  We got the gym.
*  The guys have it.
*  You know, so like I like traveling around.
*  So are you basically semi-retired?
*  For sure. Yeah, for sure.
*  I mean, obviously when you put on like, if you put on an event that pisses off every other promotion in the sport,
*  it's going to probably be hard to get mattress in the future.
*  So I'll probably compete for my own show and that's it.
*  That's the plan we want to keep doing these shows.
*  Well, I think you're going to piss off ADCC for sure by going head to head with them.
*  But I don't think it would piss off Fight Pass or Who's Number One.
*  Do you think?
*  Well, I mean, if whoever's streaming ADCC is obviously not going to be happy.
*  More competition.
*  But again, I still think long term, this story is going to grow the sport.
*  Yeah, it's an interesting story.
*  It's fun. Let's see.
*  Let's see what happens.
*  It will either be the best event ever or the fire festival.
*  I'm hoping for the former festival.
*  Are you are you besides the Gabby Garcia thing, which is, you know, no disrespect, kind of a gimmick fight.
*  Yeah, for sure. Yeah.
*  Are you done competing?
*  I'll probably do another match.
*  That's Gabby.
*  Gabby will be one day.
*  If someone's down, I'll do a match on the other day as well.
*  We'll see.
*  But I also want to leave it open because I am talking to some crazy big names and I'm like, man, if we can put that together, like I'm going to try and save some space.
*  But like, obviously, I have to run this thing.
*  I wish you could tell me some of those names on the air.
*  It's everyone you could possibly think of.
*  I'll tell you after.
*  There's a potential matchup that I'm working on.
*  That's insane.
*  It'll be the craziest shit ever.
*  Really?
*  Crazy. Yeah.
*  Want to tell me now?
*  We'll cut it out.
*  Yeah. Can we do that?
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  I'm working on.
*  Holy shit.
*  Sorry, folks.
*  You can't know.
*  Damn.
*  That would be insane.
*  That would be insane.
*  Wow.
*  Is the former, is he training?
*  Training. Yep.
*  People have said, man, he feels good.
*  It'd be like, obviously, crazy inspirational story.
*  I'd love it.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  That's insane.
*  That's insane.
*  And then it's like Abu Dhabi for a lot of people is the Olympics of grappling.
*  And one of the things is it's every two years.
*  I mean, I remember when John Jock won Abu Dhabi, I had just started.
*  I think this was like, what year was this when he started training, when he fought in Abu Dhabi?
*  Early 2000s?
*  Or mid 2000s?
*  Yeah.
*  I was thinking, I was like a blue belt at the time.
*  And when John Jock went over there, we were just so proud that he went over there.
*  And he had this advantage over a lot of the gi guys in that he only has one hand.
*  And so he never relied on grabbing collars.
*  Everything was over hooks and under hooks.
*  And he had sort of already developed a no gi game that he was applying to the gi.
*  You know, obviously, he could do all the gi techniques as well.
*  But he was more of a no gi guy in the beginning.
*  And it was so interesting watching that style, you know, watching no gi, which is if Abu Dhabi didn't do that,
*  and if they didn't have this prestigious event and make it no gi, I think the sport would have really struggled
*  because it's so hard for people to appreciate what's going on with the gi.
*  It's very slow.
*  And when you see a guy getting choked by a collar, it's just...
*  It looks silly, too.
*  Yeah.
*  But yeah, I mean, I'm so happy Abu Dhabi exists.
*  I think the inspiration for me to do ADCC was Stuart Cooper's highlight rills.
*  Like when I was coming up, like 2009, 2011, Cian Brawley, Andre Galvao's runs, like that inspired me.
*  Losing in the game more than no gi also inspired me to chase the no gi dreams.
*  But like I'm following in Eddie Bravo's footsteps.
*  You know, we both did ADCC, couldn't win it.
*  We have our own invitational.
*  But yeah, I'm thankful for everything they've done.
*  I still obviously love ADCC.
*  I wouldn't have a career as big as it is without ADCC.
*  But do you feel any loyalty to ADCC?
*  Like you're kind of fucking them, right?
*  I mean, I feel loyalty to the athletes.
*  I think like for what we do and how much bigger the sport is now, we should be compensated better, you know?
*  Like, and that's sort of why I've taken a massive risk in doing this.
*  I appreciate what you're saying.
*  But if ADC is not turning a profit, like the idea of compensating the athletes more,
*  I mean, they have essentially made stars out of so many of these athletes.
*  And by because of that, by the fact of that, they've profited.
*  But therein lies the argument.
*  And the argument is that I believe an event of that magnitude should turn a profit.
*  I'm going to do it myself and see.
*  Obviously, I could be wrong, but based on the production and the things we've paid for thus far,
*  I don't see how you couldn't run it in a profitable way.
*  Obviously, we're giving away 100 times as much for two divisions.
*  But man, like if they had even upped it to 20k, you know what I mean?
*  Let's sum token gesture like if we're going from a basketball court with 100 people in there to selling out T-Mobile,
*  like they should like if there's room for a fireworks show, there's room for drummers.
*  I feel like there should be some room in the budget for the athlete pay to increase.
*  No, that's a good argument.
*  And hopefully by forcing by this, you guys will like inspire them.
*  And the argument is about making stars like it's true.
*  It's true. You obviously get a huge platform, but you could win and not become a star.
*  You know, I know plenty of guys. We're not plenty of guys, but I know a few people that won ADCC, but really like no one knows who they are.
*  That's crazy for me is I'll go to a seminar and I'll sell out just because of just fucking gay jokes and stupid jokes all the time, you know,
*  and I'll see real champions that can't sell out a seminar.
*  So if we can make an event that those champions can make some real money and I'd be super happy.
*  Well, I think you're also your popularity has increased because people know that you coach Volkonovsky and you've worked with MMA athletes before.
*  Do you plan on still doing that?
*  For sure. Yeah, for sure. Love Volkonovsky.
*  I'll always be there for him anytime.
*  I mean, obviously MMA has got a lot of crazy individuals in there, but like to give up the time to work with the correct athletes.
*  I'll always have time for some of the real good guys out there.
*  Like obviously Izzy. Awesome. I'd always make time for Izzy. Jack Della from Perth.
*  Like guys like that, just super cool guys. I'd always find time to help him.
*  Yeah, Jack Della. What a big win he got over Gilbert.
*  I still moves off him. I remember when he went to the contender series, he hit like a Maki Kumi reversal in the first round of the contender series.
*  Fight and I was blown away by his grappling and I've been watching it since and he's reversed with Gilbert Burns. It's crazy.
*  Yeah, very crazy. I've trained with him and I'm just like, I still moves from him.
*  Like he's man, he's so good at grappling. Yeah, he's very good at striking too.
*  He's in my opinion, he's like one of the best in the sport at mixing up shots from the body to the head because so many fighters for whatever reason are head hunters.
*  You know, and because you can knock a guy out with one shot, but Jack is so good at mixing shots up to the body and to the head.
*  I mean, he just breaks guys down. Yeah, it's a scary guy.
*  I was lucky actually because before the toporio fire, we're able to sort of link up.
*  So it was like he came out to Willem Gange and trained Izzy came out at the same time.
*  So I got to watch Jack Della and Izzy mix it up and then them train with folks.
*  And for me, even as an MMA fan, it's like I have to pinch myself sometimes below.
*  Wow, that's amazing. It's just like putting on this thing when I'm talking to these guys about superfights.
*  It's the dream as just a grappling fan.
*  I'm just thinking, oh, what could we do? Who could we convince into this event?
*  You know, like just as from a pure fan perspective, it is pretty fun.
*  I'm sure it's it's going to be interesting to see whether or not this can work because a lot of people have like looked at the UFC model and said, hey, athletes should be getting paid more money.
*  And so they put on these events and none of them are profitable.
*  I mean, maybe Bellator was and they sold Bellator and then there's the PFL.
*  I don't know how they do financially, but they have the same sort of similar thing.
*  They have a tournament, the end of the tournament, the guy wins a million dollars.
*  But my point is right is like if you're an Olympic champion or if you're a UFC champion, it has so much prestige that every single person in the world knows what it is.
*  It has this intrinsic value.
*  Yeah. If you say you're an IBGF champion or an ADCC champion, a very small percentage of population know that.
*  So it's like that's case in point.
*  We put on a tournament with much more money.
*  Everyone jumps ships because they know that's money, whereas like obviously Olympic gold medal that's timeless.
*  That's that's that's crosses all sports, you know, that crosses into the culture.
*  How many guys are jumping ship? I mean, I'll tell you afterwards.
*  So is it public that they're jumping ship or are they not talking about it?
*  Well, we've got 16 sports spots in under and over.
*  And I'm navigating through who wants to be in there.
*  Sixteen spots each. So 32 total.
*  So I'm trying to navigate to the best guys we can get.
*  And it's like everyone wants in, you know, really.
*  So no one's worried about the repercussions or the blowback from ADCC now, because I think they see it as well.
*  Wow. I could get the money to show like I mean, so the Tackett brothers, local Texas guys, some of the nicest kids ever.
*  You know, and they were the first ones to reach out to me.
*  They won the trials. It's been ADCC's been their dream their entire life.
*  And they just hit me up because no one believes anything I say.
*  Unfortunately, it's like you make too many jokes.
*  Everyone's like, it's full of shit.
*  But these guys were like, man, is this real? And I was like, yeah, it's real.
*  And they're like, well, even if I have to deal with the consequences, even if I have to go back and win the trials to qualify again,
*  I want to show that a million to take and they're not even talking about themselves.
*  I want to take care of my family. And I'm like, wow, that's that's a super cool motivation to do this.
*  They're willing to risk it because they'll fight their way back in.
*  Well, I hope there's no repercussions. I hope I don't think that will be.
*  Well, we'll see. Right.
*  But I think best case scenario is that ADCC recognizes that there's competition and they have to raise up the amount of money to get the athletes.
*  And, you know, maybe it'll just elevate the profile of the sport enough so that's profitable still.
*  Yeah, it's a good experiment. Prestige versus.
*  But why do it the same weekend as them?
*  Well, you want the athletes to make a stand, you know, are they together or, you know, what is the what is the motivation here?
*  Money. Money is the motivation.
*  Money is the shot. It's sort of making a stand, but it's making a stand.
*  Money is more important than this organization that's propped up the sport for 20 plus years.
*  Well, there's other athletes that say a million dollars easy to make.
*  That guy over there? Yeah, you wouldn't.
*  It's easy for Gordon. I mean, Gordon makes a lot of money.
*  I mean, Gordon makes a lot of money from instructional.
*  It's from dominating for all these years.
*  But again, like a million for most guys.
*  I mean, you grow up in Brazil, you know, you like millions.
*  Not easy to make by any means, like especially like the instructional market is predominantly English speaking people.
*  They're the ones that are going to pay the highest price.
*  So it's like us that speak English have a huge advantage in that area.
*  Like even me personally, just for having an accent.
*  I'm a lot of Americans like, wow, he's fucking smarter.
*  That's why we use people like you for infomercials.
*  Yeah, exactly. They take it.
*  So, I mean, look, John Donahue, you throw a Kiwi accent on it.
*  He's obviously a smart guy, but that adds points for sure.
*  Are you still close to him? Do you talk to him?
*  No, we don't talk.
*  So he's upset at this.
*  I don't know. I've run into him a few times.
*  We shake hands, but you know, he's general demeanor.
*  You don't really know.
*  Like, you know, yeah, I look back when we walk past, there's no knife coming.
*  I helped him hide a few bodies in New York, you know, some missing women.
*  But we had a tight bond.
*  He's a unique character.
*  I mean, he seems like a guy from a fucking movie.
*  Like he doesn't even seem like a real guy.
*  You know, some professor of philosophy at Columbia who becomes obsessed with jujitsu, sleeps on the mats.
*  Teaches everybody and forces everybody to train 365 days a year.
*  Yeah, that's an interesting fella. Yeah.
*  What was it like doing that? Like the 365 days a year?
*  I mean, I wouldn't do it.
*  You know, I would be like, bro, we're taking a day off.
*  You know, let me have a day to relax.
*  I wouldn't necessarily do it.
*  I mean, it was a lot of training, though.
*  He can't like he wanted it to be your life, you know, like, and obviously it should be.
*  But a lot of a lot of pressure, a lot of pressure to be a part of that team.
*  Did you talk to him about that, the philosophy behind those decisions?
*  I mean, we had a lot of discussions.
*  I think like we were actually really close because I'm from he's New Zealand.
*  I'm from his part of the world.
*  So a lot of the time, Australians visit.
*  He actually has a tight connection with them because we have a lot of things we can relate on.
*  So we I mean, we talk all the time.
*  I pray, unfortunately, probably me and Nicky Ryan were two of the ones he was closest to before the team split.
*  Hmm. And when you guys were training there, how beneficial is it having a guy like him around?
*  Super beneficial.
*  And also not just because of who he is and how smart he is, but like he basically approached it like an MMA coach.
*  You know, like MMA coach is always watching, is always guiding your training.
*  Most Jiu Jitsu coaches are participating.
*  They teach you a few moves.
*  They roll with everyone.
*  Right. So to have a guy that approaches it like an MMA coach where he approaches it with that level of professionalism,
*  watching, making adjustments, I think even something as simple as that is a huge benefit.
*  Hmm. Yeah, I think so, too.
*  Also a guy who's physically impaired where he can't compete, but he has so much passion for it that he pours it all into the athletes.
*  Yeah. And I think what made him so brilliant as well is obviously his college and university.
*  He knows how to study.
*  He knows how to take notes on everything.
*  He knows how to teach.
*  You put him in Henzo Gracie's in New York for 20 years when it was the hub of MMA and grappling.
*  Guys like Hodja Gracie are passing through all the time.
*  He's basically in this position where he can just watch, train with all these guys, pick up all these details and have it locked and loaded, ready to teach in a perfect way.
*  Like obviously his game's heavily inspired by Marcelo Garcia.
*  You know, he just takes the really useful things and can articulate it in a way that's better than most of the people in the sport before him.
*  So I think there's all these factors that have made him who he is and why he's so successful.
*  How much of a factor is this, the constant training, the training of 365 days a year?
*  Like how do you balance the burnout with the discipline?
*  Like how do you like because I think inspiration is almost enthusiasm and inspiration are almost I think disciplines more important for sure.
*  But there are factors that can't be ignored because when an athlete loses inspiration and loses enthusiasm,
*  they just don't have the mental drive to push through like very difficult situations.
*  You know what I'm saying? Like you just lose the steam. You lose the engine.
*  I mean, I don't think you should do 365 a year.
*  You know, like I think you should peak for events, have a period of time afterwards where you slow down.
*  And then when you're not preparing for an event, you're studying technique.
*  When you get closer to an event, you're refining those particular techniques and skills for that particular event's rule set or opponent or whatever.
*  And we should like go up and down.
*  And like I like it when you have an event, whether you win or lose, you don't train too much after and you have this period where you miss training and you're like pulled back into it.
*  I do. And I think I mean even like obviously Gordon's had four breaks with health issues.
*  But like as long as I've known him and we train together, like there would be time periods where he wouldn't be at training for a week or two.
*  You know, so it's like I think it's like a myth we should all strive for, but everyone should be entitled to some time off.
*  Did you ever talk to John about that?
*  I mean, I would just take a day off every week.
*  But luckily, like I think he had some love for the Australians. Let me get away with some things he wouldn't let other people do.
*  So, I mean, I would be chilling.
*  Does he enforce that, like the 365 days a week?
*  I don't know if there's a real strong enforcement, but there's like an unspoken, you better be there, you know, like.
*  But I don't know who knows what it's like now.
*  Obviously he's moved to Austin. My memory is probably phasey.
*  I forgot some things, but yeah, obviously I'm super appreciative that I had.
*  I was a part of that team. But I mean, I was with like Lachlan.
*  I'm lucky I moved to Melbourne.
*  I was with Lachlan Giles for a few years.
*  I had a massive splash at ADCC 2019 and then I was with John.
*  So like I've been around some good coaches, you know, so I think a lucky position despite coming from Australia.
*  Not as lucky as others.
*  Like it would have been amazing to be like a Nicky Ryan born right next to New York and got to train with someone.
*  All the people in that team have that coaches.
*  But again, like we're all not that lucky.
*  I didn't even train with a black belt. I was already a purple belt.
*  So it's like we really, yeah, we all weren't exposed because I'm from Australia.
*  I probably came up with a time period in my city that was more like an older time in the U.S.
*  Where black belts were like, whoa, never met one.
*  What year did you start training?
*  Oh, probably 17 years ago now.
*  And even back then there weren't many black belts around?
*  No, when I started training, I just trained with my cousin and he was like a four stripe white belt.
*  There was like two people on the mats. You know, there was nothing.
*  I trained twice a week. I didn't train properly for a long time.
*  You trained twice a week?
*  Yeah, it was just like I didn't even think I didn't even know what I was.
*  You know, we just just doing it for fun.
*  Yeah, what were you doing for a living back then?
*  I was still in high school when I first started and then I was just flipping burgers at Burger King basically.
*  Then I did a psychology degree, just a bachelor's.
*  I had to work jobs, study and do jiu-jitsu.
*  So these assholes today, they get a just train. I'm so envious of them.
*  You know, like it's just the sport again, the sport's growing that much with the sponsorship deals and stuff.
*  So back then, how did you learn technique?
*  Man, I had Eddie, like here's the funny thing.
*  Eddie Bravo's Monster and the Rubber God book that came to me at a very influential time where I read the chapter about weed.
*  I was like, fuck it, maybe I should start smoking weed.
*  So like I was like thinking I'm going to learn some techniques ended up smoking weed all the time.
*  Yeah, it doesn't work for everybody.
*  It's interesting, the weed thing, because some people think it makes you lazy.
*  And I think you're just lazy.
*  I think if you if weed makes you lazy, you're lazy.
*  I just I don't I don't it makes me think about the consequence.
*  Like the idea of paranoia, like people talk about weed paranoia.
*  I think it's like a hyper awareness.
*  And, you know, anyone said this to me, like if your life is shit and you smoke weed, it's going to feel terrible.
*  But if your life is great and you smoke weed, you're going to feel good.
*  Like if you've got all you don't have any problems in your life, you know, things you're dealing with, if you've dealt with your problems and you're just like on a good path, then weeds good for you.
*  But weed has never made me lazy.
*  It's the opposite. I smoke weed.
*  I always feel like don't be lazy. Good.
*  Good. Good. Good things to do.
*  You don't want these things fucking with you.
*  You don't want these things hanging over your head like that hyper awareness.
*  It's like part of my work ethic, you know, like the like oversight, like someone is looking over me all the time, making sure I can't lie to myself or to other people.
*  I have to do the things I'm actually supposed to do.
*  That's my feeling about it.
*  Well, I mean, I read his book and I was like 17 smoking bongs, driving a training in the car, having pre workout, getting ready to go to war, you know, like that's basically influenced it out on me.
*  But it was good. I think roll it like rolling high keeps you fluent.
*  I wouldn't do all the time.
*  Sometimes I meet guys that are so high that I've just smashed them for a round, but they've done one thing, but they're so like fascinated by that.
*  Like the perceptions off sometimes.
*  I think that's possible.
*  True. That's true.
*  But I've always felt like I was like 10 percent better when I was high.
*  I really feel like that's with quite a few things.
*  You're gonna try a couple beers.
*  I'm scared. Beers don't help me.
*  Like when I play pool, if I play pool high, I play way better.
*  If I play pool drunk, I'm not good.
*  Oh, really?
*  Yeah. I think with me, alcohol just makes me not pay attention to shit.
*  Alcohol for me is like, I'm not I'm not a focused person if I'm drinking.
*  I need that for sport. That gives me a false sense of confidence.
*  That's useful.
*  Maybe one or two beers.
*  But drunk. Have you ever competed drunk?
*  I've felt it for sure.
*  You know, it's usually not be actually usually vodka soda or something.
*  So if a fan sees I'm like, that's soda water, man.
*  And you've done that many times where you just to take the edge off?
*  Five, six times.
*  I mean, I was I had a couple drinks before the Lovato match because we had the Hewler head bottle back there.
*  I was like, hey, come on, tell us some sponsorship money, you know, but sadly not.
*  Well, isn't how we're head on by Dana doesn't that was the thing.
*  I was like, go sneak us a bottle back in.
*  When you were training and you were learning from books, like, did you have any videos that you studied?
*  Was it like how did you learn techniques other than just books?
*  I mean, we I'm trying to remember what books I had, man.
*  I had like P.J. Penn's book, Eddie Bravo's book, like the actual textbooks.
*  And then I started buying the instruction.
*  I was like I had Cara Parisian's judo for M.A.
*  I had Ryan Holes.
*  He was he really changed the game with instructionals in the early days.
*  So like stealing all his moves.
*  And then I learned about the world of torrent sites and I started illegally acquiring every instruction I could.
*  And then we tried to self learn on the mats, studying these and then drilling the moves.
*  That's so I was really self taught up until Purple Bell really just focused on using instructionals.
*  And then where'd you go for Purple Bell?
*  I moved to Melbourne with Lachlan Giles and basically was like two and a half years there and then two and a half years with John.
*  That's a crazy little amount of time.
*  Yeah, I didn't spend that's the thing.
*  A lot of people obviously they just notice when you achieve something.
*  You know, so like I trained by myself a long time before I was able to join any big teams.
*  What do you think attributed to your success?
*  I think I mean, honestly, I don't know.
*  I put in the work in the early days for sure.
*  And then studying, studying, studying and then just being at the forefront of the leglock sort of.
*  You know, I got in the right time.
*  I saw techniques in the game like the beer and bolo that would just a new technique that would wipe the floor with experience black belts.
*  You could use it on people.
*  You had no business beating.
*  Those are the techniques I wanted.
*  And I saw the Danahoe guys use Hill Hooks.
*  And I was like, man, if I as a Purple Bell can submit some black belts from my fucking.
*  That's that's the way I got to go.
*  And so how did you wind up training with John and.
*  Well, I mean, I would just obviously Australia's far away.
*  Hard for us to keep doing that 16 hour journey back and forth.
*  I wanted to stay in America.
*  So I just started doing my camps there.
*  That was the best place to do it.
*  It was like 100 people in the room doing nogy.
*  Obviously, it had that DDS squad there that was awesome.
*  I was like, I'm going to go to the Danahoe focus at that time.
*  There really weren't too many places in the world that would take nogy as seriously as those guys.
*  How bad was the staff infections going around down there?
*  I got staff every month, every month.
*  How the fuck is that possible?
*  I go I got it under my eye one time and the guy was the doctor was like, well, it's right.
*  Fuck. I was like, that's reassuring.
*  Thank you.
*  But yeah, every month I was on it.
*  I remember I used to go trips to Mexico to get some medicine.
*  I used to go to the
*  I used to buy my steroids down in Mexico, too.
*  But isn't that that's probably what fuck Gordon's stomach up the steroids.
*  I mean, the I don't think the steroids help.
*  Yeah, probably probably everything.
*  Who knows? Yeah, the antibiotics definitely not good for you.
*  But when you're on antibiotics, he was on antibiotics for a year straight,
*  which first of all is crazy because the amount of discipline it takes to train that much while you're on antibiotics.
*  People don't know antibiotics wreck your cardio, just wreck your physical strength, wreck your your vitality.
*  I got staff once and I remember took antibiotics and I don't think I had ever taken antibiotics before while I was training.
*  And when I was recovering from staff, I was like, this is nuts.
*  I feel like I'm 50 percent.
*  You're at 50 percent.
*  Like when Luke Rockhold beat Chris Wideman, he was on antibiotics.
*  Take a seat. I mean, I've taken a lot during matches.
*  I've taken it a lot.
*  I've been on it all the time in the last few matches.
*  And rex you though, right?
*  Yeah, I had bad stuff in my leg.
*  Like even during the that Philip Road match.
*  I remember I submitted him and then he had stuff a few days later.
*  I was like, cut your twice, mate.
*  But that was bad when the doctor had to cut that open and like squeeze it out.
*  That was horrible.
*  But I think the more you take antibiotics, the less effect they have on you.
*  So now I get stuff. It's fucking really annoying.
*  Do you use anything to protect your skin like these defense soap or anything like that?
*  No, I just try to shower straight afterwards.
*  Just regular soap?
*  Yeah, anything.
*  I think we have some branded soap in there, but like I think it's just important.
*  Like, I mean, we're dealing with some people that don't even have a shower like that's crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  Some of them have a quick rinse. Get out of there.
*  You know, I would see guys do that when they would train and they would just go home sweaty.
*  I'm like, you're out of your fucking mind.
*  Like you're allowing that stuff to breed on your skin while you're in your car.
*  It's hot out.
*  That was Puerto Rico. We had no showers at the gym.
*  Oh, God.
*  We'd have a 60 minute drive home after each class without having a shower.
*  Oh, that's insane.
*  Not good for the car fabric smell.
*  But was the Puerto Rico gym, wasn't that exposed to sunlight at least?
*  Wasn't the mat exposed to sunlight?
*  Not enough, but you know what?
*  Because I get in the ocean every day. I think maybe that helped.
*  Oh, that probably helps a lot.
*  A lot of sunshine down there too.
*  Yeah, that probably helps a lot.
*  Sunlight on the mats apparently is a great thing.
*  Like if you could open up garage doors and have sunlight on the mats, apparently that kills a lot of things.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  I also think sometimes like the overtraining, like your immune system's just down because maybe you're stressed and sleeping.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  You're really stressed about a match.
*  A lot of people get stuff around a match because they push the training up due to the anxiety of the match.
*  They're thinking about it messes with their sleep and then they're just vulnerable to it.
*  When you were training, did you ever monitor your heart rate, check your heart rate in the morning, make sure you're not overtraining?
*  You know, I thought about doing that stuff, that HRV stuff.
*  You thought about it.
*  I looked up one of the machines at the time.
*  I was like, fuck, that's expensive.
*  I mean, now I don't monitor anything.
*  I get my blood pressure checked.
*  It's concerning.
*  You know, I almost failed the last two medicals because the doctor was like, bro, your blood pressure is through the roof.
*  Really?
*  I was like, pass it, man.
*  It's not MMA.
*  Why would your blood pressure be so high?
*  Good question.
*  Probably too much caffeine.
*  Think that's it?
*  I don't know.
*  We should find out, but I'm busy traveling all the time.
*  I should look into it.
*  You don't know what's wrong?
*  Oh, you freaked me out.
*  My blood pressure was high.
*  Now you're freaking me out.
*  We tested after.
*  I mean, I just feel like...
*  I've got to survive for this shit.
*  I understand, but you're relying on your body.
*  That's your business.
*  Your business is your body.
*  I just hope it's a faulty test.
*  Faulty test for blood pressure?
*  I think those things are 100%.
*  I'm like, the biceps too big.
*  Get a bigger band.
*  I don't think they're ever wrong with blood pressure.
*  I mean, there's factors.
*  You can be stressed out.
*  That'll raise up your blood pressure.
*  I was making jokes with the doctor last time.
*  I was making jokes with the doctor last time.
*  I competed in Dubai, and I was making jokes with him, and he was just not laughing at all.
*  He's not having a day.
*  The Mexican doctor for karate combat loved it, but not the Dubai guy.
*  Oh, that's funny.
*  I faced a...
*  You know the guy in the UFC that finished Kevin Lee real quick, Hinat?
*  He finished Kevin Lee like...
*  He knocked him down, guillotined him in a minute.
*  Oh, the last guy.
*  Yeah, his last fight.
*  I can't remember his last name.
*  Renat, Renat.
*  I can't remember his name.
*  He was crazy though, man.
*  He did not want to tap.
*  I had him buggy chugged, put him in a triangle.
*  There it is.
*  Renat...
*  Say that.
*  Fakeredov?
*  Go for it.
*  Give his middle name a crud.
*  Fakredinov.
*  Fakredinov.
*  His middle name's tougher, though.
*  Yeah, wow.
*  Ryashtevich?
*  He's just like, how can I fucking make Bruce Buffer's life difficult, eh?
*  Yeah, bro.
*  Buffer's got it rough.
*  I got it rough on the...
*  I fuck up all the time on the weigh-ins when I have to do the weigh-ins.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Do they get angry with you?
*  Does anyone get angry?
*  No.
*  Luckily, no one's gotten angry at me, but it's always a mistake.
*  I've fucked up a few times.
*  It's hard.
*  Those words are hard.
*  Sometimes your mouth just doesn't work right.
*  It just doesn't come out right.
*  I fucked up Umar Nurmagomedov's name once after his fight.
*  I was like, God damn it.
*  It just came out like...
*  I can't even say it now.
*  Hey.
*  Zabit was the hardest.
*  Magomed Sharipov?
*  Yeah.
*  Zabit Magomed Sharipov.
*  That was a guy that I...
*  Fuck, man.
*  He's just a bitch.
*  I was really bummed out when he stepped out, when he just decided enough's enough.
*  I think he's a doctor now.
*  Really?
*  I think so.
*  Find out what he's doing.
*  Zabit Magomed Sharipov.
*  That guy was fucking good, man.
*  He did some cool shit, yeah.
*  Ooh, he did some wild shit.
*  He was so interesting because he was from Dagestan, but he fought like a...
*  You know, almost like a karate fighter.
*  Yeah, crazy kicks.
*  Yeah, wild kicks, man.
*  And he could do anything.
*  I mean, crazy trips, too.
*  He would do that trip.
*  Oh yeah, he sort of made the way with that now.
*  Like, Vokes does that.
*  Let a guy try to do that one.
*  Yeah, he was very good at that one particular trip.
*  He's just so clever.
*  So clever and creative and such an interesting fighter to watch.
*  I was bummed out, man.
*  Like, really bummed out when that guy retired.
*  I was like, shit.
*  That's why I love traveling around finding these guys, like these mysterious guys.
*  Like, I was in Japan.
*  I could have dinner with Genki Sudo.
*  Ah, I love that dude.
*  That's the coolest guy ever.
*  Genki Sudo was the man.
*  He's like a politician now.
*  I know.
*  He's done it all.
*  Remember when he used to carry around that flag with all the flags and we are all one?
*  What a beautiful guy.
*  So cool, man.
*  So cool.
*  Like, win a fight and then hold this up.
*  Like, we are all one.
*  And then he just retired to pursue becoming a pop star and now he's a politician.
*  He was a pop star?
*  Yeah, he owns restaurants.
*  Yeah.
*  Have you seen his dancing videos?
*  No.
*  What's it called?
*  I imagine a guy who fights that good could probably dance like a motherfucker.
*  Crazy dancing.
*  Genki Sudo 1, I forget the name of it.
*  Like, dancing, montage, singing, he does it all.
*  No shit.
*  Wow.
*  I'm not surprised.
*  He's a creative guy.
*  He was creative as a fighter too.
*  Very interesting fighter to watch.
*  He retired and like, he became a pop star to grow in popularity.
*  Like, even fighting wasn't his focus.
*  He just wanted to leverage fighting and becoming a pop star to help him get into politics,
*  to help people.
*  He really just wants to help people.
*  So those were side gigs to get him to where he is today, where he can use his political
*  influence to help people in Japan.
*  Wow.
*  That is amazing.
*  Does he?
*  Look at him.
*  Is this him dancing?
*  Oh yeah.
*  Genki.
*  First pitch with the...
*  He's got first pitch with all his dudes behind him.
*  Oh, a terrible pitch.
*  Yeah, soft throw.
*  Wow.
*  That's pretty cool.
*  He had some crazy...
*  Man, back in that West Side Grappling Tournament, he was hitting some moves back then.
*  Oh yeah, man.
*  Innovative today.
*  Yeah.
*  Wild, explosive, interesting guy.
*  Just very interesting.
*  I mean, that's the kind of thing about the sport that's so cool, is that you get these
*  human beings that are just exceptional human beings that decide to challenge themselves
*  and one of the most difficult things a person can do.
*  Like Volkonosky, he's a very interesting guy because it takes extreme character and
*  will and discipline to become Alexander Volkonosky, the greatest featherweight of all time.
*  I mean, it takes a lot to be that person.
*  And you learn a lot just by being around those people.
*  You learn about human potential.
*  Yeah, I mean, I even learned grappling from these guys.
*  People think I show up and I'm just helping them.
*  Those guys are so talented.
*  I steal shit from them as well.
*  I don't know how they do it all.
*  Vox does it all.
*  What have you learned from Vox?
*  I mean, just the way, like I really steal a lot from MMA fighters and how they turtle
*  and get up from there.
*  A lot of grapplers don't understand that until they roll with a good MMA guy and the guy
*  just keeps getting up and they're like, what is happening?
*  Like Derek Lewis?
*  Yeah, they just get up.
*  He just stands up.
*  I love that.
*  I stole that from an instructional name, Just Stand Up.
*  And I was like, Derek Lewis inspired.
*  You did do that, right?
*  You did make a whole instructional about getting up.
*  Yeah.
*  Is it because some guys get just too captured with the idea of engaging and grappling and
*  not getting out?
*  Yeah.
*  Well, like if a guy gets his guard passed, the judo guy would just look to get guard
*  back.
*  Whereas sometimes it's good to expose your back and just stand up and reset.
*  Whereas a lot of judo guys are so scared to expose their back, they refuse to ever do
*  it.
*  So it's like when an MMA guy does it, they don't know how to deal with it.
*  They're not as good at dealing with it.
*  It's foreign to them.
*  Interesting.
*  Yeah.
*  Because you don't think about it.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, it's always like when you have new variabilities, new variables, new variables into any sort
*  of fighting discipline.
*  Like, oh, this is a new thing that I didn't consider.
*  Yeah, I love that.
*  Like, that's why I love bad jujitsu.
*  Jujitsu can be more complicated.
*  MMA is a bit more simple.
*  So it's like we can make all these instructions in jujitsu about these weird positions like
*  octopus, guard and stuff.
*  Because you can be endlessly creative.
*  Whereas in MMA, the consequences are so strong, severe.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  So it's not a simple game.
*  It doesn't mean it's easier.
*  There's just less things you can do.
*  Well, that's what's interesting is that guys in MMA in general aren't as good at submissions
*  because they have all these other disciplines to consider.
*  It's like when I went from taekwondo to kickboxing, one of the things that I realized like, oh,
*  when people are punching you in the face, there's a lot of stuff you can't do.
*  But if people aren't punching you in the face, damn, you get good at kicking.
*  And so these guys who are used to getting punched in the face, there's stuff that they're
*  just not, they don't have the dexterity, they don't have the ability to do.
*  And I don't know if you develop that to the same extent.
*  Like when you see guys like Wonderboy, who started out with karate, like that guy can
*  do stuff with his legs that the average person can't do.
*  Or Yair.
*  Yair Rodriguez is one of them.
*  That's crazy.
*  Oh my God, that guy.
*  He's one of my favorite guys to watch because his fucking kicks are crazy.
*  They just come from everywhere.
*  Who's he fighting next?
*  That's a good question.
*  Did he just fight, he just fought, saw Tegra in his last fight?
*  I believe, was that his last fight?
*  Let's say pull up Yair Rodriguez.
*  But let's just find out what Yair Rodriguez's next fight is.
*  I don't know if they've announced it.
*  I haven't heard anything.
*  Yeah, it's funny when you're in the, when you friends with a bunch of MMA fighters,
*  sometimes they let you know of a fight that's not been announced.
*  You're like, fuck, I better not say.
*  Right.
*  Better not drop the news, get in trouble.
*  Yeah, that happens all the time.
*  Yeah, I fuck up a few times.
*  Does it say?
*  Nothing booked.
*  Was Ortega his last one?
*  Yes.
*  Yeah.
*  So he lost Ortega.
*  And before that Volkanovsky, Volkanovsky beat his ass.
*  That was a, that was a prime Volkanovsky display.
*  Yeah, that was crazy.
*  That man, yeah, he just, he's just so strong.
*  He's a mauler.
*  Outmuscled him in the clinch.
*  And we worked on a bunch of stuff because of how dangerous Yair's guard is.
*  Like he, he's got a dangerous guard and we had to overcome the fact that like,
*  if you leave space against him, he throws elbows that cut you.
*  Right.
*  So it's like we had to navigate those areas.
*  And really it was good.
*  Like a training Vox for a guy like Yair is awesome because when he's on bottom,
*  there's like a big contingent of Mexican MMA fighters that have really dangerous guards.
*  Diego Lopez trains there.
*  I think he's from Manaus originally, but he trains a bunch of guys there.
*  And just aggressive bottom game where if you leave space, they throw elbows.
*  And if you're close, they're trying to set up high guards and submissions.
*  So it's like, we really had to prepare for how dangerous he is there.
*  He's one of the front runners in my opinion.
*  Diego, first of all, how the fuck does that guy make 145?
*  Shredded, yeah.
*  He's huge.
*  He's just finishing everyone, hey.
*  He's so dangerous, man.
*  You know, who did he fight?
*  Super Siddique?
*  Yousef in his last fight?
*  He stopped him in the first round.
*  Before that fight, I was telling everybody, I was like, I think this guy's the guy.
*  I think he's the next guy to emerge.
*  I wonder who he's booked against.
*  I remember his first fight was like short notice against...
*  Mosvar, Yves-Loev.
*  I thought he won.
*  It was very close.
*  And Mosvar is undefeated and one of the best guys in the division.
*  But Diego's scary.
*  It's not just that he's good, he's fucking scary.
*  He's intense.
*  From everywhere, like submissions, knockouts.
*  Submissions, knockouts, and his fucking stand-up is horrific.
*  Yeah, Yair, just climb Mount Everest.
*  Jesus Christ, Yair.
*  That's the most recent thing I can say.
*  Fucking relax, bro.
*  He's so tough.
*  It doesn't even look like he's fucking wearing anything warm.
*  He's out bird watching.
*  Look at him.
*  He's got a fucking giant pack on.
*  Walking around, rucking.
*  That's a good way to develop some cardio, I'll tell you that.
*  It looks fun, but I definitely want someone else to hold the bag, hey.
*  No, that's how you get the cardio.
*  You have to carry the bag on your back.
*  That's the whole idea.
*  He can't...
*  He can't...
*  That looks fun.
*  What are the guys that help you up the mountain?
*  Those guys.
*  Yeah, the Sherpas.
*  Yeah, but I think he's trying to get fit.
*  I think that's the whole idea behind it.
*  It's interesting when a guy like that is just so good at one area, which is kicking, and
*  very good off his back submission, but then struggles in a couple other areas.
*  He's almost there.
*  He's right there at the tippy top, but not quite at the level of the guys that are beating him.
*  Remember when he lost to Frankie?
*  Came back from that and just become a much better fighter.
*  Much better fighter.
*  People counted him out a couple times, and he almost reinvented himself, surprised people.
*  That happens so often.
*  People counted out Max Holloway.
*  Max Holloway, the last fight with Volk, Volk dominated, and Max just said, hey, that was his night.
*  He had a great night, and that is a fact of fighting, too.
*  Sometimes a guy will clip you in the first round, and you're kind of not the same, but if he didn't clip you, maybe you would have won.
*  Maybe if you just engage Max Holloway, he gets caught with that jump spinning back kick to the nose at the end of the first round.
*  Shattered his nose.
*  That's a big factor.
*  Doesn't land that.
*  Who knows?
*  Fight was a fucking amazing fight still, even with that shattered nose.
*  Crazy.
*  I was in Dubai for karate combat, and I was watching that at the breakfast buffet with all the staff at the buffet at the hotel.
*  I was like, everyone, we're all going crazy.
*  I brought the laptop down, eating omelets, and it was the craziest fight ever.
*  It was the craziest fight ever.
*  In the last 10 seconds, when Max points to the floor, a fight that he's winning, four rounds to one, crazy.
*  To just call the guy out.
*  We've got to do that in Jiu Jitsu, like give each other a leg, let's fucking go.
*  I don't think that's the same.
*  We just both get broken?
*  Well, that's an interesting thing about the EBI rules.
*  How do you like those rules?
*  The rules where when it goes to overtime, you start either on a person's back or you start from what they call spiderwebs, just side control, trying to get an arm.
*  I like anything creative like that that's going to force people to train those different areas.
*  But the majority of the sport, especially old school guys, don't like it.
*  It's very difficult to get them to compete under those rules.
*  Me, personally, I like any rule set I can beat a guy in.
*  So I had Felipe Pena match, and the UFC Fight Pass guys were like, oh, what rule set should we do?
*  I was like, I think EBI is pretty good.
*  But I like the rule set strategically against particular opponents.
*  But I like Kyle Bames, him playing a guy, one of the best overtime guys in the world.
*  If I had a match with him, I'd be like, nah, we'll just do a regular rules match.
*  So it's sort of strategy based.
*  Right, based on the opponent's strengths.
*  Like even Nikki wrote against Gordon, they went to OT and it was fucking close.
*  And it's like, that is very stressful.
*  It's exciting. It's exciting.
*  But if guys get submitted in those areas, sometimes people don't consider it real, even though it is.
*  They're like, oh, it's an overtime victory.
*  You didn't really submit him, but you did.
*  Right. When Nikki grabbed that foot.
*  It just fucking ripped it, eh?
*  I mean, how bad is his leg fucked up still?
*  You got to think, like, that's doing some damage.
*  I just think like what was hilarious about that is like he was meant, Gordon's meant to face Vinny Margules.
*  And no disrespect to Vinny, Vinny's just at a later stage of his career, right?
*  Vinny, when he was young, was a monster.
*  Was incredible.
*  And then it's like two days before they flipped the script and you got Nikki wrote.
*  And you know what I mean?
*  And I just can just picture him just getting his foot broken, being like, what the fuck?
*  What the fuck just happened, you know?
*  When I watched it, I was like, Jesus Christ, that is a lot.
*  And Nikki is such a gorilla.
*  It was loud. So loud. It was like you heard the snap, eh?
*  Sometimes, though, you get popped and it's so fast that the damage is already done.
*  And you're just like, well, it's already injured. Let's keep going.
*  You know? Right.
*  But obviously some of the submissions are holding tension points slowly breaking.
*  But the ones that are quick, sometimes guys don't tap because it's like you didn't even have time to process it.
*  What about the one with you and Vinny where you broke his leg?
*  That was disgusting. Yeah.
*  That still haunts me.
*  But yeah, I don't know why.
*  How the fuck did he keep going? Why did he keep going?
*  But that's just it. You got to be careful what shit talk you say.
*  Like I try to be careful with what I say.
*  I'm never going to be like leg locks don't work because he got put in a leg lock in 20 seconds and his leg broken.
*  It's like now you committed to the bit, you know, like was he saying leg locks don't work?
*  Leg locks don't work. And then his leg exploded.
*  And I'm like, that's such a crazy thing to say.
*  Leg locks don't work. It's because he had had matches with Gary and Gordon and they got some pops on him, but he hadn't submitted.
*  So maybe they laid the groundwork for me.
*  But I think it spiral fracture of his fibula.
*  Oh, God. Yeah. Disturbing.
*  Oh, that was where I was like, bro, I wouldn't let that happen for a million.
*  I don't know how much Charles Sonnen's paying you, but it must be more than me.
*  I just think it's his pride.
*  You know, just didn't want to tap.
*  The fact that he kept going after the leg snap, that was loud.
*  That was yeah, that was that.
*  And the second one, I saw the bone poking into the skin.
*  Like if I'd kept going, it would have probably like his whatever bone fracture would have come out.
*  Yeah. Oh, God.
*  I was nervous. I was like, bro, is this guy waiting for overtime?
*  Like he just didn't want to tap.
*  But then the ref called it because his leg was dangling.
*  I did the first heel hook.
*  And then the second one, I baited him where I pretended like I was going for his other leg.
*  So he gave me the bad one again.
*  But he was laughing. He was like, fuck, I couldn't have you broke both my legs.
*  It's like Monty Python.
*  Oh, my God. So you knew it was already broken.
*  Well, so my foot hit the ground at the exact second his leg snapped in half.
*  So for a second, like I felt a little bit of crunching, but I didn't hear it.
*  Everyone else in the room heard it.
*  And then he gets out of it.
*  And I was just like, wow, this fucking guy's flexible.
*  And then he says to me, I think he broke my leg.
*  Oh, no. He said it in the middle of the match.
*  We stopped talking.
*  And I'm just like, what's happening here?
*  How strange.
*  And I was like, you want to keep going?
*  All right.
*  And he gave like I ended up back with the same leg.
*  Oh, and it was just no resistance.
*  His ankle just did a full just kept going.
*  See if you can find that, Jamie.
*  That's this horrible.
*  That was the one that was the most disturbing jujitsu match I've ever watched.
*  Yeah, I just I just couldn't understand.
*  Like I was just like, bro, why are you making me do this?
*  Yeah, please tap.
*  You giving me?
*  I remember watching it like with this look on my face like, don't fucking.
*  I just felt bad for him because he's a fucking good guy.
*  And I was just like, man, did you not tap because you said leg locks don't work?
*  We like committed to it was quick, though.
*  It was a quick break.
*  Doesn't he still have a plate in there?
*  Honestly, I don't know.
*  But he came back and competed against Mason Fowler like maybe four or five months later.
*  That's crazy.
*  And it's just like you get some mileage on the body there, bro.
*  Yeah.
*  Is it worth it?
*  I mean, better than the tibia, I guess the fibula.
*  I cracked my fibula before.
*  It's not as bad as a small bone, you know, and they can just let it fix, you know, let it heal up once they screw it together.
*  I wouldn't let it break.
*  I'm like, oh, yeah, the noise is bad.
*  I've broken a few legs and I'm just like, well, so here it is.
*  Is this before there's the first ones of the breaks at the start of my.
*  So his legs already broken here.
*  If you go to like 20 seconds, yeah, that right there.
*  So we hit like a 50 50 invasion.
*  You hear that knee down and pull this leg out.
*  So you hear it's actually in a little bit deep.
*  Oh, dude.
*  Yeah.
*  So look at this.
*  Oh, dude, you hear it.
*  Oh, look at his foot.
*  Look where his foot is.
*  And then he tries to get me.
*  Why I let go of it because I was like, I do not know.
*  I do not know how he got out of his leg break and then me just out for the rubber guard.
*  I guess we got rubber knee.
*  He's huge here, too.
*  That was one of Craig's best positions and he got to it with it.
*  The sound is so awful.
*  The sound of broken bones.
*  I've never I never get like Chris Wideman when he fought Uriah Hall through that.
*  Like it was like full power and Uriah checked it.
*  And you see snap, you hear the snap and he sees his leg bend over like, oh,
*  that's where it's like it's crazy how people react to that shit where Conor McGregor is still just talking shit.
*  That's fucking hilarious to me.
*  I'm just like, he's such a psychopath.
*  Never Mr. Mike.
*  We didn't even have the painkilling whistle yet, but he was ready for some.
*  Did you see him partying like a night or two ago?
*  You reckon real?
*  I mean, it doesn't mean he's drinking.
*  He's vibing.
*  He's his wife.
*  He's got his shirt off.
*  Looks like he's having a good time.
*  I mean, it looked like he wasn't sober, but he could just be a fucking maniac.
*  It's mind games, though.
*  Maybe it could be that.
*  Yeah.
*  That's why I did with Lovato's kept talking about how his party and all the time and I was but I was like, maybe it's going to mess with you.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Right. Right. Right.
*  So here's Conor.
*  He's kissing his wife.
*  He's throwing.
*  He took his shirt off.
*  He's getting crazy.
*  But I mean, he could just be enthusiastic.
*  I don't know.
*  It looks a little fucked up.
*  Listen, I saw Roadhouse.
*  He ain't that good actor.
*  Shane Gillis has an amazing bit about Roadhouse.
*  You have to see it.
*  Oh, really?
*  It's so fucking funny.
*  He's a legend.
*  I want to get him involved in this.
*  I want to get some comedians commentating just shit talking the grappling world.
*  You know?
*  Oh, that's funny.
*  We'd have to get guys who know some grappling.
*  Joey Diaz.
*  Joey Diaz would be amazing.
*  Surprise interviews on people.
*  I think it'd be fucking.
*  Oh, he would be amazing.
*  Well, he wouldn't do interviews, I don't think.
*  He wouldn't be good at that.
*  But he'd be good at like commentary.
*  Get him in the booth.
*  Just confusing.
*  Yeah.
*  Get him talking shit.
*  Yeah.
*  Fucking people's names up.
*  I'll get him to corner me against Gabby.
*  He might do it.
*  He might do it.
*  He might do it.
*  You never know.
*  I cornered Higgin in Abu Dhabi.
*  Oh, you did?
*  In 2003.
*  He didn't have anybody with him.
*  Oh, really?
*  He said, Joe Hogan.
*  He said, you take the, just tell me when the time.
*  Because Higgin had been training that much.
*  Wasn't in the best shape.
*  Just let me know what time.
*  I was just yelling out what the time is.
*  Yeah, that's what I say sometimes.
*  If I don't have a, like if I'm the slave, just let me know the time.
*  Yeah.
*  Let me know if you think I'm burning too much gas or I'm too relaxed.
*  You know, I'm like, that's the key here.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  Having Joey Diaz in your corner would be fucking hysterical.
*  Alex Jones wanted to do it, but I'm like, oh.
*  That's a lot.
*  That's a tough guy to get involved with the charity.
*  Our foundation, with my business partner, Seth, our foundation is called the Fair Fight
*  Foundation.
*  I'm just like, it's probably not good to start it with fighting a woman, but it's a bold move.
*  Well, that's a fair fight though.
*  She's so big.
*  I mean, she might outweigh you by, what do you walk around at?
*  205.
*  She got a few pounds on me for sure.
*  At least 40.
*  Last night we were video calling each other and we were both taking Anova.
*  And I was like, I popped a 50 and she popped a 25.
*  I was like, you need more than that to beat me, you pussy.
*  I took some screenshots.
*  Hey, I don't know if I'll release it.
*  That's hilarious.
*  Yeah.
*  I should talk her to get the contract signed.
*  You should have Joey Diaz do commentary for that fight.
*  That would be the perfect fight for him to do commentary for.
*  Yeah, just commentate.
*  Yeah, because Joey does jiu-jitsu.
*  He knows a little bit.
*  He definitely knows positions and he talks so much shit.
*  He's just so hilarious.
*  I'm going to take it serious, but I am going to come out in a white tank top smoking a cigarette, probably.
*  I'll put it on the corner of the mat and see if I can finish her before it finishes.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, having something like that would definitely be an added element of fun.
*  Some fun.
*  The tournament's serious.
*  Obviously, you guys are going to be killing each other.
*  And then a bit of entertainment, you know?
*  A bit of a battle of the sexes, I guess you could say.
*  Definitely that.
*  Sort of.
*  A battle of the enhanced sexes.
*  Yeah, who's more enhanced?
*  Yeah, she is.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  I got to know her stack.
*  I wish what I wanted to do was run an event where we drug tested, but it was anonymous.
*  And just for my own personal enjoyment, I want to see who took the most of anything.
*  See if there's any Hallow testing in there or something.
*  It would be fun to see because jiu-jitsu is an open steroid using event.
*  Have you heard of the Enhanced Games?
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, I was reading about that.
*  I'm having those guys on.
*  So the Enhanced Games is this, they're going to allow all the athletes to take performance enhancing drugs.
*  And the idea is we should have athletes perform to the best way, I mean, I'm putting words in their mouth, but that's scientifically possible.
*  And the best way, scientifically possible is like, here's for instance, this Ryan Garcia fight.
*  Ryan Garcia, he beats Devin Haney spectacular fashion, looks amazing, pops for Osterine, very low doses of Osterine,
*  which are not going to affect him in terms of performance enhancing ability during the fight itself.
*  I don't know how he took it or what he took it.
*  I know people have gotten Osterine accidentally.
*  Sugar Sean O'Malley got it through tainted supplements.
*  They proved it.
*  It's more than once that's happened.
*  Yoel?
*  Yoel.
*  Yoel sued, he won.
*  Yeah, which is if you think anybody would not be fucking natural with that guy.
*  How does he still look like he does?
*  The Cuban fucking athlete program.
*  That's how.
*  He's grappling.
*  He's taking a grappling match in Britain against a grappler Owen Lovesey.
*  So we'll see him have a grappling match.
*  Owen's a beast.
*  That's very interesting.
*  Who do you think takes it?
*  That's a good question.
*  It's a very good question.
*  I mean, Yoel was one of the very best Cuban wrestlers ever.
*  I mean, he's a fucking tank.
*  Yeah, silver medal at the Olympics, Adam Sietaf beat him, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, I mean, he's a monster man.
*  And physically, he's just such an imposing force.
*  Like Luke Rockhold said that it hurt.
*  And Robert Whitaker said the same thing.
*  He said it hurts when you hit him.
*  It's like he's made out of metal.
*  It probably hurts when he kisses you as well.
*  After he knocks you out?
*  Yeah.
*  That was rough.
*  That's a rough way to go.
*  Well, you know, Luke likes to talk shit.
*  And you talk shit to that guy.
*  I love you.
*  He did the salsa dancing for the press conference.
*  That was the best, too, picking women out of the crowd.
*  You don't want to take your missus.
*  You'd be like, fuck it, and sit back down.
*  I know.
*  Exactly.
*  That guy's such a fucking animal.
*  I mean, I really wish he'd gotten into MMA earlier in his career.
*  It would have been amazing to see.
*  Because I think when he entered the UFC, he was in his late 30s.
*  Yeah, he's like 46.
*  He's 46 now.
*  That's crazy.
*  And he still looks amazing.
*  That's Randy Katoa.
*  Yeah, but like he doesn't look 46.
*  Like Randy looked like a strong 46-year-old.
*  I need that Cuban stack.
*  Yeah.
*  His stack is not.
*  I mean, I've told this story before for people that have heard it.
*  I'm sorry.
*  But one of the things that happened to Yoel when he got injured, he fought in the UFC.
*  And then they brought him to a doctor.
*  He had an orbital fracture and some other issues.
*  They brought him to the doctor.
*  And the doctor said to the UFC, he said, where did you get this guy?
*  And he's like, yeah, he's amazing, right?
*  He goes, no, you don't understand.
*  He goes, I've never seen a human being like this before.
*  The tendons in his eyes are three times larger than a normal person's.
*  He said his orbital bone is already healing.
*  So this guy's a freak.
*  How do I get to that level?
*  I think you got to be born in Cuba.
*  And they start messing around.
*  They've got those shitty convicts genetics from Australia.
*  I think it's, I just wonder what they do in Cuba for their athletes.
*  Do you know what I'm saying?
*  I mean, without casting any aspersions in terms of performance enhancing
*  supplements, there's only one way to find out.
*  Yeah, go there.
*  Ask them.
*  I don't know.
*  You know, I don't know what they did.
*  But I mean, the guy's like Wolverine, but he's also a genetic specimen.
*  I mean, there's only so much you could do with steroids.
*  I mean, that guy, I know I've tried.
*  You don't even live weights, which is so crazy.
*  You're taking steroids without lifting weights.
*  I mean, from time to time, you know, just not good lifting program.
*  A few pull ups here and there.
*  Yeah, but that's not, I don't think steroids are going to, well,
*  they're going to help you recover and train.
*  Yeah, it definitely helped your well-being, I think.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, if you're training 365, that's the argument, right?
*  If you're training 365 days a year, like, and that's also the argument for like
*  Tour de France, you know, I've heard it argued from people that really are
*  experts that you're actually healthier to take steroids and performance
*  enhancing drugs to do Tour de France than you are without it.
*  Because your body just can't recover without it.
*  It's just so grueling.
*  It's such a brutal race.
*  There's a reason why so many of them are blood doping.
*  So many of them are taking EPO and testosterone.
*  I always wanted to try EPO.
*  I actually like, some people criticize me for saying I take steroids and jujitsu,
*  but my, like, the way I look at it is the kids, the next generation,
*  they're going to take it anyway.
*  I at least want to put out, I put out my exact stack and I just want to send it
*  out as almost like, it's like drugs, just say no doesn't work.
*  It's like, I want to let them know I'm taking a safe amount of the doctor's
*  guidance and that it's not a mystery where they're thinking like,
*  I have to take pump one gram a week and all this stuff to compete at a high
*  level.
*  So it's like a middle ground.
*  Obviously you get criticized for it, but it's like, the other option is they
*  don't know what a high level athlete's taking and they fucking ruin their
*  body taking crazy dosages.
*  Well, it would be interesting, like, what would jujitsu look like if
*  steroids weren't legal?
*  I mean, one of the things we found out when you saw it, it came into the UFC,
*  even though there was previous drug testing, it was really only during the
*  weigh-ins, which is kind of just an intelligence test.
*  That's all it is.
*  Like when you look at Alistair Overeem versus Brock Lesnar, the idea that
*  either one of those motherfuckers is clean is crazy talk.
*  That's crazy talk, especially Alistair.
*  I mean, Alistair was, he fought, when he fought 205, when he fought, look at
*  like back when he fought Chuck Liddell at 205 and then look at him at 265, he
*  gained 60 pounds.
*  And he looks like a fucking superhero.
*  Overeem, like those days, like when he won the K-1 Grand Prix and when he beat
*  Brock Lesnar.
*  Yeah, not to have had a heart and stuff.
*  Oh my God.
*  I love it when they said the old days was an intelligence test because many
*  guys still failed that intelligence test.
*  Well, you know what it is, you know how it is.
*  Like you're in gyms, you have gym bros that are coaching you, they don't
*  really know what the fuck they're talking about, but they say a lot of
*  good big words.
*  Yeah.
*  And you go, oh, this guy knows how to pass a test.
*  And you rely on these meatheads to try to pass a test.
*  You need a Vic Tecante on the line, hey.
*  Well, there's people that have those people.
*  I'm sure there's people, I'm just guessing, just throwing it out there.
*  But I don't think everyone's clean.
*  I think there's probably some really, there's so much money involved in MMA
*  now.
*  There's probably some really sophisticated scientists that are working
*  with elite athletes and they're developing protocols that are either
*  undetectable or they have a short lasting, like, which is probably why you
*  saw it wakes you up at 6 o'clock in the morning.
*  You know, the idea is like to catch you while it's still in your system if
*  you have short acting stuff that's.
*  Yeah, like a test propionate or something like the water based.
*  Yeah.
*  Like, weren't they doing that in baseball?
*  They were taking like testosterone gummies.
*  And the idea is that they metabolize so quickly that you get the effect of
*  them, but then they're out of your system by the time you get tested.
*  I tried those, tasted like shit, you know.
*  I don't know if they did anything.
*  I mean, it's fucking gummy with testosterone and how could it taste good?
*  Throw it out of the tongue.
*  What does it taste like?
*  Just bad.
*  Hey, like chemical.
*  Yeah.
*  Like it's just there a while.
*  I remember I was trying to get legal steroids in Australia when I was coming
*  up and I just couldn't do it.
*  They just, my doctor gave me the testosterone gummies.
*  I was like, fuck this shit.
*  It's like, I felt like it wouldn't work in Australia was what are the laws
*  like?
*  I mean, here any, I think any GP can prescribe testosterone in Australia.
*  In Australia, you have to be like an endocrinologist.
*  They added a layer to it and it's hard to see an endocrinologist that's going
*  to give testosterone to a young healthy dude, you know.
*  Guys back there would do all sorts of crazy shit.
*  Like they're not sleeping for a couple of days.
*  They're beat off a bunch of times, try and crash the levels, go get the blood
*  check.
*  Doctor's like, oh, your test is low.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, another thing, the problem with a test being low, this is what they found
*  with when they did it, they had testosterone use exemptions in the UFC for a
*  brief amount of time, a few years.
*  And those are the Vitor Belfort years, you know.
*  And the problem is when a guy's done steroids his whole life, his endocrine
*  system is fucked up already.
*  So you go in there and they test your testosterone levels and you're like, wow,
*  your levels are super low.
*  Like you need testosterone.
*  I'm like, thank you.
*  But the reason why they're low is because you've been on steroids your whole
*  life.
*  Yeah, your body doesn't make it anymore.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, you went, you look at Vitor from the early days, like Vitor in UFC 12
*  when he fought Scott Ferozo and Trey Tellegman, he weighed like 200 pounds.
*  You know, they used to call him Vitor Gracie back then.
*  Victor Gracie.
*  I was training at school.
*  Why'd they throw the C in there?
*  I don't know.
*  It was a K.
*  Yeah, it was.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't understand it.
*  I don't know why they did that.
*  And I know that I think they were threatening to sue him if he used the Gracie
*  name.
*  I think someone.
*  You're the detective of that shit, hey.
*  Yes.
*  I think it was Orion.
*  Orion was very.
*  Hickson.
*  Representing the man.
*  Yeah, where'd you get that?
*  Something Brian sent it to me.
*  I like it the way.
*  It's a dope shirt.
*  I should remember the name.
*  He was the fucking man, huh?
*  What's its name?
*  The shirt company?
*  I feel bad for him.
*  Fuck it, people will find it.
*  Is it on the back anywhere?
*  Probably.
*  A little label?
*  I don't see anything.
*  I just see a tag.
*  Labeless.
*  What does it say on the bottom?
*  What is it there?
*  Is that the name?
*  What do we got?
*  What does the bottom say there?
*  Oh, it just says Hickson Gracie.
*  Gracie.
*  Hickson.
*  Oh man, I feel bad for him.
*  But a cool shirt honoring the OG.
*  Yeah, it's pretty dope.
*  He is the OG.
*  He was the fucking man.
*  Cool motherfucker, yeah.
*  Did you ever train with him?
*  I've never trained with him, never met him.
*  Really?
*  Interesting dude, man.
*  Very interesting dude.
*  I got a chance to watch Coliseum.
*  Remember when he fought Funaki?
*  Was that his last one?
*  Yes.
*  Yeah.
*  I got a chance to watch Funaki.
*  Funaki.
*  Funaki.
*  Funaki.
*  Funaki.
*  Funaki.
*  Funaki.
*  Funaki.
*  Funaki.
*  Funaki.
*  Funaki.
*  I watched footage of that with him in his house.
*  Oh, the one where the guy came to the gym, right?
*  Was it the gym challenge match?
*  No, I didn't watch that.
*  He didn't show me that.
*  Someone's got to have that.
*  He's got it.
*  He's got it.
*  We've got to get that.
*  I know.
*  I'm like release that, bro.
*  Why don't you release that?
*  That was Yoji Anjo, right?
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  He came to challenge match.
*  He just beat the...
*  He taped up his knuckles with duct tape and beat the fuck out of him.
*  That's wild.
*  Yeah.
*  And he's like, if we are competing, when your tab bit's over, if we're fighting,
*  when I'm done and I'm done, I decide.
*  He just beat the fuck out of that, dude.
*  That's some scary shit.
*  I feel sad for him now.
*  He's going, uh, Parkinson's, right?
*  Who does?
*  I believe Hickson does.
*  Does he really?
*  I believe so, yeah.
*  No kidding.
*  I didn't hear that.
*  Yeah.
*  I saw Kira Gracie announce something about it.
*  See, I always wonder, because we talked about Freddie Roach.
*  That's trauma-induced Parkinson's.
*  And you know, Hickson didn't get hit a whole lot in his career, but he did get hit.
*  You know, I always wonder.
*  Yeah.
*  Hickson Gracie fight against Parkinson's.
*  I'm not scared of death, but quitting is unacceptable.
*  Rolling Stone magazine?
*  Whoa.
*  This is Rolling Stone?
*  That's crazy.
*  That is crazy that there's a Hickson Gracie article in Rolling Stone.
*  That's amazing.
*  Wow.
*  Fuck, man.
*  Parkinson's.
*  I hope we get Kron back.
*  I hope so, too.
*  I think he might come back to grappling, maybe.
*  Well, I mean, his last fight in MMA just looked like he was just trying to pull guard and
*  work off his back.
*  And it's just, he just didn't look like he's prepared.
*  I know a place he could do that.
*  No.
*  Yeah.
*  Do you think he would be willing to, I mean, he was such an elite grappler.
*  The Gary Tonan match.
*  What a fucking match that was.
*  Holy shit, man.
*  Craziest shit ever.
*  That was before Gary was training with the Donna Herd Death Squad, right?
*  Wasn't it?
*  Either.
*  I mean, good question.
*  If we saw the match, we'd see who was in the corner.
*  Because this was definitely before the leg lock days.
*  This was a long time ago.
*  Gary was dominating that fight until the very end.
*  Back in those days, it was crazy.
*  I still miss Eddie Cummings.
*  I'm like, what happened to him?
*  You know what I mean?
*  Right.
*  What did happen to him?
*  That guy was good.
*  I've tried to catch up with him a couple of times in New York.
*  I'm like, I just want to have lunch with the guy.
*  He just left the grappling world, just vanished.
*  What is he doing?
*  I don't think anyone knows.
*  I saw in a couple of videos, he came back to Hensos and trained a couple of times, but
*  I think he doesn't like any media attention and circled around on Instagram and he just
*  vanished again.
*  Really?
*  No kidding.
*  So crazy.
*  He was an interesting guy.
*  Oh, he was an elite grappler, too.
*  Well, he was one of the very best of the leg lock guys in the early, early days.
*  He was scary.
*  We all copied him.
*  He was a scary, scary dude.
*  Super smart, like really intelligent guy.
*  And now, yeah, he ended up with Ottavia Bourdain, right?
*  Yeah, they started dating when she started training at Hensos and I don't know what happened.
*  I think she competed in grappling a lot as well.
*  Yeah, she had fucked up knees, man.
*  Her knees were all blown out.
*  I remember trying to tell her to get surgery.
*  To fix them up.
*  Eddie kept breaking them, probably not.
*  I don't know.
*  Drilling.
*  At least one with no ACL.
*  That's crazy.
*  Doesn't Nicky have a fucked up knee?
*  Nicky Ryan?
*  Nicky Ryan does.
*  Man, Nicky Ryan gets injured every three minutes.
*  You know what I mean?
*  He's made of glass, unfortunately.
*  I injured him.
*  I came back training with him one round, injured him the other day.
*  I'm just like, fuck, bro, how does this happen?
*  I felt bad.
*  It's a bit of a weird scramble, but he just beat JT Taurus.
*  So like, biggest win of his career.
*  That was a big win.
*  Yeah, he looked great in that.
*  That was beautiful.
*  Yeah, he was training real serious for that.
*  But doesn't he have like one ACL that's gone?
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  I remember he tore his ACL and the doctors were like, okay, we can attempt surgery or
*  you can do rehab only.
*  So he just did nothing and just kept training.
*  He didn't even rehab the thing.
*  I'm like, bro, do something.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, he's wild.
*  That's not wise for the future, though.
*  Not at all.
*  I mean, I think he had 95% of his meniscus removed in one of his legs.
*  Oh, god damn it.
*  Yeah, I'm pretty sure one surgeon was like, I won't do that.
*  You're too young for it, buddy.
*  You got it done.
*  Well, you know, they do meniscus replacements.
*  Oh, they do that?
*  Yes, they do cadaver meniscus replacements, especially with young people.
*  It's really effective.
*  He wouldn't even work.
*  And he's got some mileage on the body.
*  So it's like his knees.
*  God, I hope he does it because he can do it and it'll actually take.
*  We got him in this though.
*  He's gone after the million.
*  That'd be exciting.
*  What a fucked up knee.
*  There's always something fucked up with him.
*  You know, he's always injured in some way.
*  Well, isn't that the case just like with so many elite combat sports athletes?
*  It's very rare other than boxers.
*  It's very rare.
*  There's a story going around about this NBA player who got a meniscus from a donor.
*  Yeah, I mean, it's a cadaver.
*  Yes, because they don't say cadaver at all.
*  No, that's what they mean.
*  They mean a donor.
*  Yeah, no one's going to give you their fucking.
*  That's for the right price.
*  It's a cadaver donor.
*  And like I said, it is it's effective.
*  It's possible for I think there's an age where they don't recommend it anymore because of
*  the lack of blood circulation.
*  But I always wonder for who, though, like when they say, you know, you can't do it after
*  40.
*  But for who?
*  Like for the regular person who is a 40 year old who doesn't work out and is not like physically
*  fit or if you did that to say someone like Steve Amiochich, like, could he get a meniscus
*  replacement when he's, you know, constantly training?
*  And how much does your age affect blood flow to that area?
*  Like, what is the factor?
*  It doesn't make sense.
*  If like if you still have like a great VO to Max, you're still very fit in your super healthy
*  train all the time.
*  You obviously have great circulation.
*  Like, I don't understand why at a certain age they wouldn't recommend it.
*  I wonder if it's based on averages.
*  Like you take the average 50 year old guy and you give it to him and his knees still
*  fucked up because his body didn't heal properly.
*  But like with peptides, with all the things that are available today and stem cells, I
*  wonder.
*  Yeah, it's going to be some things you do to stack the deck in your favor for that.
*  For sure.
*  Once you remove your meniscus.
*  I have a meniscus was scoped in my left knee and it's always going to be fucked up.
*  There's always like something.
*  Yeah, it's just grinding, right?
*  Well, it's it's not all of mine is gone.
*  It's only in a corner.
*  But I suffered what's called a insufficiency fracture where you're because there's no
*  meniscus. I crashed skiing and I cracked my bones together so hard that it cracked the
*  top of my shin bone.
*  Skiing scares me.
*  Skiing is snowboarding.
*  That was my last time skiing.
*  I got a concussion.
*  I fucking banged my head off the ground real hard.
*  And I was skiing around this corner and this lady didn't know what she was doing.
*  And she's like, that'd be me.
*  And it was well, you know, you learn.
*  But she was on, you know, a fairly difficult trail.
*  And I'm not a great skier, but, you know, I have good balance.
*  I'm pretty OK.
*  I know how to do it. But I was like, either I hit this lady and fucking kill her or I
*  have to fall down. So I chose falling down and I fucking bang my head so hard.
*  Like as my head banged, I'm like, oh, that one counts.
*  I was like, that's a real one.
*  No, it would have been bad.
*  It would have been bad because she wasn't very large and I was no, I wasn't going slow.
*  I want to see her on the slopes.
*  Yeah, bro. That's like a bowling ball just fucking flying down the hill.
*  I mean, all that weight, the momentum of all that weight.
*  I imagine when you're really big, like my kids ski and they ski so easy
*  because they're light and like we we we.
*  But the heavier you are, like the more fucking momentum is coming down.
*  Lots of knee injuries skiing. Oh, my God.
*  Yeah. My friend Shane Dorian, he blew his fucking knee out snowboarding.
*  He hit a tree torch torches knee.
*  How to get it reconstructed and stem cells and all that jazz.
*  He's good to go now. But it took a long time before it was good.
*  And I would imagine you're a professional.
*  You're a professional surfer, one of the best in the world.
*  Big wave surfer. I mean, he's a fucking monster.
*  Like I would do everything to preserve my goddamn knees.
*  But he loves snowboarding so much. He's still back at it.
*  Like, you're insane, man.
*  Yeah, that's crazy. That's crazy. You'd risk your career. Your career.
*  Well, I think he's kind of his career as a competition is kind of over.
*  You know, he's just kind of a representative of a bunch of different brands.
*  And I don't know if he competes.
*  I mean, Kelly Slater still competes, which is crazy and still wins.
*  Kelly still trains. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*  I suppose that's risky for your career, too.
*  Oh, yeah. That's got to be risky.
*  It's got to be risky for everything.
*  Like I know guys who play musical instruments and they fucked up their hands
*  and she just said, like, broken a finger. I'm like, yikes.
*  You're like tattoo out of surgeons. It's like maybe don't train.
*  Yeah. I mean, if you break a hand and that's the hand you play guitar with
*  and now you've got these fucking gnarly ass fingers
*  and you're still trying to move at the same speed.
*  Yeah, I had some my fingers.
*  One time I got my thumb stuck up here in grappling.
*  And another time my finger got stuck on the ground and went straight up.
*  I remember that was in Puerto Rico.
*  Oliver Tarza broke my hand and I went to the hospital in Puerto Rico.
*  We got the X-ray.
*  I'm waiting around for hours and the guy's like, it's fine.
*  No breaks, nothing.
*  So I leave and then I'm like, my hands fucked up.
*  So I go back and end up getting the X-ray and I can see it's broken.
*  And I ended up getting it treated. I just posted it on Instagram.
*  I was like, any hand surgeons? What can I do for this?
*  And we just spoke about it on Instagram.
*  What did he say to do?
*  I just left it like this for a while.
*  Didn't really didn't use it too much.
*  So was it a fracture in the sense where they didn't have to bolt it together?
*  It didn't have to.
*  It's the same one when people punch a wall or something.
*  Oh, OK. Like the one down here.
*  So that one didn't need anything.
*  But I mean, I just I was a lot of Puerto Rican stories like that.
*  Where I was like, yeah, yeah, it's not broken.
*  I'm like, I can see it's broken.
*  Not so good medicine over there.
*  No, not at all. Yeah, no, that was a that was a wild place.
*  Not good for getting antibiotics for staff either.
*  No. Yes.
*  I mean, I've had plenty of times where I've gone to the doctor and they're like,
*  this is staff. I need antibiotics.
*  But they don't want to be told
*  like by some fucking idiot that they're like diagnosing themselves,
*  giving themselves the treatment.
*  So they resist the diagnosis.
*  They'll resist it on you.
*  Really? I've had doctors not give me antibiotics and then it's gotten worse.
*  And tell you it's not staff?
*  They're like, no, you're fine.
*  Just put some cream on it. Oh, boy.
*  Oh, boy. Yeah.
*  But I get it. They probably have guys come in all the time.
*  They're like, give me this, give me this. Right.
*  But no one's coming in to get antibiotics for fun.
*  Yeah. I mean, that's not like painkillers.
*  No. Yeah, it's I guess I control my bit.
*  But yeah, I just so always I just have to deal with like people coming in.
*  Oh, my back. Yeah.
*  I'm about to give me some Xanax.
*  I'm having so much anxiety.
*  I can't deal with this.
*  They just want you to freak out enough in the office.
*  Maybe they give you something just to calm you down.
*  That's a good. That's a good play.
*  Really depends on the doctor,
*  because some doctors are just a little loose with it.
*  Yeah, I feel like honestly, the more expensive the doctor, the better
*  the better your chances. Oh, yeah.
*  Getting what you want.
*  Oh, yeah. I would imagine they probably have some sort of fucking deal, too.
*  Like, you know, my wife's mom was a nurse
*  and she would explain to me how the whole pharmaceutical rep thing worked.
*  And Brigham Brigham from Wasted Well, he used to be a pharmaceutical rep.
*  It's like, bro, like the relationship they have with doctors is like,
*  it's so slippery to get them to prescribe.
*  Yeah, it's so slippery because, you know,
*  even if they're not paying you and they do pay people,
*  but even if they're not like, this is your friend, they show up.
*  Brigham was like, I would show up with their kids softball games.
*  I knew everybody's name.
*  You become friendly. They want to prescribe your drugs.
*  You're a good guy.
*  It's wild. Yeah, it's fucking creepy.
*  But like us, the opioid epidemic and stuff like that, right?
*  Oh, that's exactly it.
*  Did you ever watch that show Painkiller on Netflix?
*  I started, but I never finished it. Fucking lazy.
*  Oh, it's so fucked up.
*  How those people are not in jail is insane.
*  Not only did they bullshit people and get people to prescribe these things,
*  but they ruined who knows how many lives
*  hundreds of thousands of people, if not millions, dead from opioid overdoses.
*  And then the amount of lives that are destroyed because of those things.
*  Families wrecked everything and they tricked people.
*  They tricked them into doing drugs that are going to be.
*  They just paid a fine, right? Massive fine.
*  Yeah, but not enough.
*  It's also the part of the fine was that they were going to avoid prosecution.
*  Like if they paid, you know, X amount of billions of dollars,
*  they would avoid prosecution.
*  But I think then Painkiller came out, the documentary came out,
*  the Netflix series, and then they kind of withheld that.
*  And I think one of the guys who was the main guy for the FDA
*  that was responsible for green lighting, Oxycontin and Oxycodone,
*  that guy, they found him.
*  He was like in a small town in New Hampshire.
*  He's hiding away.
*  And yeah, I mean, they paid him off.
*  And this fucker was out there roaming around and they found him.
*  And he's like Epstein's girlfriend.
*  Except she's in jail somewhere.
*  Yeah, they got her eventually.
*  Yeah, eventually she's going to get out and she's going to fucking go swimming
*  and drown or something.
*  Yeah, I mean, that'll be me after this tournament.
*  Do you worry about that?
*  I mean, it should be all right.
*  That's not comforting.
*  Should be all right.
*  Yeah, I mean, it's just a bit of friendly competition.
*  It is that, but it's also like you're specifically going head to head.
*  Like if you had done it a month earlier, a month later,
*  I don't think we'd have the same issues.
*  I don't think we'd have the same impact on the sport, though.
*  Either we do.
*  I think you would.
*  We'll do it. We'll do it a month after as well.
*  Well, oh, cool. My buddy, we need another million, brother.
*  Going again.
*  But you want to do it once a year, right?
*  You don't want to do it more than once a year.
*  Yeah, honestly, I'm on the phone on Star Pay talking to people
*  about the surveillance stuff.
*  I got to explain everyone the ruleset.
*  Yeah. And becoming a promoter.
*  I mean, do you have to hire a staff now?
*  Do you have to hire all these people to run the thing?
*  I mean, I'm the ideas guy, you know, my business partner, Seth Belal.
*  I'm like, he's doing all the coordination and stuff.
*  But me, I'm just talking to the athletes, coming up with the rules sort of.
*  So he does all the coordination, like hiring the staff,
*  making sure the event is well run, because I would imagine
*  if you've never run an event before, like that's obviously
*  you can't call Abu Dhabi and ask for tips.
*  You can call. I should.
*  You call Lady Bravo.
*  Yeah, I spoke to him. He loves it.
*  That's like, yeah, he's very excited about it.
*  A little hat tip to him with the name as well.
*  Yeah, I think the having something where there's more money involved is always good.
*  It's just like the timing of it.
*  It's like when to do it.
*  I just if if you'd asked me, I would have said,
*  they still get to watch the finals, you know.
*  Well, yeah, true. They still got to watch the finals.
*  They get to watch the finals, but you won't have the same people competing
*  because if they're going to compete on Friday and Saturday,
*  that precludes them from being able to compete in Abu Dhabi.
*  I mean, yeah, for sure.
*  Do you want the gold medal in 10K or the million?
*  Right. That's the argument.
*  That is the argument. Right.
*  And it's it's certainly look, competition is almost always good.
*  It even when people don't like it, it forces them to up their game.
*  And I think at the end of the day, it's going to be good for the athletes
*  and good for the sport because it'll make people more and the beef,
*  the beef will, you know, too bad.
*  Biggie, I'm going down in Vegas like to back there.
*  Remember how both of those guys died, though, by the way?
*  They died very badly.
*  Oh, Tupac and Biggie.
*  Like it would have been better if Tupac and Biggie just kind of worked it out.
*  Like, I mean, even like Drake and Kendrick, but that was entertaining.
*  But Drake's house got shot at, you know, like someone didn't.
*  A security guard get shot.
*  I think he got shot. Yeah. Yeah.
*  And then we got some good music sort.
*  I didn't listen to security guard took the hit.
*  I mean, yeah, yeah, someone.
*  It's some of the songs are good.
*  I just find it foolish.
*  The beef. Mm hmm.
*  I'm not a beef guy.
*  I feel like those guys could have wrote banging songs.
*  They both put out four songs each, you know, it's like
*  he's that creativity and just.
*  Yeah, I guess if you drew in, I mean, I get it.
*  I get it. It's part of the culture. I get it.
*  Don't get me wrong.
*  Like, I like roast battles.
*  Love them. Yeah, I love to comedy.
*  They should have done a rap.
*  Yeah. Pay per view.
*  That would have been amazing. Yeah.
*  That would have that would have been amazing.
*  Yeah. Rap battles are awesome.
*  It's just, you know, it's another opportunity to write.
*  It's another opportunity to create something.
*  And it's high pressure. Yeah.
*  So in that sense, this rivalry between ADCC and the CJI,
*  you know, just one Australian idiot versus city.
*  You know, let's see what happens.
*  Yeah. Versus a monarchy.
*  A monarchy. Yeah.
*  I mean, I still love ADCC.
*  Love the history, you know, and I think you can wash that away.
*  It's amazing. Yeah.
*  Do you think you could ever compete for them again?
*  I think that's over now.
*  I mean, I wouldn't do it for 10K.
*  I don't know. I mean, who knows?
*  The doors are the doors open for anything.
*  I don't take any of this stuff too seriously at all.
*  You know what I mean? A lot of it's just fun on the Internet.
*  Like, I don't really, you know, like fucking around, having a good time,
*  you know, like I'll do anything for the right price.
*  So it's like if the spectacles, if people are interested in it.
*  Right. So you would go back if they would have you back for sure.
*  And ultimately, what I want and what I wanted from day one
*  was just athletes across everything in G2 to be compensated
*  just a little bit more.
*  You know, because again, we don't have the prestige.
*  So if they had ramped it up from 10 to 20, done, you would have done this.
*  Wouldn't have done it. Really? Wow.
*  Boy, they're probably going fuck.
*  Oh, yeah, that's that's really what sort of kicked it off.
*  But also I wanted to do like this is opportunity
*  to start up a nonprofit and stuff.
*  So it's like gives me opportunity to get back in other other ways.
*  So with your this attitude about not taking things so seriously,
*  do you think you and Gordon would ever bury the hatchet?
*  For sure. But take some MDMA.
*  We'll get to the bottom of it.
*  You know, I think he needs it.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Don't you think, though, that for a guy to be as dominant as he is,
*  you have to be that guy that's like Michael Jordan in his prime.
*  They said if you beat him in a game of pool, he wouldn't talk to you for like two weeks.
*  It just you have to be kind of a psycho.
*  I know. But you see, I guess you see the contrast in some areas.
*  Like, in my opinion, Volkanovsky was that GSP was that.
*  But really nice guy. Yeah. Anderson Silva was like, again, I don't think Gordon's.
*  I mean, it's hard to say what he is, you know.
*  It's like it's hard. I don't know that well.
*  You know, I know what the image he puts out.
*  I know a little bit of the stuff behind the scenes, but.
*  But you trained with them for years. You got to know them.
*  Yeah, but you know what you did to guys like you get on the mat.
*  So I want to hang out with them afterwards. Fucking weirdos.
*  Who wants to have a conversation with the guy?
*  Me. That's why you're here. Some of them. Some of them.
*  Like in some of it, odd, you know.
*  Don't you think that like, I love them, I'm part of it.
*  But odd people would make the world go around, though.
*  Oh, yeah. I mean, for sure, I'm not criticizing.
*  I'm fucking weird. Look at I'm doing. You're weird. Yeah.
*  Definitely weird. But some people I find cool.
*  Easy to talk to. I know.
*  It's just for me as a guy who likes both of you guys.
*  I don't like that you don't talk anymore.
*  I don't like that you have this beef.
*  I've asked Gordon to define it. He does. It doesn't define it.
*  It's very difficult.
*  He doesn't say anything bad about you, but he doesn't define it.
*  I mean, I just love fucking around like Australia.
*  We love attacking each other.
*  Like I say worse things to my friends and I say to Gordon, you know, listen,
*  I'm a comedian. I know about that.
*  So it's like I just talk wild shit to each other, too.
*  Some guys are so good to provoke.
*  You get a good fucking reaction out of them, you know?
*  Well, with comedians, you know who you can hang out with by who can take shit.
*  You know, because like if someone makes fun of me, if it's funny, I laugh.
*  But if you make fun of some people and they're like, hey, like, oh, look at you.
*  So you lost. You just fucked up.
*  You fucked up. You take yourself seriously.
*  You got to roll the punches.
*  You just take what you do seriously, but you never take yourself seriously.
*  That's so silly.
*  There's no benefit to that because then you don't get to enjoy the laughs
*  when someone makes fun of you.
*  Someone makes fun of you.
*  And it's like if you're Watch Kill Tony.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Well, when David Lucas and Tony Hinchcliffe go out each other,
*  it is one of my favorite things in life.
*  There's the both so fucking ruthless and hilarious.
*  But if David gets Tony, Tony laughs hard.
*  And if Tony gets David, David laughs hard.
*  They laugh. They love each other.
*  They're really good friends.
*  But they're fucking ruthless when it comes to that shit,
*  when they're roasting each other.
*  But they're having a good time.
*  Like if you roast someone and they get like actually upset as a comedian,
*  all the other comedians will be like, oh, look at you.
*  You're upset at a joke.
*  You fucking hypocrite. Like, what's wrong with you?
*  Well, I mean, that's what I mean.
*  Gordon says, bro, you suck. You never want anything.
*  I'm like, I could as well do that.
*  You know, relax.
*  Is that like that's the what is the beef, though?
*  Like, it doesn't make sense.
*  I mean, for me, I'm just having a good time.
*  Like, it's like I'm in a sport of people that take themselves very seriously.
*  Right. And it's just he takes himself very seriously.
*  So it's just like, so you like picking on them.
*  I like anyone. You know what I mean?
*  Like, I mean, like what you said with comedians, you know, if someone's too
*  good, too stiff, sometimes, you know.
*  Yeah. And it's good material.
*  He's like he's just walking good material.
*  You know, it's like he's provoking me.
*  I mean, well, you just post something that I'm like, I swear, I'm like,
*  this guy's playing a fucking character.
*  He's a genius. But it's real.
*  I'm like, he's baiting me.
*  I got to say something.
*  Well, you are probably the funniest guy in Jiu Jitsu, other than Eddie.
*  Eddie's hilarious.
*  Eddie loves the jokes, too.
*  He gets it. Sometimes I pass on him some deeper levels of the jokes
*  and he gets the full story. Loves it.
*  We go deep conspiracy on the Jiu Jitsu jokes.
*  Oh, no. Eddie's Eddie is fucking hilarious.
*  He's one of the funniest people I've ever met.
*  I'm so glad he's doing stand up again, too,
*  because I tried to talk him into doing stand up a long time ago,
*  like back in like 2001.
*  I was like, dude, I'm telling you, just try it.
*  It'll suck at first.
*  But just like it sucked when I learned Jiu Jitsu.
*  You suck at first, but you have the ability to do it.
*  Overcome. Yeah. He took a long time off it.
*  But when he was teaching, he would teach classes and especially seminars.
*  He would have like material. Oh, yeah.
*  They would do during seminars. It was hilarious.
*  And then he's like, I think I want to do comedy again.
*  So teaching seminars.
*  That's what I do.
*  I'll say the same joke.
*  And then I look over and I'm like, fuck, that guy was at another seminar.
*  I said the same thing.
*  I'm like, he knows.
*  He knows my tricks. Yeah.
*  Yeah. That's the problem with jokes.
*  If they already know the jokes, it's like a little bit of an issue.
*  And I'm like, fuck, have I said this a few too many times now?
*  Yeah. Switch topics.
*  Yeah. You got to make new stuff up.
*  You got to make up new new stuff for seminars.
*  When you go and do seminars, you find it.
*  It's a lot.
*  It's a lot of MMA fighters that are wanting to learn Jiu Jitsu.
*  Is it just Jiu Jitsu guys? Is it a mixture?
*  I mean, nowadays, like, man, it's like such a variety of people,
*  like sometimes even beginners like white belts will show up.
*  And it's like, they're just hanging.
*  They're just coming to hang out.
*  You know, like I love doing seminars all around the world
*  and just meeting the people that are doing the sport, you know.
*  And like I keep them at a really affordable price,
*  because I always remember when people would come to my city,
*  like sometimes the seminars are so expensive, I couldn't afford it.
*  So I just insist we book a big venue, we keep the prices low.
*  And I just get to see who from that country is participating in the sport.
*  You know, I just love it.
*  Is that you enjoy that more than competing now,
*  just going around and doing seminars?
*  I enjoy like, like all aspects of it, you know, like obviously too many seminars.
*  Exhausting. I've done like back to back to back to back.
*  I like the seminar, be three hours and then out of there.
*  Otherwise, it's too much social interaction, you know.
*  We probably also don't absorb anything after three hours.
*  It's like and I have to roll like I still run the gauntlet.
*  I try to roll as many people as possible.
*  That's got to be hair raiser.
*  They fucking try to kill me.
*  Yeah, I'm sure.
*  Bro, you paid to come here. You like me.
*  What are you doing to me?
*  Yeah. Relax.
*  Like I'll be hungover jet lagged and it'll be like I'll be do.
*  I'll do like sometimes one hour, one and a half hours straight.
*  You go every three minutes. Oh, God.
*  And I'm like, what are you doing to me, bro?
*  It's fucking one hour in. You're trying to kill me.
*  Yeah. After a while.
*  You test your patience. That's like meditating.
*  You know, I'm just like, I'd not kill this guy.
*  That's one of the legendary Hickson stories that Hickson would do a seminar
*  and then take all the black belts there and just tap them one after another.
*  I try to do fucked up shit to people, though, you know, like, like what?
*  Just crazy, stupid submissions.
*  You know, that keeps entertaining crab walks like the Boston Crab.
*  And crab. I love hitting a Boston crab.
*  I'm like, you remember that forever.
*  You see that one guy who did it in MMA?
*  Yeah, yeah. So crazy.
*  Man, that would hurt. I've never been put in it.
*  Yeah. What is it?
*  A flexibility thing is a spine thing.
*  I think I'll break your spine.
*  Yeah, I do it to people from Mount that I give a mount
*  and then I put my toes in armpits, take them over the top.
*  Boston crab.
*  That's the fun of the seminar is just hitting fucked up shit
*  on people in front of their friends.
*  I think that's the most enjoyable thing.
*  Yeah. Yeah, here's the dude who did it in MMA.
*  How did he set it up? Jesus.
*  He just climbed over the top and got his legs.
*  The other guy looks like he's fighting for his life and he's happening.
*  Well, the other guy was a little out of shape, too.
*  He's just a little noogies to the face.
*  It's like he's already ready for it.
*  It almost looks fake.
*  I don't think it's fake.
*  I think it's just a low level MMA show.
*  Wow, that's crazy.
*  Fuck, that guy would never hear the end of that.
*  I remember a guy used to train with he actually sponsors me
*  and he had an MMA fight and he tapped.
*  He won for three rounds in a minute to go.
*  I think 30 seconds ago, he crossed his leg from back and.
*  Oh, no.
*  And I fucking remind him of it to this day.
*  It's been years. That is a crazy submission.
*  That hurts, you know.
*  Oh, it hurts like hell.
*  But you got to imagine, like if you're winning the fight.
*  I've I don't think I've ever seen an MMA fight where someone tapped that.
*  I'll send it to you.
*  But guys do it.
*  Guys do it. Even Hickson did it when Hickson submitted Funaquis crossed his legs.
*  He guess he just rather have the squeeze.
*  And if the guy threatens it, he'll let it go.
*  Yeah. Sometimes I think it's about being relaxed.
*  It's like if you're doing this, they can catch it really tight.
*  If your ankles are relaxed, sometimes they slip off the top. Right.
*  I think relaxing in those positions sometimes helps.
*  Well, also being hyper aware of when the guy lifts his leg up to try to lock it.
*  But yeah, I've had it done to me before. It's fucking horrible.
*  People try to do that to me at seminars, like they'll try and play around
*  and then catch me or some shit.
*  I'm just like, fucking relax, guy. Fucking.
*  You have to always be aware, right?
*  Because you're dealing with people trying to get a reputation.
*  Try to break my legs, everything.
*  Have you ever tapped at seminars?
*  Yeah, I tapped, but I'll give him a couple more so they don't believe it.
*  You know, their friends believe they get me once, but not three times.
*  You know, what do you mean?
*  Like if a blue belt test me at a seminar one time, maybe people believe.
*  So you let him tap you a couple times, a couple more, you know.
*  Oh, so you throw in a few.
*  Yeah, that's the story for him.
*  I tapped Craig Jones three times. Yeah, once maybe.
*  And they're like, wait a minute, I tapped you.
*  How the fuck you tapping Craig Jones?
*  That doesn't even make sense.
*  Take the story away from him.
*  What have you ever tapped to at a seminar?
*  Actually, I had a seminar at Kenan's gym and a guy got me in the north south.
*  But I tapped at seminars from time to time because I fuck around.
*  I'll give him my back, my umba.
*  And then I'm always like, guys, I'm going to give you positions.
*  But like, fuck, if you get it, I'll tap.
*  Like, yeah, relax.
*  I got shit to do. Yeah, I got shit to do.
*  Yeah, don't ruin my neck.
*  Yeah, they try. Yeah, some guys try to kill you.
*  Necks are a bad one, too, man.
*  When you get a hurt neck, like when guys get like Al Jermain,
*  got his disc replaced in his neck and I was like, oh, and your neck is gone.
*  Like, that's a fucking creepy one.
*  That's crazy. Yeah, I think I just retire at that point, you know.
*  Chris Wyman got his dick, this
*  is I think he got his disc replaced as well.
*  I think you have the same thing.
*  And there's a few guys who have had disc replaced in their back and in their neck.
*  You know, they can do that titanium articulating disc now,
*  like where it allows your neck to move pretty normally.
*  But, you know, like, how long does that last?
*  I just tap to everything and not put in much effort.
*  And I feel like he's my body safe.
*  You know what I mean? Like if I'm trying if I'm training and the guys going hot,
*  I'm like, oh, you got it right.
*  Like, yeah, well, let's just that's smart.
*  But that's an ego thing. You have a healthy ego.
*  I'm just like, who cares?
*  You know, like, it's like, yeah, that's the point.
*  You know, well, it's definitely better than going out like, you know, Vinny,
*  Vinny Magalé's letting your fucking leg get destroyed like that.
*  If you can just relax like that and allow yourself to get tapped,
*  you will save so many injuries.
*  I control the security footage in the cameraman, though.
*  So, you know, I make the footage disappear if you get some.
*  Oh, in your gym? Yeah, that's your issue.
*  Yeah. Get delete that.
*  That's the problem, right? Guys want to release footage.
*  I want to sell it. Hey, like if you will come to the gym, I'm like, well, let you tap me.
*  Give me some money. Yeah, you can take it home.
*  Well, listen, Craig, good luck on this.
*  I really hope it works out.
*  I hope ADCC isn't too pissed at you and hopefully I hope you've started a trend
*  and I've hope this is going to look at that.
*  The bulls, I hope it 80 days, 20 hours, 58 minutes and 47 seconds
*  until it starts from right now.
*  That's not reassuring. That's close.
*  It is 80 days is not a long amount of time, but I hope it works out.
*  And I really hope that it elevates the sport.
*  The very least, it's getting some eyeballs, eyeballs on the board.
*  You have those for sure. Yeah. Thanks for letting me talk about it.
*  My pleasure. So tell everybody how to find you on Instagram
*  and how to find the website for the event.
*  Yeah. Craig Jones BJJ.com will sell tickets to this.
*  Sorry, Craig Jones BJJ for Instagram.
*  You and LV.com is where tickets will be up on the 31st.
*  So at the Thomas and Mac website, Thomas and Mac website.
*  And then Fair Five Foundation is the is the website with all the information.
*  That's what we saw there.
*  And CJI official is the Instagram page where it's meant to be professional,
*  but it's going to be mostly memes. Mostly memes.
*  Mostly memes and jokes.
*  OK, we had a spelling error on the post that we left it, you know,
*  I was like, we fucked up. We'll commit to it.
*  All right. Beautiful.
*  All right, man. Well, good luck.
*  And make sure you count all that before you leave.
*  Yes, I'm going to. All right. Thank you. Bye, everybody.
