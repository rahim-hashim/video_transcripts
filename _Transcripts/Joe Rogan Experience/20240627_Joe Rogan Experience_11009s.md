# Joe Rogan Experience #2087 - Ron White
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6.0s)]
*  Brom White has brought a wandering puppy into this studio. She's tangled in the wires now. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=12.0s)]
*  Yeah, you know what? We could just put her out there. They got new puppies out there. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=18.0s)]
*  We could just put her outside. She doesn't need to be around these wires. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=23.0s)]
*  Let's have her do that and play with the puppy. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=26.0s)]
*  Yeah, she'll do that. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=28.0s)]
*  How old is she? Six months? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=30.0s)]
*  Six months. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=32.0s)]
*  She's adorable. What's her name again? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=33.0s)]
*  Maddie. She's like a rug that shits. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=34.0s)]
*  That's what she is, man. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=38.0s)]
*  She's a little adorable little cutie pie. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=40.0s)]
*  She's a golden doodle. Micro golden doodle is what they're calling them. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=43.0s)]
*  Micro golden doodle. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=46.0s)]
*  Yeah, so it doesn't matter how big she's supposed to be. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=48.0s)]
*  That's it? That's as big as they get? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=51.0s)]
*  That one's supposed to, I hope so. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=53.0s)]
*  Isn't it weird? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=54.0s)]
*  I still got to cram them on planes and shit when I went travel. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=55.0s)]
*  Those things all came from wolves? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=58.0s)]
*  Did they really? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=60.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=61.0s)]
*  I don't know anything about where she came from. I got it from a breeder. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=62.0s)]
*  All dogs came from wolves. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=66.0s)]
*  They did? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=68.0s)]
*  It's just incredible that they can get a dog down to that. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=69.0s)]
*  I mean, even a German Shepherd. Imagine turning a German Shepherd into a Chihuahua. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=72.0s)]
*  How? How'd they do that? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=76.0s)]
*  I'm glad I'm not the one they're asking how to do it because I would have to say I have no idea, dude. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=78.0s)]
*  I don't even think they know how people did it because it happens so long. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=83.0s)]
*  You get two Chihuahuas and let them bang. That's the only way. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=87.0s)]
*  You get the boss Chihuahua. I wonder if you can go back up to a wolf. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=90.0s)]
*  When you can take Chihuahuas and go over 10,000 years. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=93.0s)]
*  And get back, just reverse DNA those things back into a creature. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=96.0s)]
*  Yeah, make it harder for them to live. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=99.0s)]
*  Is it hot in here? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=101.0s)]
*  No. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=102.0s)]
*  It's not? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=103.0s)]
*  No. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=104.0s)]
*  Oh no. Oh no. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=105.0s)]
*  Oh no. Then I miscalculated something. I got a miscalculation going on in my head. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=106.0s)]
*  No, we're good. It's like, what is in here? 70? It's cold as shit outside. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=111.0s)]
*  Yeah, it is. I'm up in the air on the 22nd floor. I'm still living in the condo. It is breezy up there. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=117.0s)]
*  Yeah, boy, you open up that sliding glass door, you get a taste of reality. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=124.0s)]
*  When a couple days ago we could barely shut it, you know, or open it. It was just so much pressure against it. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=129.0s)]
*  We're in Midland on Wednesday or Thursday night to do a show. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=135.0s)]
*  Thanks to you, if you'd have just let me retire, I wouldn't have been in Midland. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=139.0s)]
*  I'm sitting on my bus, my 60,000 pound tour bus, and it is shaking in the wind. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=143.0s)]
*  It is blowing so hard. And I've owned that bus 17 years. I've never felt anything like this. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=149.0s)]
*  And it just shaking. And that bus driver had to drive it from there to Houston for the next night's show. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=154.0s)]
*  He got up 10 hours later just rassling that steering wheel, trying to keep that thing on the road. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=161.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=166.0s)]
*  His shoulders were killing him. His back was sore. It looked like he'd been in a fight all night long. 10 hours. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=167.0s)]
*  What a bus is such a big target for wind, too. There's so much surface area. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=173.0s)]
*  It's like a big old sail. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=178.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=179.0s)]
*  But luckily they weigh a lot. So they're 60,000 pounds. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=180.0s)]
*  So it's pretty stable compared to a trailer, right, that somebody's pulling. There's no weight in that. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=185.0s)]
*  All that weight's right here. That stuff really blows around worse than we do. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=193.0s)]
*  Yeah, I would imagine. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=197.0s)]
*  We have got weight distribution. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=198.0s)]
*  Just the whole trailer thing being connected. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=199.0s)]
*  I know all about this shit. If you want to know any of it, just ask me questions. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=201.0s)]
*  Okay. The hinge between the two trailers, if something goes sideways, I would imagine that would be a lot harder to get back on track. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=204.0s)]
*  I don't know jack shit about that. In fact, I've owned my bus for 17 years. I've never driven it one foot. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=211.0s)]
*  And if you held a gun to my head and said, I'm going to kill you if you don't move this bus, I'd say you're going to have to kill me, dude, because I don't even know how to start it. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=219.0s)]
*  I've never been curious. I'm not that kind of person. I know I would have jet for years. I never went in the cockpit. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=228.0s)]
*  I couldn't tell you what goes on up there. I didn't. I'm sure there are people up there knew how to fly a plane. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=234.0s)]
*  But I've never started it. I've never moved it. I've had cops bang on. You got to move it. You're blocking an alley. I'm sorry, dude. You got the wrong guy. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=239.0s)]
*  And the guy that says the driver is asleep right now because you've got to drive tomorrow night. So it's kind of sitting where it's sitting unless you guys want to tow it. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=247.0s)]
*  You've had that happen? Yeah. Oh, yeah. I had. Yeah, because drivers can only drive so long. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=254.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, you drive 500 miles and then you're then they go on overdrive. So they make the same for the next couple hours that they made for the whole day. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=261.0s)]
*  So they like that. But you get but there are laws against how much that they can run without without needing some rest. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=270.0s)]
*  And we run that bus at night. So, you know, they got to sleep during the day. You're banking on people being able to stay awake. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=276.0s)]
*  People fall asleep at the wheel. Yeah, you got to go. You got to go with super pros and pay them well, you know, because those guys understand how important it is. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=281.0s)]
*  You know that you got everything on this thing. Yeah. You know, my life, my friends lives, you know. Yeah. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=290.0s)]
*  And my family, you know, that's who I've spent the most time with in the last whatever 30 years. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=297.0s)]
*  And, you know, they so you get a pro that knows how to sleep, knows how to do it, knows how to work it, knows how to work those hours. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=304.0s)]
*  And, you know, I got a great guy now that I just picked up named Steve, who used to work for Prevost fixing them. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=311.0s)]
*  And Fred, the Pats who used to built the bus. So I got the bus covered, man. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=318.0s)]
*  That's nice because you got like a little travel and apartment. Yeah, it's the greatest. You ought to get one. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=323.0s)]
*  In fact, I was looking at him the other day for you. I'm not getting one of those. You're not too. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=330.0s)]
*  You got a place to store it. Park it in one of your gyms. No, just the thought of traveling around on highways while you're just kind of. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=336.0s)]
*  You're hoping all these other people around you can keep their shit together. Right. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=347.0s)]
*  Well, you know, regular people, not pilots, regular people driving multi thousand pound machines on rubber tires, weaving in and out of lanes. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=352.0s)]
*  Yeah, you can't ever come on my bus with thoughts like that. You and I'm out there. I'll never sleep again. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=366.0s)]
*  Some guy for everybody of me the other day didn't see me on the highway. I don't think I think he just cut right in front of me. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=371.0s)]
*  I was like, wow, never saw you. We saw me. I think he just turned in my lane. I think, you know, as a left lane thing, he was going to the left lane. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=377.0s)]
*  I just don't think he saw me. I you know, the problem with that with that bus is that you get so used to it and you're so used to living on it when it's moving. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=385.0s)]
*  And you kind of forget that you're standing there, but you're really going 70 miles an hour. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=395.0s)]
*  So if something happens and this happened one time, we were in Orlando and it was actually a cop that did it cut in front of the bus. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=399.0s)]
*  I'm standing there washing dishes or whatever I was doing. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=406.0s)]
*  And then Pat's got to hit the brakes and turn to the left from going for now. I'm going 70 miles an hour. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=409.0s)]
*  I'm still going 70 miles an hour, but he's going 52 and going that way. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=415.0s)]
*  And I'm going 70 miles an hour this way. And I landed on this chair, which looks padded, but it doesn't feel padded when you hit it. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=420.0s)]
*  And I thought I would never walk again or breathe again after I just walked away from it. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=428.0s)]
*  I wouldn't even hurt. But you got to sit down and remember, hey, this thing's moving, right? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=433.0s)]
*  So if something happens, you got to be ready for it to happen. Yeah. And I sleep like a baby on it. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=438.0s)]
*  That's crazy. In fact, I spent too much time on it. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=443.0s)]
*  I got to hire somebody to shake my bed when I'm at home just a little bit. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=447.0s)]
*  So I feel like I'm moving down. If we wanted to look at the bright side of human beings, highways are a pretty good indicator that people for the most part, keep it together for the most part. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=450.0s)]
*  I think that's really how you can really tell when you're back in America and how good we are at putting a country together. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=463.0s)]
*  You know, it's how good our roads are compared to, you know, it's really funny if you cross the bridge from Ramos in Mexico to McAllen, Texas, which I used to do all the time. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=470.0s)]
*  It was a joint project. So the US built half the bridge, Mexico built half the bridge. And I'm not being a racist and I love Mexican people. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=479.0s)]
*  I just got back from Mexico City. But our side of the bridge is smooth as silk. And as soon as you hit that river, boom, boom, boom, boom. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=486.0s)]
*  But that just goes to what you just said. It's a mark of what you've achieved as a civilization, the kind of road work that you've got. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=496.0s)]
*  And you get back to Texas where we got those U-turn lanes on the freeway. We got to figure it out here in Texas, man. We got the best roads ever. Best roads ever. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=504.0s)]
*  It's just counting on all those people to keep their shit together all the time while you're driving on the highway. And most people do it. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=516.0s)]
*  Most people, the vast majority of us, keep our shit together. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=524.0s)]
*  That's why I think bus drivers should make more than pilots, because there's way more shit to run into. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=528.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, way more. Way more things that can make mistakes that are all around you. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=533.0s)]
*  Right. You're right. Things that are completely out of your control. That ain't going on up in the sky there. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=538.0s)]
*  There's also people play stupid road games. I'm sure you've seen those. People get aggressive with each other on the road. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=542.0s)]
*  When you're in a car, and this was explained to me, I forget who told us. Who told us this? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=549.0s)]
*  With the reason why road rage really exists at such a hyper level is because you're really tuned in because you're driving the car. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=554.0s)]
*  It's an extraordinary thing. You know things are happening fast, your mind's tuned in. So any little thing like, what the fuck? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=563.0s)]
*  You're already at like seven. Right. And so when you're already at seven and something happens, it freaks you out. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=570.0s)]
*  It's amazing how even-headed I think I am, but what really little it takes to set me off. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=577.0s)]
*  I like to think I'm a step above all that stuff, but I was in Mexico City the other day and this guy, I needed to find something. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=584.0s)]
*  A pharmacy. And so this guy was in the nice Beverly Hills part of Mexico City. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=591.0s)]
*  And this guy's walking, he's got a business suit on, and I literally, I don't look that great. My hair's all over the place. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=598.0s)]
*  And I said, can you tell me where a pharmacy is? And the guy didn't even look at me, he just kept on running. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=605.0s)]
*  I said, please could you just tell me where a pharmacy is? And the guy didn't even look at me. I was like, fuck! [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=609.0s)]
*  I went off on the fucking guy. He was just trying to get where he was going and didn't want to be stopped by some big hairy drug addicted looking thing that was coming at him for questions. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=614.0s)]
*  You do look a little sketchy. Like if you're asking for where the pharmacy is and I don't know who you are. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=623.0s)]
*  Right. And I'm basically wearing pajamas and the wind's blowing, but that's how far I am away from really snapping. I'm not hovering above anything, I don't think. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=628.0s)]
*  There was always the joke that you'd go to pharmacies in Mexico and just buy anything. Is that true? Because people would always say that. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=644.0s)]
*  They would call them like Mexican. I was always calling them Mexican supplements. Yeah. Like steroids and things that people get by them. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=651.0s)]
*  I think there are some things that you can get like Valium and stuff like that, but you can't go down there and get like opioids or you know. Oh no? I don't think so. I don't know. I don't know. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=657.0s)]
*  I mean according to a few TikTok videos I've seen, you can walk in and get lots of like steroid type stuff for sure. I'm looking on like for some good stuff. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=667.0s)]
*  Yeah, you can get HGH and stuff like that, but that's not what you're talking about. I'm talking about everything. Like what can you get? Yeah, yeah. No, I don't think it's really that open a book. I know you can get cheap dental care. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=675.0s)]
*  But I think they decriminalized a lot of things in Mexico fairly recently. Lexapro. So you can just go in with no prescription and buy. But the weird ones like Lexapro, that's like an antidepressant, right? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=686.0s)]
*  I have no idea what that is. You can just go buy ant penicillin. Yeah, and why not? I mean why should you have to go through it? If you know if you need penicillin, you're dick dripping, you know, get something for it. You know, go down there and patch it up. You don't want to admit it to anybody. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=702.0s)]
*  That thing is a Viagra. It's a blue pill itself. It's hilarious. Look at the dick on that. What does it say? Macho Caliente. Very hot. That's what that means. Very hot. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=717.0s)]
*  It's a pharmacy with a dude with a boner. He's got abs too. He's got a little gut, but he's got it's like a mix between me and Rogan. He's got a big old fucking upper body and a gut hanging down there. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=725.0s)]
*  It's a human Viagra pill with a boner at a pharmacy. And a Sobrero. Yeah, I know it's too bad you can't see this. Oh, I guess some people watch this on television. Yeah, some of them do, yeah. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=738.0s)]
*  Isn't that that thing from like the ancient times? Yes, it is. But it's also I think it's a sleeping pill. Right. But it's right next to a bottle of shampoo. Right. Or that's lotion, body lotion. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=750.0s)]
*  Isn't it kind of ironic that it's so is soma, is it sleeping medication? Funny what it is. Because the original soma was like from muscle relaxer. So the original soma, they don't even know what it was. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=761.0s)]
*  There's all sorts of questions as to what it was. They think it had something to do with mushrooms perhaps, but it might have been a bunch of other psychedelics too. They don't know what it was. I still don't know what it is. Have you heard the term? No. You never heard the term soma? It's like an ancient term for like some sort of a magical elixir. Am I saying that right? Yeah, I mean this one I Google it says it itself is also a god. So I don't even. Some drink is most famous. I want some. Yeah, ancient Indian drugs. Soma. Soma. Soma. Soma. Soma. Soma. Soma. Soma. Soma. Soma. Soma. Soma. Soma. Soma. Soma. Soma. Soma. Soma. Soma. Soma. Soma. Soma. Soma. Soma. Soma. Soma. Soma. Soma. Soma. Soma. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=775.0s)]
*  Soma. This is right down my alley made from a plant called soma is a god and a drink that was used as an offering to the gods in some Vedic rituals. Soma was celebrated at an early period as shown in the hymns of the Rig Veda. Wow. From when? They don't really. Oh, fucking thousands of years ago. When was that? And they still use this today? No, it's just it. You know, it's it's now it's more of a term. It's like a term as like a. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=805.0s)]
*  It's like a thing that cures all. A soma is a thing that clears minds. This doesn't say it's just a. Some you know, just various interpretations of what it does. But it's kind of crazy that they named a muscle relaxant that like how brazen how brazen. I bet you do feel better though overall. I bet you feel great. Yeah, my muscles are pretty relaxed all the time. Yours aren't. You need the muscle relaxant. What do those do to you? They just conk you out. They make me [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=835.0s)]
*  play better golf because it takes the tension out of my shoulders and my. Yeah, a lot of a lot of golfers use all kinds of meds to get loose or they actually go down to stretch lab and get those muscles all stretched out so you can play. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=865.0s)]
*  I've I've heard with pool players, Percocets is a big one. Well, that's all nerves, right? I mean, if you can't. Is that what Percocets do? Well, yeah, I think so. You know, calm your nerves or deaden them or whatever, you know. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=879.12s)]
*  I've never I've never taken it. I've been watching this. There's a pool player that comes up on my feed now and he's like an old kind of chubby, fat, Mexican looking guy. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=894.12s)]
*  And he's like the greatest pool player that ever lived. Efren Reyes. Is that who it is? From the Philippines. Fuck man. Yeah, I've been watching that guy play a little bit. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=903.12s)]
*  Once it gets on my TikTok, it starts feeding to me if I know I eat it. You know, they'll go here. Have another one. Have another one. But I liked watching the guy play fucking pool. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=911.88s)]
*  I'm just like, God, he's got he's fearless. You've got ice water just pumping through his veins. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=919.88s)]
*  He's a wizard, man, like a real wizard. He does things on a pool table. There he is. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=924.9599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that guy right there. That guy's all over my TikTok feed now. I can't get him off. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=930.1999999999999s)]
*  He does things on a pool table that are like magical. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=934.9599999999999s)]
*  How old is he? Well, he's older now. You know, he's probably in his late. Yeah, like 69, says. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=938.4399999999999s)]
*  And he's still still play. He still plays all the time. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=945.4s)]
*  They live stream videos of him playing down. That's what I'm getting, I think. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=948.96s)]
*  Yeah. So they have these setups like Efren Reyes is, you know, really arguably the greatest pool player in the history of pool players. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=953.84s)]
*  And he's now still playing all the time online and he plays online. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=962.68s)]
*  And he's not as good as he was when he was in his prime because, you know, he's 69 years old. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=968.6s)]
*  It's a young man's game. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=972.64s)]
*  I played pool my whole life. We had a pool table at my house when I was a kid. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=975.72s)]
*  And so so I always like watching, you know, trick players and people that could, you know, run the table and do weird shots and stuff like that. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=979.6800000000001s)]
*  This guy changed the way people stroke the ball. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=989.2s)]
*  He came along and he had this very loose and relaxed hand grip on the cue. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=993.2s)]
*  Whereas some of the American players, they were a little too tight with their hand on the cue. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=999.44s)]
*  And Efren came along and it was like this flowing sort of like almost like he was playing a musical instrument. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1005.12s)]
*  And the way he did it is so relaxed that his stroke, like the way the cue ball would dance around the table was wild to watch. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1012.4000000000001s)]
*  Right. Maybe that's what I'm so intrigued about, because I don't know exactly what I'm seeing. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1019.96s)]
*  But I was watching it on that and you can see he does have a different motion into the ball and even looks like, you know, with that. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1024.44s)]
*  Well, you've played pool before. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1031.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Right. So if you play pool before, you know, like when someone looks like they're good. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1033.0800000000002s)]
*  Like, oh, that guy looks like you can play pool. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1037.68s)]
*  You watch that guy and you're like, oh, this is like a completely different kind of thing. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1039.52s)]
*  And then you would guess that that I would guess if I saw him on the street that I could beat him at pool. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1043.52s)]
*  And then he would have all my money and I would go, what the fuck happened to me just now? [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1049.2800000000002s)]
*  They brought him over to America under a fake name to hustle with them. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1053.24s)]
*  They brought him over as Caesar Morales. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1058.28s)]
*  So these backers, they came from the Philippines. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1060.8s)]
*  These dudes are big money. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1063.4s)]
*  They came to America and they brought that dude. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1064.8s)]
*  No shit. Yeah, that's their killer. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1067.4s)]
*  And they brought him. The pool world is so sneaky that they brought him in under a fake name because they didn't want people to ask around back to the Philippines, like people to make calls to the Philippines. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1069.44s)]
*  Hey, who's this African Reyes guy? [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1080.24s)]
*  And then everybody would just say, oh, he's the best. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1082.2s)]
*  He's the best. So instead, they just came up with a name. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1084.08s)]
*  Caesar Morales. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1086.56s)]
*  And he won this giant tournament as Caesar Morales. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1088.0s)]
*  It's like a famous. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1090.68s)]
*  No shit. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1091.6000000000001s)]
*  I have it. I have it on a t-shirt that Morales stuns field at Reds. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1092.32s)]
*  So they just bring him in like the biggest pool tournament in the country. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1097.8s)]
*  And this guy's just robbing everybody. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1101.72s)]
*  Just robbing everybody. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1104.52s)]
*  Just just getting out in ways that people are like, oh, my God. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1106.08s)]
*  I could stroke his knowledge of where the ball's going, the creativity. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1110.44s)]
*  Just a genius. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1115.2s)]
*  Genius. Genius. A virtuoso. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1116.2s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I actually knew nothing about it because my phone figured out that I liked watching him. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1118.4s)]
*  Right. But you can still tell. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1125.48s)]
*  Yeah. You can still even though you don't play a lot of pool. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1127.0800000000002s)]
*  You look at that. You could tell. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1130.0s)]
*  You're like, wow, that's wild. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1131.48s)]
*  Yeah, I never played a lot of pool. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1133.92s)]
*  I was never good. I never had a good eye for the for the game. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1135.16s)]
*  I played a lot so I could play. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1137.8799999999999s)]
*  You know, I could beat my friends. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1139.48s)]
*  Yeah. But if somebody came in, it was like ping pong. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1140.76s)]
*  I could beat it. I beat the guys on my block pretty bad. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1143.1599999999999s)]
*  But if somebody came in, it was a player that could just push me around and shove me out of the door. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1145.8799999999999s)]
*  I've had a couple of fun opportunities to play like real pros here. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1150.1599999999999s)]
*  Like this guy Federer-Gorst. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1154.4399999999998s)]
*  He's probably number two or number three in the world. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1156.32s)]
*  Incredible player. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1160.9599999999998s)]
*  And me and him played for hours here. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1162.4399999999998s)]
*  When we're playing, it's just it's wild just to watch him up close do things. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1164.4s)]
*  You go, what the fuck? [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1168.8400000000001s)]
*  Like, how are you doing that so effortlessly? [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1170.24s)]
*  Yeah. It's like watching a professional golfer when you play golf, you know, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1172.8000000000002s)]
*  the smoothness and the precision is just like, fuck man. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1176.4s)]
*  Yeah. That's why I watch pro golfers and I get to play with them every once in a while. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1181.4s)]
*  And it's actually kind of like that guy's loose thing. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1185.16s)]
*  You know, that's how that golf swing is. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1187.8400000000001s)]
*  It's really loose and it's and it's and nothing's really connected hard. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1190.0800000000002s)]
*  To anything. And it just the way it comes through the ball. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1193.96s)]
*  It's just something magic happens. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1196.56s)]
*  Yeah, it's a I'm trying to strangle the club and beat it to death. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1198.96s)]
*  And it doesn't work at all. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1202.68s)]
*  And I'm writing a book right now. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1203.96s)]
*  Fifty years of bad golf. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1206.48s)]
*  How I did it. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1208.32s)]
*  And like I had a plan to do it this bad for so long. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1209.3600000000001s)]
*  Tony says you play good. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1214.72s)]
*  No, you know what? [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1215.8s)]
*  That I'm back like I'm like I was at anything. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1217.16s)]
*  I can I can beat guys my age if you don't know me and we're playing golf together. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1219.64s)]
*  I'll kick your ass. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1223.6s)]
*  But but am I a player? [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1225.1599999999999s)]
*  No, there are guys 10 years older than me that could beat me to death on a golf course. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1227.32s)]
*  You know, any of those old pro guys that I hook up with every once in a while daily can still beat me like a drum. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1231.6s)]
*  But isn't it interesting? [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1237.36s)]
*  It's like there's a control of a game like that. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1239.8s)]
*  What an extraordinary talent because it's so variable. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1245.0s)]
*  There's so many things going on. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1248.48s)]
*  You literally do never do the same thing twice the whole time you play golf your whole life, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1250.44s)]
*  because something's going to be different about the wind and the way and the where you want to kind of lie. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1256.5600000000002s)]
*  You got on the ground. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1261.3200000000002s)]
*  What club you need to get to that. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1262.24s)]
*  And it's all a game of questions. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1263.64s)]
*  And you and you rarely have the answer. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1266.64s)]
*  Even Ben Hogan, who is arguably the best ball striker ever, said that in an average day of golf, he hits two shots the way you want it to. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1269.2800000000002s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1277.24s)]
*  And the rest of them are close to that. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1278.4s)]
*  You know, so his misses are really good. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1280.16s)]
*  So if I hit one shot a month about that, I'll go that was perfect. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1283.4s)]
*  And that's that's about how often I can do it. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1289.48s)]
*  Everything else is pretty good. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1292.16s)]
*  It's such a fascinating game. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1293.48s)]
*  Yeah, you don't have the time. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1296.64s)]
*  No, you don't have the time. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1299.0400000000002s)]
*  No, no, I don't know. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1301.76s)]
*  I'm scared of it. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1303.8400000000001s)]
*  Scared of love it. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1305.72s)]
*  You would. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1306.84s)]
*  And but you've always had that position, right? [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1307.48s)]
*  You've always kind of looked at golf. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1310.04s)]
*  That's a good. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1311.3999999999999s)]
*  That's what people that want to get into golf. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1312.1599999999999s)]
*  They think about starting. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1314.44s)]
*  It's a waste of time and money. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1315.44s)]
*  You need to understand that going into it more time than you can ever imagine. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1318.04s)]
*  And you have to settle with how good you want to be, because to be better than that, you got to spend hours and hours. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1322.32s)]
*  But you can just if you can want to just rake it around, gamble with your friends, you know, you don't have to practice all that much. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1328.84s)]
*  I knew quite a few comic buddies that I think lost a little inspiration in their career because they were spending so much time playing golf. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1334.1599999999999s)]
*  Well, that's how I killed my days. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1343.4799999999998s)]
*  And I still do to this day. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1345.0s)]
*  You know, when I was on the road like you were, I don't know what you were doing during the day, but I was I was trading tickets for free golf, schmoozing wherever I could. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1346.56s)]
*  So you just play everywhere you go. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1357.0s)]
*  Yeah, we still do. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1358.52s)]
*  You know, that's nice. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1359.8s)]
*  We travel at night, wake up in a golf course, crawl out. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1361.1599999999999s)]
*  You're in the parking lot. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1364.04s)]
*  You know, it's like you were FedExed over there. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1365.1999999999998s)]
*  That's great. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1367.4799999999998s)]
*  Crawl out of the box and play some golf. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1368.12s)]
*  You know, kill another day. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1370.04s)]
*  Kill another day. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1372.4399999999998s)]
*  You're over here building the empire. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1374.04s)]
*  I'm killing another day. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1376.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but killing on the day is sweet. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1378.52s)]
*  Yeah, we'll do it that way. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1380.4399999999998s)]
*  I mean, what is life? [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1382.36s)]
*  What is life? [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1383.84s)]
*  If not enjoyment, it's all about love. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1384.4799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, it's all about love. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1387.4799999999998s)]
*  How much do you love? [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1389.2s)]
*  How much care you love? [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1390.52s)]
*  You know, outside of that, nothing really means much. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1392.28s)]
*  But yeah, but that's you know, it's a waste of time or whatever. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1394.68s)]
*  I could do charity events with golf. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1399.56s)]
*  People like to see me, you know, shake hands. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1401.1200000000001s)]
*  And I like doing that kind of stuff. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1403.04s)]
*  So, you know. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1404.52s)]
*  Well, you just love the game. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1406.28s)]
*  I do love talking about why you know, because I play it like like you in fighting, [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1407.96s)]
*  you know, exactly because you know exactly what that is that they're doing. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1414.0800000000002s)]
*  You can't even hardly explain it to me. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1417.88s)]
*  Even when you're trying to make me really understand what's going on exactly. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1421.1200000000001s)]
*  When two guys are on the ground and it looks like nothing's happening, [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1425.0400000000002s)]
*  then you're losing your mind because there's so many things happening. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1427.92s)]
*  That's a hard one to explain, too, [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1431.3200000000002s)]
*  because I'm trying to explain it while it's actually happening. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1432.72s)]
*  So I have to have the path carved out in my head, [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1434.68s)]
*  especially in like some transitions that guys do when they go and mount to rear [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1437.68s)]
*  naked choke and I'm trying to like set up what he's going to do while not stepping [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1441.8000000000002s)]
*  on what they're doing, you know, and then it's like this weird [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1447.32s)]
*  dance with a description of what's happening in real time. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1451.52s)]
*  Right. That's why nobody can ever take your job. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1454.6799999999998s)]
*  God, a lot of guys could do that. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1457.2s)]
*  No, that's not true. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1458.6s)]
*  A lot of guys. Not that's not true. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1459.8s)]
*  No, this guy's awesome at it. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1461.6399999999999s)]
*  If Rogan doesn't say it, it doesn't get said. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1462.8799999999999s)]
*  And that's true. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1465.28s)]
*  That's how people feel. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1466.6399999999999s)]
*  You know, they sit around waiting for you to tell them what to think and do. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1467.76s)]
*  And as far as fighting goes, that's ridiculous. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1471.52s)]
*  No, there's there's guys that are better at it than me. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1474.24s)]
*  Like Dominic Cruz is better at it from a technical standpoint than me. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1476.8799999999999s)]
*  You know, he's he's had he was a UFC champion. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1480.84s)]
*  He's had a shit ton of fights. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1484.08s)]
*  He knows a lot about the technical details. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1485.56s)]
*  But he's not but he's not Joe Rogan. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1487.9199999999998s)]
*  So it's not as fun to hear. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1490.52s)]
*  Yeah, for me, the fun, I get it. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1492.48s)]
*  But for me, the fun is the fight. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1494.76s)]
*  The fun is the, you know, the who the fuck knows what's going to happen. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1496.8s)]
*  You can you can tell that you can see the joy in your face that it brings you [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1500.56s)]
*  with all these these fucking events. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1504.68s)]
*  Well, you're getting to see the literally the greatest fist fighters of all time, [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1507.3200000000002s)]
*  the greatest stand up ground fighting, MMA fighting warriors of all time. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1512.92s)]
*  They exist right now. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1519.6000000000001s)]
*  Now, I get excited and I get that and I get that it's the ultimate sport. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1520.8400000000001s)]
*  OK, I'll fight you. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1524.64s)]
*  You know, that's how wars should be decided. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1527.0s)]
*  One guy and one guy. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1528.92s)]
*  Instead of we're going to take our lower middle class, [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1531.0s)]
*  put them in a field with your lower middle class. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1533.6399999999999s)]
*  They're going to kill each other. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1536.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1537.24s)]
*  Now, you ought to just fight me in the fucking alley. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1537.8s)]
*  That's too difficult, Ron. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1541.12s)]
*  Why? So they'd rather just fight you with narratives. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1542.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1544.9599999999998s)]
*  Fight you with mandates. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1546.0s)]
*  But you know, I won't listen to their narratives. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1547.12s)]
*  Yeah, that's how I defend myself. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1549.56s)]
*  I don't have I'm really careful about what information I let in my head [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1551.32s)]
*  because I don't know what's going to stew around in there. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1555.1599999999999s)]
*  I hear you, man. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1557.36s)]
*  I hear you, especially in this day and age. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1558.7199999999998s)]
*  And also, there's like there's so much to worry about. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1560.1999999999998s)]
*  Every fucking time I get on the news and I start reading what's happening in the world [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1562.96s)]
*  every day, it's something new that's insane that you have to worry about. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1568.6000000000001s)]
*  I know. And that's why I'm just real careful about what news I let in my head. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1572.6000000000001s)]
*  You know, and I don't let it in. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1578.16s)]
*  And I've got, you know, I've got news feeds on my phone that are these are news [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1580.4s)]
*  organizations that I trust that if something wacko in the world is going to happen, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1584.52s)]
*  it's news and they're going to pick it up. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1588.88s)]
*  But if it's something completely unverifiable that I don't even need to fucking know, [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1591.4s)]
*  they're not going to pick it up. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1595.6s)]
*  And so but if I know when people go down that fucking dark road in the web, [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1597.24s)]
*  they come out on the other side and sometimes they're you can't get them back. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1602.4s)]
*  You know, they're full blown. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1606.92s)]
*  I got friends that came back full blown QAnon. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1608.44s)]
*  They believed it. Satan. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1611.32s)]
*  They're Satan worshipping cabal of Democrats that eat babies. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1614.0s)]
*  I'm like, where are all the missing babies? [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1617.84s)]
*  You know, how many babies does it take to feed all the Democrats? [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1619.56s)]
*  If they're all drinking the blood of the babies, [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1623.76s)]
*  they're going to be some missing babies, right? [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1625.6399999999999s)]
*  Somewhere. No, no. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1627.32s)]
*  Yeah, they're from overseas. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1629.32s)]
*  I don't know. They've got some answer to anything you throw at them. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1630.72s)]
*  Tom Hanks. Like, that's not true. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1634.52s)]
*  Tom Hanks still making movies. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1636.92s)]
*  Tom Hanks didn't need a baby. Yeah, he did. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1638.48s)]
*  And they believe it. Where did the Tom Hanks one come from? [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1641.28s)]
*  I don't know. Where did that one come from? [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1644.08s)]
*  It's just straight out of QAnon. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1645.4s)]
*  It was their basic doctrine in the beginning was all this bizarre claims. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1647.3600000000001s)]
*  And I got a friend that's well, you met her. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1653.0400000000002s)]
*  And I'm not going to say her name, but it's I mean, she believes this with all of her heart. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1655.68s)]
*  Right. All of her heart. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1661.88s)]
*  And there's nothing I can do to to to say, you know, [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1663.2800000000002s)]
*  nothing I can do, nothing I can change my mind. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1669.0800000000002s)]
*  I think at least a certain portion of that is other governments fucking with people. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1670.96s)]
*  Absolutely it is. Absolutely it is. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1680.16s)]
*  Yeah. And you can sway the uninformed. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1685.08s)]
*  They're not uninformed. They're misinformed. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1688.48s)]
*  Yeah, they're informed. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1690.2s)]
*  You know, they're taking in information, but but but it's just the wrong information. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1691.48s)]
*  And you can be easily manipulated by that kind of stuff. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1695.8s)]
*  I mean, the human nature wants to go where it finds comfort, you know. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1698.56s)]
*  Yeah. And if somebody's feeding you what you eat, you'll go that way, you know, even if it's not good for you. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1702.84s)]
*  And people have a very strong desire to uncover mysteries. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1708.1599999999999s)]
*  Right. You know, very strong desire to get to the truth. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1712.6s)]
*  Yeah. Because in important situations, like if there's something real going on, [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1716.24s)]
*  that's a good quality. It's a good quality to have. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1720.96s)]
*  But if it's, you know, they're eating babies, [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1724.08s)]
*  it's like, OK, right. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1728.12s)]
*  What what's the benefit of eating babies? [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1729.4399999999998s)]
*  Like, why are they doing this? [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1731.84s)]
*  Yeah, it gives them some kind of superpower, you know. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1733.04s)]
*  It's so bizarre and so off of any what I would consider realm of possibility of even part of it being true. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1735.6799999999998s)]
*  But, you know, people go down there and they'll see just a path of things that lead them. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1744.72s)]
*  You know, some of it true, some of it not true, not true, not true, not true. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1749.48s)]
*  They'll head off down that direction. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1752.6s)]
*  They don't come back, you know. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1754.04s)]
*  It can separate families, man, that, you know, don't talk to grandpa anymore. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1756.96s)]
*  He's gone off the fucking deep end. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1761.24s)]
*  And you know what's really insidious about that is that the more crazy ones that are out there [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1762.52s)]
*  and the more people start linking them all together, [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1768.36s)]
*  the more real conspiracies sneak through. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1772.84s)]
*  Because if you're if you wanted to hide a real conspiracy, [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1776.44s)]
*  I would hide it in a bunch of other bullshit conspiracies. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1780.2s)]
*  I put a bunch of bullshit ones out there. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1784.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1785.72s)]
*  But I'd make it so that morons believe that Michelle Obama has a dick. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1786.1200000000001s)]
*  I would just pump it out everywhere. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1791.68s)]
*  I'd make fake videos. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1793.24s)]
*  That's what exactly what's going on. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1794.5600000000002s)]
*  That's what's going on. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1796.8s)]
*  And if you did that, though, then you could sneak in some real conspiracies and that otherwise people would think, [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1797.6000000000001s)]
*  well, that's outrageous. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1804.28s)]
*  That kind of corruption would be uncovered. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1805.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1807.8400000000001s)]
*  That kind of corruption would be prosecuted. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1808.1200000000001s)]
*  And you're like, wait, no one's going to anybody's getting busted for this. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1809.8s)]
*  This is right. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1813.4s)]
*  What? [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1814.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1815.3200000000002s)]
*  Nobody is right. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1815.64s)]
*  So it's not really happening. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1816.96s)]
*  It's bananas. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1818.6000000000001s)]
*  And also people want to, you know, I know somebody that has no formal education, right? [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1820.24s)]
*  I don't have any formal education. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1826.04s)]
*  I didn't make it through high school. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1827.2s)]
*  My favorite joke that I ever wrote was I do have a GED and if you don't know what GED stands for, [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1829.8s)]
*  you've probably got one, too. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1834.8400000000001s)]
*  My favorite jokes. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1837.48s)]
*  But, you know, they they they would love to have the answer to a question. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1838.8400000000001s)]
*  You know, they would love to be able to make a point of some kind. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1844.28s)]
*  You know, they would love to, but they can't because they're, you know, they're just sit around watching other people do it. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1847.44s)]
*  And I wish I could think of something to say and I can't think of anything. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1851.28s)]
*  Well, if there's somebody feeding them something to say, now they get real loud about it because they have a point to make, even though they don't understand it at all. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1854.96s)]
*  They just know how to sound like they're making a point like Lauren Boebert or, you know, Marjorie Taylor Green or whoever. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1863.04s)]
*  That's who they were. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1870.4s)]
*  And now they feel like they can make a point. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1872.5600000000002s)]
*  So they're real fucking loud about it. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1874.24s)]
*  And but if you've actually been around a while, you just sit around and shake your head and go, you're a goddamn idiot. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1876.0s)]
*  But all you got to do is be the smartest person in your region and boom, you're in Congress. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1881.44s)]
*  You know, they think she's smart as fuck down there in that one little section of Georgia where. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1887.3200000000002s)]
*  It's the problem with it is like how many people that you know want to run the government. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1892.44s)]
*  How many people do you know? [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1902.16s)]
*  How many I mean, how many people that you know that are like really healthy, clear thinking, business minded people that have been successful that want to run the government? [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1903.72s)]
*  Nobody, nobody, nobody. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1915.4s)]
*  So you're not getting any of those folks? [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1917.16s)]
*  No, you're not. And what you're going to get is you're going to get their money to influence things in the direction they'd like to see it go without them having to be there doing day to day stuff on it. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1918.8s)]
*  So they can have influence on it, but they don't want to they don't do they want to be the president of the United States. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1929.56s)]
*  Do they have it set up like a minor league, like they groom politicians, they get them to a position and like, I like how you stand on this. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1934.32s)]
*  But maybe if you stood a little bit further on this line, we could support you on this. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1943.28s)]
*  Absolutely. Absolutely. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1947.44s)]
*  And then they start grooming them for the big stage, just like you would do with like regional plays. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1948.04s)]
*  And all of a sudden you're on Broadway. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1953.08s)]
*  Right. Well, you know, that's the religious right. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1954.36s)]
*  You know, they're you know, they wanted they wanted somebody they want to get rid of abortion. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1957.08s)]
*  So what are they going to do? [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1961.36s)]
*  They got to stack those courts. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1962.28s)]
*  They're going to do you're going to. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1963.52s)]
*  OK, we got there's a trillion of us and we'll put you in office and we'll be but you got to you got to put this judge here and this judge there. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1964.6399999999999s)]
*  So what our thing comes to pass. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1972.96s)]
*  So that's just the way it works. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1975.04s)]
*  I'm even more cynical. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1977.12s)]
*  I just can't believe that human beings as a whole haven't resolved a bunch of different things. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1978.76s)]
*  There's a bunch of I don't believe are really coming back around. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1985.8s)]
*  I think people are making this argument that they're coming back around and they're highlighting moments where it's coming back around. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1989.92s)]
*  Coming back around to what? [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=1999.6s)]
*  I just don't. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2001.3999999999999s)]
*  I just I mean, I think this is one of the weirdest times ever for human beings to communicate. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2002.2s)]
*  And I think because there's so many of us and there's so many people that are talking and there's so many voices and it's happening on everyone's phone and it's happening all over the fucking world all at once. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2008.92s)]
*  Never been like this ever. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2023.1200000000001s)]
*  Ever. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2024.3600000000001s)]
*  In the history and it makes you wonder where it's going. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2024.92s)]
*  I think it's short circuiting everything. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2027.16s)]
*  It's short circuiting our government. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2029.56s)]
*  It's short circuiting. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2031.0s)]
*  It makes me nervous. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2031.9199999999998s)]
*  And one of the things that makes me nervous is government that we have. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2032.8s)]
*  It's complicated. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2035.48s)]
*  It is complicated. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2036.56s)]
*  So you just can't be some douche bag on the side going, I want them out of there. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2038.36s)]
*  You got to have a plan because this thing's got to work. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2042.76s)]
*  You want you don't want chef separation of church and state. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2045.9199999999998s)]
*  Well, why don't you just move to Iran then? [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2049.36s)]
*  Because that's what happened over there. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2051.48s)]
*  The religious right took over. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2053.04s)]
*  Now our laws are your laws. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2054.64s)]
*  That used to be a pretty normal place. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2056.2s)]
*  People don't believe that. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2057.64s)]
*  But Iran used to be fucking strawberry rivers and shit and normal people jobs. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2059.0s)]
*  And Ron, there were people that were willing to laugh at people's deaths because they [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2064.08s)]
*  didn't want to get vaccinated for covid. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2072.48s)]
*  There were there were people like that at the same time thinking they're good people. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2076.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2080.96s)]
*  All on the Internet. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2081.3199999999997s)]
*  I mean, I think that's the thing. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2082.2s)]
*  I know. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2083.7599999999998s)]
*  I know. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2084.24s)]
*  You know, when it came to all that stuff, you know, me, I don't talk about politics [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2084.68s)]
*  on stage and I never I never knew and I never will. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2088.2s)]
*  And it's not, you know, you just want to be able to sell tickets to both people. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2091.3199999999997s)]
*  But no, I want standup comedy to be a place where we can laugh and I'm going to do what [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2094.9199999999996s)]
*  I, you know, so I'm not going to take a position. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2100.24s)]
*  I never did. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2102.7599999999998s)]
*  If I was a political commentator before, OK, that's fine. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2103.24s)]
*  If I'm not Bill Maher. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2105.9199999999996s)]
*  So I don't bring it into my show because I want us all to come in and just be the [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2107.3599999999997s)]
*  And at the end of my shows now, I'm reminding people that no matter what our [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2111.24s)]
*  differences are, we just still came to this room and we all laughed at the same [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2114.4799999999996s)]
*  thing and we laughed hard and we loved each other and we had a great experience. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2118.3599999999997s)]
*  Let's remember that. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2121.4399999999996s)]
*  Let's try to get back to that. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2122.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2123.56s)]
*  You know, instead of all this, all these stupid little things that makes it look [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2123.9599999999996s)]
*  like we have it's like fake rivalries. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2128.64s)]
*  It's like it's not like, you know, Texas or New York or whatever. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2132.0s)]
*  It's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2136.2s)]
*  Texas and Oklahoma, they're you look you. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2140.72s)]
*  They're the same place. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2143.3199999999997s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2145.08s)]
*  There's no difference between those two places. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2145.6s)]
*  And they act like, well, we're Oklahoma. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2147.84s)]
*  And somebody put that in their head, you know, and what I was getting at was that [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2150.4s)]
*  if they're willing to do that over just some issue of whether you want to or don't [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2153.48s)]
*  want to get a vaccine, what would they do if they really believe that God was on [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2157.84s)]
*  their side? What would they do in a really bad thing? [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2162.64s)]
*  They could really when things go really bad. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2166.2799999999997s)]
*  Anything. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2169.16s)]
*  When the power goes out for a while. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2169.8399999999997s)]
*  Anything they could. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2172.72s)]
*  Yeah. And justify it. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2173.88s)]
*  And that's what's dangerous is they genuinely do believe that. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2175.7999999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2180.72s)]
*  That we would be better off if we did things like this for sure under these laws of [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2181.08s)]
*  God in this book, that by when Jesus would get back to his basic teachings that I [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2187.08s)]
*  really dug, you know, which is love each other, love, love, love. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2192.48s)]
*  And wait a minute, that was Lennon. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2196.92s)]
*  But still, Jesus was saying a similar song about, you know, [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2199.08s)]
*  and with a good positive message. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2204.04s)]
*  And that message was always of love. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2205.84s)]
*  You know, back when I went to church and, you know, my uncle still preacher to this [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2207.48s)]
*  day, Dr. Charles Pollard still preaching to the American Indians out in Farmington, [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2211.8s)]
*  New Mexico for no money. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2216.08s)]
*  You know, has 23 people about at every service. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2217.56s)]
*  Then he goes to jails and and he's 90 years old. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2221.48s)]
*  You know, still working to this day. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2225.2000000000003s)]
*  Still knocking it out for the Lord. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2227.04s)]
*  And and he used to be the president of the Southern Baptist Convention. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2229.6s)]
*  My uncle did. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2234.8s)]
*  So that was a very powerful position. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2236.0s)]
*  And then he fell out of favor with him because he just didn't believe in some of the [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2238.08s)]
*  doctrine. And then he started. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2241.84s)]
*  He showed up at my grandmother's birthday party on a Harley with no shirt on. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2244.44s)]
*  I'm like, oh, no, Charlie's gone nuts. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2248.92s)]
*  So he went down to Corpus. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2254.68s)]
*  I think it was. And he started this kind of the gospel according to Charlie thing. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2255.8s)]
*  And then it was just a kind of a phase he went through. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2261.2400000000002s)]
*  And then he, you know, but now he he's still believes in that basic doctrine. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2264.6400000000003s)]
*  And and I love him to death. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2271.84s)]
*  He's one of my favorite people. I'll talk to him all day long. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2274.04s)]
*  You know, I just he's a treasure really is. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2276.5600000000004s)]
*  And just a sweetheart of a guy about all about, you know, love and sweetness. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2280.04s)]
*  That's awesome. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2283.96s)]
*  His wife died. And and I asked him, I said, did your knowledge of of God and Jesus and [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2285.16s)]
*  did that help you with her death? [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2293.3599999999997s)]
*  And he goes, nope, not a bit. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2294.7999999999997s)]
*  It hurt and it hurt. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2298.3599999999997s)]
*  And I hated and I didn't understand it. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2299.72s)]
*  I was like everybody else, you know, you know, didn't even help. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2301.7999999999997s)]
*  So now, but that's just how honest he is. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2305.2s)]
*  So, wow. Uncle Charlie, isn't it fascinating how much [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2308.56s)]
*  religions practiced by so many different people in so many different ways? [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2314.64s)]
*  And yet, if someone tried to start a new one right now, good fucking luck. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2319.2s)]
*  Good luck. The feds would investigate you immediately. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2324.72s)]
*  But if you start your own religion, if you bought some land out in Bastrop, right. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2328.8399999999997s)]
*  And the wrong white church. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2332.96s)]
*  And you're already thinking about doing this, aren't you? [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2334.6s)]
*  You're just putting my name on it. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2336.6s)]
*  I know what you're doing. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2338.04s)]
*  I'm not interested in any of those activities. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2338.68s)]
*  I'm not either. But if you did, I would get my uncle to come run it. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2340.68s)]
*  They would. But you would 100 percent get investigated. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2344.12s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I would. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2347.16s)]
*  But if you wanted to open up a Catholic church, [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2348.0s)]
*  if you said you converted to Catholicism, you wanted to open up [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2350.68s)]
*  a Ron White's Catholic church, you'd be like, oh, with a mission and a respectable [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2353.84s)]
*  position to take, Ron, good, good for you. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2357.64s)]
*  Congratulations on converting. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2360.2s)]
*  It's hard to get new money. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2361.64s)]
*  Yeah, you can't start. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2363.32s)]
*  You can't be a startup in the religion world. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2364.52s)]
*  I think that's what Charlie found out. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2367.16s)]

*  250 people don't laugh. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2757.8399999999997s)]
*  And but when I was a kid, I was raised in the Baptist Church. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2759.48s)]
*  Uncle Charlie, my preacher when I was little. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2762.48s)]
*  And so but there was a storybook. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2765.48s)]
*  Wasn't the Bible, but it was just something we got in Sunday school [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2769.0s)]
*  and depicted Christians being fed to the lions, [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2771.92s)]
*  which always stuck in my craw, that that was a big story, a big deal. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2775.4s)]
*  I mean, you know, I don't I know we've all been oppressed, [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2778.8s)]
*  but feeding them to the lions, that's pretty big deal. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2780.84s)]
*  And I really thought it was universal knowledge. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2783.6800000000003s)]
*  So when they were looking for a new name for the Washington commanders, [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2785.52s)]
*  I suggested the Christians because when and I thought about this joke for three days [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2789.16s)]
*  and I thought about the buildup of laughter was going to get it was going to work so well. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2794.44s)]
*  And they were going to end up changing the name of the comedy club to Ron White's [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2797.52s)]
*  mothership because of this one joke and how well it worked. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2800.48s)]
*  But the way that it was going to start, the rumble was going to start [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2803.72s)]
*  as I said, when when Detroit comes to town, [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2806.16s)]
*  they're going to make the connections of Detroit Lions, Lions, Christians, [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2809.2s)]
*  my storybook from my childhood. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2813.04s)]
*  And that's what that's the rumble of the really hip laughter. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2815.4s)]
*  And because when the Lions get back to the that's the next laugh was going to be [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2818.68s)]
*  when the Lions meet the Christians on a pleven playing field. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2823.4s)]
*  So, you know, so none of it got a laugh. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2826.92s)]
*  None of it did. None of it worked. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2830.6000000000004s)]
*  And they stared at me and there was a good crowd, too. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2831.76s)]
*  They were waiting for the next funny thing that I said. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2834.6400000000003s)]
*  And and that was it. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2837.1200000000003s)]
*  And I really was expecting it. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2838.5600000000004s)]
*  And it just I was never been so wrong. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2840.0s)]
*  But do you think you are just old enough to where you're like over that curve, [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2841.84s)]
*  where the Christians and the Lions were more recent than they were? [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2847.0800000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I just don't think everybody got that storybook. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2851.76s)]
*  Nobody gets that anymore. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2854.1600000000003s)]
*  No, I didn't. Well, obviously. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2855.28s)]
*  I got it. Yeah. Christians and Lions. Yeah. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2857.1600000000003s)]
*  I got that connection. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2860.1200000000003s)]
*  I don't think kids get that. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2861.0s)]
*  You said you would have told me not to do it, which was a lie, [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2861.96s)]
*  because you would have told me to do it because you want me to try new shit. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2864.1600000000003s)]
*  Always wanted. But I just I was joking around. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2867.0800000000004s)]
*  You said, don't over the told you not to do it. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2869.36s)]
*  You would have told me to do it. You would have been wrong. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2871.28s)]
*  But you told me a bomb before I ever found out about it. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2873.5200000000004s)]
*  And I said, I was so bad. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2876.6400000000003s)]
*  It's so laughably. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2877.6000000000004s)]
*  I laughed so hard at how wrong I was. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2879.0400000000004s)]
*  That's how little you fuck around and find out. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2882.36s)]
*  And that's the truth. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2884.88s)]
*  That's how you mean. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2885.68s)]
*  Bits are fascinating. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2886.8399999999997s)]
*  They change. They change their structure like on stage. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2888.12s)]
*  I could do five minutes now on why that joke didn't work. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2891.24s)]
*  Yeah. And that would be way more entertaining than the joke ever was. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2894.2799999999997s)]
*  You know, show up Tuesday. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2897.52s)]

*  That's how they get it off of the water hose. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2919.7599999999998s)]
*  And he gets away and then the lion gets him again. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2921.52s)]
*  And the lion gets him again. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2924.3199999999997s)]

*  It looks like it's Russian. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2929.2s)]
*  If you don't find it, Jamie, I'm 99 percent sure I saved it on my phone [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2932.4399999999996s)]
*  because it's so fucked up. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2937.0s)]
*  But I'd have to go through it. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2940.04s)]
*  That would be some dead air. Russian hose. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2941.08s)]

*  Right. What are you doing in there? [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2976.92s)]

*  That happened in that room that I played at the Mirage. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2985.12s)]
*  That was that that was their room, man. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2988.2799999999997s)]
*  That's where that whole thing went down. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2990.0s)]
*  Yeah, it dragged him off. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2992.04s)]
*  Bit bit him by the neck and dragged him off in front of a live audience. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2994.3599999999997s)]
*  There's all the speculation to why it did it. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=2999.0s)]
*  All the spec. No one knows. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3001.56s)]
*  No one knows. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3003.8799999999997s)]
*  It just decided I'm going to bite this guy's neck and drag him off. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3004.6s)]
*  There was a thought that it was afraid of some woman had feathers on her hat [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3007.7999999999997s)]
*  in the audience and that it threw him off. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3013.16s)]
*  And I'm like, you really think that fucking tigers are scared of a lady [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3016.3199999999997s)]
*  with feathers on her head? That doesn't make any sense. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3019.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I think it just decided to bite that guy's neck. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3022.6s)]
*  But I'm not a tiger. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3025.6s)]
*  Maybe that guy would have been a was being a prick. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3026.2799999999997s)]
*  You know, under the guise of being an animal lover, [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3029.32s)]
*  but at night he was like, don't give him that expensive food and, you know. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3031.76s)]
*  Well, maybe it was like it was probably punishment. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3035.6000000000004s)]
*  It's probably what they do to the tigers to get them to listen. Right. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3038.84s)]
*  You know, like what did they do when you're training them? [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3042.52s)]
*  You know, did they ever cross the line where the tiger always remember [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3044.8s)]
*  the time you heard it and lashes out at you? [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3047.44s)]
*  Yeah, I'm going to find a fucking opportunity. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3050.1600000000003s)]
*  I'm going to sit here. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3052.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, you think the tigers are going to be served cold, baby. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3054.0s)]
*  It's going to be served cold. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3056.76s)]
*  It seemed like for the most part, they got along with those tigers [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3058.44s)]
*  for a long time, though. That's what's. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3060.8s)]
*  They lived at their house. Yeah. Right. Yeah. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3062.44s)]
*  Siegfried and Roy, they lived at their house. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3064.6800000000003s)]
*  They were at one with them. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3066.48s)]
*  They fucking cuddled them and loved on them. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3067.44s)]
*  And they do say that tigers, when they protect their cubs, that's [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3070.28s)]
*  that's how they do it. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3073.2000000000003s)]
*  They grab them by the neck and they drag them off. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3073.88s)]
*  But he's just too frail for it to do that, too. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3076.0s)]
*  It just fucked him up. Yeah. Right. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3078.92s)]

*  For real. Yeah. Not like a cub. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3089.8s)]
*  A lion. Oh, no. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3092.0s)]
*  The way a lion picks up the cub, it has all the skins or grabs all that. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3093.2400000000002s)]
*  You don't have any skin to scratch your fucking neck. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3097.08s)]

*  It is as a crippled person. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3106.6800000000003s)]
*  Well, he did. He lived several years, right? [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3109.96s)]
*  It was just a horrible story, man. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3114.04s)]
*  And that the show was shut down because like that's the reality [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3116.04s)]
*  of having tigers on a stage in front of a bunch of people. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3119.56s)]
*  Like, you just don't know. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3122.2400000000002s)]

*  and freak out and yell. Right. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3127.96s)]
*  And the thing could just launch itself. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3129.56s)]
*  Is this the question is, oh, don't you show it to me, son of a bitch? [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3132.28s)]
*  Try to find it. I don't. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3135.4s)]
*  What could go wrong? Everything. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3136.84s)]
*  You got to ask yourself that question. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3138.88s)]
*  What could go wrong? Because that might. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3140.44s)]
*  Oh, wait, you were saying something about his diminishing relationship [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3143.08s)]
*  with that lion. This is a tiger from four or five years ago. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3146.08s)]
*  I was trying to see if it had [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3149.08s)]
*  an answer to all the questions you guys are asking. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3151.72s)]
*  But it said something about his diminishing relationship with it. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3153.84s)]
*  Oh, my God. He wrote it like a horse speculation on from someone. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3156.52s)]
*  They asked on this. Yeah, like an ex-employee or something. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3159.7599999999998s)]
*  I think I saw that. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3162.36s)]
*  So he was going the tiger and him were not getting along. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3163.52s)]
*  That's again, it's a speculation. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3166.6s)]
*  This is says new allegations about the attack, which is [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3168.0s)]
*  this would have been like 15 years after the attack even happened. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3171.16s)]
*  Dude, almost nothing scares me more than animals. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3173.7599999999998s)]
*  Right. So scared of them. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3177.44s)]

*  I lived on the lake, Lake LBJ in this house, and there was a frog, big bullfrog. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3266.8399999999997s)]
*  And he was lived by my pier. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3272.68s)]
*  And I would go out there and I would see him and he'd always jump in the water. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3275.08s)]
*  And and but he was that's where he lived. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3278.12s)]
*  He was always a big old fat thing. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3280.8s)]
*  This big biggest bullfrog I'd seen. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3283.0400000000004s)]
*  And I'd go down there and fish and then they come back there. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3285.4s)]
*  And then one night he didn't jump. He stayed there. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3287.6800000000003s)]
*  And I'm like, oh, he's not afraid of me anymore. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3290.2400000000002s)]
*  And the next night I brought a net down and I caught him and I killed him and ate him. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3291.92s)]
*  I shit him into my toilet. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3296.36s)]
*  And and the other frogs went out and told other frogs, don't go near there [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3298.6400000000003s)]
*  because that's what's going on. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3303.48s)]

*  He's going to kill you and eat you and shit you into his toilet. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3307.32s)]
*  I think they figured that out. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3310.16s)]
*  I think they did. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3311.6800000000003s)]
*  I didn't see any more frogs after that, after the missing of that one frog. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3312.88s)]
*  Yeah, I bet if you started feeding them, they'd be hanging around. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3316.84s)]
*  But if you start killing them. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3320.12s)]
*  Yeah, right. They're probably right there. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3322.36s)]

*  And you could either easy to catch because there was a flashlight [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3356.6s)]
*  because they don't know that you can see them, you know, [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3359.52s)]
*  and they're making all that racket. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3361.7599999999998s)]
*  You just pick them up, put them in a can. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3362.96s)]
*  And then we would take them. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3365.08s)]
*  This guy didn't like had a pond right behind his house [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3366.6s)]

*  OK, so they put these mice in this fucking. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3428.92s)]
*  No, those are rats, man. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3431.28s)]
*  Those are little rats. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3432.88s)]
*  Yeah, those are rats. OK. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3434.52s)]
*  And then they put this giant frog in there with them. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3436.56s)]
*  And I don't know why they all they're trying to jump and get out. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3440.92s)]
*  And also in the frog, just decide to start eating them. I think. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3443.52s)]
*  I think they're trying to just trying to get out. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3448.36s)]
*  But look what he does. He's a monster. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3450.2000000000003s)]
*  This is like a Star Wars monster. Oh, my God. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3452.12s)]
*  Oh, dude, he's a job of the hut. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3456.56s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. He eats them all. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3458.88s)]
*  This one's not effective. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3461.48s)]
*  I've seen I think he's probably already full. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3462.7599999999998s)]
*  They probably look how fatty is they probably film these all day long. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3464.52s)]
*  How cruel. But he's anybody. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3468.16s)]
*  The one that I saw is anybody trying to put a stop to this? [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3470.56s)]
*  Nobody's putting a stop to nobody cares about the [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3474.24s)]
*  rats and the frogs, rats or frogs. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3476.52s)]
*  Get no respect. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3481.04s)]
*  We'll make that part of our religion. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3481.7999999999997s)]
*  Isn't it funny, though, like if the the rat was eating the frog, [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3483.3999999999996s)]
*  I'd be more disturbed. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3487.16s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3489.48s)]
*  Look at how gross that thing is. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3490.3999999999996s)]
*  Look at it. Look at how big it is. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3493.2s)]
*  I've never seen a frog shaped like that. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3495.2s)]
*  Oh, look at it. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3498.4399999999996s)]
*  Slow motion. Yeah, come on over here. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3500.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, let me tell you something. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3502.7599999999998s)]
*  Got a little story for you. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3504.4399999999996s)]
*  It seemed like the rat ran right in there like, fuck it. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3506.24s)]
*  What's it over with? [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3508.68s)]
*  Oh, my God, what a way to die. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3510.64s)]
*  Your balls hanging on the chin of a thing that's swallowing you. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3513.04s)]
*  Look at those little balls. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3516.9199999999996s)]
*  Oh, the last dying quiver. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3518.2s)]
*  Oh, bro, he's going to stay alive inside that thing's gut for quite a while. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3521.96s)]
*  Do not let your children watch this. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3524.96s)]
*  This is really, really gross. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3526.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I'm trying to unsee it. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3529.12s)]
*  I can't do it. I can't do it. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3532.0s)]
*  That's what happens. That's nature, man. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3533.7999999999997s)]
*  That's part of the Joe Rogan experience right there. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3535.96s)]
*  That's nature. That's why you should not have crocodiles in the street. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3538.32s)]
*  That's why you shouldn't import wolves into your neighborhood. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3542.88s)]
*  That's right. That's why you shouldn't bring grizzly bears back to California. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3545.76s)]
*  My mother. Slow down, everybody. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3549.2400000000002s)]
*  My mother wants to. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3551.0s)]
*  You know, you know how low things got with mom. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3553.36s)]
*  Now, I want a cat. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3555.48s)]
*  And I'm like, no, mother, you can't have a cat. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3557.44s)]
*  Jeannie's allergic to cats. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3560.84s)]
*  No, I want one of those Bingo cats. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3561.84s)]
*  They're hypoallergenic. Oh, my God. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3564.1200000000003s)]
*  For my mother, my 90 year old mother. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3566.32s)]
*  And yeah, I think they're pretty good sized cats, like 15, 20 pounds. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3568.6800000000003s)]
*  And I'm like, no, she said, I want you to get me a Bingo cat for my 90th birthday. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3574.0s)]
*  And I said, Mother, number one, I'm not advancing you any more birthdays. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3579.8s)]
*  You got to show me the number. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3583.0400000000004s)]
*  You got to get to the number before you get your 90. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3584.2000000000003s)]
*  I'm not fronting you any 90th birthday. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3586.32s)]
*  You have to get to that number to get that present because you already got them. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3589.0s)]
*  You know, you're already advanced all you can. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3592.1200000000003s)]
*  So so if she wants, she lives to be 90, she might get them. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3593.96s)]
*  Wow. Just a few months. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3599.0s)]
*  No, aren't I thinking of the same kind of cat like which ones are the which ones are Bengals? [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3600.16s)]
*  It's a horrible idea. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3604.8s)]
*  There's some of them that are they're basically like a wild cat. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3606.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Well, they're not very many generations removed. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3609.04s)]
*  I think is the problem. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3611.88s)]
*  And I think they're perfectly good cats, but they're really big. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3613.6s)]
*  And they're really a lot of energy. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3616.36s)]
*  I'm kind of different because you can take them out on a leash and stuff. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3618.56s)]
*  My mother doesn't want to do that. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3621.32s)]
*  I'm like, you know, at least one or something, a little lapdog. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3622.6s)]
*  Am I fucking this up? [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3627.88s)]
*  Is it the same thing as a bangle? [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3629.36s)]
*  The same thing as those other ones that I think they're called kittens, you know? [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3630.92s)]
*  Yeah, that's it right there. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3635.48s)]
*  That's a regular bangle cat. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3636.56s)]
*  OK. Yeah. So that's a regular cat. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3639.12s)]
*  So I'm thinking of that. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3641.28s)]
*  I'm thinking of a serval. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3642.6s)]
*  Oh, yeah. OK. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3644.36s)]
*  So what is a bangle cat? [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3645.68s)]
*  Just a cat, right? Is that? Yeah. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3647.32s)]
*  Yeah. But it comes from the bangle tiger. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3649.04s)]
*  And, you know, they're just a handful. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3652.68s)]
*  You know, it's not like a big old floppy lap cat. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3654.96s)]
*  These cats, you know, they kill their big time killers. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3657.8s)]
*  They got to be involved in stuff. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3660.92s)]
*  They've got a lot of energy. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3662.64s)]
*  They're big and strong. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3663.96s)]
*  So they're up to like, you know, 15, 20 pounds, I think. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3665.32s)]
*  Look at the description. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3668.96s)]
*  The bangle cat is domesticated cat breed created from a hybrid of the Asian [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3669.96s)]
*  leopard cat with domestic cats, especially the spotted Egyptian Mow. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3674.84s)]
*  So that there you go. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3682.56s)]
*  I was in my head. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3683.7200000000003s)]
*  I was like, I think I fucked up. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3685.2000000000003s)]
*  And it's the wrong one. That one is crazy. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3686.2400000000002s)]
*  I've seen people have that one as a pet. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3688.12s)]
*  There's you have. Yeah. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3690.48s)]
*  Yeah. Did John Jones have one of those? [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3692.04s)]
*  That's just a lion. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3694.4s)]
*  Didn't you have a crazy cat? [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3696.04s)]
*  He's got one of these. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3697.56s)]
*  What does he have? Oh, yeah. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3698.76s)]
*  Look, what kind of what kind is that? [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3700.36s)]
*  That looks like that bangle cat. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3701.92s)]
*  Yeah, it does look more like that than the serval cat. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3703.68s)]
*  It says serval, though, doesn't it? [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3705.48s)]
*  I typed that in. I don't. I was. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3707.12s)]
*  Oh, what kind of fucking cat is that? [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3709.44s)]
*  Does it have a jacket on? [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3712.56s)]
*  Yeah, it's got like a fucking leash. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3714.08s)]
*  That's a big ass cat. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3716.6s)]
*  Bro, I would not. Donald. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3718.72s)]
*  Careful, Donald. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3720.8399999999997s)]
*  Mother's mother's 90. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3722.24s)]
*  That's not what she wants. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3723.9199999999996s)]
*  And she gets so stubborn. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3725.12s)]
*  It could be. I want a cat. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3727.3599999999997s)]
*  It could be awesome. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3728.7599999999998s)]
*  It could be the greatest cat of all time. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3729.64s)]
*  Or it could be it decides to fuck you up and get an eater. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3731.08s)]
*  Yeah, you know, she couldn't defend herself if it went nuts on her. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3734.48s)]
*  That's what our story was earlier today in the episode. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3737.56s)]
*  Yeah, people getting eaten by [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3740.44s)]
*  tigers. Mm hmm. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3743.1600000000003s)]
*  First responders when they find bodies [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3745.1600000000003s)]
*  after people have died in a house with cats. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3748.0s)]
*  Doesn't take long for the cat to start eating. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3751.6000000000004s)]
*  Right. They don't give you a whole lot of time for this. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3754.0800000000004s)]
*  Oh, mama. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3756.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, dogs wait. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3758.6800000000003s)]
*  They will. Yeah, dogs wait until they're starving to death. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3761.32s)]
*  They're dying. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3763.84s)]
*  They don't even associate you with you anymore. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3764.84s)]
*  You just meet and they have to stay alive. Right. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3767.28s)]
*  Cats are like, I'm hungry. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3769.36s)]
*  Yeah. Eat Ron's lips. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3770.8s)]
*  Right. Get an eyeball nostril. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3773.1600000000003s)]
*  It's a fascinating relationship that we have to these small animals. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3777.08s)]
*  Like I was saying about your beautiful dog that you [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3781.2000000000003s)]
*  if you trace the lineage back of that thing, that used to be a wolf. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3784.84s)]
*  Somehow or another, they went from wolves to like more of a floppy [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3788.32s)]
*  eared animal to more of an animal that was like smaller that hung. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3792.6s)]
*  And then they figured out how to bring all the way to a [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3796.96s)]
*  rug that shits. That's what I own. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3799.24s)]
*  That's a rug that shits. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3801.3199999999997s)]
*  Like, how the fuck did they do that? [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3803.04s)]
*  So if you die in a home that's locked with animals, [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3805.08s)]
*  those animals will eat you really fast, especially a cat. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3806.9599999999996s)]
*  Dogs will hold out until they have nothing left to eat, [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3809.8799999999997s)]
*  but a cat will remove your head in 24 hours. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3812.04s)]
*  Wow. Oh, my God. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3814.64s)]
*  What kind of loyalty they got over all that love quick. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3816.3999999999996s)]
*  That cat never loved you. Oh, my God. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3819.7999999999997s)]
*  If it can eat your head in 24 hours, that cat never loved you. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3821.7999999999997s)]
*  It was just I need food. I'm going to be nice. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3824.64s)]
*  Do you know how to corner on it? [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3827.4799999999996s)]
*  Waiting for you to fucking die. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3828.72s)]
*  Like I explained it to him. Oh, the coroner was telling him. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3830.4399999999996s)]
*  Yes. Yeah, I think yes. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3832.4799999999996s)]
*  And like what kind of fucked up shit have you seen? [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3834.2799999999997s)]
*  It's like animals. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3836.12s)]
*  Would you play that play that right where you're saying that? [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3837.64s)]
*  Over and move your head within 24 hours is right before the head. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3840.2s)]
*  And back it up before that. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3843.24s)]
*  Back it up for that. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3844.8399999999997s)]
*  Well, so if you die in a home that's locked with animals, [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3846.24s)]
*  those animals will eat you really fast, especially a cat. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3850.2799999999997s)]
*  Dogs will hold out until they have nothing left to eat, [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3854.7999999999997s)]
*  but a cat will remove your head in 24 hours. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3858.0s)]
*  And I'm not talking I'm talking literally hair on the floor, no head [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3860.8399999999997s)]
*  and nibbling into their chest. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3865.2799999999997s)]
*  Even cats that were loved by their owners, or is it just cats? [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3868.2799999999997s)]
*  No, you think we're had something with the owner and they're [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3871.24s)]
*  and they're going to say this is my time. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3874.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, no, they're they're absolutely feeding on you. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3876.56s)]
*  You know, I don't care how much you love that cat and that cat loves you. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3879.56s)]
*  He's going to eat you. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3882.6s)]
*  And I just never, never imagined that they could do that much damage. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3884.16s)]
*  Smaller dogs now lab, a lab won't. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3888.64s)]
*  The labs, for some reason, don't eat their owners, you know, [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3891.0s)]
*  unless they're locked in for months, I guess they would. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3894.3599999999997s)]
*  But I find it more weenie dogs, small dogs and cats, cats, cats. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3896.64s)]
*  No, they don't wait. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3901.44s)]
*  And how do you know? [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3902.6s)]
*  Oh, I don't know if I believe the guy now. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3904.16s)]
*  Oh, why? Because I bet he has a lab. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3906.92s)]
*  So he had to say labs wouldn't eat you. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3910.2s)]
*  I mean, what makes a lab different than my sweet little Matty? [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3912.8399999999997s)]
*  He's saying Matty would go after you after a little while. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3916.64s)]
*  But but the lab, come on. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3919.24s)]
*  Yeah. Why would they think that the look maybe means like Chihuahuas [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3922.0s)]
*  or something like that, like or a little Jack Russell terriers? [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3925.04s)]
*  They'll fuck you up quick. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3928.3999999999996s)]
*  But like, what is what's the data on that? [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3930.12s)]
*  The labs really eat you when you're done off of his experience. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3933.12s)]
*  I don't know. I was trying to. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3935.8799999999997s)]
*  I don't know where he gets his expertise. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3937.2s)]
*  I'm not I'm not seeing this on NPR. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3939.76s)]
*  It's not coming on on my newsfeed. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3942.12s)]
*  I was also kind of making that point when I Googled that and typed it in. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3943.88s)]
*  It gives me like a tick tock fun. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3946.84s)]
*  Like that's the fact that Google gave me, which was a fact from Theo's podcast. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3948.52s)]
*  Oh, yeah. The top result. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3951.96s)]
*  And then they're calling it a fact. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3953.2000000000003s)]
*  I mean, well, I do know for a fact that cats eat people. Yeah. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3954.84s)]
*  Yeah. Well, that makes sense. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3958.28s)]
*  I mean, that's how people eat people. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3959.48s)]
*  I know people who have found people that where they got, you know, [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3961.32s)]
*  where the cops where they found people that were partially eaten by the cats. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3965.76s)]
*  That's 100 percent real. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3969.88s)]
*  That was a fun show. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3971.08s)]
*  Did that show for the cops? [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3972.7200000000003s)]
*  That was that was so much fun. That was awesome. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3974.08s)]
*  Three cops got thrown out. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3976.2000000000003s)]
*  That's right. They came to party. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3978.8s)]
*  They came to have a good time to party. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3980.92s)]
*  It was a lot of fun. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3982.92s)]
*  That was a good fucking time. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3984.28s)]
*  Those people don't get appreciated enough. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3986.52s)]
*  And that's the truth. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3988.12s)]
*  They don't get appreciated enough. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3989.6s)]
*  And if things go south, they're going to be the first people you call. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3990.76s)]
*  And you've been disrespecting them for so long and not appreciating [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3993.7200000000003s)]
*  how hard it is what they do for so fucking long. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=3997.96s)]
*  And that doesn't that doesn't excuse the bad ones. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4001.04s)]
*  That's not no, it doesn't. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4005.28s)]
*  It's just you can't lump everybody in with that same group. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4006.64s)]
*  Because most of them are great. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4009.2s)]
*  You got to have these guys. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4010.32s)]
*  You got to have this team, man. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4012.52s)]
*  You have to have them. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4014.2s)]
*  And it ain't the greatest job in the goddamn world. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4015.08s)]
*  And it sure is dangerous. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4017.36s)]
*  And some of them thrive on that kind of environment. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4018.52s)]
*  And that's great. I don't. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4020.44s)]
*  And so I need, you know, and it was just it was so cool [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4022.4s)]
*  to be able to make them laugh that hard because, you know, we had the death of that [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4026.44s)]
*  cop not too long ago, you know, that that's been a pretty dour place to work. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4029.76s)]
*  That's what the guy was telling me. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4034.48s)]
*  The chief police was, you know, they hadn't been laughing. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4035.84s)]
*  You know, they haven't been that really got everybody down and kept them down. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4040.16s)]
*  Of course. So that was cool. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4043.6s)]

*  It was real fun to do. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4047.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's it's, you know, we should have started a church that night. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4049.8s)]
*  We could have started with that. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4054.04s)]
*  Blonde, we got to plant these seeds carefully. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4055.2s)]
*  That's right. This is what we're doing today on the podcast. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4057.2s)]
*  We're planting seeds. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4059.48s)]
*  You can't just go out there and just dig a trench. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4061.2s)]
*  And the government starts getting involved quickly. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4063.4399999999996s)]
*  You know, like slowly plant seeds based on a story of love. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4065.64s)]
*  Yeah. And mutual respect. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4069.7599999999998s)]
*  It would be great if we could buy into a franchise like Chick-fil-A, [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4073.3599999999997s)]
*  you know, or something, you know, I mean, close in our burgers. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4076.3599999999997s)]
*  Just buy into something that's preexisting. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4080.2s)]
*  You know, our challenge is going to be started from scratch. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4084.04s)]
*  Yeah, just the church of Ron White, just from scratch. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4087.68s)]

*  But it's kind of funny. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4097.8s)]
*  It really is kind of funny that if we did just both of us become Christian [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4099.04s)]
*  and then open up a Christian church, no problems at all. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4103.24s)]
*  You know, I got like three million followers. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4105.24s)]
*  I wonder how far they would actually follow if I started leading. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4107.32s)]
*  You don't even want three million. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4110.92s)]
*  If you get three hundred thousand to move into a town [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4112.72s)]

*  They they literally bought into a town and it wasn't that bad. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4124.64s)]

*  You know, I can do this. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4132.12s)]
*  And then, you know, then it gets soaring. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4133.96s)]
*  Nobody can handle that kind of power. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4137.12s)]
*  Yeah, that's that kind of focus of energy. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4139.6s)]
*  And we yeah, you're the guy, you're the guy without it. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4141.84s)]
*  It corrupts. Well, it's just corrupt. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4144.92s)]
*  They're they're literally bestowing the word of God [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4147.16s)]
*  and the meaning of life and the meaning of the universe [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4151.12s)]
*  in front of their loyal following. Right. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4154.68s)]
*  This guy's got thirty one Rolls Royces, by the way. Yeah. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4156.76s)]
*  And they're just happy when he gets another one. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4159.8s)]

*  They brought in homeless people and buses so that the homeless people [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4271.6s)]
*  would become part of their community and they'd have more votes. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4274.96s)]

*  It wouldn't have been as good, though. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4459.76s)]
*  Location wise wouldn't have been as good. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4460.96s)]
*  This is this turned out to be heaven. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4462.76s)]
*  So we can't second guess anything that went down before it or after it or whatever. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4465.360000000001s)]
*  I feel like it lined up in the exact correct order. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4470.360000000001s)]
*  Like the universe opened up all the doors in the exact correct order. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4474.84s)]
*  And like I feel like the failed experiment with that other place [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4479.320000000001s)]
*  or the frustration and having it not come together was a good [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4483.48s)]
*  like a lesson, a good lesson in like how like real estate deals can go [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4489.639999999999s)]
*  and how all the issues with property. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4494.28s)]
*  Right. How careful you need to be. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4497.4s)]
*  There's a lot of stuff going on when you're buying stuff. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4499.0s)]
*  And sometimes you got to experience a failed deal and go, OK, that didn't work. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4501.839999999999s)]
*  Maybe this maybe this is better. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4506.719999999999s)]
*  And you were kind of impetuous, so you needed something to slow you down a little bit [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4508.08s)]
*  because you were going you were going pretty nuts with the city. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4511.5599999999995s)]
*  I mean, I talked to you one day. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4515.599999999999s)]
*  You were thinking about moving to Austin. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4517.08s)]
*  And the next day you lived there. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4518.879999999999s)]
*  You had a house on the lake. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4520.32s)]
*  You moved your studio like, God damn, this guy moves. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4521.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not I'm not interested in half asking things. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4526.0s)]
*  Oh, no, no, no. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4528.32s)]
*  If I have to do it right along with it. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4529.2s)]
*  That's what's the fun part about it is like a change like that is a big deal. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4531.32s)]
*  Well, if you really if you look at that, I'm pretty emotional about the mothership. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4535.599999999999s)]
*  But if you look at it, it was. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4538.8s)]
*  It was the only thing that could have got me where I am today. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4542.0s)]
*  Nothing, no other vehicle would have worked [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4547.28s)]
*  because I wouldn't have been interested in it. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4550.28s)]
*  I would have been interested in me being alone and isolating myself and all those things. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4552.400000000001s)]
*  But the mothership was that thing that was so delicious [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4558.360000000001s)]
*  and so perfect for what I needed at that point in my life. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4563.400000000001s)]
*  I think that universe used you just to get me [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4567.36s)]
*  back out of this fucking hole that I was in. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4572.5599999999995s)]
*  You know, you know where I was at. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4574.96s)]
*  You know, I was in a shitty fucking place and I needed. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4576.64s)]
*  I didn't know what to do. I didn't know where to go. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4579.96s)]
*  I didn't know what to do with my emotions. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4581.72s)]
*  I didn't know what to do with my, you know, doubting everything about my talent [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4583.72s)]
*  and all this stuff. And, you know, so [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4588.32s)]
*  nothing else would have got me where I am today. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4592.64s)]
*  And no other combination of things. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4595.0s)]
*  It wouldn't have been an open mic night and Webster [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4597.88s)]
*  wherever that I would have gone to and with any interest at all. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4600.2s)]
*  And really started to fall back in love with the art of doing stand up [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4604.2s)]
*  and be able to do all those reps. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4608.32s)]
*  You know, that doesn't exist anywhere else. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4610.5599999999995s)]
*  You know, that that's what happens at the mothership that [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4612.64s)]
*  you can go in there and sharpen the fucking blade. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4615.88s)]
*  You ought to see what I'm doing to these crowds on the road. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4617.8s)]
*  I'm beating the fuck out of them. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4619.84s)]
*  I'm having a blast, except I still hate to travel. But, you know, [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4621.32s)]
*  we're real lucky. We're real lucky. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4625.84s)]
*  And like I said, I feel like the universe opened up all the right doors [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4628.280000000001s)]
*  at all the right time. Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4631.04s)]
*  And put it all together in this perfect way. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4632.92s)]
*  And we all benefit from having all of us here together for sure. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4635.84s)]
*  It's 100 percent benefits your act. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4640.2s)]
*  100 percent benefits your joke writing and the amount of fun that you have in life. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4643.12s)]
*  And how hard we laugh in that green room. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4647.92s)]
*  And that's what I'm saying. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4650.08s)]
*  The amount of fun you have in life, it's the most fun. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4651.68s)]
*  And the best thing about the green room is how restrictive it is, [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4654.76s)]
*  you know, that you just can't go in there. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4658.76s)]
*  You know, you're just not you got to earn that spot in the treehouse. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4660.44s)]
*  You know, and so any time you open the door, you'll see, [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4664.28s)]
*  you know, some of the best comics alive [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4668.08s)]
*  sitting there talking about standup comedy and, you know, writing jokes [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4670.599999999999s)]
*  and laughing and having a good time. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4673.92s)]
*  But, you know, that's our fucking little space, man. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4675.48s)]
*  And it is the greatest thing on earth. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4678.44s)]
*  The one of the worst things that happens in green rooms, [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4680.16s)]
*  what Ron's talking about is like, you'll be in a green room [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4682.44s)]
*  and a bunch of agents will walk in and start talking. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4684.599999999999s)]
*  Especially in L.A. used to happen all the time. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4687.5599999999995s)]
*  They all wanted to go in the green room. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4690.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah. So they'd go in the green room. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4692.0s)]
*  And I've done shows before, like at these big theaters and there's people. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4693.839999999999s)]
*  I don't even know who they are. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4697.639999999999s)]
*  They're all hanging around the green room. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4698.5599999999995s)]
*  Like, OK, I don't even know who you are. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4700.719999999999s)]
*  Doesn't happen so much anymore. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4704.4s)]
*  But in the past. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4705.719999999999s)]
*  Oh, and I played big venues out near California. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4707.679999999999s)]
*  The guys I didn't even know from APA and, you know, CAA or whoever [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4710.799999999999s)]
*  the fuck I was with. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4714.96s)]
*  And the people from my office that I didn't even know, they're all back there [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4716.44s)]
*  in the green room, you know, trying to get a little by trying to prove to me [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4719.719999999999s)]
*  that they're earning some kind of fucking money. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4724.04s)]
*  I'm sending them or whatever. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4725.679999999999s)]
*  But that doesn't happen at the comedy mothership. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4727.5199999999995s)]
*  It's just us talking about it. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4731.2s)]
*  Really, nobody knows much more about the business of this than we do. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4733.36s)]
*  You know, the next collective group. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4736.5599999999995s)]
*  We feed off each other. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4738.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4740.24s)]
*  It's like we 100 percent feed off each other. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4742.400000000001s)]
*  And this wasn't designed to be a commercial for the mothership, [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4745.84s)]
*  but it sounds like one. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4748.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah, we're both super lucky. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4749.52s)]
*  All of us are not just us in this room, [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4751.68s)]
*  but all of us together that we're all in on this together, [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4753.88s)]
*  because that's what it is. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4756.4400000000005s)]
*  It's like we got a spot where we can all fuck around. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4757.320000000001s)]
*  And we have a lot of other spots in Austin now because of that. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4760.6s)]
*  And along with that. Right. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4763.96s)]
*  Basically, that makes the mothership a very proper name [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4766.72s)]
*  for that place, for that club. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4770.84s)]
*  Yeah, because everything else kind of feeds off of it. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4772.64s)]
*  You know, that was the point. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4775.4400000000005s)]
*  That was the idea. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4777.6s)]
*  Well, there was a bunch of other names that I had for it, [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4778.32s)]
*  but that was the idea. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4780.04s)]
*  What I liked about that one is that we all do travel and we're all stuck, [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4781.24s)]
*  you know, in this thing. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4786.4s)]
*  If you're if you're a standup and you, you know, you want to go on the road, [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4787.32s)]
*  you got to go places. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4790.68s)]
*  But you have a place to go back to where you can keep your skills, [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4792.08s)]
*  without traveling. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4795.76s)]
*  That's what doesn't exist anywhere else. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4796.96s)]
*  Well, that's what made me realize what we were missing when we came here. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4799.4800000000005s)]
*  When we first came here, we're at the Vulcan. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4803.0s)]
*  It was great, but it was it was a great place and love Nick [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4804.56s)]
*  and everybody that worked there. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4807.0s)]
*  But it wasn't set up perfect. Right. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4807.96s)]
*  It was hard to get around. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4810.400000000001s)]
*  You had to go downstairs to get on stage. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4811.4400000000005s)]
*  It was like there's a lot of annoying shit about it. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4813.12s)]
*  There was like kind of goofy the way it was set up. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4815.280000000001s)]
*  And it's a great room to perform in. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4817.76s)]
*  Like the acoustics are fun. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4820.84s)]
*  It rattles, you know, but I was like we. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4822.16s)]
*  But we need the setup to be correct. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4824.68s)]
*  And if we get the setup like completely correct, just do it [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4828.08s)]
*  absolutely the way a comic would want to be done. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4831.08s)]
*  Just do everything the way the comic may make it everything. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4834.200000000001s)]
*  So it's like the fucking easiest ride ever for the comics that come in. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4836.360000000001s)]
*  We go up the stairs. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4839.84s)]
*  That's right. Yeah, it's just easy. Fun. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4842.68s)]
*  Everybody's going to have a good time. Let's go have fun. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4845.240000000001s)]
*  Let's have fun. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4847.6s)]
*  And that's what we needed, because we were on the road all the time. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4848.4800000000005s)]
*  And when you're on the road all the time, it's like you're in these places. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4851.4400000000005s)]
*  You're only going to be there for a couple of nights. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4854.56s)]
*  You're doing your stand up with a couple of friends you came with. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4856.160000000001s)]
*  Then you go back home and then you wait to go somewhere else again. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4858.280000000001s)]
*  You don't have a home base. Yeah. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4860.8s)]
*  Touch in like Ron White. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4862.400000000001s)]
*  I was Cincinnati. Right. Like those those Tuesdays and Wednesdays are the shit, man. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4863.76s)]
*  They are. They're the shit. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4869.56s)]
*  They are. And, you know, it was kind of like it was at this store for a while. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4871.52s)]
*  Yeah. You know, when we were all supporting it at the same time and, [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4876.200000000001s)]
*  you know, the crowds were, you know, it was always packed [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4879.92s)]
*  because they knew they were going to get a show they couldn't get any other time [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4882.76s)]
*  for any price. That show doesn't exist anywhere else. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4885.68s)]
*  And the other night we did a show. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4889.320000000001s)]
*  It was me and you and Shane Gillis and [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4891.24s)]
*  Jim Norton, who's that guy makes me laugh harder than anybody. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4895.76s)]
*  He's hilarious. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4900.12s)]
*  Theo Varn came in. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4901.04s)]
*  It was all in one night at the Comedy Mothership. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4902.400000000001s)]
*  Crowd doesn't know. We don't even know. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4905.92s)]
*  You know, you don't even know who's all going to show up on the night. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4907.360000000001s)]
*  But there's always room, you know, if you're, you know, [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4912.04s)]
*  if you're one of the big Kamiya Mayas, you know, there's always someone coming by. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4914.5199999999995s)]
*  We always make room for you. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4918.76s)]
*  And it's just fun. It's just a real fun environment. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4919.92s)]
*  It's a real fun place to fuck around. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4922.5199999999995s)]
*  You know, and now that we have that, it makes it easier for us. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4926.16s)]
*  It makes it easy to you for you to do this tour you're doing. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4930.0s)]
*  Makes it for all of us. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4932.72s)]
*  It's just a place to keep your chops. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4934.16s)]
*  Yeah. You know, it's all. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4936.16s)]
*  And I don't care if you're doing short sets or long sets. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4937.72s)]
*  You need to be doing sets because it keeps that familiarity with you [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4939.96s)]
*  in that audience and keeps it keeps that all secondary. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4943.72s)]
*  It's something that you don't even think about. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4947.72s)]
*  It's what you do it every goddamn day. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4949.44s)]
*  And that's what you should do. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4951.24s)]
*  And then it doesn't matter if you're on the stage for for 15 minutes [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4952.24s)]
*  or an hour and 15 minutes. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4955.72s)]
*  It's just that you got to get on stage and talk to those people. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4957.0s)]
*  And just so it's second nature to you. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4959.96s)]
*  And if you don't do it for a while, it's not. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4963.36s)]
*  You think about it. Right. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4965.32s)]
*  We don't think about sense before we walk on stage at the mothership. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4967.08s)]
*  You know, it's just what we do all the time. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4969.72s)]
*  So but you remember what it was like when we took all those months off for Covid. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4971.12s)]
*  Then you did stand up. Fuck, I was horrible. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4974.320000000001s)]
*  I couldn't believe how bad I was. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4976.56s)]
*  And I didn't even know that was the big question is for me was I didn't know [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4978.4400000000005s)]
*  what I was so good at that made it special to watch. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4983.400000000001s)]
*  You know, I didn't because I was just doing an impression of myself [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4987.52s)]
*  and that I didn't have that confidence in all those things [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4991.16s)]
*  that that come from knowing what's going to happen. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4995.16s)]
*  I saw your first set back at the Vulcan. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=4997.4s)]
*  You fucking killed. Fuck, it was awful. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5000.0s)]
*  You fucking killed. You're out of your mind. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5001.719999999999s)]
*  You're out of your mind. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5004.2s)]
*  You got big laughs. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5005.839999999999s)]
*  I think it just didn't feel comfortable for you. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5007.16s)]
*  I think you didn't feel like you were killing because it didn't feel comfortable [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5009.799999999999s)]
*  because you just haven't done it in so long. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5013.12s)]
*  I think that's all it is. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5015.0s)]
*  But for the audience member, if you look at that set versus my [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5016.2s)]
*  15 minute set that I'm doing now, it's where you were talking about [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5021.28s)]
*  the other night that that timing and all that stuff is back to sharp. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5025.04s)]
*  You know how I got here stuff, you know, [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5030.04s)]
*  and that's all growth that comes from fucking doing reps. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5033.5199999999995s)]
*  You know, it's definitely it's a gym. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5036.88s)]
*  That's for sure. And if you work out, you see the results. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5039.4s)]
*  And if you don't, you don't. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5042.64s)]
*  I think it's just like golf. It's just like everything. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5044.2s)]
*  Yeah. Well, it's something I understand and I love, you know, and so I, you know, [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5046.56s)]
*  and if you only play golf with idiots. Right. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5051.56s)]
*  You know, you never fucking really learn to play golf. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5054.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. And you'd be going, I'm so great. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5057.36s)]
*  You know, it's it's better to hang out with guys that can hit the ball [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5059.36s)]
*  further than you. Yeah. You know, that's fine. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5063.32s)]
*  That's fine. Because you can still beat those guys. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5065.44s)]
*  If you're lucky, if you're smart. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5068.08s)]
*  Yeah. Well, that be there's always in groups of guys. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5069.76s)]
*  There's always the one guy who's the dominant golf player. Right. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5072.5199999999995s)]
*  And that's that used to be me all the time. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5076.92s)]
*  But now when I play now, I've got these friends that, you know, [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5079.08s)]
*  that are fucking pro. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5082.08s)]
*  Is that a reps thing? [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5083.400000000001s)]
*  Is that just a reps thing or is there a certain characteristic [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5084.52s)]
*  that some people have that makes them like really good at golf? [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5087.52s)]
*  I think that some people are born with a with an innate ability for athletics, [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5090.360000000001s)]
*  you know, and some people aren't. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5096.08s)]
*  And you can you can try to get to that place as hard as you want to. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5097.400000000001s)]
*  Like John Daly, you know, he's a gifted athlete, you know, [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5101.4400000000005s)]
*  and he would no matter what he had done, he would have been great at it. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5104.96s)]
*  But he chose to do it with golf. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5108.52s)]
*  And his situation at home was real fucked up, abusive father, horrible shit, [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5110.04s)]
*  just horrible shit. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5115.12s)]
*  I know a lot about him. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5116.72s)]
*  I've spent a lot of nights drinking with him. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5117.76s)]
*  And but he had these hands, man. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5119.96s)]
*  And this this ability to turn his back to his target and just keep going. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5123.5199999999995s)]
*  And it generated literally no one had ever seen anybody do what John Daly did [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5129.0s)]
*  when he first started hit when he first came on the scene. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5133.72s)]
*  They're the other pros were going out to the driving range, going, watch this. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5136.5199999999995s)]
*  And he's hitting the ball 75 yards past everybody [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5140.5199999999995s)]
*  and hit in the middle of the fairway with it. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5145.32s)]
*  They're like, and but he was so self-destructive [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5147.08s)]
*  that he he could he could manage it to some point. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5151.72s)]
*  You know, I don't know. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5155.28s)]
*  And John didn't know either, I'm sure. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5156.28s)]
*  But, you know, he won two majors, which, you know, most people that [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5158.04s)]
*  play professional golf or never win one and or never win a tournament [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5162.32s)]
*  most people didn't have a card to play on the PGA Tour, never win on the PGA Tour. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5166.5599999999995s)]
*  So he didn't do earth shattering stuff like Tiger did as far as the numbers go. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5170.24s)]
*  But, you know, he he just had that natural ability. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5175.5199999999995s)]
*  And his son is just like him, which is kind of a weird thing [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5180.24s)]
*  because that father son thing doesn't mesh up. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5184.16s)]
*  And then who knows if it ultimately will. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5186.28s)]
*  But his son's got a pocketful of money, bets with everybody there. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5188.5599999999995s)]

*  to today's fitness obsessed stars. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5330.6s)]
*  So if he drank 12 Coca-Cola's, though, you do have to think like [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5332.84s)]
*  that is a lot of energy and a lot of sugar. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5336.44s)]

*  whether he's playing a professional tour event or playing with the guys. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5353.0s)]

*  You got to hit that side. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5358.48s)]

*  And he's so unapologetic and and he's kind of a hero because of it. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5397.16s)]
*  He is. Yeah. Yeah. He's totally a hero. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5401.44s)]

*  that doesn't automatically make you no fun. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5555.32s)]
*  That's a separate decision you have to make. That's very well put. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5558.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. Right. Very well put. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5562.32s)]
*  I know a lot of comics that stop drinking like David Tell, [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5564.32s)]
*  I think is the best example of a guy who stopped drinking and just got way better. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5566.88s)]
*  Like he was always hilarious. He was always an amazing comic. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5571.4800000000005s)]
*  He's always been fun. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5575.32s)]
*  But I think it was just taking a toll on his body. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5576.72s)]
*  And then when he quit, it's like all of a sudden he had energy again. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5579.36s)]
*  He's writing a shit ton of great material. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5583.400000000001s)]
*  I think he's at like his highest level ever now. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5587.16s)]
*  And he hasn't drank in a long time. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5589.88s)]
*  Yeah. Just keeps getting better. Years and years. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5592.8s)]
*  And but, you know, he was out of control, though. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5595.4400000000005s)]
*  I mean, he was a little bit. Yeah. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5598.76s)]
*  Well, he had that show. Insomniac. Yeah. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5601.08s)]
*  That was true. I mean, that's what he would do every night. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5603.76s)]
*  I worked with him. I ended up doing a bunch. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5606.08s)]
*  I went to the Montreal Comedy Festival and he and I, we didn't know each other. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5608.36s)]
*  And we were doing a bunch of shows at the at the dirty show or whatever it was. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5612.28s)]
*  Oh, yeah. There were like 12 shows in a week. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5616.76s)]
*  And so we met that's back when he drank and I drank. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5619.2s)]
*  And and so we were fast friends. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5622.36s)]
*  And I thought he was funny as fuck. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5624.8s)]
*  I didn't know. I had never seen any of it. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5627.08s)]
*  And I just fucking love to tell. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5628.92s)]
*  He's so much fun. He's one of the best of all time. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5630.4400000000005s)]
*  But he would come through town and boy, after the show, he's gone. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5632.88s)]
*  You know, he goes into a dark netherworld of, you know, whatever's going on down there. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5636.28s)]
*  He finds it. And, you know, so. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5641.6s)]
*  But he didn't do anything. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5644.4400000000005s)]
*  I mean, he quit. He quit everything. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5646.24s)]
*  He got sober when. Yeah. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5647.84s)]
*  When people go, I heard you quit getting fucked up. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5649.76s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, you heard it wrong. You know, [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5651.96s)]
*  you just quit. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5655.12s)]
*  There's more than one way to skin a cat is the way I the way I look at it. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5656.08s)]
*  I think the way you're skinning it right now is the best way. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5659.6s)]
*  Fuck yeah, I think so. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5661.52s)]
*  It's the best way. It makes for the most fun. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5662.72s)]
*  I don't you know, I feel really good about all the decisions [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5664.320000000001s)]
*  I made that got me to where I am right this minute. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5669.0s)]
*  You know, as far as liquor goes, I didn't, you know, it makes for the most fun. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5671.0s)]
*  The situation we're in right now makes for the most fun. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5675.320000000001s)]
*  If they would just hurry up and decriminalize mushrooms [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5678.04s)]
*  and things along those lines. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5682.28s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, because then we'd start doing mushrooms. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5684.12s)]
*  But as long as they're against the law, we don't do them. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5686.76s)]
*  We're against it. That's what I'm saying. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5689.36s)]
*  We put we put a stop to it. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5691.28s)]
*  In fact, we're part of the mechanism. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5693.28s)]
*  Imagine if it's the only thing that can really get us out of this. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5695.12s)]
*  But we're all so dismissive of it. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5697.92s)]
*  Sounds loony tunes, right? [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5700.28s)]
*  But if you could give mushrooms to every living human being on this planet [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5702.12s)]
*  all in one day, right, sort a lot of shit out. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5706.08s)]
*  That's what Hicks said. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5708.96s)]
*  It was our accelerator pad to our evolution, you know. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5710.88s)]
*  But he was a big Terrence McKenna fan, and he quoted Terrence McKenna in his act. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5714.12s)]
*  And Terrence McKenna was the guy who came up with that theory [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5717.56s)]
*  that the reason why human beings evolved is from mushrooms. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5720.56s)]
*  Oh, OK. It's called the stoned ape theory. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5723.52s)]
*  It's a crazy theory. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5725.32s)]
*  What is feral scientists recommending easing restrictions on marijuana? [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5727.16s)]
*  Oh, I did see that. Yeah. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5730.2s)]
*  They want to make it a schedule three. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5731.68s)]
*  So it has some medicinal uses. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5733.96s)]
*  Shrooms are we that's just we that's weed first. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5736.12s)]
*  Oh, it'll never going to give it to you all at once. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5739.12s)]
*  It's just too revolutionary. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5741.5599999999995s)]
*  Well, Texas, you know, we still don't even have mercy weed. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5742.84s)]
*  You can't get weed if you have cancer, if you're dying of cancer. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5746.96s)]
*  I don't think so. Not in Texas. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5749.44s)]
*  There's no medical weed in Texas. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5750.84s)]
*  They have like point three percent you could get if you have [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5752.4s)]
*  if you're dying next week or something. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5756.24s)]
*  Right. Which is kind of weird because, you know, not that I, you know. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5757.84s)]
*  I mean, you can buy the edibles that you can buy in Texas. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5761.5199999999995s)]
*  Buy the edibles that you can buy or THC edibles. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5764.44s)]
*  And they but they got it that that law passed because they didn't understand [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5768.08s)]
*  the law because they were going by weight of something. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5771.799999999999s)]
*  And but they didn't realize that there's no OK. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5774.799999999999s)]
*  These gummies are 14 percent. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5776.5199999999995s)]
*  You know, so they're trying to fight it now. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5779.04s)]
*  But right now it's legal to buy that. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5780.879999999999s)]
*  But and then something that's just like pot like one milligram or whatever off. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5782.599999999999s)]

*  and I would never do anything. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5795.12s)]
*  Good for you. Illegal. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5796.599999999999s)]
*  Well, I witnessed Brian Simpson take a few of those gummies. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5798.0s)]
*  Yeah. Right. And they were supposed to be very mild. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5801.12s)]
*  And he was very upset at how fucked up it was. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5803.679999999999s)]
*  He was very upset. This is outrageous. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5806.879999999999s)]
*  He was he was shocked. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5809.08s)]

*  I've never tried. That's a good question. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5813.96s)]
*  That's a solid question, Jamie. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5815.759999999999s)]
*  What was the question? [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5817.32s)]
*  He said it's smelling salts wake someone up out of like a wist. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5818.44s)]
*  Stupor. Yeah, it will, because I've used those ones that are on the table [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5821.5599999999995s)]
*  in the green room. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5825.4s)]
*  Yeah. You ever get too stoned to do a set and then you just pick up [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5827.0s)]
*  one of those salts and just jerk you right out of it for a minute. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5829.839999999999s)]
*  You've only taken the ones that we have at the mothership then. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5832.96s)]
*  Though. Yeah. Right. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5837.24s)]

*  No. Oh, this is significantly stronger here at the. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5841.4s)]
*  The stuff that we have here in the studio versus the stuff [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5845.36s)]
*  that we have in the green room, the stuff we have the green was kind of old. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5847.64s)]

*  Do you knock into the dirt? [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5861.72s)]
*  It's worth experiencing, because it's so potent. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5863.160000000001s)]
*  Well, it's shocking. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5865.84s)]
*  Wait, let me get ready. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5867.0s)]

*  I'd say probably that one. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5879.76s)]
*  I'm sure that's definitely going to do the job. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5883.68s)]

*  He's an animal. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5954.92s)]
*  He only went up one side if I had to get that other side. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5955.88s)]
*  I thought he was going to leave the show. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5957.4s)]
*  I was worried you were going to get mad and leave the show. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5961.36s)]
*  That was like meth. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5962.92s)]
*  That's very potent. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5964.16s)]
*  That's what it feels like going down. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5965.72s)]
*  Well, this guy who created this is like this crazy power lifter, dude. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5967.92s)]
*  But there's no after effect of it, is there? [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5970.96s)]
*  No, I don't think you should do it too often. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5974.16s)]
*  I just did it once every 10 seconds. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5977.28s)]
*  It's not making me any smarter. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5979.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. OK. All right. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5981.32s)]
*  Well, I don't have any. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5983.08s)]
*  I don't have anywhere to go, but fucking up. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5984.48s)]
*  All of us have nowhere to go but up. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5987.16s)]
*  That's what AI is all about. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5989.16s)]
*  But I think it's probably not good. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5991.04s)]
*  That's that guy. He created it. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5993.8s)]
*  Look at the body on that son of a bitch. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5995.6s)]
*  Look at the crazy shit he can do. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5997.84s)]
*  Full splits in between chairs while holding up. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=5999.68s)]
*  It looks like Josh Blue. Yeah. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6002.12s)]
*  No, not in that picture. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6004.4400000000005s)]
*  I mean, dude's a crazy athlete like that is that is absolutely [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6006.16s)]
*  ridiculous strength to be able to do that. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6009.68s)]
*  And that's preposterous. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6011.56s)]
*  So so they a lot of those power lifter dudes, [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6014.68s)]
*  they take a big blast to the shit before they left. OK. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6018.16s)]
*  I say I want to look like that, but I'm 67. Right. Yeah. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6021.44s)]
*  How many hours a day? [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6025.639999999999s)]
*  Would I have to dedicate of my life? [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6028.2s)]
*  No bullshit. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6032.24s)]
*  I mean, of course, I could never get to that. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6033.36s)]
*  No, you can get to that. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6035.2s)]
*  But no bullshit. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6036.28s)]
*  You could change your entire body [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6037.36s)]
*  with weightlifting and steroids in a year. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6042.5199999999995s)]
*  We would get you to a Russian scientist [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6046.599999999999s)]
*  and they'd hook you up with the latest fucking greatest top shelf. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6048.8s)]
*  Like if we had a project like did you ever see that documentary? [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6053.68s)]
*  Icarus. It's a great Icarus. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6057.04s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. Yeah. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6059.4800000000005s)]
*  It's Brian Fogel's. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6061.08s)]
*  It says, right, Brian Fogel's. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6064.84s)]
*  Why didn't freeze there for Brian, who also did this dissident, [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6066.64s)]
*  which is another amazing documentary, but Brian did this race. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6070.92s)]
*  He did it completely clean. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6075.76s)]
*  And then he was going to get this Russian doping guy [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6077.8s)]
*  to tell him what to take. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6080.76s)]
*  And then he was going to do the same race the next year. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6082.16s)]
*  Juiced up. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6084.2s)]
*  He was doing it for a documentary to show what the difference is. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6085.12s)]
*  He's not competitive like he could win. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6088.4800000000005s)]
*  He's a very good cyclist, though. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6090.320000000001s)]
*  So in the middle of this process of going through this thing with this Russian guy, [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6091.68s)]
*  it comes out that the Russians cheated in the Sochi Olympics. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6096.28s)]
*  And so when they cheated in the Olympics, they used piss [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6101.400000000001s)]
*  that was like fake piss. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6105.88s)]
*  They like smuggled piss through a hole in the wall. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6107.12s)]
*  And this guy was a part of the whole program. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6109.28s)]
*  And he's in this documentary. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6111.76s)]
*  And these are all this is all happening. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6113.360000000001s)]
*  You're a cyclist. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6114.96s)]
*  You know, he's a cyclist. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6116.6s)]
*  He gets doped up for this documentary. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6118.52s)]
*  This is what he's doing. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6120.76s)]
*  And so in getting doped up with steroids and EPO, [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6121.400000000001s)]
*  he's talking to this guy who's the head of this Russian anti doping agency, [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6125.16s)]
*  who's really just they're just Russian doping. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6128.56s)]
*  So they just everyone's doped. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6131.24s)]
*  And this guy tells him everything. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6132.8s)]
*  He spills the beans on the whole program. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6135.04s)]
*  And now the guy's in like the fucking witness protection plan. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6137.2s)]
*  They've got him shuttled all around the country to keep him alive. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6140.72s)]
*  They want Russia wants him dead. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6144.08s)]
*  This fucking guy spilled. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6145.8s)]
*  They they juice the whole Olympic team. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6147.2s)]
*  And this guy, Brian, got very lucky and caught it in the middle of it happening. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6150.36s)]
*  So it's just dumb luck that the Russians get busted for doping [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6156.4s)]
*  while he's doing a documentary on doping with the guy who did the fucking dope. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6161.28s)]
*  And he didn't have anything to do with the them getting exposed. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6165.16s)]
*  No, not at all. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6168.5599999999995s)]
*  It was what happened was they used these jars that were supposed to be impregnable. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6169.5199999999995s)]
*  Right. So there's these jars you would urinate into the jar. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6174.28s)]
*  And then once they had your sample, it would be sealed in a way that no one could open. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6177.48s)]
*  Well, they found these micro scratches. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6181.5599999999995s)]
*  They're all over the inside of these supposedly sealed jars [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6183.44s)]
*  that led them to believe that someone had figured out a way to hack into that [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6186.64s)]
*  and open these things. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6189.64s)]
*  And they realized that the Russians had figured out a way with a new piece of equipment. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6191.04s)]
*  They engineered they got their own bottles and they got [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6194.88s)]
*  they engineered a tool that would allow them to open it up [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6197.92s)]
*  and then they would put it back on. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6200.48s)]
*  So they would go and they would take the piss out [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6201.92s)]
*  and they would bring it in with a new bottle. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6204.5199999999995s)]
*  And the new bottle was filled with clean piss. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6207.04s)]
*  And so there's literally they had a hole in the wall, [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6210.44s)]
*  literally had a hole in the wall where they were swapping out [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6213.68s)]
*  the clean piss for the dirty piss. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6216.12s)]
*  Look at this official urine sample room, hole and storage space. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6218.16s)]
*  And in the storage space is where they had all the clean urine. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6222.92s)]
*  And they got busted while this guy was doing it. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6226.2s)]
*  So if we got that guy, that Russian, right, to turn you into a fucking stud. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6228.36s)]
*  Yeah, just we need about 16 months. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6233.04s)]
*  You need about 16. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6235.44s)]
*  Do we really need a run? Why is it's all amped up on that? [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6236.32s)]
*  We don't need that. No, we don't need that. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6239.5599999999995s)]
*  But if you ever want to go that way. No, [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6241.12s)]
*  I you don't need that. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6243.4s)]
*  But just like, you know, you don't need to play golf. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6245.4s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I'm the one that asked the question. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6247.76s)]
*  No, no, no. It's a fair question. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6249.72s)]
*  It's like, how long would it take? [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6252.320000000001s)]
*  I mean, you're not obese. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6253.68s)]
*  You're fit because you walk around a lot. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6256.160000000001s)]
*  You're doing a lot of golf. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6258.0s)]
*  You're playing a sport all the time. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6259.040000000001s)]
*  So you're active. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6260.8s)]
*  I stretch for that for that game. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6261.96s)]
*  So I'm pretty I'm pretty limber for, you know, that 67 year old. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6264.360000000001s)]
*  That game looks like it would really benefit from like rotational work. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6268.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Do you do like you ever do with a trainer or do you do like cables? [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6272.8s)]
*  No, you know what? [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6276.8s)]
*  Everything I do in my golf swing right now, I do to avoid two tears [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6277.96s)]
*  I've got in my shoulders. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6282.2s)]
*  And but for the most part, it doesn't hurt to make that. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6284.08s)]
*  Well, because everything stays connected. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6286.72s)]
*  It's it's what I do like this that that they really hurt. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6288.320000000001s)]
*  Have you ever done stem cells? [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6292.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. Well, with the same guys that with the ways to well, folks. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6293.52s)]
*  And it's better than it was because before I couldn't do that at all. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6297.16s)]
*  And now I can. And it doesn't it doesn't really hurt that bad. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6302.2s)]
*  But before, if I got it to there and just pushed it back a little bit, [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6305.92s)]
*  it not only hurt, it hurt when I quit doing it. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6309.76s)]
*  And still, you know, it's not it's not exactly right. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6312.400000000001s)]
*  It's not exactly right. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6315.72s)]
*  I I have a plan that can help you tremendously that I use for my shoulders. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6316.84s)]
*  I have no affiliation with this company. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6322.240000000001s)]
*  It's called Crossover Symmetry. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6323.72s)]
*  I bought it. I bought it online. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6325.4400000000005s)]
*  I think I bought it on Amazon. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6326.92s)]
*  I had I had one at home and one at the gym. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6328.280000000001s)]
*  It's a bunch of different cords. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6330.64s)]
*  They attach to posts and they have these cables. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6332.240000000001s)]
*  And some of them are like 10 pounds, some of them are 15 pounds, some are 25 pounds. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6334.8s)]
*  And they give you a plaque and the plaque has a series of different exercises [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6338.72s)]
*  for your shoulders, all for shoulder strength. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6342.88s)]
*  It makes a giant difference, a giant difference. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6345.4400000000005s)]
*  So you use these cables and it's not hard work. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6348.88s)]
*  You're not like lifting heavyweight or anything like this. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6352.400000000001s)]
*  This is like rehabilitation and strength. Right. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6355.04s)]
*  So you're on the last ones. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6358.04s)]
*  You are getting like a good pump, but it's very controlled. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6359.84s)]
*  It's very controllable. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6363.24s)]
*  And in the process, you're strengthening your shoulders. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6365.04s)]
*  You're strengthening all the things that are not that strong, [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6369.28s)]
*  which is why you're probably getting injured in the first place, [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6372.72s)]
*  unless it's some sort of a catastrophic situation. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6374.96s)]
*  For the most part, people get injured because their shoulders just aren't in good condition. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6377.4s)]
*  Now, I fell when I was young off a cliff into a pool. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6380.64s)]
*  It was 78 feet, Hamilton's Pool right over here in Austin, Texas. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6385.6s)]
*  And I landed not like you should land. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6389.64s)]
*  OK, so it's catastrophic. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6392.32s)]
*  It ripped everything, it sprained both wrists and my shoulders. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6393.639999999999s)]
*  But I never had it looked at. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6397.719999999999s)]
*  It was just bad for a long time. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6398.719999999999s)]
*  Then I had it just a few years ago in Beverly Hills. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6400.24s)]
*  I had them do a CAT scan or whatever. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6403.28s)]
*  MRI, probably. What did they say? [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6405.24s)]
*  They said you got tears in both of them. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6407.639999999999s)]
*  There. That's where I fell right here. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6409.16s)]
*  It was 78 feet. Oh, my God. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6411.12s)]
*  And it was I was standing at the top where people were jumping off and I was really drunk. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6412.88s)]
*  And and I didn't really jump off. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6417.2s)]
*  I kind of tripped and stumbled and then just went, oh, well, I'm going with it and fell off. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6419.4s)]
*  Oh, shit. And I just landed like I was sitting down with my arms kind of back. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6423.32s)]
*  And it was just how deep is the water? [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6428.36s)]
*  Well, it turned out I wasn't very deep into it. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6431.16s)]
*  It's a pretty deep pool, but I don't even know. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6433.799999999999s)]
*  But I was this far underwater because that's how flat I landed. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6436.24s)]
*  I didn't even go underwater. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6439.04s)]
*  And so, no, that must have sucked. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6441.04s)]
*  I would knock the breath out of me and people were like, are you OK? [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6444.4s)]
*  And I'm like, which they they took that to mean I'm fine. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6447.52s)]
*  Yeah, don't do a thing. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6451.76s)]
*  Even if you have damage to your shoulders, that shoulder [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6452.92s)]
*  strengthening program will help you if you it'll help you retain [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6457.040000000001s)]
*  range of motion because you're doing it kind of slowly. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6461.360000000001s)]
*  And if you just stay persistent with it and consistent and just do it every day [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6464.8s)]
*  and if you're doing it every day, you're not even doing it like that hard. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6469.320000000001s)]
*  It's not like a thing where you're like killing yourself. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6472.280000000001s)]
*  But you're doing like eyes, wise and tease with like little dumbbells, [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6474.68s)]
*  do things like that and do just do like easy things that strengthen your shoulder. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6478.56s)]
*  You'd be amazed at how much more shoulder mobility and strength you'd have [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6482.320000000001s)]
*  if you just strengthen all the connective stuff. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6486.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I'm sure. I'm sure that doing anything would be more than I'm doing now, [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6489.120000000001s)]
*  which is absolutely nothing. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6494.080000000001s)]
*  Get a fucking trainer, Ron. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6495.76s)]
*  Get some. You know what I tried to get? [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6497.4400000000005s)]
*  I used to have a sassy young lady that's going to crack you into shape. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6499.52s)]
*  I used to have my yoga instructor [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6502.68s)]
*  would come over my house every day or five days a week. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6505.080000000001s)]
*  And she was beautiful and smart and funny and she was great. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6508.120000000001s)]
*  And I would it was basically a yoga nap. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6511.280000000001s)]
*  It was so easy breathing and then, you know, with smells. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6513.200000000001s)]
*  And she was all mystical and shit. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6517.52s)]
*  I like it. And but my girlfriend was like, yeah, yeah. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6519.8s)]
*  And I think you call on her part. Right. Right. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6524.120000000001s)]
*  Yeah, she was all over me. She's never wrong. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6527.080000000001s)]
*  She's got this intuition that she's never been wrong. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6529.040000000001s)]
*  Yeah. They don't want that around your man. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6532.6s)]
*  That's them yoga freaks. Yeah. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6534.88s)]
*  They're a little bit more in tune to sexuality in a room. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6537.160000000001s)]
*  It's 94 degrees and they're all sweating on top of each other. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6540.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. It has a lasting impression up in the air. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6543.68s)]
*  I mean, everybody's a little bit more free after a yoga class. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6547.4800000000005s)]
*  But it was still good for me. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6552.4400000000005s)]
*  It was a good way to start the day. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6553.92s)]
*  Oh, yeah. It's a great way to start it. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6555.8s)]
*  I used to love doing it that way when I lived in California. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6557.72s)]
*  I used to do the Bikram style. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6560.4s)]
*  They changed the name after he got busted a bunch of times. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6563.16s)]
*  But it was it was Bikram's when I first started. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6565.48s)]
*  And it was that series of poses, which I think he just popularized. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6569.44s)]
*  I don't I don't believe any of them. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6573.8s)]
*  I don't even know if he put them in that order, [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6575.84s)]
*  if they were already in that order that people do. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6578.28s)]
*  But whatever it is, that order, forget what you think about him. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6580.2s)]
*  As gross as that guy is that that guy is he's very funny. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6583.28s)]
*  He wasn't he wasn't all that gross. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6587.719999999999s)]
*  He'll one million dollars for one drop of my sperm. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6589.88s)]
*  You ever see him say that? Yeah. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6593.04s)]
*  You ever see him say that? A million dollars for a. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6594.48s)]

*  Yeah. Wild man. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6601.2s)]
*  But that guy, that's why you really can't start fucking your followers. [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6602.679999999999s)]
*  Because it's just going to he seemed even though it seems like a good idea [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6608.679999999999s)]
*  at the time, but yeah, he was getting a lot of he's a cult leader. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6612.24s)]
*  I mean, I think it's just like any other cult, [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6615.64s)]
*  even though it does provide the benefit of the yoga. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6618.04s)]
*  So the thing is, like whatever it is, like you take him out of the equation [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6621.0s)]
*  because it's not they're not his exercises. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6624.4800000000005s)]
*  And I don't think they're his order. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6627.08s)]
*  Can you find out if that's true if you put it in that order? [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6629.12s)]
*  If he invented the order. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6631.400000000001s)]
*  But whatever it is, if you just follow those exercises [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6632.84s)]
*  in that order, it's awesome. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6637.0s)]
*  And you do it every day. And there's no variation. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6639.4800000000005s)]
*  I love variation in the yoga class. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6641.88s)]
*  I love to be able to go into yoga class and doing different stuff. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6643.68s)]
*  It's fun. But I also love going to this class where it's a 90 minute class [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6646.04s)]
*  and there's a specific number of movements and you know what they are [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6650.4800000000005s)]
*  because you've done this over and over and over and over again. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6654.4400000000005s)]
*  And it's a fucking challenge. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6656.56s)]
*  And you're all in there cutting it out together. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6657.92s)]
*  Like, that's a real human struggle. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6660.360000000001s)]
*  I know it sounds like my experience was nothing like that. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6663.280000000001s)]
*  This was a guy. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6666.64s)]
*  I'm on a little thing stretching my back while I'm laying there, [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6668.360000000001s)]
*  breathing in some incense. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6671.56s)]
*  That's good, too. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6673.36s)]
*  But then, yeah, doing some breath work. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6674.4s)]
*  Listen, that's good, too. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6677.16s)]
*  Just breathing and no grunting. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6678.799999999999s)]
*  Well, with the 90 minute one, you got to be hydrated. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6681.96s)]
*  You got to be prepared for that. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6685.08s)]
*  You got to get some electrolytes in your system. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6686.44s)]
*  Yeah, I went to a hot yoga one time and I literally threw up in the parking lot. [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6688.12s)]
*  I was in there. It made me sick and I'd eaten, you know, whatever. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6692.2s)]
*  I guess you shouldn't eat. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6695.0s)]
*  I think they do it at 104. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6696.2s)]
*  I think it's 104 degrees. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6697.92s)]
*  Bukham also follows a sequence of 26 postures. [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6699.24s)]
*  Students improve flexibility and circulation through this sequence [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6702.36s)]
*  with the high temperatures allow them to enter each pose posture more easily. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6705.92s)]
*  The poses were chosen from chudhury, from classic Hatha poses [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6710.28s)]
*  designed to systematically move fresh oxygenated blood [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6715.2s)]
*  to 100 percent of your body to each organ fiber. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6719.32s)]
*  So so it was him. [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6722.16s)]
*  He came up with this sequence. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6723.92s)]
*  I think he hacked it, right? [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6726.28s)]
*  I think he hacked it. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6728.24s)]
*  I'm not finding anything that says he didn't. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6729.2s)]
*  Because he made a bunch of claims about winning yoga tournaments in this country. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6730.8s)]
*  And they're like, we don't have yoga tournaments in this country. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6734.400000000001s)]
*  So it's a yoga kumatai. [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6737.12s)]
*  They meet in the woods, yoga to death. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6738.4800000000005s)]
*  OK, Hatha Yoga Studio practice different types of yoga. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6741.96s)]
*  Most of you try to keep their hot yoga classes anywhere from a balmy 75 degrees [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6744.28s)]
*  to a steamy 95 degrees, elevated temperature. [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6748.08s)]
*  I think they do 104. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6751.04s)]
*  Yeah. OK. Oh, here it goes. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6752.76s)]
*  Since we practice Bikham yoga, our goal is to replicate the environment [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6754.88s)]
*  found in southern India. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6758.0s)]
*  Our yoga teachers set the thermostats from 103 to 108 degrees. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6759.24s)]
*  Let's go. Now, that's hot yoga. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6763.52s)]
*  That's what Tony does, right? [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6765.52s)]
*  He does that every week. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6767.0s)]
*  Yeah. Pink Floyd music. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6768.16s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. That's he says really good class. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6769.6s)]
*  But he loves doing that hot yoga. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6772.88s)]
*  It keeps Tony normal. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6774.32s)]
*  It helps him with his evil brain. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6776.2s)]
*  Yeah. His evil brain is a touch of the divine. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6778.24s)]
*  Yeah. He needs to be connected. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6780.88s)]
*  I love him to death. He's the best. [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6783.04s)]
*  You sold out the fucking Madison Square Garden. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6785.8s)]
*  So two hours to Madison Square Garden's. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6788.0s)]
*  They're killing the game. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6791.12s)]
*  They deserve everything they're getting. [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6793.200000000001s)]
*  You know what? And that just when he came up with that idea, [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6794.84s)]
*  that didn't sound like a good idea to anybody, I don't think, you know, [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6799.04s)]
*  that we're going to get guys that suck for sure. [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6802.6s)]
*  And they're going to do a minute and we're going to make fun of them or whatever. [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6805.52s)]
*  Try to help them or, you know, but [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6809.0s)]
*  but it's such an engaging, amazingly great idea. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6811.72s)]
*  Well, you know what it is? [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6815.04s)]
*  It's an idea that was developed entirely by Tony and Red Band together over years. [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6815.92s)]
*  So Tony comes up with the idea. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6823.160000000001s)]
*  He partners together with Red Band. [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6825.200000000001s)]
*  They figure out how to do this slowly over years. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6827.0s)]
*  So they're doing it in the belly room of the comedy store [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6830.52s)]
*  in front of like 50 fucking people. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6833.68s)]
*  There's no one there in the beginning. [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6835.320000000001s)]
*  They're doing from that to selling out Madison Square Garden [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6836.88s)]
*  in three hours in like 10 years. Right. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6840.200000000001s)]
*  We just but yeah, you can question it all you want to. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6843.4s)]
*  But if you leave a great comic alone and let him come up with his own thing, [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6846.36s)]
*  right, figure out no one's better at hosting a show than that guy. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6850.04s)]
*  Oh, nobody. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6854.76s)]
*  He's because, you know, he was he's into wrestling. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6855.5599999999995s)]
*  So everything he announces, it's hard to follow the fucking credits [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6858.5199999999995s)]
*  that he gives you when he brings you on stage in that thing. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6862.84s)]
*  You know, if you're one of his regulars, you know, [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6865.36s)]
*  you think this guy sold out three nights, it's fucking Madison Square Garden. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6867.4s)]
*  You got to go follow that intro. Right. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6871.2s)]
*  But, you know, yeah, nobody could do it. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6873.44s)]
*  And nobody else could do it. But he's so quick. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6876.04s)]
*  He's so quick with like roast lines like when him and David Lucas go at it. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6879.08s)]
*  I swear, I don't think I ever laugh harder in life when him and David. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6883.639999999999s)]
*  There's some videos of him and David Lucas going out of where I'm red, [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6888.679999999999s)]
*  like a grape, and I can't breathe because I haven't. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6892.76s)]

*  I'm just dying. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6898.96s)]
*  They're so good at going back and forth with each other. They're so good. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6900.280000000001s)]
*  There's a shit ton of videos. We don't have to play any of them. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6904.2s)]
*  But if people are interested, there's a shit ton of videos online [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6906.56s)]
*  of Tony and David Lucas. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6909.04s)]
*  They're like I've been telling these fucking dudes since the beginning of time, [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6910.96s)]
*  not like Tony needs anything else now. Right. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6913.92s)]
*  If you wanted to do another podcast, the podcast is him [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6916.08s)]
*  and David Lucas just talking shit and reading the news. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=6919.360000000001s)]

*  and he put in an ad for a private investigator's assistant. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7284.72s)]
*  It was really just someone to drive him around because he didn't have a license. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7287.28s)]
*  And so I was looking for like unconventional ways [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7290.56s)]

*  I was just like one open mic, two open mics in like I just started. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7300.2s)]
*  And I met this dude and he was absolutely the funniest dude [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7304.24s)]
*  I'd ever met in my life. [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7307.92s)]
*  I couldn't believe how funny he was. Right. [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7309.12s)]
*  Funnier than any of the comedians at the clubs. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7310.76s)]
*  Totally natural. [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7313.92s)]
*  Laughing about everything. [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7315.64s)]
*  And the guy fucking went cold turkey. [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7318.04s)]
*  No AA, no programs, no nothing. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7320.360000000001s)]
*  Crashed his car, ran from the cops, got busted. [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7322.68s)]
*  And he's like, you know what? I'm fucking done. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7325.44s)]
*  I'm fucking done. [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7328.0s)]
*  This guy was a character man. [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7328.96s)]
*  He was a fucking character. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7331.44s)]
*  His name is Dave Dolan. [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7333.44s)]
*  He used to call himself Dynamite Dickless Dave Dolan. [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7334.44s)]
*  He's one of the funniest fucking human beings I've ever met. [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7336.799999999999s)]
*  And you just drove him around? [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7338.719999999999s)]
*  I drove him around for months because I forget how long he lost his license for. [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7339.5599999999995s)]
*  I don't know what it is. [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7343.92s)]
*  You know, when your license gets suspended for DUI, [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7344.88s)]
*  but he lost it for quite an amount of time. [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7347.5199999999995s)]
*  And during that time, I was making my transition from [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7349.5599999999995s)]
*  stand up, from fighting to stand up, [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7353.76s)]
*  because I was I was in the middle of both worlds. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7357.2s)]
*  And it was while I was working for him. [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7359.44s)]
*  Were you still playing pool? [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7361.28s)]
*  Were you playing competitive pool? [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7362.84s)]
*  No, I wasn't playing pool at all. [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7363.92s)]
*  No, I wasn't playing pool at all. [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7364.8s)]
*  I didn't start playing pool until I hurt my knee. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7366.28s)]
*  I mean, I played a couple of times here and there with friends, [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7368.84s)]
*  but I wasn't like really into it until I tore my ACL. [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7370.68s)]
*  You know, if you have an ACL injury, it has to be diagnosed. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7374.08s)]
*  Then you have to schedule an appointment and you have to get surgery. [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7377.92s)]
*  So it was a long time where I couldn't I couldn't do any martial arts. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7381.04s)]
*  It was just too unstable. It was really fucked up. [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7384.84s)]
*  I badly tore my ACL and tore my meniscus. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7387.280000000001s)]
*  It was like real wobbly. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7390.8s)]
*  So I really couldn't do martial arts. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7391.96s)]
*  I was only just like lifting weights and I was looking for something [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7393.160000000001s)]
*  challenging to do and me and my friend would go. [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7395.92s)]
*  He got a job. My friend John got a job working at this pool hall. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7398.360000000001s)]
*  And he and I would just go there and just knock balls around for free [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7401.4800000000005s)]
*  during the day because he was working there. Right. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7403.84s)]
*  So he'd be like work them on the counter. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7406.08s)]
*  And I just got obsessed with it. [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7407.72s)]
*  And I just happened to be around all these people that were like [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7409.56s)]
*  really good players, like high level professionals would come in from the road [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7413.0s)]
*  because it was a gambling pool hall. [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7417.84s)]
*  It's called Executive Billiards and White Plains. This Boston. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7419.4800000000005s)]
*  Now, this is New York. OK. [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7422.120000000001s)]
*  So I was I didn't really get into pool until I was like 20, [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7423.84s)]
*  three, 24, 23 or 24. [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7427.88s)]
*  That's when I really started getting into pool. [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7431.160000000001s)]
*  I know before stand up or. [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7432.76s)]
*  No, I was in the middle of stand up. [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7434.64s)]
*  It was it was a problem where like my manager said to me, he goes, [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7436.4400000000005s)]
*  I think you care more about pool than you do your career. [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7439.52s)]
*  And I was like, oh, shit. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7441.52s)]
*  I was like golf. It was right. [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7442.72s)]
*  You're golf. I was playing every day. [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7444.160000000001s)]
*  Eight, eight, 10 hours a day. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7446.4400000000005s)]
*  No, every day, every day. [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7447.76s)]
*  I was traveling to go play in tournaments. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7449.52s)]
*  I was going to tournaments many nights of the week [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7451.52s)]
*  that I could have easily been doing stand up. [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7453.360000000001s)]
*  I was going to play in tournaments. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7455.200000000001s)]
*  I'd go to Connecticut to play. I'd go to Jersey to play. [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7456.320000000001s)]
*  I go to West End Billiards and watch the Killers play. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7459.4400000000005s)]
*  Wow. West End Billiards was this place in a real sketchy part of New Jersey. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7462.64s)]
*  Oh, sketchy. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7468.48s)]
*  And it was this place where it was world renowned as being like a players pool hall, [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7470.08s)]
*  like Hawaiian Rodney Morris was there and fucking Mike Segal played there. [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7476.48s)]
*  Like the greats of all time. [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7481.84s)]
*  They haven't even had places like that around here. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7483.68s)]
*  It's not that many of them. There's hard times in Sacramento. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7487.12s)]
*  That's still a big one. That's a big one. [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7489.84s)]
*  They stream big tournaments from there. Yeah. [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7491.84s)]
*  That's that one's legit. [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7495.84s)]
*  That's a legit like real players pool hall. [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7497.6s)]
*  But there's not a lot of them left in the country, unfortunately, [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7500.64s)]
*  because the game is not very publicized, [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7505.68s)]
*  except it's got more of a following now because of the internet, [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7507.52s)]
*  because people are watching those clips. Right. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7510.08s)]
*  Watching. And they realize real high level pool, [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7511.68s)]
*  you know, like Joshua Filler. Watch that guy play. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7514.8s)]
*  My favorite is this guy from Taiwan. His name is Koping Chung. [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7517.84s)]
*  He's my favorite. He's so smooth. [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7522.8s)]
*  When you watch that guy move the ball around the table, [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7527.04s)]
*  it's so effortless and precise. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7529.28s)]
*  And his cue ball control is just magical. Magical. [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7531.84s)]
*  He played in the US Open and won 11 games in a row on a four inch pocketed table. [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7536.08s)]
*  If you knew how crazy that is to run those kind of racks on a four inch pocketed table, [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7544.16s)]
*  it's like almost unheard of. What is a four? I don't even know. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7551.12s)]
*  OK, so if you buy a Brunswick Gold Crown stock from the factory, [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7554.72s)]
*  it probably has five inch pockets. [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7559.76s)]
*  If you buy a diamond, it has four and a half, [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7562.0s)]
*  but you can get it all the way down to four. [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7564.64s)]
*  And they got it all the way down to four. [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7566.320000000001s)]
*  Four inch pockets are fucking small. They're small. [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7568.320000000001s)]
*  And this fucking dude ran 11 games with four inch pockets. [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7571.68s)]
*  With four inch pockets. He went through the entire... [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7576.8s)]
*  He ran 11 games? I mean, like the other guy didn't get a shot for 11 games? [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7580.48s)]
*  Either the guy had a shot and missed and then he ran out or he had a safety. [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7584.799999999999s)]
*  He made a safety and the guy had a kick and then he got the ball back. [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7590.32s)]
*  But whatever he did, he just played like perfect pool for a number of games. [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7594.16s)]
*  See, if you watch the guy play, man, if you really know how to play, [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7600.639999999999s)]
*  it's just effortless. There's something about the style. [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7604.24s)]
*  And he just keeps getting better too. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7607.84s)]
*  Every time you see him in each tournament, he just gets a little bit better. [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7610.64s)]
*  These guys all stopped playing because of the pandemic. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7614.24s)]
*  So for a couple of years, they couldn't play internationally. [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7617.04s)]
*  So they kind of fell off a little bit. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7621.04s)]
*  And only the guys who were in certain tours where you were allowed to still play, [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7622.88s)]
*  guys were playing with masks on, it got real weird for a while. [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7626.72s)]
*  And some of the guys since international travel was limited, [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7630.400000000001s)]
*  they didn't get that high pressure going to the US Open in Atlantic City. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7632.88s)]
*  That was the big one where he was at. [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7637.2s)]
*  That's like a big... [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7638.72s)]
*  That's where he was while that was being shot. [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7639.679999999999s)]
*  That's all the killers from all around the world gather up in Atlantic City. [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7641.5199999999995s)]
*  And do they know who's going to win before they go into it? [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7645.2s)]
*  You can't know who's going to win. They're too good. [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7648.16s)]
*  I mean, so there's not a number one that's significantly better than everybody else, [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7649.92s)]
*  like there was in golf for years with Tiger Woods. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7654.8s)]
*  There's a guy named Shane Van Boning and he's won more than anyone. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7656.639999999999s)]
*  And he's won the US Open. [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7660.72s)]
*  He's tied with Earl Strickland, who's another one of the all-time greats. [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7662.4s)]
*  Maybe Strickland has more. [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7667.12s)]
*  Strickland might have more. [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7668.48s)]
*  Who won the most US Open, Shane Van Boning or Strickland? [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7669.5199999999995s)]
*  Either way, this guy wins everything. [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7672.799999999999s)]
*  He's won World Nine ball. [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7675.28s)]
*  He's won the US Open multiple times. [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7677.12s)]
*  He's favored to beat most people, but that doesn't mean he's going to win. [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7680.08s)]
*  Because a guy like Ko Ping Chung could just run out. [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7684.0s)]
*  And you don't even get a shot at it, right? [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7686.32s)]
*  Okay, Earl Strickland and Shane Van Boning, both from the US, [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7689.04s)]
*  share the record for winning the US Open Nine ball championship the most time. [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7691.759999999999s)]
*  Strickland in 84, 87, 93, 97 in 2000. [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7695.52s)]
*  And then Van Boning in 2007, 12, 13, 14, and 16. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7698.8s)]
*  He's evil. [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7702.72s)]
*  He's evil on the table. [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7703.84s)]
*  And when he plays, he shuts his hearing aids off. [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7705.12s)]
*  He's got hearing aids. [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7708.08s)]
*  He shuts those bitches off and he's in a world of his own, man. [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7709.36s)]
*  He doesn't hear any jeering. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7712.400000000001s)]
*  Pinball wizard. [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7713.76s)]
*  He's the pinball wizard. [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7714.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7715.76s)]
*  He's the pinball wizard. [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7716.24s)]
*  Yeah, he's a monster, man. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7717.68s)]
*  He's a monster. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7719.12s)]
*  One of the greatest players of all time. [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7720.4800000000005s)]
*  If you have a list of the top five greatest players of all time, [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7722.799999999999s)]
*  and you have Shane Van Boning on that list, we're not having a conversation. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7726.48s)]
*  You're a silly person. [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7730.16s)]
*  And what's his mothership? [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7731.04s)]
*  Where does he go to hang out, play pool? [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7732.24s)]
*  South Dakota is where he started out. [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7734.719999999999s)]
*  They call him the South Dakota Kid. [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7736.32s)]
*  He had a table in the basement that had really tight pockets. [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7737.599999999999s)]
*  And he would practice his break on it so much that the center of the table was just [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7740.5599999999995s)]
*  white from being compressed from the cue ball, smashing into the rack, [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7744.88s)]
*  and then slapping down the same spot over and over. [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7749.12s)]
*  He broke so much that he created like a white cloud around where you rack the ball. [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7751.28s)]
*  Wow. [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7755.759999999999s)]
*  Because he's just obsessed. [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7756.16s)]
*  And like universally regarded as one of the greatest breakers of all time. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7758.24s)]
*  So these guys are on some spectrum. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7761.759999999999s)]
*  A hundred percent. [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7764.24s)]

*  that are like normal guys. [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7785.599999999999s)]
*  Like you could hang out with them. [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7787.28s)]
*  They're cool as fuck. [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7788.4s)]
*  It's just an obsession that they could have been doing that with anything else. [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7789.5199999999995s)]
*  Could have been disc golf. [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7793.44s)]
*  It could have been frisbee. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7794.88s)]
*  Carpentry. [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7796.08s)]
*  Whatever it is. [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7797.2s)]

*  It's a crazy Tiger stat I just saw all over the weekend. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7801.12s)]
*  Over a 10 year stretch from 99 to 2009, Tiger was more likely to win 34% than finish 9th [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7803.759999999999s)]
*  or worse, 32% for 10 years. [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7810.0s)]
*  That's insane. [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7812.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7813.04s)]

*  Nobody ever racks up those kinds of numbers. [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7814.56s)]
*  He's a monster. [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7817.44s)]
*  You got 150 people every week. [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7818.4s)]
*  So you should win one out of 152, you know, instead of 25% of the ones that you fucking [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7820.64s)]
*  enter, it's just crazy. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7829.12s)]
*  Yeah, you have to be. [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7830.56s)]
*  I'd never be done again. [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7831.28s)]
*  I'd like to think. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7832.56s)]
*  A mad genius to pull that off. [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7833.44s)]
*  And a mad genius raised by his dad to be that from the time he was really young. [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7835.6s)]
*  You know, you'd have to have a springboard. [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7840.24s)]
*  Right. [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7843.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7844.0s)]
*  I mean, that's what he was. [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7844.16s)]
*  Right. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7845.2s)]
*  And also, like, if your dad plays golf, man, if someone in your family plays, I really, [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7845.44s)]
*  really wonder this. [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7850.32s)]
*  If you are you transferring some of your comedy into your kids? [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7852.16s)]

*  I forget how they ran that study, but they think that there's some aspect of thinking [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7866.32s)]

*  It was a fucking really smart guy. [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7969.76s)]
*  I forget who it was. [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7971.2s)]
*  But someone told me that there was two different strains of syphilis and one of them seems to [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7972.24s)]
*  have definitely come from North America. [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7977.12s)]
*  Sailors came over in the 1400s with the Pinta and the Santa Maria and shit. [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7980.96s)]
*  When they went back, they brought syphilis with them. [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7985.04s)]
*  Because it seems like there was a different strain of syphilis that ran through Europe [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7987.28s)]
*  during that time period. [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7990.88s)]
*  The same place where these people had just got back from North America. [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7992.16s)]
*  So they picked it up from our locals? [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7994.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7996.8s)]
*  And took it back with them? [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7997.2s)]
*  That's what we did. [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7998.16s)]
*  We gave them horrible diseases. [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=7999.04s)]
*  They gave us a few. [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8000.4s)]
*  Make fucking holes in your face. [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8001.84s)]
*  The syphilis one was a wild one. [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8004.8s)]
*  That's a wild one. [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8007.84s)]

*  That slow brain rotting fucking nothing you can do about it. [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8012.08s)]
*  Isn't it scary that diseases like that come from sex? [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8017.36s)]
*  So weird. [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8021.04s)]
*  So weird that nature is so concerned that we're going to overpopulate. [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8022.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8026.4s)]
*  That it gives you diseases that you only get from sex. [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8026.72s)]
*  You have to live in fear. [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8029.599999999999s)]
*  There's a scary one, syphilis and AIDS. [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8031.12s)]
*  What scares you more than syphilis and AIDS? [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8033.04s)]
*  Nothing. [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8034.72s)]
*  Doc, I'm not feeling so good. [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8035.68s)]
*  Syphilis or AIDS? [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8037.28s)]
*  Either one. [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8038.88s)]
*  I'm like, oh shit. [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8039.4400000000005s)]

*  Magic toss is doing okay. [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8044.0s)]
*  As much shit as people talk about pharmaceutical drug companies or medical science in general, [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8046.72s)]
*  I am so thankful they exist. [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8051.92s)]
*  Because if it wasn't for them, if there was no penicillin, [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8054.72s)]
*  do you know how fucked we'd be? [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8060.400000000001s)]

*  They are. [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8064.72s)]
*  That's true. [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8065.36s)]
*  But isn't it great that we have [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8066.16s)]
*  antibiotics? [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8068.8s)]
*  Because if it wasn't, half the fucking people would be dead. [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8069.92s)]
*  Right. [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8074.08s)]
*  Not half, but you know what it's like. [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8074.4800000000005s)]
*  Back in the day, if you got a staph infection, that was a wrap. [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8076.0s)]
*  That was it, buddy. [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8079.4400000000005s)]
*  That's right. [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8080.8s)]
*  It's going systemic. [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8081.360000000001s)]
*  It's taking over your blood. [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8082.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and if you had breast cancer, you were done. [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8083.6s)]
*  That's just pure death sex. [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8085.68s)]
*  Bone breaks. [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8086.88s)]
*  And that's a wrap. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8087.6s)]
*  You're losing that leg. [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8088.96s)]
*  Teeth gone. [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8090.4800000000005s)]
*  Done, you don't eat, you starve. [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8091.6s)]
*  You can't keep up. [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8093.68s)]
*  There was this tribe that I was reading about. [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8094.8s)]
*  I forget whose book was it. [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8097.2s)]
*  But it was about what happens with the older women in this tribe. [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8099.360000000001s)]
*  It's horrible that the younger males, when they realize the older women aren't keeping [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8104.08s)]
*  up anymore, they'll sneak behind them and bludgeon them over the head. [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8108.88s)]
*  What's not keeping up? [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8113.68s)]
*  They don't keep up because they're nomadic tribal people. [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8115.2s)]
*  And it's, you know. [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8117.76s)]
*  Oh, you mean they're like lagging behind the group as it moves? [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8118.4800000000005s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8121.6s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8122.16s)]
*  And then what happens to them? [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8122.8s)]
*  They get killed by the younger males. [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8123.92s)]
*  So they have a fear of the young males. [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8125.76s)]
*  A natural fear. [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8128.400000000001s)]
*  A natural fear. [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8129.04s)]

*  Fear. [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8130.400000000001s)]
*  It's supposedly accepted in the tribe because it's understood that at a certain time you're [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8130.88s)]
*  putting them in danger. [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8138.88s)]
*  You're putting them in danger by slowing them down. [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8140.16s)]
*  Right. [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8142.8s)]

*  Things I bought are just gone on iTunes. [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8213.359999999999s)]
*  Now it says they're not available in the country that you're in. [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8216.0s)]
*  I'm like, this is the country I bought them in. [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8218.24s)]
*  Yeah, that's weird. [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8220.16s)]
*  That might be a glitch. [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8221.039999999999s)]
*  I don't know how that works. [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8222.08s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8223.199999999999s)]
*  But I was reading something very bizarre about Google and their terms of service [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8223.759999999998s)]
*  and what they're going to do to adjust something for a sensitive event. [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8229.839999999998s)]
*  Did you see that? [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8234.56s)]
*  I could send you the article, but it was one of those ones where I read it and I was like, [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8237.439999999999s)]
*  I read like one paragraph into it and I was like, Jesus Christ, this is starting to make me angry. [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8241.12s)]
*  I don't want to read into this. [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8246.0s)]
*  I don't know where my phone is, but I wanted to ask because it's something literally, [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8248.800000000001s)]
*  I go to Almond Brothers and go to, I want to listen to a song. [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8252.880000000001s)]
*  It says no longer available in the country you're in and that's iTunes. [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8259.2s)]
*  And then I can, but I can push the button and say, play [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8262.08s)]
*  the Almond Brothers band and it'll play it. [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8267.04s)]
*  But I don't have it at my command on iTunes like I did. [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8269.679999999998s)]
*  I don't know where it went. [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8272.96s)]
*  I thought I was buying that stuff. [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8273.76s)]
*  That's what I meant. [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8274.96s)]
*  But I don't know. [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8275.599999999999s)]
*  Apparently I wasn't buying it. [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8276.16s)]
*  I just thought I was buying it because it isn't there anymore. [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8278.8s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know how that works. [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8281.84s)]
*  They must have some different licensing deals with certain songs. [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8282.96s)]
*  Jamie, that's not it. [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8285.92s)]
*  It's something that was real recent and they were talking about [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8287.599999999999s)]
*  what they would do for a significant cultural event. [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8291.439999999999s)]
*  Let me see if I can. [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8296.16s)]
*  This is a new policy going to affect February 2024. [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8297.28s)]
*  Clearly defines what constitutes a quote sensitive event for purposes [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8300.0s)]
*  of prohibiting certain exploitative or insensitive ads and content. [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8303.28s)]
*  Yeah, that's it. [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8307.68s)]
*  While Google already had policies in place for ads and YouTube monetization, [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8309.6s)]
*  this expands the restrictions to Google's publisher network as well. [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8312.640000000001s)]
*  And so there was, it was defined in a certain way. [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8316.720000000001s)]
*  See if you could pull up what it actually says because the way it was defined, [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8319.84s)]
*  what disturbed me was that it's very blanket. [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8323.52s)]
*  A sensitive event is defined as an unforeseen or unexpected situation [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8327.44s)]
*  that poses significant risk to Google's ability to provide high quality, [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8332.800000000001s)]
*  relevant information while reducing insensitive content. [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8336.480000000001s)]
*  I have a concern with that. [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8341.68s)]
*  Insensitive content in prominent and monetized features. [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8343.12s)]
*  Insensitive to who? [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8349.04s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8350.640000000001s)]
*  So open and subjective. [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8351.12s)]
*  Now listen to this though. [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8352.240000000002s)]
*  Sensitive events include those with major social, cultural, or political impact, [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8353.52s)]
*  such as civil emergencies, natural disasters, public health crisis, terrorism, conflict, [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8358.16s)]
*  or mass violence. [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8364.0s)]
*  So what they're saying is you must be sensitive if you're going to discuss civil emergencies, [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8365.28s)]
*  natural disasters, public health crisis, anything with a major social, [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8371.6s)]
*  cultural, or political impact, terrorism, mass violence, you must now be sensitive. [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8376.16s)]
*  The thing is whatever they're trying to say and whatever they're trying to do to make [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8382.16s)]
*  the online world a nicer place, you got to be really careful with saying things like that. [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8387.52s)]
*  Because sensitive is a weird term if someone is violently opposed. [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8393.2s)]
*  Sensitive to who? [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8396.88s)]
*  Right. [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8397.68s)]
*  Also, what if someone is violently opposed to something that's happening? [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8398.16s)]
*  Think about one or many of the military conflicts around the world. [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8402.32s)]
*  Don't pick a side. [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8405.36s)]
*  What if someone is violently opposed to these people dying and losing their lives [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8406.4s)]
*  and they're talking about it? [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8410.24s)]
*  Is that an insensitive piece of content that can now be censored by a new policy? [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8411.68s)]
*  Is that what it is or is they just going to demonetize it, which they've kind of always done? [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8417.04s)]
*  I think this was talking about people who are making ads using their platform, [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8420.720000000001s)]
*  not people who are hosting content on their platforms. [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8424.56s)]
*  So say it again. [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8427.68s)]
*  I got to admit I'm a little lost on this one. [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8428.24s)]
*  So if any of the listeners out there are also a little confused as to... [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8432.24s)]
*  No, it's about them having the ability to censor you. [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8435.76s)]
*  So if you do the Ron White Show on YouTube, [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8438.800000000001s)]
*  which is owned by Google, if they decide that this something of whatever you're doing [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8441.28s)]
*  is in somehow or another offensive... [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8446.640000000001s)]
*  They would want to edit it. [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8448.24s)]
*  I don't know what they're saying they can and can't do. [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8449.92s)]
*  I think it's making ads. [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8452.320000000002s)]
*  I don't know if it has to do with the content. [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8453.28s)]
*  Again, that's on YouTube. [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8454.960000000001s)]
*  I think this policy content change is for people who use the Google Ads platform [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8455.76s)]
*  and create ads like this one I'm showing you right here so that you can't abuse it. [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8460.320000000002s)]
*  You can't monetize it. [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8464.400000000001s)]
*  But look how it's phrased, please. [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8465.68s)]
*  Go back to the top sentence. [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8467.28s)]
*  So look at... [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8469.04s)]
*  Which one? [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8469.52s)]
*  It says, the updated policy provides practice including price gouging, [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8470.16s)]
*  misdirected traffic, and victim blaming during sensitive events. [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8474.16s)]
*  I'm with the first ones, price gouging, misdirected traffic. [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8478.0s)]
*  I'm in with those. [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8481.84s)]
*  But victim blaming during sensitive events, that one gets touchy. [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8483.039999999999s)]
*  Because like what do we... [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8487.36s)]
*  It's just using the ads though. [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8488.4s)]
*  It's like making some weird ad to pop up to get you to click on something [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8489.52s)]
*  that's going to pop up on content that might be about that event or anything like that. [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8492.32s)]
*  I understand. [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8495.28s)]
*  But victim blaming, the thing about victim blaming is you can do it both ways. [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8495.92s)]
*  Victim blaming like with Hamas and Palestine and Israel, [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8501.039999999999s)]
*  you could victim blame on both sides. [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8504.8s)]
*  You could say the Israelis were doing this and that's why Hamas had to attack. [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8507.6s)]
*  And you say Hamas attacked and that's why the Israelis are doing this. [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8510.96s)]
*  And you fucking people should have known better. [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8513.6s)]
*  And you fucking people should have known better. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8515.12s)]
*  That's victim blaming. [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8516.48s)]
*  Sure. [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8518.08s)]
*  You got to let people talk. [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8518.72s)]
*  And if talking looks like victim blaming until people work it out... [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8520.8s)]
*  Then why not let it out? [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8525.52s)]
*  You can't just stop people from talking. [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8526.32s)]
*  So what are we saying? [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8528.08s)]
*  Are we saying that it's just they can't monetize that? [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8528.88s)]
*  Well then what happens is if you're not monetizing stuff, [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8531.439999999999s)]
*  you let people know that unless they self-censor, it's going to cost them financially. [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8534.56s)]
*  Even if the ads like... [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8540.56s)]
*  Say if it represents a company that is actually interested in this discussion [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8542.48s)]
*  and wants to know what's the right perspective on this? [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8547.359999999999s)]
*  Who's most informed? [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8551.92s)]
*  Who's looking at this the most correctly? [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8552.88s)]
*  If you're a company and you're... [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8555.119999999999s)]
*  Why wouldn't you want to advertise on something where people are just talking [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8556.8s)]
*  about what may or may not be happening in the world? [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8560.88s)]
*  And if you're going to do that on YouTube, then you have to worry about [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8564.08s)]
*  you're losing your ability to make a living now. [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8566.8s)]
*  It's like, ooh. [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8569.199999999999s)]
*  Is that what happens? [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8571.279999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8572.08s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8573.439999999999s)]
*  I mean, is this just a blanket policy in case of the most egregious offenses [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8574.24s)]
*  that all people agree are terrible and should probably not be okay? [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8580.88s)]
*  But then who gets to decide that? [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8585.119999999999s)]

*  No, I believe that, you know. [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8594.32s)]
*  It's kind of the future of people being able to talk shit [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8595.679999999998s)]
*  because this is how it goes away. [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8597.92s)]
*  Right. [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8599.199999999999s)]
*  It goes away through stuff like that. [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8599.599999999999s)]
*  Sure. [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8600.96s)]
*  It goes away through people deciding that something's insensitive, [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8601.519999999999s)]

*  Okay, what is examples? [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8617.599999999999s)]
*  Exhaustive ads that claim victims of... [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8618.56s)]
*  Oh, ads that claim victims of sensitive event [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8621.279999999999s)]
*  responsible for their own tragedy or similar instances of victim... [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8623.76s)]

*  Yeah, it's ads. [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8628.4s)]
*  So it's just about ads. [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8628.88s)]
*  Yeah, at least for now it is. [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8630.24s)]
*  Maybe they could switch it and be like, now all content, but... [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8632.0s)]
*  Well, that's completely reasonable. [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8634.72s)]
*  If it's just about ads, that's completely reasonable. [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8636.48s)]
*  Right. [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8638.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8639.279999999999s)]

*  Because that's kind of... [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8646.32s)]
*  Well, is it? [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8647.04s)]
*  It's just that you can still use other parts of the internet that can still... [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8647.92s)]
*  But you can't use propaganda, you can't lie... [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8651.6s)]
*  You can't use Google Ads, [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8653.76s)]
*  which is the biggest part of the internet advertising world. [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8654.960000000001s)]
*  Right, they shut you out. [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8657.76s)]
*  Do it somewhere else is all they're saying. [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8658.8s)]
*  Right. [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8660.32s)]
*  That seems reasonable. [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8660.56s)]
*  Yeah, that's pretty reasonable. [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8662.0s)]
*  As long as they're not doing that with the actual content of the podcast. [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8663.52s)]
*  Because I do know that they demonetize. [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8668.48s)]
*  They demonetize people all the time if you talk about certain subjects. [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8670.64s)]
*  It's always been a problem. [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8673.359999999999s)]
*  And they don't do that to you. [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8675.76s)]
*  They used to do it. [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8677.279999999999s)]
*  Yeah, they used to do it up until the time when we switched over to Spotify. [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8678.0s)]
*  On their website, this is specifically under advertising policy. [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8680.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8683.84s)]
*  I think it's kind of... [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8684.48s)]
*  So now they don't do it to anybody? [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8684.96s)]
*  No, no, they do it to other people. [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8686.48s)]
*  They do it to other people all the time. [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8688.24s)]
*  They stopped doing it to us for like three months. [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8689.279999999999s)]
*  Like where they didn't give us any dings. [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8691.359999999999s)]
*  We're doing the same show. [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8693.279999999999s)]
*  Right. [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8694.56s)]
*  I don't know any other way to do this. [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8694.88s)]
*  Right. [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8696.96s)]
*  Sit down and talk shit. [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8697.52s)]
*  It's the only way to do it. [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8698.480000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8699.28s)]
*  If I change that for somebody that's going to censor something or I'm going to lose money, [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8699.52s)]
*  like what are you talking about? [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8703.68s)]
*  Like I can't change what I do. [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8704.880000000001s)]
*  No, no. [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8706.24s)]
*  I have zero interest in doing that. [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8706.560000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8708.32s)]
*  You know, and if I don't think it's offensive, then that's it. [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8708.880000000001s)]
*  That's the end of the conversation. [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8713.6s)]
*  And I think you're pretty sensitive. [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8714.560000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I'm sensitive. [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8715.92s)]
*  I try to be sensitive about these kind of things. [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8716.720000000001s)]
*  It's just you got to let people talk. [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8718.640000000001s)]
*  And just because people disagree with you, it doesn't mean there's something wrong with them. [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8721.04s)]
*  Did you see that clip? [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8724.4s)]
*  He was the way he was phrasing. [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8726.24s)]
*  It was actually kind of funny. [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8728.320000000002s)]
*  He was talking about white frailty or white anxiety, that it's a public health crisis, [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8729.6s)]
*  that white people who vote Republican, it's just like an opioid epidemic. [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8736.0s)]
*  This guy was comparing the two. [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8740.320000000002s)]
*  Here, I'm going to play. [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8743.6s)]
*  You want to send this to Jimmy. [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8744.800000000001s)]
*  I don't know where this is. [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8747.68s)]
*  I don't know where he said this. [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8749.6s)]
*  I just saw it on Twitter. [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8751.2s)]
*  And I'm like, man, you got to get out of the house. [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8752.8s)]
*  You got to go hang out with some different folks. [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8756.24s)]
*  They don't have an opioid epidemic. [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8759.119999999999s)]
*  There's a lot of people that are the conservative people that are like really clear thinking people. [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8761.119999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8766.8s)]
*  Yeah, they think this is a mess and they want things to change. [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8767.52s)]
*  They want the rule of law put back into place. [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8771.119999999999s)]
*  Doesn't mean they're on opiates. [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8773.28s)]
*  This is so crazy to say that everybody who doesn't agree with you is on drugs. [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8775.36s)]
*  Well, you know, and that gets fired back on both sides. [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8780.0s)]
*  Now you're in a stupid war. [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8786.400000000001s)]
*  We're like, you're stupid. [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8787.76s)]
*  No, you're stupid. [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8788.720000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8789.36s)]
*  You people are on drugs. [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8789.84s)]
*  Who brought back name calling? [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8791.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8793.2s)]
*  Was that? [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8793.44s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8794.24s)]
*  If you had been taught equality from the beginning, you wouldn't be flipping out. [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8794.720000000001s)]
*  But that's how hegemonic dominance works. [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8798.08s)]
*  And so I think that's why it happens. [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8799.92s)]
*  And we have to be willing to talk about that because it's really unhealthy. [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8801.68s)]
*  This white anxiety is a public health crisis in that regard. [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8804.880000000001s)]
*  And that's why not only we were talking in the other room a minute ago before we came in here, [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8808.4s)]
*  it's not just the opioid crisis that we think about with folks killing themselves disproportionately, [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8812.72s)]
*  increasingly white working class folks who are using heroin or using over the counter opioids, [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8817.359999999999s)]
*  but they're political opioids. [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8824.0s)]
*  Turning to a candidate who says you vote for me and I will take away your pain. [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8825.6s)]
*  I will bring back those jobs. [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8829.68s)]
*  I will make your life better. [[02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8831.119999999999s)]
*  That's a form of an opiate as well. [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8832.56s)]
*  So we got to be honest about the dysfunctionality and the real danger of the front lash, backlash, [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8834.48s)]
*  whatever we want to call it, even for the people who are thinking they're going to benefit from it. [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8840.72s)]
*  What you see right there is a wild instance of someone that's used to being around a certain [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8846.0s)]
*  type of people that think a certain type of way. [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8852.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8853.76s)]
*  And think it's okay to say it out loud. [[02:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8854.16s)]
*  Everyone's going to go along with this. [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8856.4s)]
*  And a bigger forum. [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8857.76s)]
*  And you put that out there to the world. [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8858.64s)]
*  And the whole world is like, what the fuck are you talking about? [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8860.72s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8864.64s)]
*  They're not on opioids. [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8865.6s)]

*  And why are you dressed like that? [[02:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8868.4s)]
*  You shouldn't even have an opinion. [[02:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8870.56s)]
*  That doesn't bother me at all. [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8872.64s)]
*  It does. [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8873.52s)]
*  He's dressed like E.D. I mean, would dress in a casual setting. [[02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8874.24s)]
*  Let me see it again. [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8880.32s)]
*  I didn't even think about how he's dressed. [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8881.52s)]
*  I just thought about what he was saying that he just dressed like a regular guy. [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8883.279999999999s)]
*  It's paramilitary. [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8886.4s)]
*  No, it's like a car shirt. [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8887.6s)]
*  No, that guy doesn't look paramilitary. [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8891.68s)]
*  At all. [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8894.48s)]
*  Ron White. [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8895.039999999999s)]
*  Maybe I saw it in his eyes. [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8896.16s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8897.52s)]
*  Well, it's kind of a very, very fast. [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8898.4s)]
*  Yes, Castro. [[02:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8902.48s)]
*  Come on. [[02:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8903.92s)]
*  No, it's just a shirt with two. [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8904.4s)]
*  Beard. [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8906.08s)]
*  This is a no good. [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8907.119999999999s)]
*  It looks like the guy's got some suits on. [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8908.72s)]
*  Why not wear a suit? [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8910.48s)]
*  It's probably casual guy, casual guy tuned into the younger people. [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8912.4s)]
*  Casual Friday. [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8916.24s)]
*  You just like that. [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8916.96s)]
*  That's a crazy thing to say. [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8918.48s)]
*  It's also not a nuanced perspective on the whole race issue in this country, in this [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8920.16s)]
*  world. [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8926.48s)]
*  It's a silly thing to do to say that all people that are Republicans, that are these white [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8926.8s)]
*  people are like on opioids and they want someone to rescue them. [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8933.6s)]
*  It's so silly. [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8936.88s)]
*  It's so stupid to lump them all into white people. [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8937.6s)]
*  First of all, because there's a lot of people that are Republican that aren't white. [[02:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8940.0s)]
*  There's a shit ton of them, man. [[02:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8942.64s)]
*  Go down to Miami. [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8944.08s)]
*  Those Cubans are all Republican. [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8945.36s)]
*  They're all Republican. [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8947.6s)]
*  There's so many Republicans down there. [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8948.72s)]
*  It's a silly thing to say. [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8950.48s)]
*  And it's also a silly thing to say that the people that oppose you politically are just [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8952.4s)]
*  wrong, so wrong that they're looking for a drug to rescue them. [[02:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8956.72s)]
*  Someone who comes along and says that they can do a better job is offering you heroin. [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8961.199999999999s)]
*  I think both sides have a really difficult time understanding the perspective of the [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8966.16s)]
*  other. [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8973.119999999999s)]
*  There's just a big swing and a miss and you can butt heads all day and nothing budges. [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8974.24s)]
*  I know some real smart, wealthy guys that disagree with me 100%. [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8981.04s)]
*  So when we're around each other, guess what we don't do? [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8986.24s)]
*  Talk about it. [[02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8988.480000000001s)]
*  Because there's so much more. [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8990.560000000001s)]
*  There's so many connections that we do have. [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8992.720000000001s)]
*  Why let that political thing get in the way of friendship? [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8995.84s)]
*  Because it sure can if you let it. [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=8999.12s)]
*  Here's the problem. [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9001.68s)]
*  This is the number one problem. [[02:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9002.48s)]
*  People attach themselves to their ideas and they attach themselves to a party that their [[02:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9004.0s)]
*  ideas most likely have been adopted from. [[02:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9010.0s)]
*  Most people's opinions politically are a conglomeration of a group of people's [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9012.8s)]
*  opinions they've adopted. [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9017.359999999999s)]
*  Whether it's right-wing people, extreme right-wing people. [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9019.039999999999s)]
*  I mean, I'm saying most. [[02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9021.039999999999s)]
*  What is it? [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9022.32s)]
*  60%. [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9022.72s)]
*  How many? [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9023.359999999999s)]
*  Environmental productivity. [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9023.76s)]
*  There's a lot of people that are not independent thinkers, is my point. [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9025.439999999999s)]
*  Everybody almost. [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9029.52s)]
*  Most people. [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9030.88s)]
*  So when you get connected ideologically, very personally to a group of opinions, [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9031.76s)]
*  and then someone opposes that group of opinions, they're attacking you. [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9037.84s)]
*  They're attacking you. [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9042.08s)]
*  You take it very personally and people are deceptive about the way they phrase things [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9042.960000000001s)]
*  in order to try to win. [[02:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9046.960000000001s)]
*  And it's entirely because their self-worth is connected to this verbal jousting that [[02:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9048.48s)]
*  they're doing, which is both productive and unproductive at the same time. [[02:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9053.76s)]
*  Because it lets you find out if things are bullshit. [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9058.16s)]
*  I think it's fruitless. [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9059.92s)]
*  But it does allow you sometimes to find out if things are bullshit. [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9060.88s)]
*  But on the other hand, it's not smart. [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9064.4s)]
*  It's not a smart way to communicate because most people are in the middle on everything. [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9066.56s)]
*  Most people just want the world to be a safer place. [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9072.0s)]
*  You want your kids to go to nice schools. [[02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9073.92s)]
*  You want your neighborhood to be safe. [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9075.359999999999s)]
*  You want people to make money. [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9076.72s)]
*  You want the economy to do well. [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9077.679999999998s)]
*  You don't want any war. [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9078.88s)]
*  Yay. [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9079.599999999999s)]
*  That's the most important shit. [[02:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9080.88s)]
*  And we want it to be balanced and we want it to work. [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9082.32s)]
*  Right. [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9084.8s)]
*  You know, for as many people as possible. [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9085.039999999999s)]
*  Leave me the fuck alone. [[02:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9086.8s)]
*  Don't tell me what to do. [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9088.0s)]
*  Have laws in place to keep people from getting fucked over. [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9089.919999999998s)]
*  But take your fucking hands off approach. [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9091.919999999998s)]
*  But as soon as what people don't understand is as soon as you start developing all these [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9094.08s)]
*  different areas of business and of life that have to be adjusted, you have to be adjusted. [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9100.0s)]
*  And that's like, you know, putting like DEI initiatives and doing these different things [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9105.279999999999s)]
*  where you're not going to hire the most qualified people. [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9111.759999999998s)]
*  You're going to hire people. [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9113.599999999999s)]
*  You want to hire a certain percentage of people from this part of the world. [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9114.64s)]
*  A certain percentage of people from that. [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9117.36s)]
*  It's like what you're even if you think you are doing better for the world, [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9119.12s)]
*  what you don't recognize is that this is a pattern of control. [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9123.04s)]
*  And this pattern of control that can be used to manipulate people to thinking [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9127.12s)]
*  they're doing something good socially, which they may very well be. [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9130.480000000001s)]
*  What it really does is allows control of businesses in a new way. [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9134.0s)]
*  And it allows control of public perception in a new way that can be manipulated to get [[02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9139.36s)]
*  you to do certain things and get you to allow certain legislation to get passed that has the [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9144.08s)]
*  government have much more control over what you do or what you say and how much money they get [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9150.4s)]
*  and money for programs. [[02:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9154.96s)]
*  And it's you're locked into a system now. [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9155.92s)]
*  And if you want to be a good person, you have to follow this pattern. [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9158.0s)]
*  Sure. [[02:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9160.96s)]
*  That's where things get squirrely. [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9161.52s)]
*  And so as soon as people start telling people how they can and can't talk, [[02:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9162.96s)]
*  this book's got to be gone. [[02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9166.8s)]
*  You can't say that. [[02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9168.08s)]
*  You can't teach this. [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9169.12s)]
*  As soon as that happens and the government steps in, we're fucked. [[02:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9170.56s)]
*  We're fucked because if they step in, they're not going to do it within your best interest. [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9174.88s)]
*  They're going to do it in whatever way makes them the most money or cost them the least. [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9180.24s)]
*  Well, you know, something's got to keep this herd going in the right direction, you know? [[02:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9184.56s)]
*  And let's just go back to that answer one day, one day, one day mushroom off for the whole. [[02:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9191.039999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9199.119999999999s)]
*  Well, eventually that organism will just take over everything. [[02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9199.52s)]
*  It's really grows well and it'll just get in your shoes and it'll balance everything out. [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9202.24s)]
*  Everything will make sense. [[02:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9208.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9209.2s)]
*  You know what will happen? [[02:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9209.6s)]
*  It'll get airborne. [[02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9210.48s)]
*  The spores will get airborne. [[02:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9213.04s)]
*  We're still getting people high. [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9214.32s)]
*  Fix every problem we've ever had. [[02:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9215.04s)]

*  I guess the celebrity jujitsu match is off. [[02:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9574.8s)]
*  And I was like, what? [[02:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9578.72s)]
*  Because he used to joke around about having a celebrity. [[02:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9580.16s)]
*  Maynard is really good. [[02:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=9582.4s)]

*  Maybe there's some other photos that'll show different. [[02:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10041.62s)]
*  There it is. [[02:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10044.18s)]
*  Like this is the bullshit version too. [[02:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10044.660000000002s)]
*  I think there is some imagery somewhere of the front, but whatever it is, like this guy [[02:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10048.18s)]
*  has a legit church. [[02:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10054.980000000001s)]
*  So he has actually gone through all the steps to create a church. [[02:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10056.58s)]
*  And they worship him? [[02:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10059.78s)]
*  No, no, no. [[02:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10061.060000000001s)]
*  Well then. [[02:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10062.66s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[02:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10063.7s)]
*  They just worship his art? [[02:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10064.74s)]
*  I would be speaking out of turn if I said what they worship. [[02:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10066.1s)]
*  I think it's more of the psychedelic experience in its most pure and loving form. [[02:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10069.7s)]
*  If I had to boil it down to what they believe in, that's what Alex Gray believes in. [[02:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10077.54s)]
*  And all of his art, this is all like these sacred tryptamine type images. [[02:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10082.5s)]
*  He's like the only guy that I've ever seen that captures certain aspects. [[02:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10087.94s)]
*  Do you know this guy? [[02:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10092.26s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10093.3s)]
*  He's been on the podcast before. [[02:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10093.62s)]
*  He's really cool. [[02:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10094.82s)]
*  No shit. [[02:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10095.7s)]
*  Yeah, really cool guy. [[02:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10096.66s)]
*  And his wife is really cool too. [[02:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10098.18s)]
*  She's been on here as well. [[02:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10099.38s)]
*  Look at all of his work. [[02:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10100.74s)]
*  It's amazing stuff. [[02:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10103.3s)]
*  But he's got a real church. [[02:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10104.5s)]
*  This is the only guy that I know that's actually made a real church. [[02:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10105.86s)]
*  I'm like, oh, I believe him. [[02:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10108.42s)]
*  I believe him. [[02:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10110.26s)]
*  That's not a guy I was trying to Joel Oelstein in. [[02:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10110.9s)]
*  He's not trying to buy 98 Bentleys. [[02:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10114.02s)]
*  Right. [[02:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10116.1s)]
*  That's really who he is. [[02:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10116.82s)]
*  He's just a real fascinating artist. [[02:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10118.02s)]
*  There's a bunch of people that have Alex Gray tattoos. [[02:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10120.58s)]
*  It's probably like one of the most common. [[02:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10122.98s)]
*  The gray-haired guy? [[02:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10123.94s)]
*  Yeah, the gray-haired guy with the ponytail. [[02:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10124.82s)]
*  Sweetheart of a guy. [[02:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10126.74s)]
*  Wow. [[02:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10128.26s)]
*  So that's an example of like- [[02:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10130.02s)]
*  What's his tax status down there at the church? [[02:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10131.06s)]
*  It's a good question. [[02:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10133.3s)]
*  I think he got it through. [[02:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10134.58s)]
*  I think it's a legitimate church. [[02:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10136.02s)]
*  Non-profit organization formed in 1996 to create a permanent public exhibition of the sacred mirrors. [[02:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10137.78s)]
*  But I think they got like a tax-exempt status. [[02:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10144.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10148.5s)]
*  Established in 2008 as an interfaith church. [[02:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10149.460000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[02:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10154.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10154.58s)]
*  So from 2008, I guess they established it as an actual church. [[02:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10155.140000000001s)]
*  Don't you have to have a doctrine that- [[02:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10157.62s)]
*  Well, here it is. [[02:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10159.78s)]
*  I'm sure they do. [[02:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10161.220000000001s)]
*  I just don't know what it is. [[02:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10161.78s)]
*  Provides unique creative events and workshops in a spiritual context. [[02:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10163.54s)]
*  Like what is their- [[02:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10166.82s)]
*  Do they say what they believe? [[02:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10169.22s)]
*  This is- I'm on their vision page and we're just- [[02:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10170.66s)]
*  Right. [[02:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10172.34s)]

*  I mean, I would join just so I could hang out there. [[02:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10176.9s)]
*  It's a place of contemplation, worship for community, honoring the practice of art as a spiritual path. [[02:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10179.619999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[02:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10184.98s)]
*  Cosm's site and structure provides a living model of the ideals expressed through the inspiring [[02:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10185.539999999999s)]

*  and invited contributors. [[02:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10196.02s)]
*  So they just take cool artists and their art and they show it to people and [[02:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10197.62s)]
*  their spirituality is based on creativity. [[02:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10202.58s)]
*  And it's amazing art, man. [[02:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10205.94s)]
*  This stuff is fantastic. [[02:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10207.380000000001s)]

*  He may have classes. [[02:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10229.460000000001s)]
*  Isn't, isn't like comedy kind of a form of religion in some way? [[02:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10231.220000000001s)]
*  It is for us, Joe. [[02:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10236.1s)]
*  It is. [[02:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10237.220000000001s)]

*  You know, it's, you find, I mean, just making people laugh is a good thing to do. [[02:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10238.98s)]
*  It's a great thing to do. [[02:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10245.060000000001s)]
*  It is. [[02:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10245.94s)]
*  It's fun. [[02:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10246.5s)]
*  And I can't tell you how grateful people are, you know, that, just how hard we make them laugh, [[02:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10246.98s)]
*  you know, that they, it's just so much fun to do. [[02:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10253.46s)]
*  If you can even remember. [[02:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10256.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10257.38s)]
*  To be somebody that wasn't a comedian watching a comedy show and how hard you can laugh at, [[02:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10257.939999999999s)]
*  you know, at that experience when, you know, it just, I remember I saw Seinfeld one time [[02:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10263.06s)]
*  and in a comedy club, you know, he had full blown chops and it was all never heard it before. [[02:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10269.3s)]
*  He beat me to death. [[02:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10275.619999999999s)]
*  I mean, to death at the, whatever, the improv in Dallas, Texas. [[02:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10277.779999999999s)]
*  I had a table right off the, it was my birthday. [[02:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10283.939999999999s)]
*  I'd only been doing standup for about six months. [[02:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10286.26s)]
*  I wasn't in the show. [[02:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10288.18s)]
*  Oh, that's nice. [[02:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10288.9s)]
*  They just gave me the chair. [[02:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10288.98s)]
*  He was making 25,000 for the week and we were like, no fucking way. [[02:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10290.26s)]
*  Nobody makes that much money in the world. [[02:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10296.019999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10299.22s)]
*  Doing the standup at a club. [[02:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10299.539999999999s)]
*  And this is the nineties, right? [[02:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10301.3s)]
*  80. [[02:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10303.46s)]
*  What year is that? [[02:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10303.619999999999s)]
*  86. [[02:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10304.18s)]
*  86. [[02:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10304.26s)]
*  I saw Seinfeld for the first time in 88 before I did standup. [[02:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10305.779999999999s)]
*  Like right before I did standup, I was probably maybe 87. [[02:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10311.3s)]
*  It was at the Paradise, which was a comedy club in, it was like a, [[02:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10316.58s)]
*  it was a big place that was connected to Stitches. [[02:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10320.9s)]
*  So Stitches was the comedy club and that was small. [[02:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10322.98s)]
*  I think it's seat, it would seat about 150 or so. [[02:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10325.86s)]
*  And then the Paradise, which is next door was bigger, but it only sat like maybe 500 people. [[02:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10328.74s)]
*  I'm just guessing four or 500 people. [[02:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10334.5s)]
*  And so Seinfeld was there and I took him with this girl that I was dating [[02:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10336.34s)]
*  and just fucking cried. [[02:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10340.34s)]
*  Couldn't believe how smooth he was. [[02:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10341.78s)]
*  So smooth. [[02:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10343.62s)]
*  It was so fun to see. [[02:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10344.42s)]
*  Back then, he was doing all those sets, all those sets every night. [[02:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10346.9s)]
*  He's the one that said, a comic should be on stage. [[02:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10352.5s)]
*  I heard him say it every single day. [[02:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10354.74s)]
*  And that's the reason I tried to stay on stage every single day was because of what Seinfeld said. [[02:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10357.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10366.26s)]
*  There's something to that for sure. [[02:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10367.22s)]
*  But I remember back then thinking about doing stand-up, like, oh my God, I could never do this. [[02:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10369.3s)]
*  And then going to an open mic and go, oh, I can do this. [[02:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10373.22s)]
*  Like the difference between like, crazy people bomb. [[02:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10376.099999999999s)]
*  You're like, oh, Richard Jennings said it best. [[02:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10379.939999999999s)]
*  He said, terrible comedy gives people inspiration to try comedy. [[02:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10382.019999999999s)]
*  That's the purpose it serves. [[02:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10386.34s)]
*  Right. I can for sure do that. [[02:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10387.779999999999s)]
*  He was the guy I got to see live quite a few times. [[02:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10389.22s)]
*  But I got to see him before us. [[02:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10392.74s)]
*  Maybe I had just done an open mic or two, but I was sitting front row at Catch a Rising Star [[02:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10394.34s)]
*  in Cambridge and he was doing The Weeknd there. [[02:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10398.9s)]
*  God damn, he was good. [[02:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10401.38s)]
*  There was nobody better than him, I don't think, at his peak. [[02:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10402.82s)]
*  It was just so much power. [[02:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10405.94s)]
*  So much writing, so smooth and so many tags. [[02:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10407.779999999999s)]
*  And just like, just a consummate professional, consummate professional. [[02:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10411.22s)]
*  He was just a joke writing machine. [[02:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10415.779999999999s)]
*  He could take any premise, any premise and turn it into a closing bit. [[02:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10418.5s)]
*  Right. [[02:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10422.02s)]
*  It's crazy. [[02:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10422.52s)]
*  That's what it was like. [[02:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10423.94s)]
*  It was like watching somebody that had nothing but closing bits. [[02:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10424.66s)]
*  That's how hard you left at this show. [[02:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10427.619999999999s)]
*  I've told this before, but I'll tell it again just because it's so crazy. [[02:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10429.3s)]
*  East Side Comedy Club in Long Island. [[02:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10431.699999999999s)]
*  I went there at the, I don't know if I was there on Sunday or, [[02:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10434.02s)]
*  I was there after Jenny's shows were done. [[02:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10438.5s)]
*  So when I got there, the fucking host was depressed. [[02:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10440.5s)]
*  And we were all talking, like, what's the matter? [[02:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10444.1s)]
*  He goes, Jenny did a different hour every show. [[02:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10445.779999999999s)]
*  He goes, he did two different hours on Friday and then two different hours on Saturday. [[02:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10448.5s)]
*  And he fucking killed. [[02:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10453.3s)]
*  And the guy was like, I want to quit comedy. [[02:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10454.5s)]
*  Like, what am I doing? [[02:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10456.5s)]
*  The fuck am I doing? [[02:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10457.7s)]
*  This guy just did four different hours and murdered. [[02:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10458.42s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10461.3s)]
*  Crazy. [[02:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10462.42s)]
*  I should quit. [[02:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10463.22s)]
*  You watch something like that. [[02:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10464.74s)]
*  Like, I mean, he was like, he just, people just forgot. [[02:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10465.62s)]
*  That's one of those ones. [[02:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10469.54s)]
*  Like, I know Chris Rock gives it up to him a lot. [[02:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10470.34s)]
*  Some people, you know, they inspire people to quit. [[02:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10472.9s)]
*  Well, he definitely would raise the bar. [[02:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10476.34s)]
*  He definitely would raise the bar. [[02:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10479.14s)]
*  I saw him kill at the Comedy Works in Montreal. [[02:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10480.98s)]
*  Remember that little room, that little tiny room upstairs? [[02:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10484.9s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10487.22s)]
*  I saw him kill up there talking about buying a Corvette. [[02:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10487.779999999999s)]
*  How do you make that funny? [[02:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10491.699999999999s)]
*  How do you make buying a Corvette funny? [[02:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10493.779999999999s)]
*  I have no idea. [[02:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10495.94s)]
*  It was hilarious. [[02:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10496.82s)]
*  He was murdering. [[02:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10498.5s)]
*  He was a murderer. [[02:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10499.699999999999s)]
*  He could do anything, any subject. [[02:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10500.82s)]
*  He could find it. [[02:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10502.58s)]
*  He'd find the angle. [[02:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10503.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10504.26s)]
*  I remember the one thing he did. [[02:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10505.06s)]
*  It was just about a look in his eye that whenever he, all he did was move his eyeball. [[02:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10506.9s)]
*  And he'd show you how far he moved his eyeball. [[02:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10513.22s)]
*  And that's how the fight started with his wife. [[02:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10514.98s)]
*  But it was just real insightful. [[02:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10517.619999999999s)]
*  And then it was so subtle that it was just so expertly fucking done that it just killed me. [[02:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10519.86s)]
*  Yeah, he's one of the greatest. [[02:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10525.94s)]
*  Yeah, he was one of the greatest. [[02:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10528.1s)]
*  I gotta write something down before I forget. [[02:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10529.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10533.3s)]
*  It's just so interesting to think about the guys that inspired you [[02:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10534.1s)]
*  when you first started doing stand-up. [[02:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10538.5s)]
*  When you first started, what that was like to see someone who was really good at this thing [[02:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10541.46s)]
*  that was just like, it was just a weird, foggy dream in the first couple times you go on stage. [[02:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10546.26s)]
*  How does anyone ever really become a professional? [[02:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10552.5s)]
*  And then you watch a master go up in murder. [[02:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10555.3s)]
*  And we're like, holy shit. [[02:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10557.619999999999s)]
*  And then you realize he's nobody. [[02:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10560.019999999999s)]
*  There are guys that make him look like he doesn't know what he's doing. [[02:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10563.539999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10568.74s)]
*  But you kind of have a realm of comedy of what you can see. [[02:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10570.02s)]
*  And in Boston, that would have been a much bigger glimpse than you would get in Arlington, Texas. [[02:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10575.94s)]
*  You got whatever head ladders came through the Funny Bone Chain. [[02:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10582.02s)]
*  And they were all great. [[02:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10584.74s)]
*  They all killed everybody. [[02:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10586.1s)]
*  And nobody really went on to do tremendous businesses like Foxworthy and me and Dan. [[02:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10587.62s)]
*  And the Boo Caller Boys. [[02:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10596.1s)]
*  There wasn't a lot of guys. [[02:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10599.460000000001s)]
*  Well, you guys opened the door for a lot of new guys that came after you, though. [[02:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10600.58s)]
*  A lot of guys were inspired by that for sure. [[02:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10603.62s)]
*  But it's like you need a community. [[02:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10606.82s)]
*  And Boston had a crazy community. [[02:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10608.74s)]
*  They had a community of assassins that were local guys. [[02:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10611.140000000001s)]
*  And then new people were coming in every week that were like big national headliners. [[02:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10613.78s)]
*  So you'd have all these murderous local guys. [[02:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10618.26s)]
*  And then Dom Herrera would fly in for a weekend. [[02:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10620.82s)]
*  Bill Hicks would fly in for a weekend. [[02:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10623.78s)]
*  They had all the road killers. [[02:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10625.3s)]
*  Whenever a big national act was killing it on the road, they would stop at Nick's Comedy Stop. [[02:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10627.699999999999s)]
*  We'd all watch them. [[02:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10632.5s)]
*  So they had the whole thing. [[02:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10634.019999999999s)]
*  It was like a perfect training ground for learning how to do stand up. [[02:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10635.46s)]
*  Yeah, they never gave a fuck about me in Boston until I got bigger. [[02:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10638.98s)]
*  Yeah, but that's always how it is. [[02:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10643.939999999999s)]
*  There was too many people there. [[02:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10645.46s)]
*  Yeah, that's what they had guys. [[02:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10646.82s)]
*  It was like Denver. [[02:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10648.82s)]
*  Denver never gave a fuck about me. [[02:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10651.22s)]
*  But I would look at their list of headliners and go, [[02:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10652.66s)]
*  we got Louis Anderson. [[02:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10654.66s)]
*  They got all these big name fucking comics. [[02:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10655.78s)]
*  And I went to big name fucking comic and I didn't belong on that list. [[02:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10658.74s)]
*  Yeah, it is what it is. [[02:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10662.26s)]
*  But you have to have a scene like that. [[02:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10663.78s)]
*  That's where talent emerges from. [[02:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10666.1s)]
*  And that's what's been really fucking cool about being able to do that here. [[02:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10668.42s)]
*  Is that to take this place that had a scene, there was an Austin Comedy Scene. [[02:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10672.1s)]
*  The reason why I came here is there was already a club here. [[02:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10676.18s)]
*  It went under during the pandemic, but it still existed. [[02:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10678.5s)]
*  And it was always a fun place to work. [[02:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10682.58s)]
*  And then to have all of that, you were here first. [[02:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10684.740000000002s)]
*  So you were the one before the pandemic even hit. [[02:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10687.7s)]
*  You were already here. [[02:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10691.060000000001s)]
*  And you were telling me, I fucking love it. [[02:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10692.18s)]
*  I was like, damn it, from what it loves, it's got to be something to it. [[02:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10693.94s)]
*  Right. [[02:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10696.5s)]
*  And you were like, is that reasonable? [[02:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10696.980000000001s)]
*  I fucking love it. [[02:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10698.660000000002s)]
*  I fucking love it. [[02:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10699.78s)]
*  Not too big, not too small. [[02:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10700.5s)]
*  Everybody's cool. [[02:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10701.94s)]
*  God damn it. [[02:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10703.220000000001s)]
*  And I had already thought about it before because of on it, [[02:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10704.18s)]
*  because the business is here. [[02:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10706.660000000002s)]
*  And I'd have to come down to do stuff occasionally anyway. [[02:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10708.42s)]
*  And I was always coming down to do stand up anyway. [[02:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10711.62s)]
*  And I always loved being down here, but it wasn't until the pandemic. [[02:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10713.86s)]
*  And it wasn't until you getting on stage. [[02:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10717.62s)]
*  That one time when you get on stage, you hadn't gotten on stage in fucking forever. [[02:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10720.42s)]
*  And you grabbed me by the shoulder. [[02:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10724.26s)]
*  You grabbed me. [[02:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10726.1s)]
*  You go, we are going to fucking do this, whatever it takes. [[02:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10726.980000000001s)]
*  You're going to open up that club. [[02:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10729.7s)]
*  Right. [[02:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10730.820000000002s)]
*  I meant it too. [[02:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10731.78s)]
*  I know you did. [[02:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10732.900000000001s)]
*  And still do to this fucking day. [[02:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10734.42s)]
*  I'm behind that 100%. [[02:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10736.18s)]
*  My effort and I talk about that club on the road and my shows [[02:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10738.099999999999s)]
*  and just how much it means to me and how cool it is. [[02:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10742.98s)]
*  It means to me too. [[02:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10745.779999999999s)]
*  And it means to me because you're there too. [[02:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10746.74s)]
*  Everybody together in this is a really exciting camaraderie. [[02:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10749.38s)]
*  It's a great tribe and we're blessed to have it. [[02:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10752.74s)]
*  Yeah, it's very cool. [[02:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10757.38s)]
*  But you saying that to me that day, I was going to do it anyway for sure, [[02:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10758.9s)]
*  but that was an extra fucking turbo gear. [[02:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10762.42s)]
*  It was an extra kick in the pants. [[02:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10765.22s)]
*  I made some extra phone calls, tried to close it up, figure out what the problem was. [[02:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10767.699999999999s)]
*  It was just we had a big adjustment from moving from the old place to the new place. [[02:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10772.74s)]
*  That was a big pain in the ass because we had spent a considerable amount of time and effort. [[02:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10775.539999999999s)]
*  Architects were involved and drawing up plans and people had gone to look at it. [[02:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10780.9s)]
*  And when it all fell through, they're like, fuck, we got to start from scratch. [[02:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10786.66s)]
*  And everybody blamed me. [[02:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10790.82s)]
*  Well, people didn't believe it. [[02:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10793.46s)]
*  That's what was funny. [[02:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10794.5s)]
*  But that's also what makes it more fun when it does open [[02:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10795.3s)]
*  because people are like, he's never going to do it. [[02:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10797.619999999999s)]
*  Like, OK, just sit back. [[02:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10799.22s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[03:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10801.939999999999s)]
*  I've got some crazy plans. [[03:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10802.58s)]
*  If I hear you say you're going to do something, I just, how long is that going to be? [[03:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10804.179999999998s)]
*  It's going to happen quick. [[03:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10808.34s)]
*  It would have happened quick. [[03:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10811.38s)]
*  We would have had this place open probably inside of a year. [[03:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10812.34s)]
*  It was perfect the way it did happen. [[03:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10816.98s)]
*  A lot of anticipation from all of us. [[03:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10819.539999999999s)]
*  It made us all nervous. [[03:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10822.179999999998s)]
*  The fact that even with all that anticipation, it still gets an A. [[03:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10823.78s)]
*  It still gets an A. [[03:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10828.66s)]
*  I know it's my place, but shut the fuck up. [[03:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10830.42s)]
*  That place is perfect. [[03:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10832.740000000002s)]
*  Yeah, it's perfect. [[03:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10833.62s)]
*  The place is perfect. [[03:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10834.26s)]
*  We made it perfect. [[03:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10835.060000000001s)]
*  And we got lucky that we got the right people and the right architect. [[03:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10836.02s)]
*  Shout out to Richard. [[03:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10839.78s)]
*  The people that put it together did an amazing job. [[03:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10841.060000000001s)]
*  And it's also like the vibe there is so strong. [[03:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10843.78s)]
*  It's very fun. [[03:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10846.42s)]
*  It's real positive. [[03:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10847.78s)]
*  Well, you know, we all feel like it's ours. [[03:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10848.980000000001s)]
*  And even though you pay all the bills and shit. [[03:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10851.140000000001s)]
*  It pays the bills now. [[03:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10854.5s)]
*  So, you know, people don't know that 80% of the door goes to the comics. [[03:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10856.900000000001s)]
*  And so there's also no opportunity for a comic to make money. [[03:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10862.1s)]
*  That kind of money in a local gig at home, anywhere on the fucking planet Earth, [[03:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10866.26s)]
*  that opportunity does not exist. [[03:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10870.66s)]
*  Well, it's not. [[03:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10872.5s)]
*  I would never do it if I was going to do it for money. [[03:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10873.54s)]
*  I would never do it that way. [[03:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10875.54s)]
*  That's crazy. [[03:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10876.5s)]
*  Right. [[03:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10876.980000000001s)]
*  It wouldn't make any sense. [[03:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10877.54s)]
*  You're making less money. [[03:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10878.5s)]
*  Yeah, I decided to get in the comedy club business. [[03:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10879.54s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[03:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10882.66s)]
*  I didn't get in the comedy club business. [[03:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10883.7s)]
*  I got in the business of making comedy and having a place for comedians. [[03:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10885.54s)]
*  My idea was set up the ideal spot. [[03:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10893.220000000001s)]
*  And what's the ideal spot? [[03:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10897.7s)]
*  Well, the ideal spot was that the comedians would get the bulk of the money [[03:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10898.740000000002s)]
*  because the comedians doing all of the work. [[03:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10902.42s)]
*  They're the ones who have to come up with the jokes. [[03:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10904.740000000002s)]
*  If we don't have the comedians, we're just selling drinks. [[03:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10906.980000000001s)]
*  Right. [[03:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10909.460000000001s)]
*  This is nonsense. [[03:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10909.94s)]
*  So it's obvious what people are there for. [[03:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10911.140000000001s)]
*  I knew that when I started getting a percentage of the door. [[03:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10913.14s)]
*  Right. [[03:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10916.019999999999s)]
*  I knew how it works. [[03:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10916.5s)]
*  But that should be that way regardless. [[03:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10917.3s)]
*  That's the real relationship. [[03:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10919.619999999999s)]
*  You're selling what we do. [[03:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10921.14s)]
*  Right. [[03:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10922.66s)]
*  You shouldn't be getting 80% of the money. [[03:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10923.3s)]
*  80% of the money should be going to the comedians. [[03:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10924.9s)]
*  That's crazy. [[03:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10926.66s)]
*  There's so much money from booze. [[03:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10927.22s)]
*  You sell money in alcohol. [[03:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10929.22s)]
*  You sell money and there's still money. [[03:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10930.58s)]
*  You can tell the guy that owns the place doesn't give a shit about it turning to profit. [[03:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10932.5s)]
*  My idea was just don't lose money. [[03:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10936.82s)]
*  No. [[03:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10939.38s)]
*  Just break even. [[03:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10939.539999999999s)]
*  I'm 100% on board. [[03:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10940.82s)]
*  It's great. [[03:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10944.18s)]
*  That's how it should be. [[03:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10944.74s)]
*  And if you do it that way, then it's really deeply in. [[03:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10945.86s)]
*  There's a commitment to this idea. [[03:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10950.34s)]
*  We're all committed to this idea. [[03:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10953.22s)]
*  Just making the most fun possible, the most comedy possible. [[03:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10954.5s)]
*  Do our best. [[03:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10957.3s)]
*  Have a great community. [[03:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10958.18s)]
*  Have a great tribe. [[03:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10959.22s)]
*  Have a great vibe. [[03:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10960.5s)]
*  We're all feeding off each other and talking shit to each other and having a good old time in the back. [[03:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10961.46s)]
*  And then it fuels us to go on stage. [[03:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10965.22s)]
*  We're watching each other from the balcony. [[03:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10966.98s)]
*  It's exciting. [[03:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10968.66s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[03:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10969.539999999999s)]
*  It's very exciting. [[03:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10970.1s)]
*  It's fun. [[03:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10970.74s)]
*  It's very exciting. [[03:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10971.220000000001s)]
*  It's the funnest thing ever. [[03:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10971.7s)]
*  I'm very happy you're a part of it, my brother. [[03:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X095ZicHkM8&t=10972.74s)]
