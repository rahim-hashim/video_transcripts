# Joe Rogan Experience #2332 - Oz Pearlman
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=0.0s)]
*  Serial. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6.4s)]
*  Dude, you've only been here for 20 minutes, you already freaked me out. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8.4s)]
*  Just freaked out. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=20.16s)]
*  I'm freaked out by the fact that you're the first guy that's ever come here that ran a [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=21.16s)]
*  marathon before you got here. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=24.88s)]
*  You know, wanted to clear my mind. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=27.6s)]
*  It's a big day. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=29.28s)]
*  How long did it take you to run it? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=30.76s)]
*  You gotta check online, I don't know, I think it was like 3 hours, 25 minutes, 3.30, something [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=32.36s)]
*  like that. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=36.64s)]
*  Wow, that's a good time for a casual... [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=37.64s)]
*  Went kind of southeast, thunderstorming in Austin, Texas, and then looped around, went [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=39.2s)]
*  back, got some work done. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=43.24s)]
*  I always do phone calls while I'm running. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=44.400000000000006s)]
*  How often do you run, you said you ran 27 miles this morning? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=46.16s)]
*  I think so, I don't know, I just, I turned around, I got it done, I need to get ready [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=49.400000000000006s)]
*  for this shower, but yeah. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=52.8s)]
*  Is that a normal thing for you to do? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=54.82s)]
*  Very normal. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=56.64s)]
*  Wow. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=57.64s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=58.64s)]
*  That's a lot of distance, man. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=60.36s)]
*  You know, there was like a sweet spot, pre-having as many kids and more family constraints and [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=62.24s)]
*  work and now life is busy, but where I do 20 miles every day. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=67.04s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=71.24s)]
*  Like what's the longest you've run? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=72.24s)]
*  153 miles. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=73.8s)]
*  Wow, how long did it take you to do that? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=74.8s)]
*  33 hours. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=77.56s)]
*  Spartaflon in Greece, epic. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=78.56s)]
*  It's in Greece? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=80.12s)]
*  Oh, it's crazy, man. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=81.12s)]
*  You run from Athens to Sparta. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=82.84s)]
*  This race is amazing. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=85.14s)]
*  You ever seen me 300 with Drud Butler? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=86.14s)]
*  So that's the story. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=88.44000000000001s)]
*  A couple of crazy dudes in the 80s decided that they're going to recreate where he ran, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=89.60000000000001s)]
*  Phidipides, to deliver the message. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=94.88000000000001s)]
*  Because in that movie, you remember 300 Spartans defended against the Persian masses and they [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=96.80000000000001s)]
*  frame it as the difference between us having civilization and not. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=101.76s)]
*  Had those 300 guys not died while they assembled an army and he delivered that message to King [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=105.24000000000001s)]
*  Leonidas, so when you finish this race, if you finish, it's one of the hardest races [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=109.88000000000001s)]
*  in the world. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=114.12s)]
*  There's Badwater, Goggins, mutual buddy of ours. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=115.2s)]
*  But there's races they say are the hardest. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=118.68s)]
*  This one kicked my butt. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=120.56s)]
*  First year. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=122.32000000000001s)]
*  Is it because of the elevation? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=123.32000000000001s)]
*  What is it? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=124.32000000000001s)]
*  It's because Europe does not believe in ice, so there's nothing cold for the first 50 miles. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=125.32000000000001s)]
*  You're hot and then the cutoffs are much stricter. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=130.76s)]
*  So at 50 miles, you have to be done, you got to fact check this, but nine or 10 hours. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=134.18s)]
*  So you have to finish 153 miles in under 36 hours. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=138.4s)]
*  You need to be running at all times. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=141.36s)]
*  You can't walk for two hours and start throwing up. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  I was puking for eight hours straight the first time I did it. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=146.32s)]
*  Still excuses. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=149.68s)]
*  This is me just bitching. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=150.68s)]
*  I should have finished that year. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=151.84s)]
*  I wasn't mentally tough, but 100% that year I just didn't have it mentally and the next [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=152.92s)]
*  year I came back ready to die. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=157.64s)]
*  I was like, I'm going to finish this race. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=159.12s)]
*  There was a guy in the middle of the night, I won't kid you, who looked at me and he says [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=162.0s)]
*  to me, there it is, he goes to me with like crazy eyes and I've already given up in my [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=165.48s)]
*  mind. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=170.07999999999998s)]
*  They call it DNFing, did not finish in ultras. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=172.44s)]
*  I already wrote the speech of like, I'm going to tell my friends, I learned from this, you [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=175.16s)]
*  know, all that, all that stuff of like, I already gave up in my mind and I saw this [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=178.76s)]
*  guy at mile, I don't know, 72 middle of the night who looks at me with these crazy eyes. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=183.16s)]
*  I'll never forget his looks, crazy eyes, like that, but a hundred times more and goes, you're [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=187.6s)]
*  going to give up. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=191.8s)]
*  He goes, if you can't run, you walk, you can't walk, you crawl, you never ever. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=192.8s)]
*  And I was like, yo man, this guy needs to chill out right now because I've already quit [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=198.2s)]
*  in my mind. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=201.72s)]
*  But I channeled that guy when I came back the next year and it was that, it was, I'm [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=202.72s)]
*  going to the hospital and you're not putting IV, I'm going to finish this race. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=205.96s)]
*  And I came back the next year mentally, like there's no way I'm not finishing. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=209.4s)]
*  Did you do anything different in preparation? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=213.2s)]
*  Listen, it's, it's all mental. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=215.24s)]
*  It's all mental. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=218.12s)]
*  Anyone who tells you otherwise, physical is meaningless at that point. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=219.12s)]
*  Physical is meaningless in most points, to be honest. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=221.92s)]
*  There were guys who I saw when I quit, it was, you know, 2 a.m. who were slower than [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=224.04s)]
*  They were older than me. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=230.56s)]
*  Every objective measure, I should have beat them, but they mentally finished. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=231.82000000000002s)]
*  The next morning I got a night's sleep, woke up, watched them, ate lunch and saw them finish. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=235.04000000000002s)]
*  I was like, I was crying. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=239.36s)]
*  I couldn't believe the emotions of this guy finished who was two hours behind me when [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=240.36s)]
*  I quit. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=243.76000000000002s)]
*  And I learned that day, it's mental, 100%. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=244.76000000000002s)]
*  The mindset is when you get there, you know, if you're finishing at the start. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=247.24s)]
*  So did it haunt you that you didn't finish? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=250.84s)]
*  Oh, haunted me every day. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=252.56s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=254.0s)]
*  Haunted. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=255.0s)]
*  Like what you did was really hard, but you didn't. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=256.0s)]
*  No, that's bullshit hard. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=257.52s)]
*  It was, I should have finished. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=258.52s)]
*  How far did you get? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=259.76s)]
*  I got halfway. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=260.92s)]
*  So that's pretty hard. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=262.44s)]
*  No, I got swept. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=263.44s)]
*  75 miles? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=264.44s)]
*  This, I quit when it was convenient because I got to an aid station and I'm like, oh, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=265.44s)]
*  you know, I got 30 minutes on the, I already decided in my mind I was quitting. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=268.4s)]
*  But hold on, I got to pause because I walked in here and I told you, before we start, I [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=271.64s)]
*  have something for you. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=276.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=277.2s)]
*  Right? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=278.2s)]
*  People always say, can I read minds? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=279.2s)]
*  I can't read minds. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=280.2s)]
*  I read people. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=281.2s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=282.2s)]
*  This envelope, if they can't see it and they're listening, your logo sealed. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=283.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=285.24s)]
*  This is your future. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=286.24s)]
*  My future? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=287.24s)]
*  This is your future. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=288.24s)]
*  This is not supernatural, but I assure you, I want you to hold this from now until the [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=289.72s)]
*  end of the episode. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=293.28000000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=294.28000000000003s)]
*  That's when we open it. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=295.28000000000003s)]
*  I don't even know if I want to know my future. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=296.28000000000003s)]
*  No, no, this is all good stuff. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=297.28000000000003s)]
*  Live to 120. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=299.08s)]
*  Joe's going to be a two-term president. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=300.08s)]
*  You know, you know. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=301.92s)]
*  Shut the fuck up. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=302.92s)]
*  That's not good. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=303.92s)]
*  I don't want that job. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=304.92s)]
*  You take it before we even start. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=305.92s)]
*  And at the end we open it. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=307.68s)]
*  So nobody skips this episode. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=308.8s)]
*  You buckle up for the ending. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=310.16s)]
*  I'm here. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=311.68s)]
*  People will just fast forward. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=312.68s)]
*  They'll fast forward. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=314.04s)]
*  They'll miss all the good stuff in the middle. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=315.04s)]
*  The quitters. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=316.04s)]
*  The quitters. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=317.04s)]
*  And Steve who did not finish Spartathlon. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=318.04s)]
*  So that's insanely impressive though that you run that much. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=323.0s)]
*  When did you start doing this? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=325.68s)]
*  My sister ran a marathon. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=327.44s)]
*  Shout out to my older sister. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=329.52000000000004s)]
*  And there's a little bit of sibling rivalry. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=330.8s)]
*  She's eight years older. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=331.8s)]
*  I have twin sisters. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=332.8s)]
*  And do you remember when marathoning became like commonplace? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=333.96000000000004s)]
*  Before you say anything, I have to shout out to my sister because she got upset that I [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=337.44s)]
*  didn't shout her out before because she ran Bert Kreischer's 5K. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=340.8s)]
*  She's like, I can't believe you didn't shout me out. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=344.40000000000003s)]
*  Sorry sweetie. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=347.16s)]
*  Love ya. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=348.16s)]
*  Well played. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=349.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=350.16s)]
*  She's the best. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=351.16s)]
*  They all are, right? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=352.16s)]
*  So my sister ran it. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=353.16s)]
*  And everyone at a certain point, marathoning became like a thing. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=354.16s)]
*  Do you remember when Oprah ran one and then everyone's like, I'm running a marathon. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=356.8s)]
*  I didn't pay attention. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=359.88s)]
*  Yeah, but there was like a moment where the zeitgeist. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=360.88s)]
*  Everyone started running marathons. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=363.6s)]
*  This was before that. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=364.68s)]
*  I believe you. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=365.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=366.68s)]
*  But I wasn't tuned into that frequency. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=367.68s)]
*  I was. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=368.68s)]
*  When my sister said she's running 26.2 miles, if she had told me, this is not that she's [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=369.68s)]
*  not fit. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=372.88s)]
*  She was like a collegiate D1 athlete, swimmer. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=373.88s)]
*  I'm like, what do you, if she had said I'm going to the moon, it would have been equal [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=376.4s)]
*  of like, what do you mean you're running a marathon? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=379.52s)]
*  And so when she did it, I immediately that day signed up for a marathon just to be like, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=381.8s)]
*  no, screw that. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=385.71999999999997s)]
*  I'm not, I'm not not doing this. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=386.71999999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=388.36s)]
*  And I was working on Wall Street. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=389.36s)]
*  I was kind of getting fat and lazy, happy hours. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=390.36s)]
*  And I go, this is all there is. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=392.59999999999997s)]
*  Like I'm just going to keep, I'm making money. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=394.76s)]
*  Don't get me wrong. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=396.15999999999997s)]
*  I'm blessed. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=397.15999999999997s)]
*  But I got, I got to have something that fires me up. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=398.15999999999997s)]
*  That's my instinct. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=399.36s)]
*  And so I signed up for a marathon. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=400.84s)]
*  What year was this? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=402.36s)]
*  2004. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=403.36s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=404.36s)]
*  And then I did one Philly marathon, you know, the Rocky, the whole thing. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=405.52000000000004s)]
*  And at mile 23, I start, I stop and I'm like crying. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=410.76s)]
*  I, again, this is a common theme. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=414.2s)]
*  I've cried like twice in my life. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=415.56s)]
*  My wife will ask and say, but I was wrecked. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=416.68s)]
*  I was going to quit. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=419.64s)]
*  I see two dudes walking because I'm going decently fast at this point. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=420.92s)]
*  I've trained terribly. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=424.96000000000004s)]
*  I see two dudes walking about a hundred yards ahead of me and I go misery loves company. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=425.96000000000004s)]
*  I'm going to walk up and I'm going to, I'm going to catch them, but they're walking the [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=430.96000000000004s)]
*  same speed as me. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=434.32s)]
*  And I'm like, screw it. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=436.28s)]
*  I'm going to run to them. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=437.28s)]
*  I run, I get about halfway there. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=438.28s)]
*  Do you know what they do? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=439.28s)]
*  They looked at each other and they started running. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=440.28s)]
*  And I literally screamed at them. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=442.96s)]
*  I go, fuck you. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=443.96s)]
*  Like I got fired up and I learned that the anger is a great like incentive. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=444.96s)]
*  It's like something to fire up. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=451.12s)]
*  And I got so pissed off that my blood pressure, I ran the rest of the race. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=452.12s)]
*  You know, Goggins takes all of his haters comments and he records them and then plays [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=455.24s)]
*  it back to him while he runs. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=460.52s)]
*  Oh, I know David well. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=462.0s)]
*  I've known David going on like 15 years, man, before Goggins became Goggins. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=463.2s)]
*  I've seen the whole come up. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=467.36s)]
*  How did you meet him? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=468.52s)]
*  So we trained for ultra marathons together. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=469.88s)]
*  He used to live in New York City. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=471.68s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=473.76s)]
*  And we'd go out there and you know, he's shirtless. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=474.76s)]
*  And this is before now, man, he can't go anywhere. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=477.34000000000003s)]

*  He still runs on the street. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=481.04s)]
*  He runs, but man, he's, he's like, that's such a fame. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=482.2s)]
*  That's, you know, we've talked about, but it's he's, he's, I mean, he's inspired countless [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=484.92s)]
*  millions. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=489.16s)]
*  Oh, for sure. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=490.16s)]

*  You know, he got a hold of Tony when Tony was at the end of his career, essentially. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=579.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=582.72s)]
*  You know. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=583.72s)]
*  Well, I mean, that's always it, right? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=584.72s)]
*  Judge a fighter at the prime. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=585.72s)]
*  Well, yeah, absolutely. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=586.88s)]
*  And with fighters, you know, there's just, especially natural fighters that aren't taking [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=588.88s)]
*  any steroids or anything. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=592.52s)]
*  When it gets to a certain point in time, the game is over. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=594.44s)]
*  Just, that's just how it is. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=596.9200000000001s)]
*  Right? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=598.6s)]
*  Time is undefeated. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=599.6s)]
*  Time's undefeated. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=600.6s)]
*  But fucking Goggins, almost 50, still out there doing it. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=601.6s)]
*  And has been injured so many times. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=605.9200000000001s)]
*  Not just injured. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=607.5200000000001s)]
*  People need to understand the mental strength. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=608.8800000000001s)]
*  And we've talked about on the podcast where we showed his x-rays. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=610.9200000000001s)]
*  The work that he's had done on his knees. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=613.96s)]
*  I mean, it's all insane. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=615.44s)]
*  It's insane. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=616.94s)]
*  They do experimental stuff on his knees. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=617.94s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=619.4000000000001s)]
*  His knees are destroyed. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=620.4000000000001s)]
*  I mean, they must be. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=621.4000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they're destroyed. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=622.4000000000001s)]
*  They're complete bone on bone. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=623.4000000000001s)]
*  And he just keeps running on them. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=624.4000000000001s)]
*  It's just like, okay. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=626.2800000000001s)]
*  He cross trains though. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=628.5200000000001s)]
*  I mean, the dude, like the pull-up record, his hands. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=629.5200000000001s)]
*  Cam Hayneson, right? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=632.84s)]
*  True. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=633.84s)]
*  Man, what a stud that kid is. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=635.24s)]
*  I've been watching. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=636.48s)]
*  Chip off the old block. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=637.48s)]
*  I follow him. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=638.48s)]
*  He is, I never met him, but man, he's great. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=639.48s)]
*  That consistency and that putting that together. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=641.36s)]
*  And yeah, very impressive. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=644.08s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=645.8000000000001s)]
*  I've known him since he was a kid. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=646.8000000000001s)]
*  So to me, it's fun to watch him become a man and then become this beast. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=648.24s)]
*  Beast. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=652.08s)]
*  Yeah, it's amazing. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=653.08s)]
*  I mean, he did, I think it was, was it 9,000 chin-ups in 24 hours or 10,000? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=654.08s)]
*  I think it was more. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=658.6800000000001s)]
*  9,000 was the record. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=659.6800000000001s)]
*  I think he stuck with 10,001 and I'm good. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=660.6800000000001s)]
*  9,000 was the record and he got to 10,000. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=663.08s)]
*  So he broke the record first and then some cat in Australia broke the record, beat his [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=665.6800000000001s)]
*  record and then he just demolished that guy's record. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=670.12s)]
*  And then I saw his thing, which was a flex, which reminded me of something I did, which [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=672.84s)]
*  was like one of the highlight moments of my running career, which is he goes, I got another [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=675.5600000000001s)]
*  personal best in the same week at a marathon. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=679.12s)]
*  And so he ran. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=681.36s)]
*  So I one time did two marathons a week apart, like six days apart. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=682.88s)]
*  I did a New Jersey marathon. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=686.88s)]
*  I won it. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=687.96s)]
*  And then the next week I did Long Island marathon and I got clipped by some college runner who [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=689.36s)]
*  beat me in the last like quarter of a mile. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=693.28s)]
*  Damn, you won a marathon? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=695.1999999999999s)]
*  I won that one four times in a row. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=696.68s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=698.7199999999999s)]
*  What's the time? [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=699.7199999999999s)]
*  My fast times are 2 23. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=700.7199999999999s)]
*  Two hours and 23 minutes for a fucking marathon? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=702.28s)]
*  Yeah, I love Goggins, but every race we've run against each other, I beat him. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=705.56s)]
*  Well, you have two knees. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=709.48s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=712.6s)]
*  That's world class, man. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=714.6s)]
*  I mean, it's like a fast for a weekend warrior. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=715.6s)]
*  Two hours and 23 minutes? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=719.84s)]
*  One year at the New York City Marathon. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=721.16s)]
*  I want to remember this. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=723.16s)]
*  I got 30th place, but at my shows, I tell people I was the fastest Jew. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=724.16s)]
*  That's all that mattered. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=727.44s)]
*  That's all the fastest Jew. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=728.44s)]
*  All that mattered. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=729.44s)]
*  That's super impressive that you win marathons. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=732.08s)]
*  I won that one. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=734.44s)]
*  And then six days later, six or seven, I did this other one and I got beat by this kid [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=735.44s)]
*  who was like 22. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=739.16s)]
*  I don't care how old I was, 30s. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=740.16s)]
*  And he beat me and he fell and collapsed at the finish. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=742.16s)]
*  And I'm like, again, I'm pretty fresh. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=744.72s)]
*  And he goes, oh my God, man. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=746.36s)]
*  He goes, is that your personal best? [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=748.0799999999999s)]
*  And I'll never forget looking in his eyes. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=749.92s)]
*  And this guy's wrecked. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=752.04s)]
*  And I go, bro, that's not my personal best this week. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=753.04s)]
*  And it was just the most fulfilling thing to say for not having won. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=755.52s)]
*  But I'd run literally a week earlier, faster. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=759.48s)]
*  So that was a great moment. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=761.88s)]
*  Yeah, but he beat you. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=763.36s)]
*  He did beat me. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=764.36s)]
*  True. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=765.36s)]
*  First loser. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=766.36s)]
*  That's a weird flex. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=767.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=768.36s)]
*  It's a weird flex. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=769.36s)]
*  So you were a stockbroker? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=770.36s)]
*  I wasn't technically a stockbroker. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=771.36s)]
*  I worked on Wall Street. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=772.36s)]
*  But I did tech. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=773.76s)]
*  What did you do on Wall Street? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=774.76s)]
*  I worked for electrical engineering and then worked like, I don't know, the tech guys who [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=775.8s)]
*  supported the iBankers. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=779.4s)]
*  OK. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=780.84s)]
*  And then how did you get involved in this mentalist thing? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=781.84s)]
*  This mentalist thing, right? [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=784.6s)]
*  What a weird thing. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=785.72s)]
*  So when I was a teenager, I started doing magic tricks. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=786.72s)]
*  So I saw a guy on a cruise ship and I'd never seen really a magician. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=789.88s)]
*  I wasn't into it, didn't know about it, didn't have a kid's party magician when I was a kid. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=793.92s)]
*  And I was obsessed. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=797.3199999999999s)]
*  Literally, I was on a cruise. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=798.3199999999999s)]
*  I followed this guy around the cruise ship. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=800.04s)]
*  It was a little bit stalker-esque. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=802.72s)]
*  And there's not that many places to hide if you're a grown man. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=804.1999999999999s)]
*  So I was finding this guy everywhere to just see more tricks. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=806.1999999999999s)]
*  And I got back home and I bought every book I could at Borders. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=809.76s)]
*  I went to the library. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=813.52s)]
*  I was obsessive. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=814.52s)]
*  I'm kind of those types of people who I don't do anything 80%, 90% given the running today. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=815.52s)]
*  It's like 120%. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=821.0799999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=822.0799999999999s)]
*  And that was the thing for about, I don't know, 20 years. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=823.0799999999999s)]
*  It was more I was doing magic. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=825.64s)]
*  I was always doing magic on the side. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=826.76s)]
*  I paid for college doing magic. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=828.28s)]
*  Really? [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=829.68s)]
*  I run a couple of businesses. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=830.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=831.68s)]
*  What did you do? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=832.68s)]
*  So I graduated high school when I was 16. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=833.68s)]
*  I skipped a grade, all this. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=835.4399999999999s)]
*  And then my folks got divorced. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=837.3599999999999s)]
*  Long story. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=839.0s)]
*  And they moved back to Israel. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=840.0s)]
*  I was born in Israel. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=841.4s)]
*  So separately moved back to Israel. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=842.4s)]
*  So I was a bit of, I guess, I don't know, an adult. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=843.92s)]
*  Like I had nobody supporting me. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=846.7199999999999s)]
*  So when I went to college, I turned 17, I had to pay all the bills. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=847.92s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=851.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=852.0799999999999s)]
*  So I was doing magic at restaurants. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=853.0799999999999s)]
*  I've been doing magic at restaurants for like 30 years. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=854.56s)]
*  And that's where I learned how to read people. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=857.1999999999999s)]
*  Just how to go up to a table of people who are like, who's this twerp? [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=858.64s)]
*  Like who's this nerdy kid with braces? [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=862.2800000000001s)]
*  Like what are you doing here? [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=863.8000000000001s)]
*  Get out of here. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=864.8000000000001s)]
*  And how do you win them over quickly? [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=865.8000000000001s)]
*  And that's honestly the biggest skill is how do you in sales read people effectively? [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=867.48s)]
*  Right? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=872.5600000000001s)]
*  That's what I'm selling. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=873.72s)]
*  I'm selling the thought of reading your mind. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=874.72s)]
*  Now did you learn the techniques from books? [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=877.08s)]
*  Did you take classes? [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=879.24s)]
*  No classes, books and videos, did magic. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=880.24s)]
*  And so mentalism is kind of a field. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=884.2800000000001s)]
*  Like you had David Blaine in here, right? [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=887.9200000000001s)]
*  Legend. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=889.8000000000001s)]
*  He's a growing up like icon. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=890.8s)]
*  So magic tricks are different because magic is there's slight of hand, right? [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=893.04s)]
*  So you're deceiving your eye by making you look at the wrong place at the right time [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=898.92s)]
*  when I do a move and I can practice that move over and over and over until I get it perfect [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=903.9599999999999s)]
*  so that when I perform for you, it works. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=908.4399999999999s)]
*  Right? [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=910.64s)]
*  Standup comedy, the most pure art form, right? [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=911.64s)]
*  You and a mic. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=914.12s)]
*  That's it. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=915.12s)]
*  Mine is the closest magic. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=916.12s)]
*  You have props. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=917.12s)]
*  Mentalism. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=918.12s)]
*  There's no props. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=919.12s)]
*  I don't need you to pick a card anymore. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=920.44s)]
*  I don't need it. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=921.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=922.76s)]
*  I can just tell you, think of a card and that's where I go with it. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=923.76s)]
*  So now you start knowing how people think and you in essence reverse engineer the human [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=926.04s)]
*  mind. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=930.12s)]
*  It's kind of like magic of the mind. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=931.12s)]
*  And so that's where it kind of went from magic and I kept doing more of the mentalism, more [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=932.92s)]
*  of it. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=936.92s)]
*  But mentalism has a very steep learning curve. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=937.92s)]
*  If you go do an open mic and you suck, how many people get to the level of getting better, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=940.16s)]
*  getting better, putting in the work, takes 10 years to be funny for most people, right? [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=945.28s)]
*  There's a couple of phenoms, but that's a different story. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=949.2s)]
*  So most mentalists, they drop off because I'm just going to go back to magic tricks. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=952.4000000000001s)]
*  This works every time. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=956.48s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=958.2800000000001s)]
*  So it's more difficult to learn. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=959.6800000000001s)]
*  Way more difficult. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=961.52s)]
*  Is it sheltered? [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=962.52s)]
*  Like, is the material on it difficult to find? [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=963.52s)]
*  I think it's more that people don't have the thick skin. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=967.36s)]
*  Like the same way you said the quitting mentality where I came back the year later, most people [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=969.9000000000001s)]
*  won't improve because you can't practice mentalism in front of a mirror. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=973.6s)]
*  You can practice magic. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=977.2s)]
*  So when I do the trick on you and it's a card trick, no offense to magic, it's great, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=978.56s)]
*  but what we're talking about is a much higher level. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=982.78s)]
*  I can't get it right and the first few times you do it, the first hundred times, you eat [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=985.1199999999999s)]
*  shit like you're going to get it wrong and most people don't want to do that. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=990.52s)]
*  Oh. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=993.56s)]
*  Watch, watch. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=994.56s)]
*  Let's try something fun. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=995.56s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=996.56s)]
*  Okay? [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=997.56s)]
*  How about this? [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=998.56s)]
*  If I were to ask you, how long have you been married? [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=999.56s)]
*  Sixteen years. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1002.4799999999999s)]
*  Okay, nailed that question. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1003.4799999999999s)]
*  Well played. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1004.4799999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1005.4799999999999s)]
*  Your sister's happy, your wife's happy. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1006.4799999999999s)]
*  If I asked you, would your wife know your social security number? [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1007.94s)]
*  No. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1010.98s)]
*  She doesn't know it. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1011.98s)]
*  No. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1012.98s)]
*  So is there any way in the world I could know your social security number? [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1013.98s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1015.4200000000001s)]
*  Right? [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1016.4200000000001s)]
*  You say I'm a stalker, who knows? [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1017.4200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you could get the information. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1018.4200000000001s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1019.4200000000001s)]
*  Online. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1020.4200000000001s)]
*  Agreed. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1021.4200000000001s)]
*  Agreed. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1022.4200000000001s)]
*  I'm skeptical, you're skeptical. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1023.4200000000001s)]
*  Well, especially someone famous. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1024.42s)]
*  Yeah, fully. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1025.42s)]
*  Plus you can't change that, so I'm not going to do that to you. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1026.42s)]
*  Data dumps. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1027.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1028.78s)]
*  If I told you right now to make up a random number, I'd say get out your calculator. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1029.78s)]
*  I'd love that and you add it up and you do a random number. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1033.38s)]
*  You know, I'm screw calculating. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1035.5800000000002s)]
*  I want it to be spontaneous. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1037.82s)]
*  Would your wife know your ATM pin code? [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1039.06s)]
*  No. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1041.06s)]
*  No. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1042.06s)]
*  Lie to me. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1043.06s)]
*  Do not tell me your real ATM pin code. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1044.06s)]
*  Okay. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1045.06s)]
*  Obviously, unless you want to. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1046.06s)]
*  Make up a fake four digit number off the top of your head. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1047.5s)]
*  What feels to you utterly spontaneous when I say go, one, two, three, four digit code, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1050.9399999999998s)]
*  random, go. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1056.46s)]
*  Okay. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1057.46s)]
*  Say it. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1058.46s)]
*  2020. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1059.46s)]
*  2020, okay. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1060.46s)]
*  So you ask me how do I do what I do? [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1061.46s)]
*  I'm going to write down 2020. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1062.46s)]
*  Okay. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1065.46s)]
*  It's weird, but statistically, men will lie bigger, women smaller. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1066.46s)]
*  Men like to lie by saying things are bigger, right? [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1073.42s)]
*  No shocker. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1074.98s)]
*  Okay. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1075.98s)]
*  So I don't think I would tell you right off the jump for me that that means that your first [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1076.98s)]
*  number, you don't have to say anything yet. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1081.18s)]
*  I wrote 2020 is smaller. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1082.82s)]
*  That's what most people do when they're rushed. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1084.42s)]
*  If I had given you five minutes, you would have done this different. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1085.94s)]
*  No, I wouldn't have. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1087.8600000000001s)]
*  No, you would have. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1088.8600000000001s)]
*  Why would I have? [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1089.8600000000001s)]
*  Because you would have thought about it and then people go down a different path. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1091.3s)]
*  Nope. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1093.94s)]
*  No? [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1094.94s)]
*  Okay. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1096.42s)]
*  So I'll say it either way. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1097.42s)]
*  You'll be honest if I'm right. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1098.42s)]
*  Okay. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1099.42s)]
*  I got a hit, which means it's a zero or one. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1100.42s)]
*  I think the first number you're codes a one, isn't it? [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1102.66s)]
*  Your real pin code. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1104.5s)]
*  My ATM pin code? [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1108.18s)]
*  ATM pin code. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1109.18s)]
*  Why would I tell you that on the air? [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1110.18s)]
*  Should I only show this to you? [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1112.14s)]
*  Sure. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1113.9s)]
*  Only show it to you. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1114.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1115.9s)]
*  Can we acquiesce that the first number I got was correct? [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1116.9s)]
*  Yes. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1118.1000000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1119.1000000000001s)]
*  Now you did repetition. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1120.1000000000001s)]
*  So I like the fact when people always say to me it's fake when they watch the videos, [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1121.5800000000002s)]
*  they're like, you must have set up. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1125.5s)]
*  Joe doesn't even want this to happen right now. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1126.9s)]
*  He had no idea this was going to happen. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1128.34s)]
*  You use two numbers in repeat. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1129.94s)]
*  What that means is you probably did the same thing. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1131.98s)]
*  You also didn't use any of the same numbers. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1133.7s)]
*  I know there's not a two, a zero, or a two in it. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1134.98s)]
*  I don't think so either. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1136.7s)]
*  And I'm watching you while I say it. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1139.5s)]
*  You put the hand up. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1140.5s)]
*  You might as well have said yes to me out loud. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1141.5s)]
*  So now I know. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1142.54s)]
*  Think of the second number, third number, fourth number. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1144.22s)]
*  Every time you did it, it's a data point. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1147.98s)]
*  Okay. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1150.74s)]
*  I'm only going to ask you one more question. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1151.74s)]
*  I'm not looking for answers. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1154.66s)]
*  The last number is the biggest, isn't it? [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1156.0600000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1158.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1159.26s)]
*  I'm showing this to you. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1160.26s)]
*  Is there a camera behind me? [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1161.26s)]
*  I don't want to make sure I'm only going to show it to you. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1162.66s)]
*  It's not 2020. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1165.66s)]
*  How did I do Joe? [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1168.38s)]
*  Is that your ATM pin code? [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1169.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1172.38s)]
*  That's weird. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1174.3000000000002s)]
*  I'm skeptical because I've got that pin code in the mail. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1177.3000000000002s)]
*  He's calling his bank right now and be like, do you know this? [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1183.18s)]
*  Has this guy been playing the long game? [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1185.18s)]
*  Yeah, I don't like that. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1186.42s)]
*  It's not 1950 anymore, people. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1188.1000000000001s)]
*  We know our food is different, highly processed and less nutritious. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1190.1000000000001s)]
*  Industrial farming practices often strip nutrients from the soil and can deplete the nutrients [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1194.0600000000002s)]

*  So I want everyone to know that was correct, right? [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1266.74s)]
*  That is, you went 2020. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1267.74s)]
*  Yeah, that was correct. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1268.74s)]
*  Your wife of 16 years doesn't know it, now I do. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1270.54s)]
*  It's 2020 not, it's just because that's the year I moved here. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1272.8200000000002s)]
*  It wasn't like. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1276.38s)]
*  I think, I know you think that's the case. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1277.38s)]
*  No, that's 100% the case. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1278.8600000000001s)]
*  That's exactly what it is. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1281.02s)]
*  What do you mean, you know, I think that's the case? [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1282.02s)]
*  You said a four digit number and I was like, oh, the date I moved here. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1285.8200000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1289.0600000000002s)]
*  2020, perfect. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1290.0600000000002s)]
*  I hear you. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1291.94s)]
*  You don't believe me. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1293.46s)]
*  It's not that I don't believe you. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1294.46s)]
*  It's that we got layers. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1295.8600000000001s)]
*  So like we're peeling through and I know why you think you picked it. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1297.26s)]
*  And I know that you think you gave me no information. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1300.06s)]
*  But I'm telling you that good luck finding out how in the world could I have found out [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1301.7s)]
*  your ATM pin code. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1306.66s)]
*  You said nobody knows this. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1307.8200000000002s)]
*  That informed what I did. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1309.6200000000001s)]
*  So had you thought of a different number of your social security, you wouldn't have said [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1311.8200000000002s)]
*  2020. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1314.22s)]
*  But that ATM pin code is one that was assigned to me by the bank and I never changed it. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1315.22s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1319.5800000000002s)]
*  So I didn't pick it. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1320.5800000000002s)]
*  That's even better, isn't it? [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1322.1s)]
*  Had you picked it, I could have looked this up. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1323.54s)]
*  That's actually to me more of a gold standard. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1325.3799999999999s)]
*  No, because you could get it from the bank because the bank is the one that fucking sent [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1327.22s)]
*  it to me. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1330.94s)]
*  I guess, man, if I have broken into your bank account, there are bigger things at play than [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1332.26s)]
*  this podcast, I feel. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1336.98s)]
*  I don't keep a lot of money in that account. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1338.18s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1341.34s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1342.34s)]
*  How many UFC fights do you think you've seen in person or commentated? [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1343.34s)]
*  Boy, I don't even know. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1346.3s)]
*  I really don't know. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1348.98s)]
*  What UFC number are we on? [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1350.94s)]
*  UFC 200... what is it? [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1352.42s)]
*  234 or something? [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1355.42s)]
*  What is it at now? [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1360.42s)]
*  235 is the next one? [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1362.02s)]
*  But each fight has an undercard, you got the title fight. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1363.98s)]
*  Sometimes as many as 15 fights. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1366.66s)]
*  Or as few as... [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1369.22s)]
*  3. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1370.22s)]
*  3. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1371.22s)]
*  316. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1372.22s)]
*  What is it? [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1373.22s)]
*  316. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1374.22s)]
*  UFC 316 is now? [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1375.22s)]
*  One coming up on June 7th. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1376.22s)]
*  What did I say, two? [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1377.22s)]
*  Yeah, I was thinking two for a second. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1378.22s)]
*  Didn't we have 300 already? [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1379.46s)]
*  Oh, you know what I'm thinking? [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1380.46s)]
*  I'm confusing podcast numbers. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1381.46s)]
*  We're in the 2000s. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1383.06s)]
*  Oh yeah, you're a lot of podcasts. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1384.06s)]
*  UFC, yeah. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1385.98s)]
*  So it's UFC 3 what? [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1386.98s)]
*  316. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1388.46s)]
*  316. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1389.46s)]
*  With 10 fights per... [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1390.46s)]
*  So I haven't been on all those cards, but I started commentary-wise in 2021 and just [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1391.46s)]
*  as a post-fight interviewer in 97. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1401.22s)]
*  So 97, I did it for two years, not as many shows. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1403.78s)]
*  And then from 2001, I used to do 20 a year. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1407.82s)]
*  I used to do a lot. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1414.5s)]
*  I was doing most of them. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1415.7s)]
*  I would say thousands of fights. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1417.8999999999999s)]
*  Thousands, right? [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1420.22s)]
*  Probably. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1421.22s)]
*  Watch this, because I love that... [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1422.22s)]
*  I like the way you think and I like that you're skeptical, because I'm a huge skeptic. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1423.6599999999999s)]
*  I'm always the one calling BS on this. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1427.1799999999998s)]
*  That's how I started doing it. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1429.58s)]
*  If you think through all your fights and you go back in time, and they need to know this [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1431.82s)]
*  is spontaneous, this is impulsive. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1434.74s)]
*  You have not thought of this before this moment, have you? [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1436.78s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1439.22s)]
*  I want you to stop and start thinking of different fighters, past or present. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1440.22s)]

*  A lot of them. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1637.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1638.54s)]

*  Like straight up, I'm a fanboy of comedians, like not the people that do what I do, because [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1644.3799999999999s)]
*  that's, I just love watching how you can take any premise and stuff that's not funny, right? [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1649.02s)]
*  The people that really go, you know, like Andrew Schultz, Life, did you watch his? [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1654.7s)]
*  I haven't seen it yet. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1659.58s)]

*  No. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1661.58s)]
*  So how do you take infertility, right? [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1662.58s)]
*  And just, it's not really a very funny subject and make it incredible. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1663.58s)]
*  One of the best specials. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1667.1s)]
*  He's amazing. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1668.1s)]
*  He's so good. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1669.1s)]
*  So good. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1670.1s)]
*  I like the fact that how you invent that. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1671.6599999999999s)]
*  So I design with an end in sight. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1672.78s)]
*  I say, what do I want people to remember about what I do? [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1675.2199999999998s)]
*  Because I'm not really in the business of fooling you, honestly, and like entertaining [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1680.3799999999999s)]
*  you. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1684.1s)]
*  All of those are side effects. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1685.1s)]
*  What do I think I do for a living? [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1686.1s)]
*  I create memorable moments, which is very definable because if you go see a movie, let's [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1688.06s)]
*  say you see a popcorn flick, you walk out of the movie theater, 10 minutes like, what [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1692.78s)]
*  happened in the movie? [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1696.86s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1697.86s)]
*  It was fun. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1698.86s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1699.86s)]
*  I'm 100% like the death of my show. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1701.62s)]
*  You leave and you will remember things, hopefully for years to come. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1703.58s)]
*  And that's because I can rework your memory. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1708.6999999999998s)]
*  That's really a lot of the techniques I do. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1711.4599999999998s)]
*  People think that your memory is infallible, that what you see is some sort of blueprint, [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1713.34s)]
*  like a video. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1717.58s)]
*  And it's not. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1718.58s)]
*  It has to do with how you feel in the moment, the emotions, the things you can position [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1720.1s)]
*  the same way hypnosis works. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1723.78s)]
*  So I can kind of engineer memories in a certain way, the way people remember things, the way [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1725.34s)]
*  they think and create those moments that people talk about hopefully for years. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1728.94s)]
*  And that's what's been, you know, I guess that's what's been the driver of my business [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1732.8600000000001s)]
*  and what's helped lead to my success. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1736.42s)]
*  Engineering memories. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1738.9s)]
*  And when you first started getting into mentalism, is that the word to use for it? [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1739.9s)]
*  Mentalism? [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1743.5800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1744.5800000000002s)]
*  You're a mentalist, but do you call it mentalism? [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1745.5800000000002s)]
*  I guess so. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1746.5800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, mentalism. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1747.5800000000002s)]
*  Did you know that or is it something that... [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1748.5800000000002s)]
*  No, I learned it. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1750.7800000000002s)]
*  I learned certain things and I observed them and I didn't understand why they happened. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1751.7800000000002s)]
*  Do you ever have that? [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1755.22s)]
*  You ever have a moment in a set where you say it's something that you didn't think was [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1756.42s)]
*  funny but got a huge laugh? [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1759.18s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1760.82s)]
*  Do you have that or do you always know? [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1761.82s)]
*  Sure. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1762.82s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1763.82s)]
*  Because it's usually not the punch. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1764.82s)]
*  It's like, I didn't know that would be funny right then. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1765.82s)]
*  Oftentimes with the new bit. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1766.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1767.82s)]
*  Right? [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1768.82s)]
*  You don't exactly know where it's funny. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1769.82s)]
*  Where the beats are. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1770.82s)]
*  What was the word I said in this way? [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1771.82s)]
*  What was that inflection point? [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1772.82s)]
*  So when I was doing restaurants, I had this trick where I would have somebody pick a card [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1773.94s)]
*  out of a deck of cards, right? [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1778.1000000000001s)]
*  They would put the card back in the deck. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1780.3s)]
*  They sign it with their name. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1781.58s)]
*  And I used to do this at a bunch of restaurants. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1783.22s)]
*  They would shuffle up the deck. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1785.1s)]
*  I give them a rubber band. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1786.1s)]
*  I say, rubber band that bad boy. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1787.1s)]
*  And I would take the deck and I would throw it at the ceiling. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1788.54s)]
*  It's kind of a famous trick. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1790.78s)]
*  And then boom, the ceilings were really high at all the restaurants I worked at. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1792.3799999999999s)]
*  So nobody could peel in that. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1794.74s)]
*  Their card would stay stuck to the ceiling. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1796.1s)]
*  And this was great for multiple ways. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1799.26s)]
*  One, everybody talks about it. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1800.74s)]
*  And they're like, dude, this guy stuck my card to the ceiling. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1801.74s)]
*  How the hell did he do that? [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1803.54s)]
*  They would also bring people back to the restaurant. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1804.54s)]
*  You write cha-ching, cha-ching. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1806.82s)]
*  The managers love me because we'd bring more people back to see it and point at where their [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1808.1s)]
*  card was, right? [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1812.1399999999999s)]
*  Business 101. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1813.62s)]
*  So I create a great value proposition to the manager. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1814.9399999999998s)]
*  Why am I there? [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1817.34s)]
*  I'm getting you guys more customers. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1818.34s)]
*  But one time I'm listening to people that came back in and they're talking about the [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1820.02s)]
*  trick and they go, yo, man, I picked a card. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1824.9799999999998s)]
*  I put it back in the deck and I shuffled it up. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1828.1s)]
*  And next thing I know, I look at the ceiling and my card's on the ceiling. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1830.74s)]
*  And I'm like, yo, that's not what happened. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1833.06s)]
*  I threw the deck up. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1834.86s)]
*  The deck fell down and then the card was on the ceiling. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1836.6999999999998s)]
*  So I go, why did that guy misremember it? [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1839.3799999999999s)]
*  Maybe he's just drunk, maybe whatever. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1842.06s)]
*  But I'm trying to understand why did he have a different memory of the same event? [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1843.3s)]
*  And what I realized is that people observe what you have them focus on. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1848.62s)]
*  Tony Robbins has a great bit where he goes, right now, close your eyes. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1853.82s)]
*  Tell me everything that's green in this room. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1855.94s)]
*  And you're like, green? [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1857.6599999999999s)]
*  But then when you open your eyes, I see that the UFO lights are green instantly. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1859.78s)]
*  But I say, close your eyes again. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1864.1s)]
*  What's purple in this room? [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1865.3s)]
*  I'm like, I didn't look for purple. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1866.3s)]
*  You find what you're looking for. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1867.78s)]
*  So if I didn't say, it took me a while to iterate and figure it out. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1869.86s)]
*  But if I don't look up when I throw the cards, when I would throw the cards up and let them [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1874.3799999999999s)]
*  fall back down in my hand and not look up, the percentage would go 80, 90 percent that [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1878.58s)]
*  afterwards, people, when they told the story, they edited, they clipped out the part of [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1882.6599999999999s)]
*  me throwing the deck. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1887.4599999999998s)]
*  And now it becomes a miracle. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1889.3s)]
*  How the hell is that card on the ceiling stuck? [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1890.58s)]
*  You mean you shuffled it, it was signed, it's on the ceiling? [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1892.3s)]
*  That went from being a good trick to a miracle. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1894.78s)]
*  And I kind of learned that at about age 15. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1897.06s)]
*  And I started to realize, how do I do that with everything I do? [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1899.06s)]
*  Because that's a life hack for everything you do. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1902.1799999999998s)]
*  That's not magic. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1905.0s)]
*  That's life. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1906.3799999999999s)]
*  How do you get people to remember what you want and forget the things you don't want? [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1907.3799999999999s)]
*  That's how you achieve success. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1913.22s)]
*  You start to highlight your strengths. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1914.6599999999999s)]
*  You find ways and that's a learnable skill. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1917.84s)]
*  That's not something for magic. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1920.3s)]
*  That's something in all of life. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1921.44s)]
*  And what is it like when you're thinking this, when you're thinking I'm going to get people [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1923.1s)]
*  to remember something? [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1926.1799999999998s)]
*  How are you doing this? [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1928.3400000000001s)]
*  What's your intention when you're trying to devise what to do? [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1929.3400000000001s)]
*  Well I guess my intention, at the end of the day I'm a competitive SOB. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1933.74s)]
*  I want to be the best in the world at what I do. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1937.06s)]
*  I'm driven by that. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1938.8600000000001s)]
*  It's like Olympic gold medalist. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1939.8600000000001s)]
*  I want to do the best things possible. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1941.42s)]
*  Most people don't know what a mentalist is. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1943.6200000000001s)]
*  You go on the street, 100 people, how many people are going to say yeah? [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1945.22s)]
*  I have a second ATM card. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1947.78s)]
*  Leave that for the end. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1952.26s)]
*  You want to try it again? [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1953.26s)]
*  Not yet. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1954.26s)]
*  I don't want to do the same thing. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1955.26s)]
*  I got to do better stuff. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1956.26s)]
*  I want to see if you can do it again. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1957.26s)]
*  Alright before we go, how about that? [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1958.26s)]
*  Not right now. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1960.18s)]
*  We're in flow. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1961.18s)]
*  Okay, okay. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1962.18s)]
*  I'm trying to throw you off. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1963.18s)]
*  You could. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1965.3799999999999s)]
*  Listen, I don't get it right every time. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1966.3799999999999s)]
*  That's the other part. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1967.7s)]
*  A magic trick works every time. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1968.7s)]
*  This doesn't. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1969.82s)]
*  I've eaten it on live national TV with millions of people watching. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1970.82s)]
*  Yeah man, there's no safety net. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1974.98s)]
*  It's not a trick. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1976.86s)]
*  It's not a card trick where you put it in and I find it. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1977.86s)]
*  It's not like that. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1979.54s)]
*  So how are you doing it? [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1980.54s)]
*  I'm telling you, I don't read minds. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1981.54s)]
*  I read people. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1983.58s)]
*  I've got a whole host of different skills, algorithms, you name it, like misdirection. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1984.58s)]
*  It's all a wheelhouse of skills that I'm using to create the impression that I can read your [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1989.74s)]
*  mind. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1993.3799999999999s)]
*  But this has got to be a weird thing to know how to do. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1994.3799999999999s)]
*  Weird like in a bad way or a good way? [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=1998.6999999999998s)]
*  Definitely a good way. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2001.6599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2002.6599999999999s)]
*  But weird to like you have like an extra frequency. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2003.6599999999999s)]
*  I agree. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2006.46s)]
*  You're tuning into with humans. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2007.46s)]
*  Like you're experiencing life in a different way because you're experiencing life through [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2009.46s)]
*  this understanding of like thought patterns. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2013.14s)]
*  It's you know what the best way. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2015.5400000000002s)]
*  Do you remember in born identity, the first scene, like one of the scenes where he loses [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2017.42s)]
*  memory and he walks in the restaurant. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2021.7s)]
*  You remember that scene and he's sitting at a diner. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2023.38s)]
*  Do you remember that one? [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2024.94s)]
*  I don't. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2025.94s)]
*  He sits there and he turns and he goes, he doesn't remember who he is. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2026.94s)]
*  And he goes, why do I know? [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2029.66s)]
*  And I'm going to massacre this quote, but why do I know that that guy's 250 can handle [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2031.3000000000002s)]
*  himself in a fight? [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2035.0600000000002s)]
*  Why do I know this? [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2036.0600000000002s)]
*  Why do I know that right now I could run for two and a half miles before my core temperature [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2037.0600000000002s)]
*  goes down to this? [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2040.22s)]
*  It's like this amazing superhero spy moment of like, how the hell does he know all that [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2041.38s)]
*  stuff? [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2045.5s)]
*  So he's observing life at a much more hyper focused level than most people are. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2046.5s)]
*  Most people are dialed in at autopilot. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2053.26s)]
*  If you could set a speaker to autopilot and here's what you're observing. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2055.66s)]
*  I don't do it in my day to day life. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2059.66s)]
*  It requires focus. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2061.38s)]
*  It's not the same. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2062.88s)]
*  It's kind of like, I guess, I don't know, I don't lift weights. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2063.98s)]
*  I just run. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2066.06s)]
*  But how much focus is required to try to do the largest bench press you've ever done? [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2067.3s)]
*  I assume that you have to get psyched up. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2071.82s)]
*  You have to focus. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2073.1000000000004s)]
*  You have to do everything right for that to work. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2074.1000000000004s)]
*  Just an analogy. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2075.34s)]
*  But for me, when I'm performing, you asked me why I run 27 miles this morning. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2076.34s)]
*  That dials in my mind. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2080.3s)]
*  Like I'm focused or I thought through everything I'm going to do today. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2081.6200000000003s)]
*  It's a laser focus. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2086.1000000000004s)]
*  That got me kind of in tune. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2088.2200000000003s)]
*  I could also have not run, but I'm also away from home, so that was like my joy. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2089.5800000000004s)]
*  Is the sequel better than the original? [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2095.58s)]

*  So when you're putting together a show, when you're going to do a show, how do you structure [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2182.02s)]
*  it? [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2202.34s)]
*  Like how do you, like day one, you're like, okay, I'm getting ready to do a show. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2203.34s)]
*  You mean some on TV or like what I do for a living, like events? [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2206.86s)]
*  Or either one. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2209.46s)]
*  What kind of show you're doing? [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2210.9s)]
*  So for my day to day living, which is I do a lot of like really big corporate events, [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2212.5s)]
*  and then I do, you know, I guess a lot of private parties, things of that sort, performances, [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2217.02s)]
*  like live performances. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2220.62s)]
*  Typically I structure it the same way I think anybody would. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2223.34s)]
*  I want to go out the gate very strong. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2225.7s)]
*  I want to very instantly establish credibility. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2227.46s)]
*  Who am I? [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2230.94s)]
*  What do I do? [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2231.94s)]
*  Am I any good at it? [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2232.94s)]
*  And why should you be paying attention to me? [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2234.82s)]
*  Because all those questions off the jump is like, who the hell cares? [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2236.54s)]
*  I always go into it with who cares what you can do. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2238.7s)]
*  You're special. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2241.14s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2242.14s)]
*  I like the thought of I'm going to prove to you that this is something incredible and [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2243.14s)]
*  that it's something you're interested in emotionally. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2246.14s)]
*  Right? [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2248.2999999999997s)]
*  If I told you to make a random number up, who cares? [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2249.2999999999997s)]
*  But now it's going to haunt you that that's your freaking ATM pin code. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2251.66s)]
*  So I prefer that. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2254.7799999999997s)]
*  I do something very quick that freaks you out. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2256.1s)]
*  And then every single thing needs to have a very clear premise. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2258.94s)]
*  Like I call it clarity of effect. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2263.3199999999997s)]
*  I don't like a trick where I'm like, get a book, get a Rubik's Cube, get it. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2265.5s)]
*  Like, it's too confusing. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2268.66s)]
*  You need to be able to explain to a six year old what I did in one sentence for it to be [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2270.18s)]
*  memorable. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2274.58s)]
*  That's the key. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2276.1s)]
*  The best things you've ever seen are typically stuff you can describe in one max two sentences. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2277.1s)]
*  And for TV, for TV, it's the same same exact thing, but I always like to do new stuff. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2282.7s)]
*  So I have done a lot of TV appearances and I always structure it based on who's watching. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2289.2400000000002s)]
*  So rather than it being about me and me saying, oh, look what I can do and look how cool this is. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2294.62s)]
*  You do a card trick. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2299.5s)]
*  Again, I'm not saying that's not amazing, but the card trick is about you. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2300.5s)]
*  Typically, if I'm on ESPN and I've done hundreds of millions of views doing stuff for football [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2304.54s)]
*  players, you're watching this. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2309.02s)]
*  You're a football fan. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2310.9s)]
*  You're like, who cares about this guy? [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2311.9s)]
*  I'm going to do stuff about football players and about what interests you if you're a fan. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2312.9s)]
*  I don't know if you've seen, I did a clip with Joe Burrow from the Bengals where I said, [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2317.54s)]
*  Joe, I ever spoken to you a word in my life? [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2321.62s)]
*  And he goes, no. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2323.34s)]
*  Like, I honestly, the funny thing about that is I wasn't even supposed to use him in the show. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2324.34s)]
*  They told me he's shy. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2327.94s)]
*  You don't want to like don't use him in the show. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2328.94s)]
*  And they said, if you can't avoid him, I got in there. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2331.1600000000003s)]
*  I tried to rile up the gang, you know, kind of peer pressure. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2332.6600000000003s)]
*  And I'm like, should we get Joe in here? [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2335.1000000000004s)]
*  And they're like, yeah, get him up. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2336.46s)]
*  Haven't spoken a word to this guy in my life. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2337.82s)]
*  There's no access. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2339.34s)]
*  I went in with ESPN. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2340.34s)]
*  Shout out to Adam Schafter, who I love, who set all these wheels in motion. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2342.34s)]
*  But Joe stands up, doesn't know me from anyone. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2346.36s)]
*  And I say, every wide receiver and tight end in the room stand up. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2349.1000000000004s)]
*  And I go, what if I could tell you who you're going to throw that ball to? [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2353.16s)]
*  What's that worth? [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2357.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2358.16s)]
*  That's the holy grail. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2359.16s)]
*  If you're in football, I go catch the ball quarterback. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2360.16s)]
*  I go look at everyone in this room and I'll look at me. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2361.8799999999997s)]
*  And I wrote on a huge, huge thing, showed the camera, throw it to anybody you want, [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2364.48s)]
*  throws it, got the first one right. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2368.72s)]
*  I go, let's do it again. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2370.3999999999996s)]
*  I go throw it to anyone you want. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2372.0s)]
*  Anyone. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2373.6s)]
*  I go anyone throws it, got the second one right. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2374.6s)]
*  Everyone's freaking out. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2376.64s)]
*  I go one last play. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2377.64s)]
*  One last two is luck. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2378.64s)]
*  And I write fakes to Jamar. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2380.14s)]
*  You can watch the clip. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2381.68s)]
*  Most viral thing I've ever done. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2383.5s)]
*  And he fakes it to Jamar, turns around, throws it to another guy, nailed it exactly. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2384.86s)]
*  Just and you just see his face. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2389.5s)]
*  And so I was thinking about how I would do that for two years, two years of thinking [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2391.48s)]
*  of every single way that could work, not work, go wrong. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2397.06s)]
*  Everything about it was, you know, he thought I went in the room and it's so simple. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2401.62s)]
*  That was two years of me thinking about it during every run. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2405.2s)]
*  So for two years, you knew you were going to do this or you knew that you were? [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2409.0s)]
*  I started with the end. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2413.2s)]
*  You asked me the same way. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2414.58s)]
*  I don't know how you like form a set, but you asked me how do I design? [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2415.72s)]
*  I was designing with the story people would tell. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2418.72s)]
*  And so people that don't know who I am don't anything go, yo, we saw this guy. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2422.24s)]
*  You see this guy? [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2425.48s)]
*  He just told Joe Burrow to throw the ball to any people. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2426.48s)]
*  Throws it, gets it right. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2428.42s)]
*  Like the story is I told the quarterback, anybody he would throw the ball to. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2429.42s)]
*  So it was any quarterback. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2432.94s)]
*  It wasn't Joe Burrow in your head? [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2433.94s)]
*  Well, I didn't know who it would be. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2435.96s)]
*  But he said you could do it for two years. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2437.36s)]
*  So for two years, you thought you were going to be on ESPN and with a quarterback? [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2438.8s)]
*  Well, no. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2442.1600000000003s)]
*  He was the second season. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2443.1600000000003s)]
*  So when I first started it, I start brainstorming. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2444.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm like, I can't control what thoughts come in. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2446.96s)]
*  I'm constantly thinking about what I'm going to do. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2449.0s)]
*  And I just do notes apps. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2450.96s)]
*  I write stuff down in the shower. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2452.6000000000004s)]
*  Like when I run is when I come up with stuff and in the shower, sometimes on airplanes, [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2454.36s)]
*  but I sleep on planes. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2458.1600000000003s)]
*  But that's when it hits me. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2459.1600000000003s)]
*  Like where are your bursts? [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2460.4s)]
*  You must have like, where are you getting material? [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2462.6400000000003s)]
*  Mostly late at night. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2465.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2466.28s)]
*  Yeah, but sometimes driving. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2467.28s)]
*  Driving? [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2468.5600000000004s)]
*  You don't do phone calls or anything? [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2469.5600000000004s)]
*  I mean, phone calls, I'm usually concentrated on talking to people. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2471.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2475.76s)]
*  They're not the times where ideas come to me. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2476.76s)]
*  A lot of times it's driving with no music on. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2478.48s)]
*  Wow. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2481.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I'm never in the car by myself ever. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2482.6400000000003s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2484.28s)]
*  Family. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2485.28s)]
*  Five kids. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2486.28s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2487.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2488.28s)]
*  We're driving to work. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2489.28s)]
*  You know, usually that's when it comes to me. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2491.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2494.28s)]
*  And I'm in New York City. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2495.28s)]
*  Or the sauna. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2496.28s)]
*  Sauna. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2497.28s)]
*  Sauna's good because you can't be on electronics. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2498.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2500.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2501.28s)]
*  Yeah, the phones are a killer. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2502.28s)]
*  The phones like you zap any creativity or boredom. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2503.28s)]
*  You need boredom. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2505.28s)]
*  Yeah, you do need boredom. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2506.28s)]
*  Yeah, you need boredom for ideas to come to you for sure. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2507.28s)]
*  Yep. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2509.84s)]
*  Yeah, that's the problem. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2510.84s)]
*  But essentially with social media, it's like it's a boredom. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2511.84s)]
*  You are still bored, but you are occupied. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2514.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2517.5600000000004s)]
*  You don't get to sit with it. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2518.5600000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2519.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2520.6800000000003s)]
*  Which I think is key because that's when they kind of fire off. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2521.6800000000003s)]
*  And I think that's, you know, not to get into it, but like so many kids now have no way [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2524.76s)]
*  to deal with boredom. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2529.76s)]
*  Yep. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2530.76s)]
*  Like it's like, panic, I got to get my phone. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2531.76s)]
*  I got to, you know, that whole feeling of I wish there was a way to do that. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2533.32s)]
*  They're just completely unaccustomed to not being constantly entertained. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2536.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2540.76s)]
*  Even entertained by nonsense. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2541.76s)]
*  That's not even really entertaining. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2542.76s)]
*  It's just distracting. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2544.5200000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2545.5200000000004s)]
*  Which is a big part of it. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2546.5200000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2547.96s)]
*  So you sat out for two years prepping this thing. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2548.96s)]
*  No, I didn't sit out. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2552.6800000000003s)]
*  I was just always thinking. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2553.76s)]
*  It's like, right. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2554.76s)]
*  I mean, you know, you set out, I should say, set out in your mind. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2555.76s)]
*  You had this idea in your head for two years. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2558.84s)]
*  How do I do it? [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2560.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2561.88s)]
*  How do you do it? [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2562.88s)]
*  How do you do it? [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2563.88s)]
*  That's that. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2564.88s)]
*  That was the question because I didn't know how to do it at first. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2565.88s)]
*  How did you do it? [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2566.88s)]
*  Million dollar question, right? [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2567.88s)]
*  I wouldn't be in business if everybody knew that's kind of. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2569.84s)]
*  Well, okay. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2572.32s)]
*  Even better. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2573.32s)]
*  How did you learn how to do this kind of thing? [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2574.32s)]
*  So I started with books and then there's some videos, but it's a very esoteric. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2576.76s)]
*  What do the books tell you that's applicable? [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2581.1200000000003s)]
*  They give you a series of foundational things like right. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2583.04s)]
*  Almost everybody who becomes a mentalist stars a magician. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2586.12s)]
*  It's kind of like if you're a doctor, you gotta be a doctor before you become a plastic [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2588.72s)]
*  surgeon. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2591.36s)]
*  So there's this core set of skills that you utilize to know how to fool people, right? [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2592.36s)]
*  To know how people think. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2597.6s)]
*  Okay. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2598.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2599.6s)]
*  Think about you. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2600.6s)]
*  If I taught you a card trick right now, there's always a level of deception. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2601.6s)]
*  We all that slide of hand. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2603.52s)]
*  Well, there's tricks called self working tricks where you don't need to do any sleight of [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2605.96s)]
*  hand. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2609.2799999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2610.2799999999997s)]
*  You can do it yourselves as long as you follow the instructions like Ikea furniture, like [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2611.44s)]
*  step one, step two, step three, as long as you can work people in a certain way to do [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2614.0400000000004s)]
*  the right thing as versus somebody. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2618.92s)]
*  I'm not doing that. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2620.1600000000003s)]
*  You're like, oh shit, what do I do right now? [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2621.1600000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2622.1600000000003s)]
*  You have to know how to finesse people. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2623.1600000000003s)]
*  You have to influence people effectively. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2624.76s)]
*  And so that same stuff within magic almost always applies to props. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2627.4s)]
*  You need a thing to do the trick. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2632.36s)]
*  Now it could be a regular deck of cards, in which case you're learning slights, but also [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2635.1600000000003s)]
*  there's gimmicks, right? [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2638.0s)]
*  There's tricks you can buy at stores, which when I was a kid, I'm like, oh, teenager, [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2639.52s)]
*  I'm like, get me the next gimmick. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2642.7200000000003s)]
*  But then to get better, you start being able to do stuff impromptu, right? [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2644.48s)]
*  That's when you kind of hit another level where I don't need stuff. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2648.08s)]
*  I can do stuff with anything. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2650.6s)]
*  You know, I could do stuff. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2652.4s)]
*  It's like a good story from my book that I'm writing right now, but it's like where I just [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2653.44s)]
*  needed anything around. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2659.12s)]
*  I was like, I ended up in jail for a weekend. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2660.6s)]
*  It's a long story, but like in jail one weekend, stupid weekend, but I walk in there by myself [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2662.36s)]
*  and I should have been out that day. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2669.28s)]
*  But anyway, I got stuck all weekend and I watched them with cards and it was like I [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2671.1200000000003s)]
*  had trained my whole life for this moment where I walked up record scratch to like 40 [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2674.52s)]
*  dudes and I go, can I see those cards? [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2678.96s)]

*  And I just did card tricks for the next eight hours. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2683.44s)]
*  When I went to take a shower, I'm like, am I thinking of the show Oz? [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2686.7200000000003s)]

*  Drunken idiots. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2705.28s)]
*  I go up to visit a buddy in college and we steal from a Papa John's, don't ask me why, [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2706.28s)]

*  I'm wearing the shirt. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2788.06s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2789.06s)]
*  This is on a Friday night. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2790.06s)]
*  How old are you? [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2792.5s)]
*  I was 20 years old and I was just about to get an internship for Merrill Lynch. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2793.5s)]
*  And while this story is hilarious now, it's like a funny chapter in my book. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2798.4s)]
*  It was like, God help me. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2802.32s)]
*  Did I avoid everything? [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2803.6000000000004s)]
*  And then when I went to jail, yo, scariest one of the scariest days of my life. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2806.02s)]
*  Because it's, it's how did you get out of everything? [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2809.32s)]
*  So I got out of everything because I had a clean record. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2811.48s)]
*  I was pretty upstanding citizen and, you know, not to get in the weeds or something [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2812.88s)]
*  called Holmes Youthful Trainee Act. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2816.82s)]
*  I wonder if they still have it. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2818.1600000000003s)]
*  Or is expunged from my record. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2819.1600000000003s)]
*  Didn't have to report it to like the Wall Street firm. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2820.76s)]
*  And they also said they were charging me. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2823.1400000000003s)]
*  They put us in like a drunk tank, me and two buddies. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2824.36s)]
*  And they said they're charging us with felony larceny. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2826.6800000000003s)]
*  And I'm, I've seen some like law and order. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2829.6400000000003s)]
*  I'm like felony. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2832.2400000000002s)]
*  What is this? [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2833.2400000000002s)]
*  Like, what do we steal? [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2834.2400000000002s)]
*  Like 20 bucks worth of stuff. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2835.2400000000002s)]
*  They go, but you stole things they don't sell. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2836.2400000000002s)]
*  Had you stolen $999 of pizza, it would have been a misdemeanor. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2838.26s)]
*  And I know they're lying to me. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2842.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm not a mentalist then and I'm inebriated, but I can read the room. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2843.36s)]
*  Didn't say a word. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2847.24s)]
*  Knew this was BS. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2848.24s)]
*  And then they separate us when we went to general population. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2849.6s)]
*  And it's not like the movies. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2852.4s)]
*  You know, it's, it's like, it was, it was wild. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2854.2799999999997s)]
*  It was wild when I went in there and I just knew this is my cheat code. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2857.7599999999998s)]
*  It was like everything in life had prepared me for this moment. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2860.84s)]
*  And the jail was also, again, I didn't know this, but it was very segregated. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2864.24s)]
*  Like the white dudes are here. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2867.36s)]
*  The black dudes are here. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2868.7999999999997s)]
*  And I didn't know what, what do you do when you go in? [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2870.24s)]
*  Like, what do you do? [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2872.0s)]
*  I'm five foot nothing. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2873.04s)]
*  I'm like a buck 40 dripping wet. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2874.2s)]
*  What do I do? [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2875.84s)]
*  How do you make friends right now? [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2876.72s)]
*  And I see the black guys playing spades and I just walk up and it's like, [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2878.2s)]
*  you make your move. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2882.16s)]
*  And I'm like, let me see those cards. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2883.08s)]
*  And it was just, it's, it's like a moment I have, and I didn't stop for hours. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2885.2s)]
*  I didn't repeat a trick. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2888.96s)]
*  Like I know tricks encyclopedically. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2889.92s)]
*  I just go all day. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2892.16s)]
*  Wow. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2894.88s)]
*  What an experience. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2896.2s)]
*  It was crazy. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2897.36s)]
*  And then it was all thrown out and it cost me some money. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2898.28s)]
*  It was definitely a very, very stressful few weeks. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2901.24s)]
*  And I never stole anything since, honestly, that was scared straight. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2903.7999999999997s)]
*  That was very, very smart. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2906.6s)]
*  Like I, you prefer to learn a lesson like that for my kids, especially without being [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2907.8799999999997s)]
*  stupid, but so many of us have to be stupid to internalize a lesson of touching [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2912.04s)]
*  the stove. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2916.3999999999996s)]
*  And I had to burn my hands, but [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2916.9199999999996s)]
*  did you always talk this way? [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2918.3999999999996s)]
*  The way you talk, you talk very fast, a lot of energy, just your whole life. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2920.24s)]
*  I think so. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2924.24s)]
*  Even though man, anyone on 1.5 X, the way I listen to podcasts is going to be miserable [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2925.12s)]
*  with me, but yeah, I talk fast. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2929.12s)]
*  Like you're listening to podcasts at that speed. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2931.2s)]
*  You're communicating at that speed. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2933.2799999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2934.68s)]
*  It's like you're on, you know, and you ran 27 fucking miles. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2935.68s)]
*  That's true. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2940.3199999999997s)]
*  No caffeine. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2940.8399999999997s)]
*  So I'm not a caffeine guy. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2941.96s)]
*  You don't drink caffeine at all. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2942.96s)]
*  I try to avoid it. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2944.68s)]
*  I'm not a coffee guy. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2946.04s)]
*  I missed the boat on coffee. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2946.9199999999996s)]
*  I honestly wish I did. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2948.0s)]
*  They probably wouldn't be good for me given how dialed in I am. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2949.6s)]
*  But like I just never started drinking caffeine. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2951.9199999999996s)]
*  So I never got into it. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2954.2799999999997s)]
*  Do you ever mess with any stimulants? [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2955.3199999999997s)]
*  Not really. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2957.52s)]
*  No, not really. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2958.2s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2958.96s)]
*  Like what do you mean by stim? [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2959.56s)]
*  Like I'll have anything. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2960.68s)]
*  If I don't sleep. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2961.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2963.2799999999997s)]
*  And that happens a lot. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2963.7999999999997s)]
*  So if I'm not like getting enough sleep and I've done a red eye and I'm this and that, [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2965.08s)]
*  I will occasionally do like a Celsius or Red Bull, but I don't really like it. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2968.48s)]
*  I do it kind of as medicine because I have to be alive and functioning. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2972.0s)]
*  But I really try to avoid it. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2975.3599999999997s)]
*  Because what is it like when you get hit with a Celsius and you haven't been drinking any caffeine? [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2976.7599999999998s)]
*  So I only drink about a third of it and then I pour it out. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2981.24s)]
*  And my kids are always like, why are you pouring that out? [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2985.7599999999998s)]
*  And they call everything a brusky, which is a weird thing. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2987.8799999999997s)]
*  They call it just because before I always like it was always like a brusky is what they [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2990.0s)]
*  think. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2994.56s)]
*  They've extrapolated to every beverage in a can being a brusky. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2994.76s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2998.0s)]
*  It's hilarious. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2998.76s)]
*  That's funny. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=2999.56s)]
*  And so one third just like must do more than that. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3000.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3003.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3004.48s)]
*  Like if you drink a four loco, I did have booze in it. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3005.0s)]
*  You know, four locos are like, yeah, that's what I'm thinking. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3008.72s)]
*  But it has like caffeine, too. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3012.08s)]
*  That's like bad decisions in a can right there. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3013.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3015.72s)]
*  Like what am I thinking? [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3015.92s)]
*  Oh, a red line. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3016.96s)]
*  Is that the one? [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3018.08s)]
*  No, I think it's four loco. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3018.72s)]
*  It's caffeine mixed with alcohol. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3019.56s)]
*  There's one that's like was just caffeine. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3020.7599999999998s)]
*  It was fucking crazy. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3022.2799999999997s)]
*  That was the stuff to take like pre-workout that was fucking people up. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3023.32s)]
*  Was that a red line? [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3025.88s)]
*  Something like that. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3026.64s)]
*  Oh, there was that one. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3027.48s)]
*  That was the other one. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3028.2s)]
*  That was a Rip Fuel. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3029.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3030.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3031.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3032.84s)]
*  So you've always been like this. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3034.12s)]
*  I gotta ask my wife. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3036.0s)]
*  I think so. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3036.7999999999997s)]
*  Well, I'm more on now because we're doing something. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3038.04s)]
*  But if I go on certain platforms or TV and I know I want to be slow, then I'll just calibrate [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3040.16s)]
*  down, but I'm getting fired up. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3045.56s)]
*  Do you, when you plan out a show, whether it's a corporate show or a television show, [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3047.12s)]
*  do you have like a whiteboard? [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3050.88s)]
*  Do you like put your ideas on? [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3052.1600000000003s)]
*  Like, how do you, how do you do it? [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3053.7200000000003s)]
*  So I take meticulous notes about everything. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3056.76s)]
*  Everyone I meet, everything at the end of a show immediately, as quickly as I can afterwards, [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3059.6800000000003s)]
*  probably some people record shows. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3064.56s)]
*  I hate rewatching myself on corporate shows and like live shows. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3066.2000000000003s)]
*  Sure. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3069.76s)]
*  I don't mind TV stuff, but for some reason, those, if I've repeated material, cause I, [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3070.1600000000003s)]
*  you know, it's like muscle memory. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3073.96s)]
*  You've done this before. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3075.04s)]
*  It irks me to watch again, but I write down everything that happened, every nuance, like [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3076.1600000000003s)]
*  paragraphs about everything that happened, which is a useful like life hack because I [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3080.96s)]
*  remember it all. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3085.28s)]
*  But also I get repeat bookings a lot. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3086.36s)]
*  So if somebody brings me back, now it's like a real magic trick where I know everything [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3088.08s)]
*  about what happened. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3091.52s)]
*  And if you even just recount stuff from two years ago, people think you have superhuman [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3092.36s)]
*  memory or what are they like? [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3098.2400000000002s)]
*  People's number one subjects are themselves, their family and their friends. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3100.0s)]
*  The more you can do that and give them back stuff about them, the more they're like, wow, [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3104.12s)]
*  what a caring individual, right? [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3108.76s)]
*  Being a good listener, a lot of times just repeating back to people what they just said. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3110.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3113.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3114.2400000000002s)]
*  When you do these corporate shows and you do these television shows, when it goes great, [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3116.08s)]
*  do you have this idea in your head like now I've got to ramp it up? [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3123.28s)]
*  Now I've got to push it even further. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3127.4s)]
*  Now I've got to make it even more difficult for me. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3129.48s)]
*  For sure. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3131.4s)]
*  For TV more than corporate, because corporate's not as big of a deal because what does somebody [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3131.88s)]
*  want there? They want a defined quantity, right? [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3137.44s)]
*  They don't want somebody. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3140.08s)]
*  You don't want to work out new material if you're being paid a lot. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3141.08s)]
*  It's just it's a stadium. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3144.56s)]
*  Are you doing new ones? [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3145.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3146.6000000000004s)]
*  Like you're going to do your hour. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3147.96s)]
*  You're going to do what's solid. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3149.32s)]
*  So I do a lot of that. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3150.6400000000003s)]
*  And the problem is I don't really have a lot of places where I can do new material because [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3152.0s)]
*  I'm just so busy. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3156.96s)]
*  So I have so many events that I don't really have like anything that I have. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3157.8s)]
*  Are there like open mics for mentalists where you can go practice? [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3161.4s)]
*  There might have been in the past, but right now it's not it's just not where I'm at. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3164.12s)]
*  So you just practice on friends sometimes. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3167.8s)]
*  Everything's in my head. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3170.1600000000003s)]
*  Everything. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3171.48s)]
*  Yes. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3171.96s)]
*  I a lot of things I'll do on TV I've never done before ever. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3172.32s)]
*  Really? [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3176.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3177.2400000000002s)]
*  So I'm just thinking through everything that could go wrong. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3177.76s)]
*  And I go through kind of like a list of what could go wrong here. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3180.2400000000002s)]
*  What could go wrong here? [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3182.96s)]
*  What if they think this right there? [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3183.7200000000003s)]
*  What if we change this? [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3184.84s)]
*  I have like Plan A, B, C, D, E. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3185.7200000000003s)]
*  I have just a long list of what everything will go like a pick your own adventure. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3187.32s)]
*  And typically I know where to go with it. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3192.5600000000004s)]
*  And then controlling your body and your tension is everything. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3195.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3201.32s)]
*  So you're a hunter. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3201.6800000000003s)]
*  You step on a branch, animal hears it. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3204.0s)]
*  What happens? [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3206.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3207.0800000000004s)]
*  Gone. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3207.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3208.0s)]
*  It's a, it's a, it's a sense that we can feel. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3208.2000000000003s)]
*  We have the same thing. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3209.8s)]
*  We're animals. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3210.4s)]
*  If I get tense when something's going wrong, you can sense it. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3211.1600000000003s)]
*  Even if you don't know it on a conscious level, you can sense it. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3215.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3218.6800000000003s)]
*  And now we have a cascade. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3219.0400000000004s)]
*  So my job is based upon me being someone of the alpha and being in control of the [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3220.6800000000003s)]
*  situation. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3225.2000000000003s)]
*  And so if I think about it, if I just said, think of your pin code, you're like, [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3226.28s)]
*  I don't want to. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3229.5200000000004s)]
*  Right. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3230.44s)]
*  I don't want to, I'm going to do this instead. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3231.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm going to do this instead. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3232.5600000000004s)]
*  Right. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3233.2400000000002s)]
*  How did you acquiesce to my will? [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3233.48s)]
*  You did what I wanted in essence, right? [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3237.2000000000003s)]
*  We could manipulate any way, but at the end of the day, you did what I wanted. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3239.1200000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3241.8s)]
*  And in my show, I'm the one pointing the camera. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3242.0800000000004s)]
*  I'm always the director. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3244.96s)]
*  You don't get to point where you want. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3246.2000000000003s)]
*  I kind of in charge. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3247.32s)]
*  And even if I let you think you're in charge, I'm still in charge at the end of [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3248.52s)]
*  the day. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3251.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3252.1200000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3252.52s)]
*  I come to my kids, I want them to eat veggies. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3252.6400000000003s)]
*  I don't say, you got to eat your veggies. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3255.4s)]
*  They'll say, no. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3256.48s)]
*  I go, you're so lucky right now. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3257.32s)]
*  Carrots, cucumbers, or peppers, which one you're so lucky you get to choose first [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3259.32s)]
*  before your brother or sister. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3263.2000000000003s)]
*  Now I've framed it differently. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3264.1600000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3267.04s)]
*  Anybody with toddlers knows that's the best way to do it. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3267.36s)]
*  Don't go straight on. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3269.44s)]
*  That's not going to work. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3270.6800000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3271.5600000000004s)]
*  So the same thing applies. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3272.12s)]
*  Power dynamics in relationships with people. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3273.36s)]
*  So I got lost in my train of thought. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3276.1600000000003s)]
*  But in essence, if I am messing up and you know it, it's going to go downhill [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3278.32s)]
*  really fast. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3283.6s)]
*  And so on TV, some of my biggest mess ups, you don't know, but I am shitting my [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3284.32s)]
*  pants, flop sweat like fully. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3289.4s)]
*  And I can't let you see that. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3291.6400000000003s)]
*  I need to be so calm because if I am not calm, you can actually, you can actually [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3292.92s)]
*  tell and it's going to keep going worse. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3298.12s)]
*  And I can't get you to go back to what I want. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3299.96s)]
*  And I've lost control of the situation. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3301.4s)]
*  So years and years were spent doing that. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3303.36s)]
*  It's, it's, I would say it's very akin to a sniper. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3305.52s)]
*  I'm not a sniper. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3308.92s)]
*  Don't get me wrong. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3309.8s)]
*  I'm not military, but how do you calm your heart rate? [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3310.2s)]
*  How do you stay calm even when you're not? [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3312.68s)]
*  And I could have an HRM on me. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3314.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm calm when things are going wrong. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3316.32s)]
*  Because that must help. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3319.48s)]
*  The running must help for that. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3320.36s)]
*  I think so. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3321.56s)]
*  Because control your heart rate. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3322.12s)]
*  Low heart rate. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3323.16s)]
*  Just in control of it as well. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3324.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3325.8s)]
*  Like your, your heart muscles very finely tuned. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3326.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3330.96s)]
*  I think it helps. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3331.68s)]
*  I mean, it can't hurt. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3332.36s)]
*  I think it does. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3333.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3333.52s)]
*  My friend, Cam Haynes, who also runs these crazy ultra marathons. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3333.84s)]
*  He's also the best bow hunter in the world. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3338.48s)]
*  And bow hunting is a lot of it is controlling your anxiety at the moment of the shot execution. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3340.2400000000002s)]
*  And I would imagine for him, his heart rate is completely under control all the time [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3345.48s)]
*  because he's always like very low. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3350.44s)]
*  You know, because he does so many miles, like everything, he can stay calm. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3353.4s)]
*  It's probably a really great tool just for staying calm. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3358.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3361.16s)]
*  I think so. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3361.84s)]
*  I mean, the way I describe the ultra marathons, because they're silly. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3362.7599999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3367.0s)]
*  You, he just ran, I love Cam, ran 250 miles. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3367.2799999999997s)]
*  Do you see that thing? [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3370.52s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3371.16s)]
*  That's a crazy thing to do. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3372.7599999999998s)]
*  That's not healthy. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3374.16s)]
*  And I'm a nutcase who can say that. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3375.4s)]
*  And for most people, like, I don't want to do that. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3377.2s)]
*  And you don't need to. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3378.92s)]
*  But what is that? [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3379.96s)]
*  What is that really? [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3381.04s)]
*  When you do that, everything else in life becomes easier. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3382.32s)]
*  The lows that you experience when you do something like that is a way you cannot [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3386.72s)]
*  fake in any other way. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3392.6s)]
*  You cannot test who you really are. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3394.2s)]
*  Then putting yourself, you could be on the couch saying, what would I do and be [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3397.04s)]
*  tough guy and you're pretending to be Goggins or Haynes. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3399.76s)]
*  But until you get in that level where you're miserable, you haven't slept in a [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3401.84s)]
*  day, you have all that, there might be another way to push yourself, but that's [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3404.96s)]
*  where you learn who am I really at my core. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3407.88s)]
*  And then when you go back to normal life, everything else, the volume is turned [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3410.4s)]
*  down. And when I come back from those races, all I do is get a mirror to put up [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3413.56s)]
*  to see who am I really when things are at their lowest and when I want to quit and [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3417.72s)]
*  I don't. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3422.2s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's that's a very strong statement. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3425.28s)]
*  I think one of the things that you just said there, I've said a bunch of times [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3428.12s)]
*  that if you can work out really hard and push your body and push your mind, it [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3430.64s)]
*  makes other forms of adversity that you face during the day much easier. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3435.72s)]
*  And I think that's one of the reasons why so many people are so filled with [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3440.64s)]
*  anxiety. It seems like that's such a simple solution that most people don't [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3443.12s)]
*  want to accept it like, oh, there's more to that. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3447.0s)]
*  There's a mental imbalance. There's a this, there's that like perhaps. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3448.88s)]
*  But everybody that I know that does what I'm talking about, everybody I know that [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3453.4s)]
*  pushes themselves very hard in the gym or running or doing yoga or whatever, [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3457.3599999999997s)]
*  they're the most happy and the most relaxed. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3463.04s)]
*  And they're able to face adversity throughout the day much easier than people [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3465.56s)]
*  that don't take care of their body, that don't eat well, that don't exercise and [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3469.96s)]
*  don't experience any voluntary physical discomfort. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3473.76s)]
*  Couldn't agree more. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3477.7200000000003s)]
*  It's just I think it's it's I think it's mandatory, you know, and it doesn't have [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3478.7200000000003s)]
*  to be what I do or it doesn't have to be what you do. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3483.44s)]
*  It's go find do pickleball. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3485.88s)]
*  OK, go play some other sport tennis, do something that's fun. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3487.8s)]
*  Jiu Jitsu is a great one. Yeah, fun to do. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3493.0800000000004s)]
*  And then you learn how to do something while you're working out. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3496.0s)]
*  Muay Thai is another one like that. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3498.84s)]
*  You know, there's a lot of stuff that you can do that's fun, that's exercise. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3500.6000000000004s)]
*  But man, you should exercise. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3504.04s)]
*  You know, you got to move your body. You got to move your. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3506.5600000000004s)]
*  Again, I don't want to speak out of turn like medical, but they've shown over and [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3508.6400000000003s)]
*  over that exercise is just it's almost as effective in certain regards and like [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3511.6400000000003s)]
*  like just being a certain level of healthiness than antidepressants. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3516.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, more effective. It's unbelievable. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3520.2400000000002s)]
*  Statistically, clinically more effective, more effective. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3522.32s)]
*  Yeah, because it's of course it is. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3525.1600000000003s)]
*  Of course it is. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3527.96s)]
*  Like this is the reason why people are so filled with anxieties, [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3528.6800000000003s)]
*  because your body has certain physical requirements. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3532.1200000000003s)]
*  Right. Your body was designed to fight off predators and to run away from enemies [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3534.44s)]
*  and to hunt and gather food. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3539.36s)]
*  That's the same DNA as people that live tens of thousands of years ago. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3541.2400000000002s)]
*  Courses through your body. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3545.2000000000003s)]
*  That's the fabric of your body. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3546.52s)]
*  That's you. Right. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3548.56s)]
*  You can't deny that. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3549.6800000000003s)]
*  And there's a reason why this this sedentary [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3551.32s)]
*  sort of generation that we're experiencing right now because of phones [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3555.68s)]
*  and tablets and all the sitting in front of screens all the time. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3558.84s)]
*  It's the most depressed. Right. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3562.48s)]
*  No, for sure. Anxious, too. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3564.12s)]
*  I mean, Jonathan Haydon, like it's it's yeah, it's it's wild. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3565.64s)]
*  The correlation and it's just so clear cut. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3569.6s)]
*  But yes, social media is very it's it's it's one of those things. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3571.68s)]
*  There's some benefits. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3574.96s)]
*  But man, oh, man, you can't put that genie back in the bottle. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3576.48s)]
*  You got to find the right way to do it. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3578.52s)]
*  There's some benefits in that there's a lot of inspiration. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3579.84s)]
*  I agree, you know, and also information. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3582.68s)]
*  You know, I'm not completely off of social media. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3586.7599999999998s)]
*  I tap in, but I've radically reduced it over the last month or so. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3589.3199999999997s)]
*  And in doing that, it's really been much, much nicer. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3594.72s)]
*  Like life is way easier. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3599.04s)]
*  But occasionally I'll find something really interesting on social media. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3600.8399999999997s)]
*  So it's like, boy, I don't want to not know that. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3603.96s)]
*  I don't want to not like find out about some new scientific breakthrough [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3607.08s)]
*  or some new thing that's going on. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3610.2799999999997s)]
*  One of the things that I've found that helps me, though, [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3612.3599999999997s)]
*  instead of social media, I just I just have a bunch of stuff [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3615.7999999999997s)]
*  that I curate in my Google News app. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3619.04s)]
*  And so I'll just like find like any sort of scientific breakthrough [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3621.88s)]
*  or some weird discovery or a lot of really interesting things [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3625.3599999999997s)]
*  about ancient civilizations. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3629.72s)]
*  I just have that stuff curate. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3631.04s)]
*  So it just shows up on my feed. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3632.24s)]
*  Where do you get that on your phone? [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3634.24s)]
*  Yeah, it's just the Google News app, which great, because it's like that way. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3635.68s)]
*  I can find stuff out without having to go and just hopefully [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3639.52s)]
*  randomly run into it on X or on Instagram. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3644.4s)]
*  Right. You know, that's how that helps a lot. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3647.44s)]
*  Terrible with X. A lot of my friends get news on X. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3649.8s)]
*  I'm just like, it's too much. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3652.08s)]
*  It's a lot of negativity. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3653.76s)]
*  And for Instagram, for years, I started realizing that it just [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3655.4s)]
*  like a compare and despair is one of that, you know, that like where [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3659.64s)]
*  I'm like, why am I getting off of this and feeling worse than I did getting on it? [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3663.6s)]
*  And so I really had to flip a switch in my brain to to to I got rid of that. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3668.16s)]
*  Anything that I don't like, I don't show. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3673.48s)]
*  And I stopped focusing on what I don't have and what I focus on, what I do have. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3675.24s)]
*  And so so did you like used to go to it and you see someone with a giant house [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3680.12s)]
*  and a Lamborghini or something like that, was it material possession? [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3684.68s)]
*  It wasn't material. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3687.2s)]
*  It was I need to use. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3688.6s)]
*  I don't look at people and hope poorly upon them. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3689.8399999999997s)]
*  I look more at it and say, I'm not doing enough. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3693.04s)]
*  So it's like an inferior. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3695.7999999999997s)]
*  You're always going to be lesser than right. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3697.2s)]
*  You're going to be someone's going to be younger, richer, smarter, like every. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3698.7599999999998s)]
*  But in my case, it was more of I wanted to achieve a level of success [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3702.64s)]
*  and just seeing other people in my field or other fields. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3706.44s)]
*  And I felt like I'm not doing enough. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3708.6s)]
*  I'm somewhat driven, ambitious. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3710.3999999999996s)]
*  So I'm like, I'm just not doing enough right now. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3712.6s)]
*  And it's that constant feeling of I'm not doing enough doesn't drive you. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3714.96s)]
*  It would be better to see. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3718.3199999999997s)]
*  Look at them. I'm so happy for them. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3719.3599999999997s)]
*  I'm going to do that, too. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3721.68s)]
*  Like I it should be a positive uplifting thing. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3722.64s)]
*  And it's a flip in your brain. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3725.2s)]
*  It's like multiplying negative one times negative one [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3726.4s)]
*  and much more of a inflection point of gratitude. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3729.0s)]
*  Like I do know Jay Shetty. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3732.12s)]
*  Jay, I don't know, podcaster, really good dude. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3736.0s)]
*  I definitely heard him last year. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3739.84s)]
*  And he told me something very stuck with me for the last year, [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3741.36s)]
*  which is a million thoughts a day. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3744.48s)]
*  We're on social media. We're all this that he was the only two thoughts. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3746.1600000000003s)]
*  You can't control them all. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3749.12s)]
*  But try to control two thoughts each day. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3750.28s)]
*  The first one when you wake up and the last one you go to sleep. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3752.6s)]
*  It's that easy. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3755.2s)]
*  Those two just try to have the first thing you wake up be one. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3756.2799999999997s)]
*  And before you go to bed, just have one last thought. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3759.68s)]
*  And they're always for me, it's like, you know, I'm every day alive is a blessing. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3762.4399999999996s)]
*  Like I literally I believe that in my core. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3766.3999999999996s)]
*  I don't know what's going to happen tomorrow. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3769.2s)]
*  Like a parent in my school just passed away recently. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3770.56s)]
*  Shattered like young kids, cancer. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3773.72s)]
*  I've known a few people and you see that and you're like, no, that's for real, though. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3776.52s)]
*  You don't know what will happen tomorrow. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3780.04s)]
*  So I've hit the lottery like I'm blessed beyond measure. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3782.12s)]
*  Wife way out of my league. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3785.6s)]
*  Smart, gorgeous, sharp as a whip. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3787.04s)]
*  Five beautiful kids like I try to focus on everything I have [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3789.2s)]
*  and never on what I don't have. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3793.3199999999997s)]
*  I get to do what I love for a living. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3794.6s)]
*  Like my mindset is completely evolved. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3796.08s)]
*  Why would I think of what people don't? [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3797.7599999999998s)]
*  And everybody, if you're alive, you should be happy. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3799.16s)]
*  You do not know what tomorrow will be. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3802.04s)]
*  And I know that's all like new agey, whatever. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3803.6s)]
*  But that's you don't know when your your clock's up. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3805.7999999999997s)]
*  We were just talking about that in the green room last night at the comedy club [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3808.6s)]
*  about the problem with gratitude is that too many people have co-opted it. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3811.52s)]
*  Right. And really annoying people. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3816.16s)]
*  Annoying. Annoying like wooden beads types, you know, attitude. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3818.04s)]
*  But gratitude is really important. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3822.04s)]
*  But no, it's actually what you think because your thoughts create a lot of your reality. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3823.88s)]
*  The same way I said looking around the room. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3827.8s)]
*  So if your mindset starts to become one more of rather than you see someone, [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3829.84s)]
*  you're like, screw that guy. He's rich. Right. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3833.8s)]
*  That's how the mindset that's easy for you to say they're rich. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3835.84s)]
*  You see that in comments all the time. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3838.0s)]
*  I'm like, I think that person worked their butt off to get to where they are. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3839.7200000000003s)]
*  And what did they do? And you know what? That's inspirational to me. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3843.44s)]
*  What can I learn from that? [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3845.92s)]
*  And so that's just a mindset of I don't see it as a zero sum game. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3847.12s)]
*  Well, it's one thing that those people, the post, things like that have in common. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3850.84s)]
*  When you go to their page, they're all very boring. Right. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3854.28s)]
*  It's really interesting. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3857.2400000000002s)]
*  You see like the expression of their dull mind that's like, fuck them. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3858.4s)]
*  They got money. Right. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3862.32s)]
*  I don't have money. They got money. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3864.52s)]
*  It's a dull brain. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3866.52s)]
*  And I always wonder, like, what is it like to be that person? [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3867.48s)]
*  Is that person is that a biological hitch or is it just learned behavior? [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3870.32s)]
*  Like, what is it that makes them that stupid? [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3875.56s)]
*  I don't know if it's stupid. I don't know if I judge, but I think you project your insecurities. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3877.6s)]
*  It's a little bit of that, but it's a it's clearly a stupid way to think. Right. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3881.48s)]
*  You know, it's totally not empowering. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3885.48s)]
*  Like to complain about someone else's success or be angry about someone else's [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3888.16s)]
*  else's success is not empowering in any way, shape or form. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3892.92s)]
*  And so that's inherently stupid. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3896.36s)]
*  But you find the excuses because you're like, if I had that, if I had that. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3898.7200000000003s)]
*  And rather than most be nice. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3902.2400000000002s)]
*  Well, exactly. Must be nice. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3903.92s)]
*  Rather than saying, how do I do this for myself? [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3905.28s)]
*  Exactly. It's much easier, especially if you've given up on certain things. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3908.56s)]
*  Yeah. Now, once you've given up, it's better to make excuses [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3911.76s)]
*  and bring someone else down to try to bring you up. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3914.7200000000003s)]
*  Well, here's what's dumb about it. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3917.28s)]
*  And this is why I said it's stupid. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3918.92s)]
*  It doesn't get any better when you think like that. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3920.84s)]
*  Instead, if you can shift your focus and see someone doing something, [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3924.4s)]
*  recognize that these tinges of jealousy that you feel are completely natural. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3929.48s)]
*  But realize that to get the most out of this, [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3935.2400000000002s)]
*  you have to switch that in your mind to inspiration. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3939.6000000000004s)]
*  And that person's success that's kind of freaking you out now becomes fuel. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3943.4s)]
*  Right now becomes fuel and you can motivate yourself. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3947.8s)]
*  But you have to avoid the fuck that guy and look this book that [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3950.04s)]
*  that doesn't help you at all. That does zero good for you. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3954.68s)]
*  And in fact, it occupies all of your precious time with complaining [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3957.88s)]
*  when instead, if you can manage it and it can be managed, [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3962.6s)]
*  you can turn that into inspiration and then go out and try to do something. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3966.88s)]
*  Either focus more on what you're doing. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3971.32s)]
*  Realize maybe I'm doing this [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3973.96s)]
*  where it's not as efficient or maybe I can have more energy. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3976.88s)]
*  Maybe I just need to do it more. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3979.92s)]
*  Maybe I need to be a little bit more disciplined in my approach, whatever it is. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3981.76s)]
*  But those little shifts will have measurable changes in the outcomes. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3984.76s)]
*  Huge, huge changes major down the line, especially the big one. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3990.2000000000003s)]
*  Change jealousy to inspiration. Love that. You have to be able to do it. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3995.0s)]
*  Right. It's a giant key. You know, I remember when I was 21 years old, [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=3999.8s)]
*  there was a guy who was going on stage and I was hoping that he bombed. Right. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4005.16s)]
*  I remember thinking that I was hoping that he bombed. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4009.3599999999997s)]
*  And the reason I realized it, [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4011.48s)]
*  I was realizing that I was recognized and that he was talented [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4014.6s)]
*  and that he was really funny. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4019.4399999999996s)]
*  And it bothered me that maybe I wasn't as talented as him or I wasn't as funny as him. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4020.7599999999998s)]
*  So instead of like seeing him go, what is he doing? Like, wow, this is great. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4026.2s)]
*  Instead, now all of a sudden I was hoping that he failed. Right. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4030.7999999999997s)]
*  And then I realized, like, oh, here's the problem. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4035.24s)]
*  First of all, that's just like general bitch thinking that like can enter into your head. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4038.56s)]
*  And you got to figure out how to stop that. Yep. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4043.0s)]
*  But I also realize that I was getting to this weird, precarious position, [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4045.0s)]
*  which happens to a lot of artists where you get into something, [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4050.36s)]
*  whether it's music or standup comedy, because you love it as a fan. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4053.88s)]
*  You love watching it. Like, I loved comedy. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4057.96s)]
*  But then I when I became a comedian, I stopped loving comedy. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4061.28s)]
*  Now I was comparing everyone to myself. Right. That's brutal. Right. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4065.92s)]
*  Yeah. And it's not good for you. And I was like, no, no, no. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4070.44s)]
*  You got to go back to laughing at stuff that's good and not connecting it to you at all. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4072.84s)]
*  It has nothing to do with you. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4077.92s)]
*  So when someone's really good, that should be great. Right. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4079.4s)]
*  And then you should be laughing even if you don't like that person. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4082.0800000000004s)]
*  You should be laughing. Right. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4085.32s)]
*  Just even if you hate someone and they're funny, you should be laughing because it's good for you. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4087.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. And it's I find that it's over time. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4092.6000000000004s)]
*  It's it's it's almost it's selfish, but it's selfless at the same time is I like to show love to people [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4095.04s)]
*  coming up as much as possible and try to highlight them and try to kind of pay it forward in a way. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4100.6s)]
*  Yeah. That's for the new people that are kind of doing what I do or doing different things. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4106.04s)]
*  It makes you feel good. It makes you feel good. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4109.12s)]
*  Right. It's selfish to help people. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4111.12s)]
*  It is. Yeah. I say that, too. Yeah. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4113.400000000001s)]
*  It's very funny. We think that same. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4115.52s)]
*  Yeah, I think exactly the same way. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4117.56s)]
*  It's kind of selfish, but it's also it's that's what community is supposed to be about. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4119.68s)]
*  It's supposed to be not just about you. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4124.48s)]
*  And that's a different stream of community and a cult. Right. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4126.44s)]
*  Cult is like then you have the cult leader. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4130.44s)]
*  He starts banging everybody's wife and he wants everybody's money. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4132.5199999999995s)]
*  There's always an inflection point where you're starting to bang wives. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4134.799999999999s)]
*  That's always where is that in the cult? Always. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4137.48s)]
*  There's always a message from God. Right. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4139.839999999999s)]
*  That tells you you need more pussy. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4141.839999999999s)]
*  You're like those two right there. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4143.4s)]
*  I don't know why he didn't. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4145.48s)]
*  I didn't say it. I didn't say it for the record. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4147.44s)]
*  Yeah. He said it. God said it. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4150.16s)]
*  And then always the part else is there's always some sort of a end point, [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4151.72s)]
*  like the world's going to end, but it didn't because we prayed so hard. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4155.4400000000005s)]
*  So we're back, baby. Yeah. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4158.88s)]
*  Yeah, those guys are great. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4161.2s)]
*  There was a billboard in Los Angeles a while back that had the date of the end of the world. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4162.4800000000005s)]
*  Right. And you drive by and I was like, I can't wait to show up here [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4168.08s)]
*  and take a selfie in front of it the day after this fucking stupid date. Right. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4171.72s)]
*  Because those guys are never right. Never right. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4177.04s)]
*  That's weird. They're the worst mentalists. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4180.280000000001s)]
*  You know, the cult leaders. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4182.96s)]
*  Yeah. Cult leaders, they just never see the writing on the wall. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4184.92s)]
*  The cult leader has like a very unique where, again, there's there's a fine line [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4188.4400000000005s)]
*  between if you looked at a path in my life again, I don't see myself cult leader. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4192.76s)]
*  But a con man is very similar in many regards to what I do, [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4196.360000000001s)]
*  because that's using these skills in what I would describe as like an unethical way. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4199.6s)]
*  Right. Don't you think they're the same thing? [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4205.04s)]
*  The cult leader is a type of con man. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4206.6s)]
*  Oh, I was saying what I do is like a con man. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4208.24s)]
*  Yeah, but you are a con man for entertainment purposes. Right. Exactly. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4210.599999999999s)]
*  It's different. Right. You're you have an understanding of the human mind. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4214.16s)]
*  But instead of using it in a you do it for entertainment, [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4218.0s)]
*  which is like a good way to use it for sure. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4221.92s)]
*  Everybody gets happiness. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4223.8s)]
*  It's happiness. And you're not lying about the premise, [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4225.0s)]
*  which is the premise is I'm starting from the jump. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4227.84s)]
*  I'm not psychic. I'm not supernatural. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4229.8s)]
*  People ask me, is this like a talent or is it a gift? [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4231.84s)]
*  And I think it's similar. Well, yeah. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4234.36s)]
*  I mean, you've got to have some sort of thing in you [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4236.2s)]
*  to be a good comedian or a good musician or anything like that. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4238.72s)]
*  You can work on it and get better. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4240.92s)]
*  But I'm never going to the NBA. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4242.48s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? That's right. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4244.4s)]
*  You have to have some attributes. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4245.599999999999s)]
*  Right. There's like a personality trait that just is embedded in you [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4247.0s)]
*  from the time you're young for whatever the thing is that you love to do. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4250.76s)]
*  Maybe it was like watching my folks. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4254.5599999999995s)]
*  Maybe there was a lot of weird stuff. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4256.44s)]
*  I was very good at math as a kid, like unusually good at math. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4257.96s)]
*  And I would do weird stuff like I count steps every time. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4261.5599999999995s)]
*  I knew every step in every place I went to, like some rain man rain man stuff. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4265.08s)]
*  And when I would go, this is from the time I was like six. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4268.5199999999995s)]
*  We go to Little Caesars. I'll never forget. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4270.96s)]
*  I lived in Metro Detroit. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4272.5599999999995s)]
*  And before they rang up the food, I knew the percentage tax it would be. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4273.96s)]
*  So when they did it, I would instantly say before I'd look [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4278.6s)]
*  and I know what my mom is going to tell me, you're going to get $16.18. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4281.68s)]
*  How did you know that and change? [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4284.6s)]
*  And it was like a weird, [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4286.36s)]
*  that was crazy. It was like a weird thing that I got very good at. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4288.12s)]
*  And I think the boom dopamine hit dopamine hit. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4291.12s)]
*  They would like that. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4293.72s)]
*  And so it's ingrained where I was good at. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4295.0s)]
*  Again, people become the joker because there's some sort of dark thing [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4298.4400000000005s)]
*  and they're not everybody, but typically there's some I want to say trauma. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4302.12s)]
*  But you're not going to be funny or amazing unless something happened [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4306.280000000001s)]
*  in your life where you have a reason to be entertaining. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4308.64s)]
*  And so I think there's points in time where I could take people's minds off things. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4312.0s)]
*  And this was a great way to do it. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4315.72s)]
*  And also magic. People don't get to know you. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4317.280000000001s)]
*  They get to know the character, the performer. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4320.88s)]
*  So you get that nice little separation, which I learned at a young age [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4323.08s)]
*  was really like how to make rejection fear of rejection, fear of failure. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4326.4s)]
*  Most people, that's their number one fear. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4330.64s)]
*  And I learned at 14 how to make that gone, like eliminate that entirely. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4332.92s)]
*  Interesting. That's interesting. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4336.44s)]
*  It's also the dynamic of you being in control, which I think, [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4338.68s)]
*  you know, you talked about earlier, I think is for whatever reason [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4342.36s)]
*  imperative when you're speaking to people. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4346.72s)]
*  You have to be in control for them to let you kind of guide everything. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4349.2s)]
*  You don't want other people. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4354.12s)]
*  You don't want to ask questions and you have everybody like free to talk and. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4355.639999999999s)]
*  No, I don't mind that. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4359.8s)]
*  No, I don't mind that. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4361.36s)]
*  But if they do it when I want them to, right. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4362.0s)]
*  It's like, again, so the best salespeople in the world [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4364.599999999999s)]
*  aren't the used car sales like buy this, buy this. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4368.24s)]
*  That's nobody does well. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4370.28s)]

*  That's what you do. You lay the breadcrumbs into the trap. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4393.12s)]
*  The trap is not a bad thing. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4395.96s)]
*  But the same thing happens in my show. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4397.4s)]
*  I am leading you in a certain direction. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4399.24s)]

*  How often is Jamie? [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4403.679999999999s)]
*  Jamie, when I walked in, I talked to him for like two minutes, said he loves magic. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4404.719999999999s)]
*  He does. Is that true? [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4408.919999999999s)]
*  Is Jamie off, Mike? Yeah, what's up? [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4410.5199999999995s)]
*  He didn't know I was going to do this. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4413.719999999999s)]
*  You have daughters, correct? Yes. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4415.799999999999s)]
*  So it's hard. I have I have I have three girls, two boys. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4418.879999999999s)]
*  And I found when I named our girls, well, we named it together, obviously. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4422.839999999999s)]
*  The naming of the girls was far harder than the boys. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4427.0s)]
*  When you named your daughters, was it agreed upon? [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4429.28s)]
*  Were you like shortlisted? How did it go about? [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4433.08s)]
*  Well, I feel like my wife did way more work than I did. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4436.12s)]
*  For sure. So she carries the baby in her body. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4441.28s)]
*  And I said, listen, I would just want veto power. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4444.24s)]
*  Veto. Where you can't name the kid applesauce or something fucking stupid. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4447.639999999999s)]
*  But she didn't. I go, I don't think it's a fair proposition. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4451.04s)]
*  That's like literally what I said. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4455.44s)]
*  I said, and I don't give a fuck about names. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4457.0s)]
*  And they've got your name for last night, which is not fair. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4459.08s)]
*  But yeah, right. It's right. Yeah. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4461.28s)]
*  And so does she. But my name is Joe. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4463.04s)]
*  It's a boring, stupid name. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4465.36s)]
*  It doesn't bother me at all that I have the same name as a billion people. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4466.88s)]
*  Right. So for me, names don't mean anything. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4470.28s)]
*  And it meant something for her. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4472.76s)]
*  So I said, you decide. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4474.28s)]
*  So watch this. What are the do you know what the most common names are right now? [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4476.16s)]
*  I know this recently, like a two week old. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4479.84s)]
*  But the most common names right now are not the same as when you were naming [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4482.72s)]
*  your daughters is my guess if they're teenagers. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4486.0s)]
*  What do you know what the most common name right now in America? [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4487.84s)]
*  I think it's six years running. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4490.32s)]
*  Mom, this up. No, no, for girls, [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4491.56s)]
*  for girls is it no Olivia. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4494.400000000001s)]
*  Check it, Jamie. Can you look up top 10? [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4497.04s)]
*  It's a beautiful name. Look up. It just came out. Social Security. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4499.160000000001s)]
*  I know this because, like I said, we were trying to figure out names. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4501.4400000000005s)]
*  Is am I right? It should be Olivia's number one. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4504.320000000001s)]
*  I don't Google top 10. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4508.360000000001s)]
*  Who do you think of when you think of Olivia? [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4509.68s)]
*  Mm hmm. I thought initially of Olivia Wilde. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4511.72s)]
*  Who's Olivia Wilde? Movie star. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4515.76s)]
*  Do you know she is? Oh, that lady. Yeah. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4518.56s)]
*  Oh, she's great. Yeah. I thought of Olivia Newton, John. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4521.84s)]
*  Yeah, that's second. So I would have been second. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4523.96s)]
*  Physical. I performed for a little while. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4526.320000000001s)]
*  Never Olivia Newton, John. What did you get? Did you find out? [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4528.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you want me to show you the list? Oh, yeah. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4530.6s)]
*  It's not a trick. I just want to see Olivia's number one. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4532.120000000001s)]
*  Emma, Emilia, Charlotte, Mia, Sophia, Isabelle, Evelyn. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4535.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's interesting. Eight. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4541.280000000001s)]
*  I would have never imagined that. Right. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4542.8s)]
*  Ava. You did not hear those names when you were growing up. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4544.24s)]
*  There were probably no girls named Ava when you were a child. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4547.639999999999s)]
*  None of any of these names. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4550.24s)]
*  Maybe Olivia after Olivia Newton, John. But that's crazy. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4551.599999999999s)]
*  Sophia's number 10. That's interesting. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4555.12s)]
*  And Sophia spelled two different ways. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4557.36s)]
*  So it's technically number one. Jamie. Oh, really? [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4558.84s)]
*  If I ask you, OK. Oh, that's right. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4561.12s)]
*  It is a stealth P H and F. Wow. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4564.08s)]
*  Interesting that Sophia is number one, really. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4567.4s)]
*  Huh? Harper. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4570.72s)]
*  What's Harper? 1112 Camilla. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4572.56s)]
*  Camilla number 11. That's nuts. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4575.76s)]
*  Eleanor. Older names are coming back. Yep. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4578.36s)]
*  Really older names. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4581.8s)]
*  Yeah, that's like Eleanor is like my friend Eleanor Kerrigan. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4583.2s)]
*  She's in her 50s. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4586.96s)]
*  Eliana. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4591.88s)]
*  Eliana's number 18. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4593.72s)]
*  That's crazy. What are the odds? Right. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4595.16s)]
*  What are the odds that you told me is Illyana in the top 20 of names? [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4598.44s)]
*  Shut the fuck up. Who names her kid that? [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4602.96s)]
*  I think someone someone I know. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4604.76s)]
*  No, it's a beautiful name. Love that name. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4607.6s)]
*  It's a beautiful. It's not a bad name. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4609.48s)]
*  It's a beautiful name. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4611.08s)]
*  But it's like it's like I would have never thought it was that common. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4611.76s)]
*  So when you think of how this is happening, watch this. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4614.8s)]
*  Jamie, I ask you to come up with somebody absolutely random from your past. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4618.28s)]
*  Absolutely random. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4623.08s)]
*  I dug deep. OK, you already got it. Yeah. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4624.92s)]
*  You know what? [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4627.4s)]
*  How do you know this person? [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4631.2s)]
*  Not all you shouldn't have said that. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4632.32s)]
*  Oh, should have said a word, you know, right away. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4634.16s)]
*  What did you say from preschool preschool? [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4635.92s)]
*  Something in preschool. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4637.719999999999s)]
*  You still keep in touch. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4639.04s)]
*  Right, madam. No. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4639.92s)]
*  She said to him, why do you say him? [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4641.12s)]
*  And then I'm sorry, I met them is what I guess I was trying to say. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4642.44s)]
*  This guy's playing a pronoun game. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4644.88s)]
*  What's going on here? You know what? [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4646.16s)]
*  No, no, there's too many giveaways. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4647.96s)]
*  Just said wasn't on the list, doesn't this? [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4649.5599999999995s)]
*  Let me ask you a question. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4651.2s)]
*  Let's try again. No, no, I'm do something better. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4652.4s)]
*  We'll switch. This is a glitch in the matrix. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4654.04s)]
*  Do you do, Jamie, close your eyes? [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4656.44s)]
*  Close your eyes. You got to look. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4660.04s)]
*  OK, so pretend you're closing your eyes. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4662.2s)]
*  I'm going to put you on the spot. OK. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4663.84s)]
*  It's not the preschool girl. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4666.08s)]
*  I want you to close your eyes, go back in time and try to picture the face. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4667.76s)]
*  I always call the one that got your first big crush. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4671.76s)]
*  Can you visualize her face or you can't see her clearly? [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4675.5599999999995s)]
*  I guess you asked me this before. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4681.24s)]
*  It's like a it's a tough question, because the way you started [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4682.88s)]
*  wording, it was like, is this the first crush for me? [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4685.8s)]
*  It was like the first person like I knew there was like TV people and stuff like that. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4688.8s)]
*  Oh, is it a TV person? [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4692.92s)]
*  That's what it would have been, technically, I guess. Yeah. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4693.96s)]
*  Your first crush was a TV person. Sure. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4696.4800000000005s)]
*  Yes. Someone I saw on TV. Is that right? [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4698.52s)]
*  I think so. OK. I guess. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4700.64s)]
*  Well, I don't know. Is that I don't know. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4703.16s)]
*  If I were to ask you to look up how popular this name is. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4705.2s)]
*  Well, I know I'm not going to do it again. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4707.52s)]
*  It's not top 10. Is that correct? Right. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4709.4800000000005s)]
*  It was. OK, hold on. Look this way at me. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4711.08s)]
*  I want you without using your fingers [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=4713.28s)]

*  Now, wherever you want. Take it. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5027.5599999999995s)]
*  Grab it and look at that person's name. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5028.5199999999995s)]
*  Okay. And don't let me see it. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5030.28s)]
*  How likely if you were to text this person, [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5031.88s)]
*  do you think would they answer? [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5034.84s)]
*  100%. Oh, you sure? [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5036.52s)]
*  Yeah. 100%. Most of the list was a guy. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5037.88s)]
*  Guys, is it a guy? Yeah. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5040.92s)]
*  Okay. Not judging. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5042.28s)]
*  A lot of dudes on the show. Put them all back together. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5043.08s)]
*  Okay. Let's assess this. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5045.400000000001s)]
*  I don't want to know who it is. I don't care who it is. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5047.08s)]
*  As long as I want to see if they're not going to answer, [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5048.76s)]
*  I would tell you to text somebody new. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5051.0s)]
*  Text this person in your own words and say, I don't know, [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5052.84s)]
*  got a minute, need a favor and see if he texts back. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5057.8s)]
*  If he doesn't, we go to somebody new. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5060.44s)]
*  We'll give it like, I don't know, 15, 20 minutes. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5062.12s)]
*  Okay. Can I tell him what's going on? [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5063.96s)]
*  I would hedge and not say yet because I want to see where he goes with it. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5067.24s)]
*  Because if you tell him, like, I don't care, but I want to keep this very, [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5072.12s)]
*  I don't want him to know where we're going yet. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5077.639999999999s)]
*  Okay. Should I tell him to text me back? [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5079.5599999999995s)]
*  Right. Yeah. I guess text me back. That works. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5082.5199999999995s)]
*  Hey, brother, do me a favor and text me back as soon as you get this. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5085.719999999999s)]
*  It's going to sound like someone's dying, but okay. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5089.4800000000005s)]
*  The world depends on it. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5091.08s)]
*  Okay. All right. And put it down. We'll revisit later. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5094.200000000001s)]
*  Pressures. Let's see. Let's check back in a few minutes. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5101.400000000001s)]
*  Okay. Will it vibrate if he did? [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5104.200000000001s)]
*  No, I have it on do not disturb, but I'll take it off. There we go. Okay. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5106.280000000001s)]
*  He's very busy, so he might not be in front of his phone. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5113.88s)]
*  No worries. If it doesn't go, we'll give it some time. And if not, we'll switch gears. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5116.6s)]
*  Okay. But turn your phone face down so you don't think I can see it. I don't want to know who, [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5121.160000000001s)]
*  what, where. All righty. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5124.68s)]
*  We'll revisit. We'll come back. Put it on my lap so I feel it when it vibrates. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5126.04s)]
*  Oh, I'll help you later. I'm holding it in though. I knew the Joe Rogan effect. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5129.72s)]
*  Okay. We're just going to sit here and wait for him to text me? [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5137.8s)]
*  No, no, no. We'll check back in later. That seems ridiculous. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5140.92s)]
*  Is it? Yeah, because he could be working out. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5143.0s)]
*  We're not doing anything. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5144.84s)]
*  So if we get it, it's meant to be. We'll see. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5146.12s)]
*  Okay. It's not pressing. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5148.84s)]
*  You have an idea who it is? [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5150.28s)]
*  I don't know. I can look through the list again. It's not Cam Haynes, is it? [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5151.96s)]
*  Is someone popping into your head? [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5155.32s)]
*  I'm not going to guess who it is. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5157.4800000000005s)]
*  Not at all? [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5158.6s)]
*  No, because here's the reason why. If we reveal stuff, I don't want you to. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5159.16s)]
*  If I guess something very specific about this person that will, [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5163.16s)]
*  he might not want everyone to know his ATM, PIN code, or social security number. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5167.4800000000005s)]
*  Oh, you're going to guess his too? [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5170.6s)]
*  I don't know what I'm going to do yet, but I don't want you could tip it, [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5171.48s)]
*  but he's going to be pretty pissed if everybody finds out something. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5174.36s)]
*  So I prefer if nobody knows yet, but if we want to, you'll see. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5176.839999999999s)]
*  Okay. Okay. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5182.44s)]
*  Take it to the next level. Jamie's in the room. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5184.12s)]
*  Right. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5186.36s)]
*  But what if we just get anyone who you could have picked, anybody you know? [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5187.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5190.44s)]
*  Now it's different. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5190.759999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5191.799999999999s)]
*  Now it's never been done before. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5192.2s)]
*  Right. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5193.5599999999995s)]
*  You asked me, what do I wake up with thinking about? How could I do this? [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5193.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah. How are you going to do this? [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5197.16s)]
*  I don't know. Let's see if it works. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5198.759999999999s)]
*  Let's see if it works. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5199.959999999999s)]
*  So, okay. Oh, you got me. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5201.959999999999s)]
*  He did? [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5204.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5205.0s)]
*  Okay. Here's the thing. I think that if I were you, I'd say later, well, texting, [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5205.5599999999995s)]
*  what if somebody saw something? No, no, no. I haven't, I don't give any clues yet. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5212.599999999999s)]
*  If you're, there's microphones everywhere. We just asked him to think of his first crush, [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5216.44s)]
*  but he did like someone fictional and like that's a- [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5220.839999999999s)]
*  Can I tell him I'm in the middle of a show? [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5222.919999999999s)]
*  Maybe say I'm in the middle of a show. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5225.879999999999s)]
*  Okay. Okay. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5227.959999999999s)]
*  And say, we're doing a bit. Do you want to call him? Because if you're texting this, [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5230.92s)]
*  do you want to call him or do you want to text him? [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5236.36s)]
*  Well, if I call him, people are going to hear his voice. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5238.04s)]
*  No, but what if you call him and you just go over there? Which one's better to you? [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5240.2s)]
*  Which one's more impossible? Where later you go, there's just no freaking way. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5243.24s)]
*  Is it better if he texts you or is it better if he calls you? [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5246.28s)]
*  What do you think is just more impossible? [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5249.32s)]
*  I could have him call me. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5251.88s)]
*  Yeah. Why not do this? Have him call you in a second. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5253.5599999999995s)]
*  Okay. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5256.68s)]
*  You'll go over there where there's no microphone and I want you to ask this guy [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5256.76s)]
*  the same question I asked Jamie. Do you remember the name of the first girl you had a big crush on? [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5260.52s)]
*  And sometimes people don't remember. I just want you to know I've done this a lot. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5268.360000000001s)]
*  Should I ask him that? [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5270.92s)]
*  Not yet. I would do it on the phone. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5272.12s)]
*  Okay. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5273.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, screw it. Ask him that. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5274.2s)]
*  Okay. Do- [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5275.4800000000005s)]
*  Okay. I should have just did it with voice. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5281.08s)]
*  No, no, because then, well, yeah, nobody's listening to this, I'm sure. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5285.400000000001s)]
*  No, but I mean it's quicker. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5289.0s)]
*  Don't tell me what he says. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5297.56s)]
*  Okay. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5298.6s)]
*  If he says no, a lot of people don't remember this question. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5298.92s)]
*  Okay. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5301.24s)]
*  So then I hedge and I go, well, who's the first girl you ever kissed? Let's see. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5301.64s)]
*  But make sure there's absolutely no way I can see what's on your phone right now. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5305.56s)]
*  You can't see. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5308.12s)]
*  Boom, get that tight. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5309.08s)]
*  You can't see, bitch. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5309.8s)]
*  Just get mad. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5312.4400000000005s)]
*  Okay. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5313.400000000001s)]
*  Does he know or he doesn't know? [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5314.4400000000005s)]
*  Yep. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5315.400000000001s)]
*  He knows? [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5315.64s)]
*  Yep. Right away. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5316.12s)]
*  Did he tell you? [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5316.92s)]
*  Yep. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5317.64s)]
*  No shit. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5317.96s)]
*  Yep. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5318.52s)]
*  Ask him is it the same as the first girl he ever kissed? [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5319.08s)]
*  Okay. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5331.240000000001s)]
*  Let's see what he says. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5331.88s)]
*  Here we go. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5333.320000000001s)]
*  No. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5336.280000000001s)]
*  Does he remember her name too? [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5338.04s)]
*  Okay. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5339.400000000001s)]
*  Yep. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5344.04s)]
*  Yep. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5352.04s)]
*  Two weeks ago, right? No, I'm kidding. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5352.4400000000005s)]
*  Put away. You have two names in your head. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5355.4800000000005s)]
*  Okay. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5356.84s)]
*  Can we establish the fact that you have 50 people that have been on your show? [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5357.240000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5361.96s)]
*  That you took anybody? [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5362.360000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5364.04s)]
*  If this person would have texted back, text somebody else. I don't care who it is. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5364.360000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5367.320000000001s)]
*  There is no conceivable way. This isn't a bank that gave you a number. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5367.64s)]
*  Right. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5371.08s)]
*  And if he didn't know who it is, we would have done something different. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5371.64s)]
*  I don't care. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5373.72s)]
*  Put the phone away. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5374.280000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5375.240000000001s)]
*  How am I going to do this? [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5377.0s)]
*  How are you going to do this? [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5378.280000000001s)]
*  How am I going to do this? [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5379.080000000001s)]
*  Right. And he said what happens when it goes wrong? [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5380.360000000001s)]
*  Nothing. I'm not getting paid to be here. I don't care. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5381.72s)]
*  You're freaking me out. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5384.84s)]
*  Think of both names. They're different. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5386.76s)]
*  He had two different people. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5388.360000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5389.320000000001s)]
*  The same way that you did 2020 and you didn't know. Think of both names. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5390.68s)]
*  And I want you to juggle back and forth between the two. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5394.68s)]
*  Okay. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5396.68s)]
*  First kiss and the first crush. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5397.0s)]
*  Okay. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5398.120000000001s)]
*  And is one name more interesting to you or like they're equal? [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5399.4s)]
*  Or is one name more interesting or not really? [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5404.759999999999s)]
*  Not really. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5407.32s)]
*  Not okay. So you don't like if you gravitate, I would have been like go to one. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5408.04s)]
*  Okay. Count the number of letters in the first crush to yourself. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5410.679999999999s)]
*  Don't use your fingers. I can see. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5416.44s)]
*  Count the number of letters to yourself for the first crush. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5417.639999999999s)]
*  I do that. It's like you out. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5419.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5420.919999999999s)]
*  I started doing those. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5421.5599999999995s)]
*  And then count the number of letters in the first kiss. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5423.5599999999995s)]
*  Oh, you looked up. Interesting. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5426.28s)]
*  They're not equal. Can you agree with me? They're not the same amount of letters, are they? [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5433.64s)]
*  No, they're not. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5437.16s)]
*  No, see, because you would have had the same reaction. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5437.64s)]
*  Do you know when you put somebody in a polygraph test? Have you ever been polygraphed? [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5440.28s)]
*  No. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5443.8s)]
*  They can't just ask you the questions right away. They can't because they first have to get your [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5444.92s)]
*  benchmark. Same way, blood doping. You got to test someone's blood against their blood. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5448.92s)]
*  People have different amounts of testosterone naturally. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5453.08s)]
*  So I had to see how you would do each one. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5455.88s)]
*  And then you did the thing with the eyes that throw me off. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5458.92s)]
*  The first crush, is that name shorter than the first kiss? [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5461.24s)]
*  Yes. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5468.36s)]
*  Yeah. Go to the first crush. I'm going to go with that one. Less work for me. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5468.76s)]
*  Okay. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5472.36s)]
*  One more time. Count the letters. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5473.0s)]
*  Okay. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5474.28s)]
*  And you were trying to avoid it. Six letters. Is that name six letters? [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5474.84s)]
*  Yes. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5479.64s)]
*  Yeah. Mix up all the letters in that first crush's name. Forget the first kiss. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5480.04s)]
*  Scrap it. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5485.56s)]
*  Okay. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5486.120000000001s)]
*  And pick any one in your head. You got one? [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5487.8s)]
*  Got it. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5490.280000000001s)]
*  Jamie gave me a gift on a platter. Thought of a vowel. When he did that, it was 100% you wouldn't [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5491.400000000001s)]
*  pick a vowel later. You didn't do a vowel in the name, did you? [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5498.04s)]
*  No. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5500.200000000001s)]
*  Dude, I'm here for a reason. I haven't done this. I've been doing this for a long time. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5501.080000000001s)]
*  Told you. Goal is to be the best in the world at this. I have watched, I know everything you just [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5505.56s)]
*  did. Second letter. Do you think that's second letter? [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5509.240000000001s)]
*  I will. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5512.280000000001s)]
*  M. Amanda. Is the name Amanda? [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5512.68s)]
*  Yes. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5515.88s)]
*  What the fuck did you just do? [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5518.280000000001s)]
*  And you will talk about this for years. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5519.320000000001s)]
*  Hold on. I'm texting him back. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5522.4400000000005s)]
*  Can you figure out the second one? [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5528.4400000000005s)]
*  No, I'm done, man. Come on. Showbiz. You do your closer, you drop the mic and you pick the mic [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5529.8s)]
*  back up. Never. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5535.8s)]
*  Do you want to know who it was? [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5536.76s)]
*  No, I don't want to know. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5537.72s)]
*  My friend said you're a witch. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5540.200000000001s)]
*  And he said kill him now. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5542.28s)]
*  Definitely a comedian. Definitely a comedian after that. It's definitely a comedian. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5546.04s)]
*  It might not be. I hang out with a lot of weird people. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5549.32s)]
*  I don't know how to go back to conversation mode. Am I right? I got pissed like a racer. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5556.44s)]
*  What do I do? Do I pee or do we keep going? Do we go strong? [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5559.799999999999s)]
*  With this? [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5564.04s)]
*  No, I'm just saying. We'll re-calibrate. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5564.5199999999995s)]
*  It's always easier to pee. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5567.32s)]
*  Is that all right? [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5568.28s)]
*  No, it's perfect because it's too hard to form sentences when you have to pee. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5569.56s)]
*  All right, I'm going to take a quick break. Rapid fire. Are we back? [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5573.88s)]
*  We're back. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5577.4800000000005s)]
*  Lightning. I feel like brand new. I was sitting on it. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5578.4400000000005s)]
*  You rehydrate. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5583.16s)]
*  And I drank so much Gatorade right before and I was like, oh, party foul. I should have thought [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5584.04s)]
*  that went through. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5587.32s)]
*  You ran 27 miles. You deserve a little Gatorade. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5587.8s)]
*  So do you want to know who it was yet? [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5591.4800000000005s)]
*  It's up to you. I like hanging thread, but it's up to you. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5594.28s)]
*  But what is the purpose of hanging the thread? [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5597.88s)]
*  No, tell us at the end. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5599.96s)]
*  Can you tell me who it is? [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5601.24s)]
*  I could, but come on. No, I'll tell you at the end. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5602.4400000000005s)]
*  Okay. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5605.72s)]
*  You already gave the comedian. You said this. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5606.2s)]
*  No, it's a comedian. He's a witch. Kill him. 100%. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5608.6s)]
*  100%. That's not Ben Shapiro. You know what I'm saying? [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5613.16s)]
*  I just say witch. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5616.84s)]
*  Did he tell you? [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5618.2s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5618.92s)]
*  I took the quickest pee of my life. I raced over there. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5619.400000000001s)]
*  I didn't tell him. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5622.04s)]
*  You didn't tell him? [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5622.68s)]
*  No, I don't want him to know. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5623.16s)]
*  Curie, do you think that there's people that knew this shit back in the days of witches? [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5624.2s)]
*  They figured out some of the powers maybe? [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5627.48s)]
*  Not power. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5629.32s)]
*  I think that 100% psychics of the past used a lot of the same techniques I'm using. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5629.719999999999s)]
*  Because when I watch psychics and I have people always tell me at certain things, [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5636.04s)]
*  they tell me like, oh, you know, I saw psychic do this and this and this. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5639.0s)]
*  And I hear it and I go to myself, you know, I could do that same trick and I could, [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5642.919999999999s)]
*  no offense, do it better. But think about it. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5645.639999999999s)]
*  I'm doing this right now with an ethical compass versus if I go, oh, [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5648.04s)]
*  I'm getting this and I thought about this and this is what happened with your dad. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5651.959999999999s)]
*  And you're like, oh my God, you know, I'm a gold. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5654.36s)]
*  Only 25 grand more to have a private session. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5655.72s)]
*  Let's talk to him a little bit more. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5657.64s)]
*  I'm not saying there's nobody psychic. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5660.84s)]
*  I'm telling you that a lot of the psychics that I'm watching them like, [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5662.84s)]
*  I know how you're doing that. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5665.16s)]
*  That was my other question. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5666.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5667.56s)]
*  Is going to be, have you caught anyone trying to get some stuff by you? [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5667.8s)]
*  Like, I don't know. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5670.76s)]
*  Like a psychic? [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5671.8s)]
*  You mean? [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5672.4400000000005s)]
*  Not a psychic. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5672.76s)]
*  You're buying a car and someone's trying to pull some trickling. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5673.4800000000005s)]
*  You're like, I know what you're about to do here. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5675.400000000001s)]
*  Well, 100%. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5677.0s)]
*  Not a shameless plug, but like I literally write, I wrote a book. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5678.2s)]
*  It's coming out in October where it's all about, it's called Read Your Mind. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5681.08s)]
*  And it's not me telling you how to be a mentalist because 99.9% of people don't want to guess [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5683.96s)]
*  a first crush. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5689.08s)]
*  It's not useful to you in your life. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5689.8s)]
*  But what if you could read people more effectively to help you in your life, [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5692.04s)]
*  at home, at work, in relationships. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5696.68s)]
*  That is a quantifiable thing that the tools of a mentalist, [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5699.0s)]
*  when not used for entertainment, but in life day to day, are extraordinary. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5703.16s)]
*  For sure. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5707.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5708.36s)]
*  I mean, you must be great at all kinds of things because of this. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5708.6s)]
*  I don't know about that. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5712.12s)]
*  Anything dealing with human beings. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5712.92s)]
*  Right. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5714.68s)]
*  Negotiating. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5714.92s)]
*  I've never sold a property at a loss. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5716.76s)]
*  Let's just say that. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5718.4400000000005s)]
*  It's been pretty good so far. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5719.08s)]
*  You get in there, you're like, I won't take a dollar less. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5721.0s)]
*  I'm like, I know you will. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5722.76s)]
*  I know you will. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5723.8s)]
*  That's funny. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5726.6s)]
*  That's funny. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5728.2s)]
*  What a weird skill to have. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5729.16s)]
*  Right? [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5730.68s)]
*  What's a good book? [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5731.16s)]
*  A good book? [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5732.84s)]
*  To read on this. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5733.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, on becoming a mentalist or? [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5734.76s)]
*  So many of these skills. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5737.72s)]
*  Like, what did you start with? [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5738.76s)]
*  Do you remember the book you started with? [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5739.8s)]
*  Do you mean if you want to learn how to do mentalism? [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5741.32s)]
*  Do you remember the book that you started with when you first started learning this stuff? [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5743.24s)]
*  So the first book I started reading was a book called 13 Steps to Mentalism. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5746.679999999999s)]
*  But man, is it going to be tough for most people because it was written in the 1920s. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5751.24s)]
*  So it's kind of like, you know, it's like watching an old movie, no offense to old movies, [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5755.719999999999s)]
*  but I'm like, oh, it's hard to get into this with my attention span now because it's antiquated. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5758.92s)]
*  Some of it still applies, but you have to really do a big reach to know how do I apply this? [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5763.88s)]
*  Because back then there were no TVs or no phones. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5768.36s)]
*  There's no it's just that's what I started with. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5770.36s)]
*  But I had to learn the hard way. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5773.08s)]
*  So much of what I do now is again, I told you, is I don't really do what other people do [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5775.08s)]
*  because I don't know how to explain it's they create different, right? [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5780.5199999999995s)]
*  If you are building a house and you have all these tools, you're going to build using your tools. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5785.32s)]
*  Does that make sense? [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5789.4s)]
*  So I've got this set of tools. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5790.679999999999s)]
*  I knew a hammer does this. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5791.96s)]
*  I do that. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5793.08s)]
*  I create with the house already built. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5793.96s)]
*  So my vision again, and why what's been a differentiating feature is I build with the [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5796.04s)]
*  person at the end in mind and I already know what the house is going to be. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5801.96s)]
*  I know what the memory I know what you're going to say. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5805.0s)]
*  Like CNBC, do you ever watch that channel? [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5806.6s)]
*  I try not to. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5809.8s)]
*  So CNBC Fox Business are financial channels. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5811.64s)]
*  I have been on those channels dozens of times. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5815.88s)]
*  How many other mentalists or magicians have ever been on them? [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5818.68s)]
*  Zero. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5821.56s)]
*  Why is that? [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5823.0s)]
*  Because it's unusual. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5823.96s)]
*  That's a serious network. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5825.32s)]
*  Why do you put me on? [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5826.36s)]
*  Because I do stuff around the markets. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5827.4800000000005s)]
*  And so if you're watching it, you buy in because my stuff is about stock market, [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5830.44s)]
*  interest rates, all stuff. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5833.64s)]
*  And it's like, this is crazy, but it had to do with stuff I know. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5834.36s)]
*  So the same thing when I do ESPN, I'm creating from a different perspective than most. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5837.96s)]
*  I customize the content. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5842.68s)]
*  Like when I do a corporate event, I learn in and out your business. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5844.28s)]
*  And when I go up there, I sneak in the medicine. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5847.4800000000005s)]
*  So now, your people aren't just seeing a show. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5850.36s)]
*  They're getting messaging and they're getting it in a way where they don't tune out [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5854.36s)]
*  because they don't realize they're being spoken to. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5857.719999999999s)]
*  It's mostly entertainment. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5860.12s)]
*  But boom, I planted those thoughts. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5861.32s)]
*  And you leave there with, what's the product launch? [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5863.32s)]
*  What's this? [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5865.32s)]
*  All those things are now internalized and remembered. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5865.799999999999s)]
*  And this 13 steps that you said it was written in the 1920s? [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5870.12s)]
*  Fact check me, but I think it was the 20s. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5873.719999999999s)]
*  What did this guy do? [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5875.24s)]
*  What was his job? [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5876.44s)]
*  He was a mentalist? [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5877.4s)]
*  Yeah, but there were no mentalists back then. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5878.5199999999995s)]
*  There were just a few people. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5880.04s)]
*  But they were mostly telling you the skills of psychics. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5881.08s)]
*  They were showing you how psychics did stuff. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5883.64s)]
*  And it wasn't really debunking, but they're showing you all the tools, the 13 steps. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5885.88s)]
*  What are the ways that we can read people more effectively? [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5890.28s)]
*  And what are the tricks of the trade of what we do? [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5894.04s)]
*  How do you know when someone's counting something like that? [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5897.24s)]
*  And you're counting the letters. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5901.4s)]
*  Because to me, you might as well be playing drums. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5903.72s)]
*  Do you understand what I'm saying? [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5906.44s)]
*  If you're playing drums and I have an ear for it, I can hear the beats. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5907.48s)]
*  So once you learn how to do certain things, they build on top. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5910.679999999999s)]
*  If you're counting letters, like again, names are anywhere from 3 to 12 letters. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5914.12s)]
*  It's not rocket science for me to figure it out. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5918.2s)]
*  And again, I can't do it in a vacuum. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5920.5199999999995s)]
*  If you turned your back and said, I'm not doing anything. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5922.36s)]
*  Again, if you control the environment, I can't do it as well. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5924.759999999999s)]
*  It goes back to that fear thing. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5929.4s)]
*  If I started messing up right now, you'd be like, oh, it's getting awkward. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5930.5199999999995s)]
*  You would pull back and I wouldn't be in control anymore. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5934.28s)]
*  A lot of what I'm doing is I'm showing you how I can read you, [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5938.28s)]
*  but also you're allowing yourself to be read. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5944.12s)]
*  When you're saying count the letters, you can see me counting them. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5947.08s)]
*  I can see when you're counting. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5950.68s)]
*  I can see you try to throw me off the count. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5951.64s)]
*  It's like a poker player. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5953.16s)]
*  Poker player knows if you really have aces, pocket aces, [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5954.12s)]
*  or you have two, four, and you're bluffing, the best ones do. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5956.92s)]
*  Which brings the question up, why don't I play poker more? [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5961.16s)]
*  Yeah, why don't you play poker? [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5964.12s)]
*  It's just too boring. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5965.32s)]
*  That's a grind, man. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5969.4800000000005s)]
*  I'd rather make money doing this. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5970.36s)]
*  It's you with this one and a half speed. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5971.56s)]
*  Your whole life is one and a half speed. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5973.4s)]
*  That's wild. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5975.24s)]
*  That's really interesting. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5976.6s)]
*  I'm fascinated. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5978.12s)]
*  No, I think I'm going to read one of those books. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5979.0s)]
*  I'm going to probably get that one. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5981.16s)]
*  I'm going to send you one. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5982.44s)]
*  I'll try and find a better one. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5983.24s)]
*  Well, that one seems interesting too, because I want to read the origins. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5984.28s)]
*  I want to read it like when it first started out. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5987.64s)]
*  What was it like in 1920? [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5990.12s)]
*  What did he learn and where did he learn it? [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5991.88s)]
*  Is it? You find it? [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5994.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5994.92s)]
*  1950-ish or so. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5995.42s)]
*  Oh, 19... [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5996.6s)]
*  Well... [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5997.4s)]
*  But it's also not known. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5997.8s)]
*  This is the guy? [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=5999.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6000.2s)]
*  So he's born in 1930. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6000.44s)]
*  Oh, and I screwed this up. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6002.04s)]
*  It was in 1920. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6002.84s)]
*  So no, the other one's 13 Steps. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6003.64s)]
*  There's another one by Theodore Annamena. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6004.92s)]
*  He did not make his birthplace public. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6006.36s)]
*  Oh, you fucking sneaky bitch. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6008.44s)]
*  He's a sneaky bitch. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6010.2s)]
*  He's the first mentalist and he's sneaky. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6011.16s)]
*  Though it was believed to have been Mill Hill suburb of London. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6013.32s)]
*  For unknown reasons, he renamed himself Tony Cornita. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6016.36s)]
*  Corinda. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6020.44s)]
*  Tony Corinda. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6021.56s)]
*  So he's born Thomas William Simpson and he renamed himself for some reason Tony Corinda, [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6022.52s)]
*  a variation of the surname Conraddy when he began working as a mentalist. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6027.96s)]
*  In 1950, he opened up a shop where he sold all manner of stage magic goods, [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6032.84s)]
*  but catered especially to mentalists. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6037.160000000001s)]
*  He later took over the magic shop on Oxford Street. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6039.160000000001s)]
*  The shop was at street level and thus catered mainly to the regular public [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6042.360000000001s)]
*  so that many of the items sold were either practical jokes or beginners tricks. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6045.64s)]
*  But items for semi-professional magicians and hobbyists were also sold. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6049.4s)]
*  Around the same period, Corinda had the magic concession in Hamley's toy shop on Regent Street. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6053.719999999999s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6061.5599999999995s)]
*  So the book 13 Steps to Mentalism was in 1961. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6062.679999999999s)]
*  So he wrote a series of 13 booklets on mentalism between 56 and 58. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6066.599999999999s)]
*  Each one dealing with a different aspect of mentalism or allied art. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6072.04s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6076.599999999999s)]
*  I'm getting you a copy. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6077.96s)]
*  I'll buy it. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6079.5599999999995s)]
*  Is it reprinted or is it one of those ones you have to buy? [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6081.64s)]
*  No, it's definitely reprinted. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6083.4s)]
*  And see, it's since become the essential mentalism reference book. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6084.5199999999995s)]
*  But again, you're going to have a big problem because you're going to read that book and if [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6088.28s)]
*  you make it through to the end, which God bless you if you can, you're going to be like, [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6091.0s)]
*  yeah, but how the hell did you do all this stuff? [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6093.64s)]
*  You're going to get to the end of it and be like, so that's baby steps. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6096.68s)]
*  And then you've got to get to the next level. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6100.12s)]
*  Oh, sure. I'm not thinking I'm going to get all the information from that. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6102.36s)]
*  But I'm curious as to what the origins of it was. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6104.68s)]
*  How did this guy devise these things? [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6108.04s)]
*  How did he figure it out? [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6109.8s)]
*  Psychics. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6110.68s)]
*  So it's again, people with psychics want to believe. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6111.24s)]
*  Anyone who's in that room who paid that money to hear psychic has someone they've lost [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6115.08s)]
*  and they want something with them because there's, you know. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6119.16s)]
*  Do you believe in any psychic powers at all? [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6121.56s)]
*  Again, I'm not like a debunker because I'm kind of like agnostic in this thing, [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6124.84s)]
*  which is I just believe what I've seen so far. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6129.08s)]
*  And in a lot of instances, I've never personally experienced something that I couldn't explain yet. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6131.8s)]
*  But a lot of people have told me their experiences. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6137.32s)]
*  Have you heard of the telepathy tapes? [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6139.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah. So that I know you had her in here, but that's have you watched the videos? [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6141.4s)]
*  I mean, come on. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6146.04s)]
*  Yeah, that's wild. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6147.08s)]
*  No, no, I'm the opposite. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6148.599999999999s)]
*  I do not think that's real. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6149.719999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6150.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6151.5599999999995s)]
*  Oh, really? [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6151.88s)]
*  No. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6152.44s)]
*  Why? [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6152.84s)]
*  Tell me about what the videos. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6153.88s)]
*  So can we show the videos? [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6155.32s)]
*  Well, I don't know if you've got the paywall again. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6156.759999999999s)]
*  I don't want to controversial, but they're holding in many instances in that form of communication. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6158.28s)]
*  The person knows the information is holding the letters. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6164.84s)]
*  Do you understand what I'm saying? [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6170.28s)]
*  So right now, if I had shown you a word and you're either touching somebody, right? [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6171.4s)]
*  You could get, do you know what a two person code act is? [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6176.5199999999995s)]
*  No. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6179.0s)]
*  So two person code act is like a mentalist thing with two people. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6179.5599999999995s)]
*  There's a few that are the best in the world. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6182.759999999999s)]
*  Aveson's, Mind to Mind in Dubai, like a few really good ones who've done this. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6184.44s)]
*  And what they do is they can be blindfolded in a different area. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6188.759999999999s)]
*  And anything you hand to them, anything you say, the other person knows it. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6192.12s)]
*  No electronics, no nothing. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6195.48s)]
*  They just look at your credit card and they'll guess the credit card numbers. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6197.16s)]
*  And what the way that's being done is they're communicating to each other based on pauses, [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6200.04s)]
*  based on like a million ways that you can think of. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6205.48s)]
*  It's the best code act ever without speaking. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6207.8s)]
*  And you'll watch it and you'll be like, there's no way they're communicating, but they are. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6209.72s)]
*  And so it looks like telepathy, but it's not. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6212.84s)]
*  You get them in the room with scientists, you'll fool every scientist under the sun. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6215.24s)]
*  What they're doing is like not bulletproof at all with the kids. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6219.0s)]
*  And again, God bless, if I had a child in that condition, I for not one moment wouldn't want [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6222.4400000000005s)]
*  a solution and I would want something to know that they're not that they're in there and [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6227.320000000001s)]
*  I could talk to them and I don't want to speak out of turn. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6230.280000000001s)]
*  But from the videos I've seen, I can explain that in a minute. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6232.280000000001s)]
*  They're, they are moving things around and positioning the letters. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6235.08s)]
*  If you do a double blind study where the person does not know the word that they're trying [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6238.12s)]
*  to communicate, I'm not even saying psychic, just don't tell them the word. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6244.12s)]
*  The person holding it and only show the word to the person who should be saying it. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6247.96s)]
*  Right? [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6252.92s)]
*  If you're the autistic child, show them the words there. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6253.64s)]
*  I see it and then have them type that word in and do that for me. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6256.52s)]
*  Nine out of 10 times. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6260.92s)]
*  And they've not been able to do that. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6262.04s)]
*  That's not even psychic. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6263.240000000001s)]
*  That's just show me that you can type the word in that you saw. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6264.04s)]
*  And so when you do like a deep dive on that, it's been. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6267.320000000001s)]
*  She offered to have someone come in with their parent and do that. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6271.4800000000005s)]
*  Would you do that with us? [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6275.4800000000005s)]
*  Sure. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6277.320000000001s)]
*  So you could like, I don't want to take anyone's hope away. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6277.88s)]
*  I'm a parent and like, again, I don't think they're making money on it. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6280.6s)]
*  And I like, I'm very, I don't like to, again, when you ask me psychics, there's people had [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6283.56s)]
*  real deep experiences and who is it for me to take that away? [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6288.52s)]
*  But when I watch that and you're like talking to somebody who's a pro at doing this, same as psychics, [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6291.4800000000005s)]
*  I can see exactly how that's done. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6296.12s)]
*  But what did you think about their ability to read languages that they've never studied? [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6297.96s)]
*  So again, you're missing it. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6302.04s)]
*  So that's again, the devil's in the details. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6303.320000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6305.96s)]
*  It's the memory, what you remember of the story. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6306.2s)]
*  Show me how they did that. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6308.12s)]
*  Did either of the people there present know that language who was doing it? [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6309.8s)]
*  And how was that being communicated? [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6314.28s)]
*  Did the end person who's moving the board around know what the meaning of the word was? [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6316.2s)]
*  Do you understand what I mean? [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6321.96s)]
*  Yes. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6322.76s)]
*  So like, again, you're hearing the, the Cliff's notes, the end edition. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6323.5599999999995s)]
*  Watch the video and show me something that I can't. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6327.88s)]
*  There was nothing I saw in that special or that in that telepathy tape in the videos [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6329.5599999999995s)]
*  that I couldn't readily explain. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6333.88s)]
*  Really? [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6335.5599999999995s)]
*  That's correct. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6336.2s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6337.08s)]
*  Very interesting. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6338.12s)]
*  So could it be right? [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6338.92s)]
*  Yes. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6340.2s)]
*  I'm not saying it's not. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6340.76s)]
*  I'm not, again, they could be 100% right and I could be 100% wrong. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6342.12s)]
*  Hubris. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6345.88s)]
*  Right. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6346.599999999999s)]
*  I haven't been in the room with them. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6347.08s)]
*  I'm judging simply from videos I've seen. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6348.28s)]
*  But as someone who is for a living pretending to read people's minds, [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6350.5199999999995s)]
*  but I'm actually reading people, I can see how it's being done. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6355.96s)]
*  The method, it's kind of like a casino boss. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6359.88s)]
*  I see how that person's cheating when they're playing cards [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6361.4s)]
*  because I know all the cheating methods. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6363.48s)]

*  Like if you do hexadecimal or ASCII, you could take a 16 digit number and break it down into three letters. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6597.639999999999s)]
*  Do you ever see the movie The Martian? [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6604.5199999999995s)]
*  Yes. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6606.44s)]
*  Great movie, right? [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6606.84s)]
*  Another Matt Damon reference. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6607.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6609.0s)]
*  Love Matt Damon, by the way. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6609.24s)]
*  Me too. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6610.28s)]
*  Has he been on here? [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6611.32s)]
*  No. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6612.2s)]
*  Such a good dude. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6612.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I talked to somebody about getting him on. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6613.48s)]
*  Like he was going to reach out. [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6615.08s)]
*  We're going to do it eventually. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6616.2s)]
*  I'm sure. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6617.24s)]
*  I love that guy. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6617.5599999999995s)]
*  He's awesome. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6618.599999999999s)]
*  Met him a couple of times. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6619.08s)]
*  Love him. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6619.8s)]
*  As nice as you'd expect. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6620.36s)]
*  So if you can, in that movie, in The Martian, he didn't know how to send data because he [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6621.88s)]
*  only had the camera. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6625.64s)]
*  So he shows a thing where he figured out how to take and compress big things into small. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6626.2s)]
*  What's the easiest way? [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6629.96s)]
*  You can make it very small so you can send information in a certain way. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6630.68s)]
*  Again, I don't want to blow any of this cover, but there is absolutely, when I see that, [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6633.88s)]
*  I know exactly how it's being done. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6637.24s)]
*  But I don't know if she's doing it on purpose. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6638.84s)]
*  I think they've just learned each other's rhythms. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6641.4800000000005s)]
*  And that's an agent. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6643.4800000000005s)]
*  Oh, OK. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6644.28s)]
*  No, like you've got to have her in a different room. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6645.0s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6647.320000000001s)]
*  Read my mind. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6648.360000000001s)]
*  Read my mind through a door. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6648.84s)]
*  Haven't they done stuff in a different room, though? [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6649.88s)]
*  Didn't Kai Dickens, didn't she said? [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6651.72s)]
*  In particular, another magician actually told me that they had an issue watching [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6654.36s)]
*  that particular kid's videos. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6658.92s)]
*  They thought that those two were doing something funny. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6660.28s)]
*  Yep, clearly. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6662.52s)]
*  But that's right. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6664.76s)]
*  The other videos, I don't know. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6665.96s)]
*  They're behind a paywall. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6667.16s)]
*  You have to get to them. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6667.96s)]
*  That's it. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6668.84s)]
*  That's the sneaky biz. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6669.24s)]
*  Because everyone that sees the paywall, I had a couple sent to me. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6670.28s)]
*  And I'm like, because people ask me this. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6673.32s)]
*  And they were like, what do you think, man? [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6675.08s)]
*  And I listened to all the tapes. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6676.52s)]
*  I thought it was amazing. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6678.04s)]
*  It got a little wild at the end, if you got to the end. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6678.76s)]
*  Like the hill and that. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6681.400000000001s)]
*  And you want to believe. [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6682.52s)]
*  Who doesn't want to believe that? [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6683.400000000001s)]
*  There's psychics amongst us. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6684.4400000000005s)]
*  And especially, kind of like the superhero story of all. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6686.4400000000005s)]
*  These are kids who nobody thought was in there. [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6690.2s)]
*  And they're really in there. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6692.68s)]
*  And they're communicating with each other. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6693.64s)]
*  It's, I mean, I don't know. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6694.84s)]
*  So it's essentially you're saying that instead of psychic energy, [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6695.96s)]
*  there's a sense of like a kind of micro communication. [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6699.0s)]
*  You know what? [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6701.56s)]
*  And people want to believe. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6701.96s)]
*  And so you kind of have confirmation bias looking at the evidence. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6704.4400000000005s)]
*  You want to believe. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6708.76s)]
*  Kai Dickens clearly wanted to believe. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6709.8s)]
*  Just super simple. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6711.8s)]
*  You have a mentalist and maybe a scientist involved. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6712.6s)]
*  And a mentalist is better than the scientist. [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6715.4800000000005s)]
*  Because scientists, they can watch me and they'll be like, [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6716.84s)]
*  I don't know how he's doing it. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6718.6s)]
*  Right? [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6719.320000000001s)]
*  We're designed. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6719.4800000000005s)]
*  We're literally, it's like get a card sheet to beat other card sheets. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6720.2s)]
*  Right. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6724.04s)]
*  So get me involved. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6724.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6725.88s)]
*  And then let's do the same thing. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6726.4400000000005s)]
*  And I'm going to say, here are the three things I need you to do different. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6727.72s)]
*  And I'm not going to say how you're doing it. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6730.360000000001s)]
*  But do it with these three things. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6731.64s)]
*  If you do that, I'm convinced. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6733.0s)]
*  OK. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6735.24s)]
*  We might have to set this up. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6735.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6737.0s)]
*  I wonder if they'd want to. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6738.06s)]
*  But the problem is, is that there's very little to gain from that. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6738.7s)]
*  And then also, we got bad energy in the room. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6741.74s)]
*  Right. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6744.14s)]
*  That's the whole thing. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6744.38s)]
*  You ever see when Uri Geller was debunked by the amazing Randy on Johnny Carson? [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6745.18s)]
*  And he couldn't bend the spoons. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6749.98s)]
*  And he goes, I can't do it with him here. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6751.1s)]
*  He's got bad energy. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6752.14s)]
*  It's not. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6753.02s)]
*  And it's like, is it bad energy or is this a guy who knows how you're bending the spoons? [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6753.66s)]
*  Right. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6758.7s)]
*  And so every time you're about to do a move, he's like a SOB. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6758.86s)]
*  He was like, stop right there. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6761.66s)]
*  Don't move your hand. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6762.46s)]
*  Keep the spoon right there. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6763.18s)]
*  Don't. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6764.06s)]
*  No, no, don't look away. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6764.62s)]
*  It's like my nightmare. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6765.58s)]
*  I had a guy show me how they do the spoons. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6767.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6769.18s)]
*  We had a guy demonstrate magic and he goes, I can show you how to do this one. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6769.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6773.34s)]
*  And it was like a different kind of spoon. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6774.06s)]
*  It wasn't a regular spoon. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6775.9s)]
*  No, no, you could do it with real spoons. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6776.9400000000005s)]
*  You could do it with any spoon. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6778.14s)]
*  Yeah? [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6778.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6779.18s)]
*  You could bend it with your mind? [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6779.5s)]
*  I mean, again, I don't want to knock it, but that's more of a, it's not really, [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6780.86s)]
*  it's not a psychic power. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6784.14s)]
*  That falls more into the category of a magic trick where you're misdirecting people. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6785.5s)]
*  You're doing something else where I'm not really bending a spoon with my mind. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6791.42s)]
*  There's not supernatural powers involved. [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6796.06s)]
*  I can't lie to you and say that I'm doing it in such a way where you don't know the method [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6797.660000000001s)]
*  and it's layered, but it's sure going to look like it's bending by itself, but it's not. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6801.900000000001s)]
*  This guy was saying that's a kind of metal that as he moves his hand around, he heats it up. [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6805.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah, he's lying to you. [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6810.46s)]
*  Really? [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6811.42s)]
*  Really? [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6811.9800000000005s)]
*  Really? [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6812.3s)]
*  Damn, motherfucker. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6812.9400000000005s)]
*  He lied because he didn't want to tell me how he does it. [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6814.780000000001s)]
*  No, yeah. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6816.860000000001s)]
*  Damn it. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6819.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6819.900000000001s)]
*  Got me again. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6820.38s)]
*  Got you. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6821.1s)]
*  You must enjoy getting people though. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6823.5s)]
*  I like people. [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6825.42s)]
*  The spark that lights in your face when you're accurate is really fun to watch. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6826.38s)]
*  I hope it's contagious, but I enjoy watching reactions. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6830.14s)]
*  Yeah, clearly. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6833.900000000001s)]
*  That's the rush, right? [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6834.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6835.74s)]
*  Do you not love laughs? [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6836.06s)]
*  Of course, yeah. [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6837.02s)]
*  You ever go into a room and nobody's laughing and you just bomb and you just eat it? [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6838.06s)]
*  It's like, not fun. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6841.26s)]
*  How often do you bomb anymore? [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6842.78s)]
*  New jokes bomb. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6844.54s)]
*  So you bomb for chunks. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6845.9800000000005s)]
*  You bomb in segments. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6848.22s)]
*  You have to figure out how a bit works and sometimes you try a bit in a way like in the [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6850.14s)]
*  middle of it like, ooh, this is not the way and then you have to kind of adjust. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6854.54s)]
*  And you're doing a lot of sets at the mothership, I assume? [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6858.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6860.78s)]
*  And how much do you get allowances? [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6861.9s)]
*  What's the clock for being Joe Rogan before it's like, oh no, [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6864.7s)]
*  let's just see if you're funny as a person. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6868.14s)]
*  Where does that end? [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6869.58s)]
*  You got to be funny pretty quick. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6870.86s)]
*  You think so? [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6872.22s)]
*  Yeah, people are good for like a minute. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6872.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6874.62s)]
*  They're happy to see you for like a minute. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6874.94s)]
*  It's only a minute, huh? [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6877.58s)]
*  Yeah, not much time, man. [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6878.62s)]
*  Jerry Seinfeld talked about that once. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6880.06s)]
*  He's like, being famous buys you about 30 seconds. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6881.58s)]
*  Oh, I thought it's more. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6883.58s)]
*  That's what he said. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6884.38s)]
*  No, no, especially on a night filled with like really top-notch comedians, [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6885.58s)]
*  right? [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6890.78s)]
*  Killers. [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6891.0199999999995s)]
*  Is the mothership every night. [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6891.58s)]
*  It's all a bunch of killers. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6893.18s)]
*  So you got to be, but that's also why we do it that way. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6894.38s)]
*  You know, the one thing that's really bad for comedians is when they start only [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6897.26s)]
*  doing their crowds. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6902.3s)]
*  So like they do it on the road and they do large places and then they have the [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6903.74s)]
*  same opening act over and over again. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6908.54s)]
*  So they're never challenged. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6910.14s)]
*  Right. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6911.26s)]
*  Yeah, that that makes people soft 90% of the time. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6911.9s)]
*  Yeah, I made that number up. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6915.9s)]
*  Yeah, 95. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6916.86s)]
*  But it's like a high number, you know, because you get soft. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6918.62s)]
*  Right. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6922.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I did. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6923.259999999999s)]
*  This is funny. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6924.299999999999s)]
*  So I used to go to the comedy cellar. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6924.78s)]
*  I told you I love comedy like aficionado. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6925.98s)]
*  I lived in the village for I don't know years and this is pre-kids a lot more time. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6928.7s)]
*  I had to go to the cellar when you could get in the cellar like that. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6933.339999999999s)]
*  Now, good luck. [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6935.82s)]
*  Right. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6936.94s)]
*  And we would see just everybody over and over. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6937.5s)]
*  And I think you met him on Mike Vecchione. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6940.54s)]
*  Sure. [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6943.5s)]
*  So good. [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6943.9s)]
*  Very funny guy. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6944.38s)]
*  Great guy. [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6945.42s)]
*  So great guy. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6946.06s)]
*  Amazing. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6948.06s)]
*  Super funny. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6948.86s)]
*  And he went on on a night where it was just like dropping, dropping, dropping. [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6949.42s)]
*  And he had to follow Seinfeld and Seinfeld goes on and just hammers it. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6952.62s)]
*  And then Mike Vecchione comes on and you know the bathroom in the cellar, right, [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6956.78s)]
*  which is about the size of like a quarter of this table where you're touching arms [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6961.18s)]
*  when you're taking a leak next to some dude. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6965.5s)]
*  I went in there and I was quite drunk and I'll never forget this. [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6967.34s)]
*  I've worked with Mike since and I was telling him, dude, you probably don't remember me, [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6970.3s)]
*  but I was such a drunk idiot. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6973.58s)]
*  And we were touching arms while we're peeing and I always felt bad about them. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6974.9400000000005s)]
*  So drunk. [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6977.900000000001s)]
*  Like, dude, forget Seinfeld. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6978.22s)]
*  You killed it. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6979.820000000001s)]
*  You're the he's like, stop talking to me while we're peeing, dude. [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6980.38s)]
*  I crossed that threshold and I tried to ask him like because we did a gig together [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6982.780000000001s)]
*  and he opened for me and I was like, do you is there any chance you remember? [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6987.900000000001s)]
*  It's like, dude, so many drunk idiots have been next to me at the cellar telling me stuff. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6990.46s)]
*  I'm like the night where you drop, you know, that that trying to see if you remember it. [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6993.34s)]
*  Right. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6996.9400000000005s)]
*  And I wanted to apologize for it because I felt so bad. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=6997.34s)]
*  And I'm like, I was talking to you while you're pissing and dude, I just loved you so much. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7000.14s)]
*  And he forgot he didn't even know this moment, you know, how we drunk. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7007.900000000001s)]
*  But I'm like, I've been holding this weight for a while, Mike, and I'm a big fan. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7010.780000000001s)]
*  And I'm sorry I talked to you while we both had our dicks out. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7014.54s)]
*  It was not okay. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7017.42s)]
*  It was not okay. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7018.22s)]
*  There's a line in the sand that I have just crossed, brother. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7019.660000000001s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7022.700000000001s)]
*  And he forgot about it. [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7023.5s)]
*  He didn't know, dude. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7024.38s)]
*  I mean, it's like when I have gigs where people come back to me and three years later, like, dude, [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7025.58s)]
*  do you remember this thing? [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7029.1s)]
*  And I go, of course I do. [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7030.14s)]
*  Yes. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7031.34s)]
*  No, most of the time you don't remember. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7032.38s)]
*  You try. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7034.620000000001s)]
*  I remember the best and the worst, man. [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7035.42s)]
*  I remember like I remember some moments where I've bombed so bad that it is seared in your DNA. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7037.18s)]
*  You know that feeling? [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7044.14s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7045.1s)]
*  And it's usually ones where you're not to blame, but the buck stops here. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7045.5s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7050.3s)]
*  Like the setup is terrible. [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7050.860000000001s)]
*  The outdoor gig. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7052.860000000001s)]
*  I had one where, God, it was like the town of Charlotte or some some [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7054.620000000001s)]
*  town hired me some city and I had to insert all these data points about the city. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7058.3s)]
*  And we're like, normally we do two or three things. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7064.3s)]
*  I will mention two or three things in the course of a show. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7065.900000000001s)]
*  And if it's 10 minutes, forget it. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7068.22s)]
*  It's I don't want to be a salesperson up there. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7070.06s)]
*  People tune out if they're like, what are you selling me something right now? [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7071.9800000000005s)]
*  Right. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7074.7s)]
*  And I had to say eight or nine things about the town of was it Charlotte? [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7075.5s)]
*  And they at the last moment we do dressers will go, by the way, we're all dressing as genies. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7079.5s)]
*  And we're going to have a life-size genie lamp on stage. [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7083.74s)]
*  And it's going to start doing smoke while you're doing this. [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7086.7s)]
*  I'm like, I don't really like any of these things, but I was newer to show up as I'm like, [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7088.78s)]
*  I go with it the whole time I'm on stage. [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7092.46s)]
*  The smoke is going like at 100 percent. [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7095.099999999999s)]
*  We're coughing. [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7098.139999999999s)]
*  It's going terrible. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7099.0199999999995s)]
*  I can't see the person whose mind I'm reading. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7100.139999999999s)]
*  I'm sweating. [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7102.46s)]
*  I'm trying to talk about the Billy Graham Museum. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7103.5s)]
*  I'm dying a slow death up there. [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7106.139999999999s)]
*  I get two things in a row wrong. [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7108.3s)]
*  And you know, if you bomb your opener and your closer, like you're dead. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7109.98s)]
*  I left apologizing. [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7114.7s)]
*  You never want to leave a stage. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7116.06s)]
*  They somehow still loved it. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7117.1s)]
*  I don't even know how, but I sweated through that suit. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7118.700000000001s)]
*  It was like, you know, when you question what you're doing in life, that was like a question. [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7122.22s)]
*  Like, maybe I'm not supposed to be doing this. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7127.5s)]
*  Well, also you probably say, OK, never doing that kind of setup again. [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7130.46s)]
*  Kind of. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7134.3s)]
*  But me, I'm more catastrophize and I'm like, yeah, I should just be done. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7134.780000000001s)]
*  But then I came back. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7138.22s)]
*  I came back. [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7139.820000000001s)]
*  I picked myself up. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7140.46s)]
*  To. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7142.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7142.78s)]
*  Funny enough, tomorrow's my one of my daughter's fifth birthday and I'm doing a show at school for five year olds. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7143.26s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7148.94s)]
*  Yeah, man, I got to get back. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7149.66s)]
*  But sweetheart, this is like the sweet spot where they still think I'm cool. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7150.94s)]
*  That's cool. [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7154.3s)]
*  Before I'm going to be like, don't do this and embarrass us, dad. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7155.1s)]
*  Right. [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7157.5s)]
*  And last year for my oldest son, who was at the time had just turned eight, I did his school second graders and dude, they ate me alive. [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7157.9s)]
*  Because I'm not doing this like this is, you know, my sweet spot is mental. [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7166.46s)]
*  Right. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7169.82s)]
*  I had to brush off the dust of my kids show, which I haven't touched in like 25 years. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7170.46s)]
*  Thank God I'm not doing kids shows anymore. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7174.54s)]
*  No offense to kids show magicians, but like that's that ship has sailed. [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7176.9400000000005s)]
*  And man, second graders are ruthless. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7180.3s)]
*  Really? [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7183.02s)]
*  Ruthless. [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7183.5s)]
*  Why second graders? [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7184.22s)]
*  I don't know, man. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7186.7s)]
*  Like, like one kid, I, I finished this show. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7187.42s)]
*  OK. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7191.02s)]
*  And during the show, my wife is in the room recording. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7191.34s)]
*  I'm like, don't record, don't record. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7193.5s)]
*  And I had I had to like look at my wife at one point and I whispered, this is a nightmare. [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7195.02s)]
*  Because one kid's like, it's in your hand. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7199.9s)]
*  Show me that. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7201.42s)]
*  Show me that. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7202.0599999999995s)]
*  And I'm like, dude, shut up. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7202.54s)]
*  And I'm not good at it. [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7203.9s)]
*  I haven't done it in a while. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7205.339999999999s)]
*  Right. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7206.7s)]
*  So I'm just bombing on tricks. [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7207.42s)]
*  And thankfully, 95% of the crowd actually liked it. [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7209.58s)]
*  It was just these two kids who just got me. [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7212.379999999999s)]
*  When I went home, one of my neighbors saw me and he goes to me, he goes, oh, my God, what's wrong? [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7215.98s)]
*  Are you OK? [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7220.0599999999995s)]
*  Because my face was like ash and white. [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7221.0199999999995s)]
*  He thought somebody died. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7222.86s)]
*  And I'm like, dude, I don't, I don't, you know, I don't even know what to say right now. [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7223.82s)]
*  Like I, maybe I shouldn't be doing this. [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7227.099999999999s)]
*  I had to at one point tell the teacher, I'm like, I'm actually like I'm I actually do this for a living. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7229.42s)]
*  I'm like, I had to try to flex. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7233.58s)]
*  I'm like, I have an Emmy. [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7235.02s)]
*  Like I, I want to let them know I'm not actually this bad. [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7235.82s)]
*  Like I. [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7239.1s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7242.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7243.5s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7244.22s)]
*  Do you think comedy is kind of a bit of hypnotizing people? [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7245.9s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7250.38s)]
*  The best comedians, the pacing, the rhythm. [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7251.1s)]
*  Like I was watching a Tom Segura special this morning. [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7254.46s)]
*  I don't know how well you know his material. [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7258.3s)]
*  I mean, you know him well, but like he had a bit about flying first class. [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7259.66s)]
*  Do you remember that one? [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7262.54s)]
*  I don't. [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7263.42s)]
*  Oh, he talks about I don't think he's using this material anymore. [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7263.9800000000005s)]
*  The fact that he gets upgraded, he buys coach tickets early. [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7267.9800000000005s)]
*  It was years ago and he gets upgraded so much that he gets first class tickets. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7271.42s)]
*  And he go, should I not say this bit? [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7276.86s)]
*  I don't know if I want to say it. [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7278.62s)]
*  He goes, it literally the moment I get upgraded, this feeling of superiority washes over me. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7280.14s)]
*  Where I'm like, don't when people are walking, don't look at you poor piece of shit. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7285.5s)]
*  Like he's just so he goes, I dare you if you're in coach to try to use my bathroom. [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7288.46s)]
*  If I'm in the front, I will put my hand on your chest, bro. [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7293.02s)]
*  I've seen that a hundred times and it's just as funny if not funnier every time I watch it. [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7295.82s)]
*  And it's like the timing, the rhythm. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7300.22s)]
*  I learned more from comedy than ever. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7303.1s)]
*  Magic or mentalism. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7304.7s)]
*  Way more interesting because we've talked about it a bunch comics. [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7306.06s)]
*  I'm like, I think we're hypnotizing people because I feel hypnotized when someone's killing. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7310.62s)]
*  When someone's killing, I'm allowing them to think for me. [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7315.1s)]
*  They're taking me on a ride and I'm just, I'm not thinking at all about what would I say? [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7318.700000000001s)]
*  What would I do? [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7323.5s)]
*  I'm just in their head or they're in my head. [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7324.3s)]
*  Right. [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7328.46s)]
*  And also when you bring someone along and when you have that, like just you drop just amazing line, [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7328.620000000001s)]
*  like just there's so many, I mean, listen, I consume so much comedy, but like I love watching [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7333.9800000000005s)]
*  the rhythm, seeing where people go with it. [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7339.26s)]
*  The people that are more short form, like punch delivery. [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7341.5s)]
*  Right. [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7344.860000000001s)]
*  Versus like a long form, like a Nate Bargottsy, like watching Andrew do his things. [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7345.1s)]
*  Shull's amazing. [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7350.22s)]
*  Man, some of these guys are just like, you can't see where the joke is going to come [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7351.42s)]
*  and how you just squeeze every bit of juice out of the orange and the good callbacks. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7354.38s)]
*  I think that ultimate hypnotist is David Tell. [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7358.54s)]
*  Yeah. Oh yeah. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7361.42s)]
*  Dave, cause David, there's a rhythm. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7361.900000000001s)]
*  There's a rhythm to why he does. [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7364.620000000001s)]
*  It's like, you just get lost in his thinking. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7365.9800000000005s)]
*  Right. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7368.700000000001s)]
*  And he just takes you on the and he's so effortless. [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7369.1s)]
*  And he does so many sets, like he's so polished that there's like this [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7372.14s)]
*  effortlessness to his movements and the rhythm and everything. [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7377.02s)]
*  It's like, it's wild. [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7380.38s)]
*  Like Sebastian Maniscalco. [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7383.18s)]
*  I freaking love watching Sebastian. [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7384.54s)]
*  There's so many, there's so many people that came up now that I've seen like over and over [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7386.3s)]
*  and over and just watch them go up like Sam Morrill. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7389.58s)]
*  I've been a fan of Sebastian was actually the first guy to recommend you to me. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7391.18s)]
*  I love Sebastian. [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7394.7s)]
*  Shout out to Sebastian. [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7395.58s)]
*  I love you, Sebastian. [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7396.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7397.66s)]
*  Was there anyone else after that? [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7397.900000000001s)]
*  Uh, caught up a couple of people told me you were awesome. [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7399.18s)]
*  Quite a few. [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7401.66s)]
*  No, Sebastian's such a standup guy. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7402.14s)]
*  This friend of mine, when I told him that it was Shane Gillis, it's Shane Gillis, isn't it? [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7403.820000000001s)]
*  It is. [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7407.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7408.06s)]
*  You just thought of it. [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7409.1s)]
*  You shouldn't let down your guard. [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7409.66s)]
*  I just knew it. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7410.54s)]
*  How'd you know? [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7411.18s)]
*  That was it. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7412.38s)]
*  That was the moment. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7412.860000000001s)]
*  What did you see? [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7413.42s)]
*  I can't tell you, but that was right when you said this friend of mine knew, [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7414.06s)]
*  I knew you were going to protect your parks. [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7417.5s)]
*  And I said, could it have been Ari, could it have been Mark? [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7418.780000000001s)]
*  And I immediately knew it was going to be Shane Gillis. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7420.54s)]
*  Cause neither of those two would have said, definitely not Mark would have said, kill him. [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7422.14s)]
*  He's a witch. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7425.58s)]
*  He's the, I just knew it. [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7426.46s)]

*  That's Shane. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7428.700000000001s)]
*  That's such a sense of humor too. [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7431.18s)]
*  He's a witch, kill him. [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7435.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7436.700000000001s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7441.02s)]
*  That was a little bit of a giveaway because I said it was my friend. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7441.42s)]
*  Yep. [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7443.900000000001s)]
*  That is. [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7444.22s)]
*  That was the giveaway. [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7445.02s)]
*  That was the giveaway because I didn't tell you it's someone that I know. [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7445.740000000001s)]
*  You said a hundred percent. [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7447.740000000001s)]
*  So now I'm thinking like he must live in Austin. [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7448.860000000001s)]
*  Like there was a lot of, a lot of indicators. [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7450.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7453.18s)]
*  Whatever. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7455.02s)]
*  But that's part of the thing, right? [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7455.900000000001s)]
*  But that's also you admitting that this isn't like super natural. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7457.9s)]
*  I'm not psychic. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7461.42s)]
*  So everybody, when people put me on the spot and like, tell me this right now, [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7462.219999999999s)]
*  I literally go, it's not Netflix, non-demand feature. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7466.0599999999995s)]
*  Like I, again, that's where these skills, when people are like, why don't you win the lottery? [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7468.46s)]
*  Why don't you like all these things that are silly, where you don't get what I do, apparently. [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7473.58s)]
*  Do you believe that there is any sort of psychic power that people have? [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7477.9s)]
*  Like when, when someone gets a phone call from someone they're just thinking about. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7482.62s)]
*  Intuition. [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7486.219999999999s)]
*  Right. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7487.0199999999995s)]
*  I think there's, I think there's, I mean, listen, that's like a bigger picture question, [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7487.42s)]
*  like, you know, where does your mind expand? [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7492.14s)]
*  Like psychedelics, like where, where, what is there beyond this plane? [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7494.46s)]
*  Clearly, you know, people are aware of there's, it'd be silly to think, but [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7499.42s)]
*  how do you kind of get on that frequency? [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7503.82s)]
*  There's no question that people have an intuition. [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7506.14s)]
*  Again, could I call it psychic powers? [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7508.14s)]
*  I've had things happen that I can't explain to you based on the skills I have. [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7509.34s)]
*  Does that make sense? [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7513.5s)]
*  Like what? [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7514.22s)]
*  I've guessed things from people where I didn't do the normal way I do it. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7514.86s)]
*  Do you understand what I mean? [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7518.7s)]
*  Like I don't have a, there's a series of steps on how I do it, kind of like a chess player. [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7519.42s)]
*  Okay. [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7524.78s)]
*  You get a chess player, you get Magnus Carlsen, you get the best chess player in the world. [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7525.0199999999995s)]
*  They can literally blindfold play 30 people. [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7528.22s)]
*  And I'm like, how do you, how do you, how are you doing that? [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7530.3s)]
*  Right. [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7532.38s)]
*  That's like magic to me. [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7532.62s)]
*  But you're keeping track of all that stuff in your mind and you're doing stuff that is [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7533.98s)]
*  indistinguishable from real magic, in my opinion. [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7538.46s)]
*  But you've hyper focused on one skill. [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7541.26s)]
*  That's what I've done. [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7543.74s)]
*  You just think it's a lot of skills. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7544.94s)]
*  What I've focused on is one thing is assessing what people are thinking and what they give away [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7546.38s)]
*  that they don't think they're giving away. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7551.74s)]
*  That's all. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7552.94s)]
*  I just guess secret information for a living, but to make it exciting, entertaining, [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7553.26s)]
*  I add bells and whistles and make it interesting. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7556.7s)]
*  Otherwise it'd be boring. [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7558.86s)]
*  How many mentalists are out there? [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7559.98s)]
*  Like, is there a community guys? [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7561.74s)]
*  You share notes? [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7563.179999999999s)]
*  Sure. [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7564.78s)]
*  So there's like a, I wouldn't call it a brain trust, but there's people I bounce ideas off of [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7565.099999999999s)]
*  when I'm creating, kind of like you'd punch up jokes where [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7569.74s)]
*  here's what's rare in our world. [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7573.900000000001s)]
*  There's creators and then there's performers. [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7576.3s)]
*  Do you know what I'm saying? [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7579.58s)]
*  Like writers and it's like singer songwriters. [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7580.3s)]
*  How many people have their songs written for them? [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7582.54s)]
*  Some of the biggest stars in the world. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7585.02s)]
*  And how many are like Taylor Swift style where you write and this and you get a piece of you in it. [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7586.62s)]
*  And there's something about when you write your own song, [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7591.34s)]
*  I'm not knocking people that don't write their own song, [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7593.900000000001s)]
*  but there's something that you feel different. [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7595.5s)]
*  Right. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7597.1s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7597.66s)]
*  Which explains the connection Taylor Swift has to her fans. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7598.22s)]
*  I believe so because you're getting a piece of you that somebody else can't. [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7601.1s)]
*  I'm sure that's just a random pop star that gets like some factory. [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7604.3s)]
*  You'll still like it. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7608.46s)]
*  Like I love a Backstreet Boys song. [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7609.34s)]
*  Don't get me wrong. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7611.26s)]
*  Like I want it that way, Joe. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7611.9800000000005s)]
*  But like when you are with her and I'm sure like Jack Antinous, [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7615.820000000001s)]
*  she has a huge amazing crew of writers that I'm sure get things out of her. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7618.46s)]
*  And I know a lot of like music producers, but you feel some connection. [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7622.780000000001s)]
*  So what again, I think is differentiating. [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7626.54s)]
*  There's a lot of mentalists, but it's a really small number that are the singer, [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7629.02s)]
*  songwriter, the creator, performer who have the thoughts and are constantly doing new stuff. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7632.700000000001s)]
*  Because we are a cover band. [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7639.42s)]
*  Most mentalists are a cover band of other mentalists. [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7641.740000000001s)]
*  We don't need to do new stuff. [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7644.9400000000005s)]
*  You could literally do the same thing. [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7646.700000000001s)]
*  This is pretty amazing. [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7647.900000000001s)]
*  I could do this for the next 40 years and make a good living. [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7648.620000000001s)]
*  God bless. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7651.5s)]
*  And why do new stuff? [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7652.540000000001s)]
*  Like when Louis CK was popping out three specials a year, everyone's like, [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7654.780000000001s)]
*  you know, why are you doing this to all the rest of us? [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7657.900000000001s)]
*  You're so creative. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7659.74s)]
*  You don't have to. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7661.34s)]
*  And in our profession, you really don't have to because you don't have to bury material. [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7662.22s)]
*  If I'm not putting stuff online, if I'm not going like crowd work, the Matt Rife model, [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7665.9800000000005s)]
*  who by the way, I love that guy, but like it changed the game. [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7670.78s)]
*  Now, if you want to blow up on social, you've got to be doing this or do current events, [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7674.62s)]
*  do topical, do things you can burn. [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7679.02s)]
*  But I can't put my real act out there. [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7681.02s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7682.860000000001s)]
*  But you enjoy the creative aspect. [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7684.14s)]
*  I love it. [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7685.82s)]
*  I find it boring. [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7686.46s)]
*  If I keep doing the same stuff, of course, I'm bored. [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7687.18s)]
*  Right, right. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7690.46s)]
*  And I get like sad. [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7691.34s)]
*  Right. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7692.62s)]
*  But it's interesting because like I wonder how many people you can bounce ideas off of. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7692.86s)]
*  It seems like you're kind of a lone wolf. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7697.74s)]
*  In that world, I don't think there's, I mean, there's a lot of comedians. [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7700.46s)]
*  Like I could call a lot of comedians right now, right? [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7704.14s)]
*  Bounce an idea off of. [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7706.94s)]
*  There's way less mentalists and there's way more magicians. [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7708.22s)]
*  And then of the group of mentalists, if you were to do the core one, [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7711.66s)]
*  and again, this is not subjective. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7715.34s)]
*  I'm much more like objective the way we looked at names. [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7716.78s)]
*  How many of them have done certain volume of TV appearance, [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7719.02s)]
*  certain volume of views? [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7721.9800000000005s)]
*  Like which ones are getting the attention of the world and the zeitgeist? [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7722.860000000001s)]
*  It's a very, very small number because you got to innovate, right? [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7726.7s)]
*  This is like an attention economy. [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7729.900000000001s)]
*  You have to do stuff that's compelling to the viewer. [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7731.26s)]
*  And for me, I don't think about myself. [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7734.46s)]
*  It's a trick in life. [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7737.26s)]
*  I think about who's watching. [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7738.06s)]
*  Well, that's what do you mean by it's a trick in life? [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7740.22s)]
*  Well, I like it helps you in everything in life, right? [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7743.42s)]
*  My secret sauce is that I hold the mirror up not to myself, but to you. [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7747.0199999999995s)]
*  Do you get it? [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7751.259999999999s)]
*  Like when you're watching and you're watching a football thing, [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7751.66s)]
*  what's intriguing is the fact that you're a football viewer. [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7755.74s)]
*  If you're meeting somebody and you want to be memorable, [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7757.98s)]
*  learn more about them. [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7760.3s)]
*  Start listening more. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7761.5s)]
*  Like I'll tell you a story. [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7762.86s)]
*  I met Steven Spielberg. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7763.9s)]
*  I did Steven Spielberg's dad's birthday and I got in that room. [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7765.099999999999s)]
*  Have you met Steven Spielberg? [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7768.78s)]
*  No. [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7769.82s)]
*  And I'm like, you know, a crazy fan. [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7770.46s)]
*  Like I can't explain to you how many movies he had as a kid that were life changing. [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7773.34s)]
*  And I'm like, dude, Close Encounters third kind. [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7777.02s)]
*  Like, yeah, he's one of the greatest of all time ever. [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7778.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7781.42s)]
*  And so I'm in the room. [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7781.82s)]
*  I've done stuff for his family. [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7783.5s)]
*  This is not like a big blowout corporate event. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7784.86s)]
*  It's like 80 people. [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7786.62s)]
*  I hope he doesn't mind me sharing this. [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7787.82s)]
*  And it was a great time. [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7789.26s)]
*  Amazing. [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7791.26s)]
*  And at the end of it, I'm like getting some face time with Spielberg. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7792.3s)]
*  Right. [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7796.06s)]
*  And I walk up to him and we spent almost 20 minutes talking to each other, which is like, [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7796.38s)]
*  I didn't expect that. [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7802.22s)]
*  I thought I'd be like, oh, great job. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7803.02s)]
*  You know, do you know how many questions I had a million questions. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7803.9800000000005s)]
*  Do you know how many questions I asked him? [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7806.54s)]
*  How many? [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7808.22s)]
*  Zero. [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7808.86s)]
*  Really? [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7809.900000000001s)]
*  Zero. [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7810.46s)]
*  And that's like right there. [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7811.34s)]
*  I learned a lesson in life that applies to everything. [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7812.46s)]
*  That's why Steven Spielberg. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7815.1s)]
*  He is naturally curious. [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7816.54s)]
*  This guy, wealthy beyond belief, stories beyond belief. [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7818.14s)]
*  He could make it ego driven and he could have been telling me, oh, this. [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7820.54s)]
*  I would have been hanging on my every word. [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7823.5s)]
*  But instead, he wanted to know more about me. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7825.42s)]
*  And he kept asking me. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7829.02s)]
*  I was like, just pause, dude. [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7830.14s)]
*  I have like a lot of questions. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7832.14s)]
*  Like, come on. [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7835.18s)]
*  And so I learned and I could have just left that and been like, [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7836.22s)]
*  I didn't get any questions in with Steven Spielberg. [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7839.34s)]
*  Instead, I realized this is the person at the highest level of what he does. [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7840.86s)]
*  And he is naturally curious and he lets other people shine. [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7844.22s)]
*  And this is something to do in life. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7847.1s)]
*  Right. [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7849.1s)]
*  Which is you don't know when you meet somebody who they'll be or what they'll be or what can. [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7849.66s)]
*  I'm not doing it from a transactional sense. [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7854.7s)]
*  But why I've had so many TV appearances is when I go into a place, [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7856.94s)]
*  I'm going to do stuff for the security guard. [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7860.46s)]
*  I'm going to do something for the person who irons my shirt. [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7861.9s)]
*  I'm going to leave that place like a bomb went off of amazement where everyone around there now [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7864.0599999999995s)]
*  likes you and you don't know when they'll jump ship to another network, to another thing. [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7868.38s)]
*  And if they like you, sales 101, they're going to want to keep doing business with you. [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7871.82s)]
*  And so those people become your champions elsewhere. [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7875.98s)]
*  And it was kind of a lesson where he could have talked about himself the whole time. [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7878.86s)]
*  He didn't. [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7882.0599999999995s)]
*  Interesting. [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7883.42s)]
*  So I shouldn't either. [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7883.98s)]
*  When you go to other places, let other people shine. [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7885.419999999999s)]
*  And that's something I've carried with me. [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7888.379999999999s)]
*  And I think that's a superpower in life that most people don't do. [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7890.0599999999995s)]
*  They think, what am I going to say next? [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7893.74s)]
*  Right. [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7895.74s)]
*  That's kind of the key to running a good podcast too, [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7896.54s)]
*  because you really want to extract the most out of the person possible. [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7899.099999999999s)]
*  Right. [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7901.9s)]
*  Where you just want that. [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7902.54s)]
*  My questions are basically just try to get you expand. [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7904.299999999999s)]
*  And I just want to find out how you think. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7907.259999999999s)]
*  Right. [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7909.419999999999s)]
*  And for Spielberg, a guy who deals in all these stories and narratives [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7909.9s)]
*  and all these characters and heroes, to meet a unique character like yourself [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7914.54s)]
*  is probably really fascinating to him too, because he's probably like, [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7918.46s)]
*  oh, I don't know anybody like this. [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7922.219999999999s)]
*  Right. [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7923.9s)]
*  What are you doing? [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7924.86s)]
*  How are you doing? [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7925.98s)]
*  And now he's got a new tool in his toolbox. [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7926.86s)]
*  Totally. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7929.9s)]
*  Because he's got you. [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7930.379999999999s)]
*  Right. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7931.74s)]
*  This, you have the spectrum of possibilities in terms of the humans that you meet. [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7932.139999999999s)]
*  And then you meet one that's outside of that. [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7938.14s)]
*  You're like, oh, I hadn't even considered you before. [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7939.900000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7942.54s)]
*  What are you? [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7943.18s)]
*  Where? [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7943.660000000001s)]
*  How's who the fuck are you? [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7943.9800000000005s)]
*  That was pretty much the question. [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7945.900000000001s)]
*  And then he had like, he, but he was interesting because [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7947.900000000001s)]
*  I don't know if you get this, but I get like X, [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7951.02s)]
*  like the 20 questions is what I call it here. [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7953.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7954.9400000000005s)]
*  Which is how did you get into this? [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7955.42s)]
*  Like the opening questions, which you can't blame someone if you've got a weird job. [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7956.860000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7960.9400000000005s)]
*  People want to know about it. [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7961.26s)]
*  Right. [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7962.700000000001s)]
*  Like, oh, did some of your family do this? [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7962.9400000000005s)]
*  Like there's all these questions you're going to get every time. [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7964.54s)]
*  God bless people. [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7966.86s)]
*  I don't hold it against them. [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7967.58s)]
*  Mine is always I'm doing like a sound check for a gig. [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7968.7s)]
*  And then there was like, all right, so we got this, we got this. [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7971.74s)]
*  I go, don't you know that we have that? [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7974.62s)]
*  Like, ah, I'm like, okay, so just real quick, where's the green room? [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7975.74s)]
*  Like, you don't know already. [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7980.219999999999s)]
*  And I'm like, okay, this is, I just smile and I'm like, you know, [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7981.259999999999s)]
*  I never heard that one before, but it's, it's, it's you get that. [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7984.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7988.62s)]
*  But in this situation, again, it's like he, he didn't ask those questions. [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7989.0199999999995s)]
*  He was very uniquely finding answers, questions that weren't like the usual. [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7994.7s)]
*  And of course, because of study, I mean, he studies humans. [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=7999.42s)]
*  Right. [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8002.3s)]
*  I mean, to be a great filmmaker the way he is to do Schindler's List to do. [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8002.78s)]
*  That's, that's such a heavy movie, man. [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8007.34s)]
*  Have you seen that recently? [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8008.94s)]
*  Private Ryan. [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8010.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8011.0199999999995s)]
*  He's got heavy movies. [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8011.18s)]
*  And then, you know, Close Encounters was one of my favorite movies of all time. [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8012.54s)]
*  I mean, the con it's interesting. [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8016.54s)]
*  You know, one of the things I really liked about that movie is he, [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8018.62s)]
*  after he became a father changed how he felt about the ending of his own movie. [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8021.42s)]
*  He wouldn't have the father leave everybody. [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8026.22s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8028.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8029.34s)]
*  Cause the end of the movie, Richard Dreyfuss, his character gets on the spaceship and leaves [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8029.66s)]
*  with the aliens. [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8034.54s)]
*  Wow. [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8035.34s)]
*  He's like, I would never do that. [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8035.66s)]
*  I didn't know that. [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8036.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8037.34s)]
*  Did they film it or no? [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8037.58s)]
*  Well, he, it was after the fact, like, you know, he made the movie, I believe when he [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8039.02s)]
*  was younger and he didn't have children. [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8043.18s)]
*  And then as time went on, you know, he looked back on it, you're like, oh God, [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8044.78s)]
*  I would never leave my kids to go on this fucking UFO. [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8049.58s)]
*  Right. [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8052.3s)]
*  Nor would I, nor would you. [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8052.54s)]
*  No. [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8054.0599999999995s)]
*  No. [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8054.46s)]
*  Like, but in this idealistic version of who he thought the Richard Dreyfuss character was [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8054.94s)]
*  and the circumstances, like he had to leave. [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8061.34s)]
*  He had to go. [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8063.26s)]
*  You got to go with the aliens. [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8063.74s)]
*  Like sure as hell get my phone out and try and get good footage for a change. [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8064.62s)]
*  I'm like right here, good stuff. [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8067.26s)]
*  I like the Tic Tac and Gimbal, but I want to see it close up and high def. [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8069.58s)]
*  I know. [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8072.86s)]
*  You got anything? [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8073.98s)]
*  Nothing. [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8074.94s)]
*  You got something? [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8075.58s)]
*  Come on. [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8076.3s)]
*  I have off air. [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8076.94s)]
*  What I think are people bullshitting me. [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8078.22s)]
*  Oh, I, you don't have to be off air. [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8079.98s)]
*  I've watched these. [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8081.26s)]
*  I can read people. [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8081.82s)]
*  I can tell on, on air where the snake oil is. [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8082.62s)]
*  But yeah, I feel it. [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8085.42s)]
*  That's where it's instinctive. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8087.42s)]
*  Like I don't have the tools that you have, but there's a part of me that's like, [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8088.78s)]
*  hmm, something smells weird. [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8091.98s)]
*  When I walked in here and I said, this is again, passes the sniff test and part of my [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8095.18s)]
*  French, but everyone takes crap, right? [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8099.34s)]
*  Everyone in the world. [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8100.94s)]
*  I don't care if you're the Pope. [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8101.5s)]
*  You take a crap. [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8102.46s)]
*  So if they're being held in a facility, someone's taking craps, right? [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8103.26s)]
*  And who's cleaning it? [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8108.06s)]
*  I don't think the scientists are. [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8109.02s)]
*  There's a janitor. [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8110.14s)]
*  There's someone in that room. [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8111.1s)]
*  So are you telling me that there's nobody in there that's got a 401k health insurance, [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8112.06s)]
*  some sort of, how is someone not getting, [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8117.26s)]
*  tell me, explain to me what NDA they're signing or what they're doing that if they found this out, [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8121.02s)]
*  someone loose lips, sink ship, somebody would have told somebody who works in that facility, [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8124.780000000001s)]
*  who's not the scientist, who's not the military person. [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8128.46s)]
*  And word gets out. [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8131.5s)]
*  How is that buttoned up tight where nothing gets out ever? [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8132.78s)]
*  Well, for 50 years, you're telling me there's a basement somewhere in this country, [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8137.5s)]
*  eight stories down where they got those things and no one else knows who's credible and can [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8142.54s)]
*  release it. [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8146.7s)]
*  How Occam's razor? [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8147.34s)]
*  What do you think? [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8149.0199999999995s)]
*  I think the government can keep things secret for a long time. [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8149.82s)]
*  I think they did with the Manhattan project. [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8152.38s)]
*  I think they've done it with other projects in the past. [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8154.62s)]
*  I think it's possible. [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8157.34s)]
*  You think it's siloed. [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8158.38s)]
*  It's just siloed. [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8159.259999999999s)]
*  Nobody knows all the info. [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8160.0599999999995s)]
*  Because people do talk. [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8161.0199999999995s)]
*  There's a lot of people talking and people share similar stories and they have for decades. [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8162.7s)]
*  And I think there's something to it. [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8169.26s)]
*  I just don't know what it is. [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8171.26s)]
*  I think we had Jesse Michaels on yesterday who has this amazing show on YouTube, [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8172.9400000000005s)]
*  probably the best YouTube show on aliens and UFOs and UAPs. [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8177.66s)]
*  And he's very agnostic in his thinking and he's very objective. [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8182.46s)]
*  And he also is very, very, very thorough as far as his understanding of the information. [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8187.42s)]
*  And even he is baffled as much as he knows. [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8193.9s)]
*  But he knows more about siloed technology than pretty much anybody does in regard to [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8197.58s)]
*  this UAP phenomenon. [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8203.58s)]
*  Right. [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8204.78s)]
*  And he points to this guy, Thompson Brown, who was working on gravity technology in the 1950s. [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8205.18s)]
*  They had working models. [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8214.62s)]
*  Like they, he thinks that they have some sort of a gravity propulsion device. [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8216.46s)]
*  But then there's things like Roswell where the crash, like if all those stories are true, [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8221.18s)]
*  that's too early. [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8226.3s)]
*  It's 47. [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8227.5s)]
*  There's too early. [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8228.539999999999s)]
*  There's no way they had working models of these devices back then. [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8229.26s)]
*  So he thinks it's possible. [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8233.66s)]
*  You know, he's not a, I know this is true. [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8236.06s)]
*  He thinks it's possible that it is both United States government, [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8238.46s)]
*  secret projects that people are seeing. [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8242.3s)]
*  And there's probably quite a few of them. [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8243.9s)]
*  We actually pulled a few of them up and showed some of them that look like UFOs that probably [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8245.1s)]
*  is part of what people are seeing. [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8250.62s)]
*  But he thinks is also probable that there's some other things. [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8252.7s)]
*  And these other things could be from anywhere. [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8256.94s)]
*  And then there's just the Fermi paradox. [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8259.02s)]
*  Like if they're all out there, where are they? [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8260.78s)]
*  There's so many planets or so many galaxies. [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8262.62s)]
*  Well, that's, that's gotta be the case. [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8265.26s)]
*  It has to be the case. [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8267.5s)]
*  It's the question of whether or not they have visited or whether or not they're here. [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8268.460000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8272.460000000001s)]
*  And then there's just like weird Peruvian mummies that we went over, [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8273.26s)]
*  these Tridactyl mummies that they take cat scans of and you see the tissue and the bones and, [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8276.7s)]
*  you know, they were all found in what is it called? [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8284.300000000001s)]
*  What's the kind of earth that they found that these things are? [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8287.980000000001s)]
*  Die something. [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8292.220000000001s)]
*  Do you remember what it is? [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8295.18s)]
*  Where they were all dried out. [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8296.380000000001s)]
*  I know exactly what you're, the description, but I don't remember the word. [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8297.42s)]
*  Something earth. [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8300.86s)]
*  I know the word. [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8302.3s)]
*  I can't. [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8303.26s)]
*  It's, it's escaping me right now. [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8303.74s)]
*  All this stuff's very fascinating. [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8305.82s)]
*  So fascinating. [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8307.26s)]
*  Ancient depictions on cave walls of these things. [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8308.14s)]
*  And we pulled up these tapestries or a thousand years old that had these three fingered creatures. [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8311.5s)]
*  Very weird, very weird. [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8317.02s)]
*  But that doesn't necessarily doesn't mean they're alien. [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8318.38s)]
*  Right. [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8321.42s)]
*  You know, we talked to, we talked rather about all the various versions of human beings that [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8321.58s)]
*  they're finding now, you know, from Denisovans to the Island of Flores, Hobbit people. [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8327.74s)]
*  There's a weird variety of humans that went extinct. [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8334.539999999999s)]
*  Right. [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8337.1s)]
*  And these Tridactyl things could very well have been that. [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8337.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8341.26s)]
*  You had, it was Christopher Melanon, right? [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8341.42s)]
*  And I, that was my favorite one because he had, I think I, I don't want to butcher it, [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8343.58s)]
*  but I think he called it ultra terrestrial. [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8347.58s)]
*  It makes the most sense, which is think about right now, if you just dropped the bottle in [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8349.18s)]
*  the ocean, right? [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8353.42s)]
*  What are the odds you ever run into that bottle in the ocean? [[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8354.46s)]
*  It's impossible. [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8356.94s)]
*  That's what time is. [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8357.58s)]
*  If we've been around for 13 billion years, sure, there's aliens, but how do you, we've [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8359.18s)]
*  only been around for a few thousand. [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8363.82s)]
*  Like it's such an infant, it's a grain of sand in the whole beach. [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8365.1s)]
*  So what if you, what would you do right now? [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8369.42s)]
*  If we had technology a thousand years from now, 2000 years from now, right? [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8371.9s)]
*  AI multiply it out, the whole nine. [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8375.42s)]
*  What would you do? [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8377.98s)]
*  You'd send these things everywhere. [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8379.02s)]
*  Sure. [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8380.7s)]
*  Just like sci-fi and you'd plant them and you'd come out every now and again and check what's up. [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8380.94s)]
*  Sure. [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8384.78s)]
*  So that's, I don't, I don't, my likeliest thing is I don't think there's any biological [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8385.34s)]
*  beings or aliens. [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8389.42s)]
*  I think you've just got automated drones in essence that are running patterns that have [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8390.22s)]
*  some sort of a, like, I don't know, that makes way more sense. [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8394.3s)]
*  It certainly could be that. [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8396.94s)]
*  I mean, that's what we're doing currently on Mars. [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8397.9s)]
*  Right. [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8399.9s)]
*  And it's what we do with, you know, probes, you know, with James Webb telescope, a lot [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8400.460000000001s)]
*  of different things that we use. [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8405.82s)]
*  We just send a machine out and get information from them. [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8407.34s)]
*  And then also I think at a certain point in time, we're being realistic about what we're [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8410.22s)]
*  doing right now. [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8414.3s)]
*  We're going to have biological beings and then we're going to have some kind of digital [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8414.939999999999s)]
*  being. [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8419.82s)]
*  We're going to have some sort of a, whether it's, whether it's an actual physical robot [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8420.06s)]
*  or whether it's just an artificial intelligence. [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8425.66s)]
*  That's a signal that we can send and, you know, it has enough compressed information [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8428.38s)]
*  where it can compute and calculate and do it. [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8432.619999999999s)]
*  It's a technology beyond our wildest wildest dreams is a thousand years away from that. [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8434.859999999999s)]
*  Right. [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8441.179999999998s)]
*  A thousand years away, we have a God. [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8441.66s)]
*  Right. [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8443.66s)]
*  So what would if you extrapolate where we're at now with quantum computing and the ability [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8443.98s)]
*  to calculate things that if you turn the entire universe, every molecule of the universe into [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8449.34s)]
*  a computer, it would take you so much time, according to Mark Andreessen, that the universe [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8454.939999999999s)]
*  would die of heat death before it could solve an equation that a quantum computer can solve [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8459.5s)]
*  in minutes. [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8465.66s)]
*  Right. [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8466.22s)]
*  This is, we're talking about nuts. [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8466.699999999999s)]
*  No, it's crazy. [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8468.46s)]
*  And this is just 2025 stuff. [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8469.26s)]
*  You know, if you looked at the internet from 1994, it's like archaic 14 form modem. [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8471.66s)]
*  I remember it. [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8478.619999999999s)]
*  I remember it. [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8479.26s)]
*  I'm that generation. [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8479.9s)]
*  You know, that's 31 years ago. [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8480.86s)]
*  So like, what are we talking about when we're dealing with 31,000 years? [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8482.38s)]
*  So conceivably a life form has existed and gone through the same stages as us without [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8486.46s)]
*  catastrophes, without nuclear war, without all the things that could trip us up. [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8491.18s)]
*  We could be dealing with things that are beyond our imagination, [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8495.98s)]
*  literally beyond our imagination. [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8500.94s)]
*  And they're probably around us all the time. [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8502.54s)]
*  I had an idea that I wondered. [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8505.42s)]
*  I've always thought, what if ideas are life forms? [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8507.18s)]
*  Right. [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8510.62s)]
*  Because we think of life as being it has to breathe, it has to have cells, it has to, [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8511.42s)]
*  but everything in this room and everything in this city and everything on this planet [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8516.380000000001s)]
*  that's a manmade physical object came out of an idea. [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8521.82s)]
*  And the ideas compound upon each other. [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8526.060000000001s)]
*  The more people working on these ideas, the more competition, the more the ideas will [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8528.46s)]
*  flourish and the more the ideas will be more complex and more efficient versions of this idea. [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8532.3s)]
*  But it has to start as a creative thought inside someone's head and either a creative [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8540.939999999999s)]
*  thought that you can apply to existing creative thoughts or a completely unique one like Francis [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8545.5s)]
*  Crick or when they're figuring out certain aspects of biology or certain aspects of [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8550.38s)]
*  quantum field, whatever they're doing that's a breakthrough thing. [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8556.46s)]
*  Where is that coming from? [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8560.22s)]
*  It's coming from an idea. [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8561.34s)]
*  And then these ideas, they manifest itself in physical form through human labor. [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8564.22s)]
*  Well, it's Schrodinger's cat, right? [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8569.5s)]
*  Does it happen if you don't observe it? [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8570.94s)]
*  That's the weird thing about quantum physics, right? [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8573.5s)]
*  It's completely, you can't imagine it, but if you don't open that box, nothing's happened yet. [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8575.18s)]
*  It hasn't happened until you observe it. [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8581.26s)]
*  They prove that. [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8583.74s)]
*  Well, that's what it gets really weird, you know, when people, [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8584.46s)]
*  there's a lot of people that are deciding now that to approach it, [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8589.179999999998s)]
*  approach it as if consciousness is the reason these things exist, [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8594.14s)]
*  not consciousness is seeing that these things exist, [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8598.3s)]
*  that they only exist when you're interacting with them, which is like, what? [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8601.019999999999s)]
*  Some of the stuff when you read that, like I've read books about string theory, [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8607.98s)]
*  about quantum physics, it's just, they're too, it's too hard to process in the real world. [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8610.54s)]
*  When you're at the table, but the table is actually empty space. [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8616.220000000001s)]
*  There's almost nothing in it solid. [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8619.660000000002s)]
*  Every atom, I don't even know what the numbers are, like Neil deCrest Tyson, [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8621.580000000002s)]
*  but how small is the nucleus and the actual physical items out of it? [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8625.820000000002s)]
*  They're empty. [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8629.660000000002s)]
*  Everything's empty. [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8630.380000000001s)]
*  Everything's empty. [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8631.34s)]
*  And then you get to subatomic and you're like, okay, well now this is just pure wizardry. [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8632.140000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8636.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8637.18s)]
*  They exist and they don't exist. [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8638.220000000001s)]
*  This is something Michael Jackson said about ideas. [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8639.66s)]
*  Start like right here. [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8643.02s)]
*  Philip says we went and met with Michael and Kenny said, Michael, you've got to stop. [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8645.42s)]
*  We've got an incredible show. [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8649.66s)]
*  We don't need any more vignettes. [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8650.86s)]
*  Michael said, but Kenny, God channels this through me at night. [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8653.02s)]
*  I can't sleep because I'm so supercharged. [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8656.7s)]
*  Kenny said, but Michael, we have to finish. [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8658.7s)]
*  Can't God take a vacation without missing a beat? [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8661.02s)]
*  Michael said, you don't understand. [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8663.42s)]
*  If I'm not there to receive these ideas, God might give them to Prince. [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8665.42s)]
*  Incredible. [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8670.62s)]
*  Just an incredible. [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8671.9s)]
*  Michael slept one night and that's why purple rain exists. [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8672.94s)]
*  Did you know that? [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8675.26s)]
*  Little red Corvette was going to have a totally different meeting with Michael Jackson. [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8677.34s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8680.38s)]
*  Too soon. [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8681.5s)]
*  God might give them to Prince. [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8682.14s)]
*  Wow. [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8684.78s)]
*  Wow. [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8686.54s)]
*  Well, songs are interesting like that. [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8686.94s)]
*  You know, I met last year, I was in Sweden. [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8688.86s)]
*  I did this conference. [[02:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8690.94s)]
*  Brilliant Minds. [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8691.66s)]
*  Amazing. [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8692.3s)]
*  And I met Max Martin. [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8692.94s)]
*  Do you know who that is? [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8694.22s)]
*  Max Martin is, you should look this up, how many hits he has. [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8695.9s)]
*  So Max Martin has, I think more number one hits than anyone but Paul McCartney. [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8699.34s)]
*  Check that if I'm right. [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8703.98s)]
*  But I got there. [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8705.18s)]
*  There's so many interesting people. [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8705.9s)]
*  It was an amazing conference. [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8707.26s)]
*  And I was ready to geek out with him because I'm just so curious. [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8708.54s)]
*  It's the creative, like how does somebody come up with something is fascinating to me. [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8711.82s)]
*  And one of his recent songs was Blinding Lights by The Weeknd. [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8715.66s)]
*  I want such a massive hit. [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8719.9s)]
*  And I just, I love that song. [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8721.18s)]
*  And I just like, it's like perfect. [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8722.3s)]
*  Sounds like a movie track in my mind. [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8724.06s)]
*  And how did you do that? [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8725.98s)]
*  Like how, you know, where did you start? [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8727.34s)]
*  Did you guys have a beat? [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8728.779999999999s)]
*  Did you know the lyrics? [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8729.58s)]
*  Like, I'm just so curious. [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8730.38s)]
*  How does that happen? [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8731.179999999998s)]
*  Is it like in 10 minutes? [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8732.14s)]
*  Is it months? [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8733.66s)]
*  And he just walked me through like he had a vision. [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8734.859999999999s)]
*  We have this, we have like all this stuff that we sit down. [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8737.82s)]
*  And then the first, the music, then I'm like just wow. [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8739.98s)]
*  It's so amazing to create something like that, that a billion people now listen to. [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8742.619999999999s)]
*  Number one in every country in the world. [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8747.58s)]
*  How do you manufacture something so kind of perfect that everyone in the world likes it? [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8749.5s)]
*  And is there a format you know it's going to be the hit before it is the hit? [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8755.900000000001s)]
*  That to me is the most like how many bands get stuck for the rest of their life playing a song [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8758.94s)]
*  that they fricking hate that they didn't know was going to be there. [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8763.900000000001s)]
*  Especially if you're a one hit wonder. [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8767.02s)]
*  You're like dead in the eyes. [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8769.1s)]
*  You're like, I got to play this again. [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8770.140000000001s)]
*  Come on, Eileen. [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8773.18s)]
*  Like you better love that song. [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8774.060000000001s)]
*  You love a song and the artist doesn't want to sing it anymore. [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8775.5s)]
*  Oh, and then they start singing in a different way at a concert. [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8778.46s)]
*  And you're like why are you doing this weird acapella, bro? [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8782.3s)]
*  I want to hear like the radio. [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8785.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's interesting. [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8786.939999999999s)]
*  That's kind of the difference though between musicians and anybody else. [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8789.019999999999s)]
*  Because musicians you want to hear the same thing over and over again. [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8791.98s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8794.939999999999s)]
*  I have that a little bit where if I get clients who book me over and over, [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8795.82s)]
*  I say to them do you want me to do something different because it's like jokes. [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8800.3s)]
*  Right. [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8803.099999999999s)]
*  You know, it's like I've seen Gaffigan, you can do Hot Pockets. [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8803.34s)]
*  Like people call it out and I want to hear it. [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8806.14s)]
*  But you know the punch line. [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8807.9s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8809.1s)]
*  Something that especially you're known for. [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8809.58s)]
*  So I found that if I did a completely different show, [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8811.1s)]
*  people are kind of mad. [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8813.9s)]
*  Like I don't have exit surveys, but like I kind of listen in and see what's going on. [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8814.859999999999s)]
*  I wish he did that one. [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8819.02s)]
*  Bon Jovi has got to do Living on a Prayer at every gig or people are pissed. [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8820.779999999999s)]
*  For me, I need at least two of the things to be the same [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8825.1s)]
*  because people want to see if they can catch it the second time. [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8829.1s)]
*  Got it. [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8832.14s)]
*  So there's a level of they heard about it and they're like, [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8832.46s)]
*  oh, you got to do that thing with the thing. [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8834.94s)]
*  And so if I do everything new, yeah, they're kind of happy, [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8837.74s)]
*  but they still want a greatest hit. [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8840.54s)]
*  And it took me years to learn that because I used to be like, [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8842.62s)]
*  oh, I can't do the same thing. [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8844.460000000001s)]
*  I got to be unique. [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8846.140000000001s)]
*  And then I learned that that's not better. [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8847.74s)]
*  You know, I was just thinking like mentalists would be the best police interrogators. [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8849.900000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8854.380000000001s)]
*  Minority report style. [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8855.18s)]
*  Right. [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8856.62s)]
*  Don't you think? [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8858.060000000001s)]
*  Like if someone but don't you think of a police interrogator [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8859.02s)]
*  learn the skills of being a mentalist? [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8861.980000000001s)]
*  I think they could. [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8864.7s)]
*  But again, it's the best analogy that I can give you is a director holding the camera. [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8865.820000000002s)]
*  I'm always holding the camera and pointing at what I want. [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8872.380000000001s)]
*  Does that make sense? [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8875.26s)]
*  What police interrogators going to say? [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8876.62s)]
*  Okay, to the perp, think of where you were that night. [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8878.060000000001s)]
*  Look this way. [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8880.460000000001s)]
*  Look that way. [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8881.02s)]
*  Do you like you? [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8881.58s)]
*  They're not going to do all that stuff. [[02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8882.060000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8883.26s)]
*  This is done when it's done under the guise of entertainment. [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8883.66s)]
*  And if they do do that, you're kind of leading the witness. [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8886.300000000001s)]
*  You could lead whatever people are going to. [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8888.7s)]
*  It's not a show. [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8891.58s)]
*  So you're not going to have a willing participant. [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8892.54s)]
*  You can't be hypnotized against your will. [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8895.18s)]
*  Most stage hypnotists, they do compliance testing first. [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8898.380000000001s)]
*  Do you know what I mean by that? [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8901.740000000002s)]
*  They have everyone in the audience hold your hands together and imagine in like, [[02:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8902.54s)]
*  who can't get their hands apart? [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8906.62s)]
*  And the person who goes like this right away, they're like, I'm not bringing them on stage. [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8907.580000000002s)]
*  Right. [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8909.980000000001s)]
*  They're not doing anything. [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8910.460000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8911.660000000002s)]
*  You have to be able to be hypnotized. [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8912.060000000001s)]
*  You have to be suggestible. [[02:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8914.140000000001s)]
*  Mine isn't necessarily suggestible, but mine is a maze where every time you hit a roadblock, [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8915.820000000002s)]
*  I'm moving you around until I get you to the spot where you go through. [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8922.3s)]
*  And so that's why you asked me why I didn't do this. [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8925.74s)]
*  It wasn't going to work. [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8927.34s)]
*  I knew it wouldn't. [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8928.14s)]
*  I have more things planned than you know right now. [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8928.859999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8931.82s)]
*  I've been thinking about this for a while, but I'm not going to do them all. [[02:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8932.14s)]
*  Okay. [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8935.179999999998s)]
*  Because again, how you structure and act, you leave the best for last. [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8935.58s)]
*  Got it. [[02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8938.22s)]
*  You never leave here doing the best in the middle. [[02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8938.38s)]
*  Well, we're going down the home stretch. [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8939.66s)]
*  Are we home stretched? [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8941.259999999998s)]
*  Are we at the final moment? [[02:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8942.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8943.34s)]
*  We're almost at three hours. [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8943.66s)]
*  So, wow, this goes fast, huh? [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8945.42s)]
*  Flew by. [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8947.34s)]
*  Remember when you asked me did I wake up early or late? [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8948.539999999999s)]
*  Right. [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8951.9s)]
*  The only thing I got wrong. [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8952.06s)]
*  Right. [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8953.18s)]
*  Right? [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8953.74s)]
*  Except, well, he said the vowel, but he thought of melody, but either why was that, [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8953.98s)]
*  you know what I mean? [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8957.98s)]
*  That was a little bit tricky because A-E-I-O-U. [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8958.38s)]
*  Anyway, it doesn't matter. [[02:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8960.46s)]
*  Here's what I want to do. [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8962.06s)]
*  You said 50-50 coin flip. [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8963.26s)]
*  Okay. [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8965.5s)]
*  And I brought one. [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8965.82s)]
*  You said who has coins? [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8967.26s)]
*  What do we got here? [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8968.46s)]
*  A coin. [[02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8969.82s)]
*  What is it? [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8970.619999999999s)]
*  Candy half, right? [[02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8972.859999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8973.98s)]
*  All right. [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8974.38s)]
*  Let's go. [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8974.699999999999s)]
*  I feel like one is not exciting enough. [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8975.98s)]
*  That's like a football game. [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8977.9s)]
*  Here's what I do. [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8980.06s)]
*  I don't know if you can see me from over there. [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8980.78s)]
*  Let's do three tosses. [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8983.02s)]
*  Okay. [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8984.140000000001s)]
*  Statistically, how many we get right? [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8984.78s)]
*  Two. [[02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8988.060000000001s)]
*  One and a half. [[02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8988.94s)]
*  All right. [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8989.58s)]
*  Either way. [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8989.820000000002s)]
*  Call it in the air. [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8990.62s)]
*  Okay. [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8991.42s)]
*  Can you see me? [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8991.58s)]
*  The table's real busy. [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8992.94s)]
*  Okay. [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8993.980000000001s)]
*  Call it in the air. [[02:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8994.460000000001s)]
*  Tails. [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8995.42s)]
*  You going tails? [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8995.820000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8996.62s)]
*  What do we get? [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8997.02s)]
*  Heads. [[02:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8998.140000000001s)]
*  All right. [[02:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8998.62s)]
*  Okay. [[02:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8998.86s)]
*  All right. [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=8999.02s)]
*  Whatever. [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9000.060000000001s)]
*  O for one. [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9000.7s)]
*  Okay. [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9001.42s)]
*  You felt good about it when you did it? [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9001.66s)]
*  No. [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9003.18s)]
*  Okay. [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9003.58s)]
*  I just took a lot of guess. [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9003.820000000002s)]
*  Should I really put it in my head? [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9005.18s)]
*  No. [[02:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9006.78s)]
*  Do what I mean. [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9007.02s)]
*  It's a coin flip. [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9007.5s)]
*  It's not a trick. [[02:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9008.140000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9009.1s)]
*  Now it gets in your head because you guessed it and you're like, [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9009.98s)]
*  it didn't work the first time, but nobody cares. [[02:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9013.02s)]
*  There's nothing riding on this. [[02:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9014.78s)]
*  Right. [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9015.66s)]
*  You ready? [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9016.140000000001s)]
*  Call it in the air. [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9016.54s)]
*  What are you going with? [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9017.02s)]
*  Tails. [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9017.82s)]
*  You're going tails again? [[02:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9018.220000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9019.18s)]
*  You're going tails again? [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9019.66s)]
*  Yep. [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9020.62s)]
*  I can't. [[02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9021.5s)]
*  That time I would never change. [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9022.62s)]
*  It's heads. [[02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9024.140000000001s)]
*  O for two. [[02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9024.54s)]
*  All right. [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9026.06s)]
*  Third try is charm. [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9026.94s)]
*  Okay. [[02:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9027.98s)]
*  You think you got it? [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9028.300000000001s)]
*  Yep. [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9029.1s)]
*  What are the odds on that? [[02:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9032.300000000001s)]
*  So this has got to be your shot. [[02:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9033.1s)]
*  Call it. [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9035.5s)]
*  Tails. [[02:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9036.06s)]
*  Tails? [[02:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9036.86s)]
*  I always go tails never fails. [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9037.26s)]
*  What do we get Joe? [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9038.46s)]
*  You're O for three. [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9039.419999999998s)]
*  Heads again. [[02:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9040.699999999999s)]
*  You're O for three. [[02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9041.339999999998s)]
*  You done? [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9042.46s)]
*  Nope. [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9043.339999999998s)]
*  You want one more? [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9044.38s)]
*  Sure. [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9045.179999999998s)]
*  You insist? [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9045.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9046.14s)]
*  All right. [[02:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9046.699999999999s)]
*  You're not done. [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9047.259999999998s)]
*  I said three. [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9047.82s)]
*  Okay. [[02:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9048.779999999999s)]
*  Should I go over here? [[02:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9049.179999999998s)]
*  Has that envelope been there the whole time? [[02:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9049.98s)]
*  This envelope? [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9052.06s)]
*  Yes. [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9052.779999999999s)]
*  We sealed this. [[02:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9053.179999999998s)]
*  Right. [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9054.22s)]
*  The moment I arrived at this studio. [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9054.699999999999s)]
*  Right. [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9056.38s)]
*  Okay. [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9057.099999999999s)]
*  You're going to get it this time just for the record. [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9057.419999999998s)]
*  Okay. [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9058.779999999999s)]
*  Call it. [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9060.699999999999s)]
*  Tails. [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9060.859999999999s)]
*  Tails? [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9061.419999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9062.06s)]
*  Fuck. [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9063.019999999999s)]
*  O for four. [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9063.5s)]
*  Are you doing this? [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9064.539999999999s)]
*  I'm not doing anything. [[02:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9065.419999999998s)]
*  You're not making it land on heads? [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9066.38s)]
*  O for four. [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9067.82s)]
*  Do you know how to do it? [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9068.38s)]
*  Like do you have a method? [[02:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9069.42s)]
*  Call it. [[02:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9070.94s)]
*  Call whatever you want. [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9071.9s)]
*  Tails. [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9072.86s)]
*  Did I do it? [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9074.14s)]
*  You said it with... [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9074.699999999999s)]
*  What is it? [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9075.42s)]
*  It's heads. [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9076.06s)]
*  But that didn't count. [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9077.02s)]
*  That's five in a row. [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9078.06s)]
*  You're just bad luck. [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9079.26s)]
*  Is that five in a row? [[02:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9080.06s)]
*  Five heads in a row? [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9081.1s)]
*  That seems odd. [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9082.14s)]
*  Let's try one more. [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9082.86s)]
*  Do it yourself. [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9084.699999999999s)]
*  Do it yourself. [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9085.9s)]
*  Double check what, Jimmy? [[02:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9086.38s)]
*  Double check there's still tails on there. [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9087.02s)]
*  There's still tails. [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9088.3s)]
*  Okay. [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9088.86s)]
*  Just checking. [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9089.02s)]
*  But this doesn't count because this one's yours. [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9089.66s)]
*  Whoops. [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9091.5s)]
*  That was very clumsy of me. [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9094.38s)]
*  Put it anyway. [[02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9098.699999999999s)]
*  Do it on the table. [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9099.1s)]
*  I just didn't have room on the table. [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9099.74s)]
*  It's tails. [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9101.5s)]
*  But did you guess tails? [[02:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9102.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9103.42s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9103.9s)]
*  I just kept going. [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9104.22s)]
*  I feel like it's got to be tails eventually. [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9104.779999999999s)]
*  It's not a trick. [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9105.82s)]
*  It's statistical. [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9106.619999999999s)]
*  All right. [[02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9108.06s)]
*  But statistically five in a row of heads, it seems odd. [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9109.02s)]
*  I said to you, I hope everyone stayed along for this journey. [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9111.5s)]
*  I said this is your future. [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9114.06s)]
*  This is my future. [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9115.42s)]
*  Right? [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9116.06s)]
*  But I lied. [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9116.38s)]
*  Past, present, and future. [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9117.9s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9119.74s)]
*  Now hold on. [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9120.22s)]
*  I'm going to come over there. [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9120.46s)]
*  That's a lot. [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9121.02s)]
*  Open it up. [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9121.26s)]
*  You'll see what I mean. [[02:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9122.06s)]
*  But I don't want you to open it. [[02:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9122.699999999999s)]
*  Open it up. [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9123.66s)]
*  There's two things in there. [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9124.779999999999s)]
*  Now freeze right there. [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9127.099999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[02:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9128.22s)]
*  Show us what you have. [[02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9129.66s)]
*  Two envelopes. [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9130.779999999999s)]
*  Well, one's not an envelope. [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9131.82s)]
*  Well, one's a folded piece of paper. [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9133.099999999999s)]
*  Folded piece of paper. [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9134.14s)]
*  And one is a manila envelope. [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9135.099999999999s)]
*  Is it all right if I come over? [[02:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9136.859999999999s)]
*  Is it taped everywhere? [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9138.46s)]
*  Yes, taped everywhere. [[02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9139.42s)]
*  Okay. [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9140.3s)]
*  So I'm coming over. [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9140.939999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9141.98s)]
*  You want to do it? [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9146.779999999999s)]
*  Can you guys hear me? [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9147.74s)]
*  We're going to open it. [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9148.859999999999s)]
*  Where am I? [[02:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9149.66s)]
*  Is the camera here? [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9150.14s)]
*  This is Mike, but I have the... [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9150.779999999999s)]
*  There's a camera over there. [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9152.38s)]
*  Okay. [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9153.98s)]
*  You tell me. [[02:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9154.3s)]
*  Okay. [[02:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9154.94s)]
*  I'll go around you. [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9155.26s)]
*  I just want to make sure you can see this. [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9155.82s)]
*  All right. [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9158.22s)]
*  Joe, look inside. [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9158.78s)]
*  Okay. [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9161.02s)]
*  I want you to look inside. [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9161.66s)]
*  And before you grab it... [[02:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9162.54s)]
*  No, no, no. [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9163.26s)]
*  Look, look, look, look, look. [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9163.66s)]
*  Okay, I'm looking. [[02:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9164.62s)]
*  And tell me. [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9165.1s)]
*  You see it says two words. [[02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9166.14s)]
*  Can I turn this around? [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9167.34s)]
*  It says Joe Rogan will... [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9167.98s)]
*  It says Joe Rogan. [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9169.1s)]
*  And I don't want to touch. [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9169.98s)]
*  Will you do it? [[02:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9170.62s)]
*  I don't want to touch. [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9171.02s)]
*  Grab that one. [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9171.42s)]
*  That pink one out. [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9171.82s)]
*  Okay. [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9172.460000000001s)]
*  And read to us. [[02:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9173.74s)]
*  Grab that. [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9174.78s)]
*  That's your pass. [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9175.1s)]
*  Hold on to this. [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9175.74s)]
*  Okay. [[02:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9176.54s)]
*  Read out loud. [[02:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9176.94s)]
*  That's been in there from before we started. [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9177.98s)]
*  It says Joe Rogan will get three coin flips in a row wrong, [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9180.619999999999s)]
*  insist on doing one more, [[02:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9184.06s)]
*  and then get that one wrong too. [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9185.74s)]
*  The present. [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9189.5s)]
*  You can't change that. [[02:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9190.06s)]
*  The past. [[02:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9192.14s)]
*  Joe, take out what's in there. [[02:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9192.859999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[02:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9194.14s)]
*  Tell us all. [[02:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9194.539999999999s)]

*  Nobody knows the future. [[02:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9282.62s)]
*  Nobody knows the future. [[02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9283.74s)]
*  It's true. [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9284.54s)]

*  The reason you're going to talk about this for years [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYvGKBCM3Ps&t=9330.38s)]
