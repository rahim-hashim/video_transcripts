# Joe Rogan Experience #2239 - Derek, More Plates More Dates
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [December 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0mudvCm-bo)
*  So we just watched this, what is this exact job?
*  We watched this guy get assassinated.
*  Just kind of, I've seen more people assassinated and killed over the last two years on Instagram
*  than I ever have in my whole life.
*  Oh yeah, dude, the Explorer page now is a disaster.
*  Why?
*  It's just like, me and Tom Segura have this thing where we send each other the most fucked
*  up thing we find every day.
*  It's a brutal text thread.
*  But because of it, now I'm locked into this algorithm.
*  She's the CEO of their insurance unit, which I don't know what the difference is and what
*  people are, is CEO.
*  A targeted attack by a gunman waiting for him, a real assassination, 6.45 a.m. outside
*  the Hilton on Sixth Avenue, where the company's annual investor conference is about to take
*  place.
*  Yeah, man.
*  I wonder what's going on with that.
*  That's one of those things that just makes conspiracy theorists go cuckoo.
*  I'm sure there's some real good theories floating around on X right now.
*  Oh, for sure.
*  Is there?
*  It's got to be.
*  The investor meeting has now been canceled, obviously, but so that was maybe the goal.
*  What's worse, your X Explorer page or your Instagram?
*  My Instagram.
*  Oh, really?
*  Yeah.
*  I don't.
*  I just follow.
*  I mean, I follow a lot of people on both X and Instagram.
*  I don't know if it's necessarily a good thing, but when someone says something interesting
*  or they post something interesting on Instagram, I just immediately follow.
*  Let's see.
*  Let's see if this will be fun.
*  The thing about Twitter or X is that I don't interact enough to have a really fucked up
*  algorithm.
*  I'm mostly just reading stuff.
*  I don't really, hardly ever post anything.
*  I think the problem is I'll click to watch a full video of the fucked up things so that
*  it reinforces the algorithm.
*  Oh, you want to see this guy get shot or, oh, you want to see this car accident.
*  We'll give you more of those.
*  I've seen so many people get run over by cars.
*  So many people.
*  Yeah, it's crazy because a lot of the stuff I've seen in the past year I didn't even know
*  could be on the internet.
*  Right.
*  I don't know how it is when there's so many things you can't put on.
*  Do you know that there's a loophole that the ladies use to show their breasts?
*  Which one?
*  Fake boobs, fake baby.
*  Oh, no.
*  Yeah, they use a fake baby.
*  So they breastfeed.
*  So you got these girls, these big juicy melons, and they pull one out and have a rubber baby
*  and the rubber baby's sucking on the tit.
*  The baby looks so fake.
*  That's hilarious.
*  But they can get some pretty realistic fake babies.
*  Yeah.
*  What was that movie with the Sniper movie about Chris Kyle?
*  What was that called?
*  Remember there was a movie where he had a fake baby and it was so obvious.
*  He's got this rubber baby and he's holding onto his child in this stupid scene.
*  I'm pretty sure on Twitter you can just post nudity without any problems, right?
*  You can post pornography.
*  Yeah, dude, the replies to a lot of tweets that are irrelevant to porn, it'll just be
*  like, that's cool, but have you seen my pussy?
*  It'll be like some chick promoting her OnlyFans.
*  That's so common now.
*  And I just like, the discourse is like half infested at this point.
*  They had this one lady who was saying she made $40 million this year on OnlyFans.
*  Oh yeah, that's nuts.
*  $40 million.
*  And she's a virgin, I guess, and she doesn't post back stuff.
*  Sure, sure she's a virgin.
*  Sure.
*  She's a 23-year-old big-titted virgin, the only one that exists in the whole world.
*  See, that's an interesting scenario, if true, because it's like a lot of dudes want to be
*  want to shit on these chicks for being like prostitutes essentially.
*  Right.
*  But like, if she was actually a virgin and she's posting almost nude but not quite, but
*  making a bunch of money off it, there's like two contradictory things going on right now.
*  Yeah, she wins.
*  But the problem is, I don't want to tell anybody not to do anything.
*  Ladies, you do what you want, you do you.
*  If I was a young pretty girl, I'd probably be on OnlyFans.
*  I'd probably make some money.
*  Fuck it.
*  Why would I want to be a waitress when I could just show my tits?
*  That's how I would look at it.
*  The problem is twofold.
*  One, you become addicted to an extraordinary amount of money if you're successful at it.
*  So there's like a scale of people on the OnlyFans apparently.
*  Most of the OnlyFans, we talked about this, right?
*  Most of the gals don't make that much money.
*  Most of them.
*  Yeah, I mean, what's that much?
*  Six figures or millions?
*  No, like even less.
*  Like most of them make a few thousand dollars a month.
*  I think so.
*  I think out of this 43, one guy paid her five million, she said.
*  Dude, that's insane.
*  It would suck too, if you went full board and you did like actual porn and just got like banged on camera just for thinking you're going to become a multimillionaire and then you still are like.
*  You would have to get banged on camera a lot for years to really develop a fan base.
*  And you have to do a really good job like every time.
*  Super enthusiastic.
*  But my point is like you're not going to like most beautiful young women want a high value man as a husband.
*  If let's say they're heterosexual, let's just assume they want to get married.
*  If they do want to get married, they do want a relationship.
*  You're not going to get a high value man, especially if you're making if you're making millions of dollars a year doing this.
*  You're going to want a guy who makes millions of dollars a year.
*  Right. You're not going to want a guy who makes less than you.
*  You're probably used to buying fucking Louis Vuitton this and that.
*  And you're used to all this shit.
*  So you're probably you're wealthy.
*  Right. So you're already your dating pools smaller because you're probably not interested in a guy who makes one hundred thousand dollars a year like a regular guy to you is like what is he going to do?
*  He can't even take me anywhere.
*  This is bull.
*  I'm going to pay for our vacation to fuck out of here.
*  Right.
*  You've already like cut like regular guys out.
*  So now you have a very small pool of men that you can date.
*  And then out of that pool, how many of them are going to accept the fact that you're doing this?
*  Now you have an even smaller pool.
*  So some guys will accept it.
*  But for how long?
*  Like if you get real serious, you get married and then you're still showing your asshole to everybody.
*  That's you know, you're in.
*  But you're addicted to that money.
*  Like, are you going to pick a relationship over this guy who may or may not be DMing his ex-girlfriend?
*  You know, like you're throw it all away and throw away this 40 million dollar a year empire you've created.
*  Or are you trapped in that essentially forever?
*  Yeah, it's it's interesting.
*  The thresholds, though, too, of where they become successful for what they're doing, because it seems like some of them don't have to show their asshole.
*  They just they just post like thirst trap.
*  Fitness girl type content almost.
*  And people pay for that?
*  I think so.
*  Why would they pay for that when there's so much of that for free on Instagram?
*  I know that's like the common question.
*  And my search page on Instagram is all butts.
*  I assume it's something to do with like you follow this person and like you get a bigger hit of dopamine probably from being able to
*  potentially see more revealing something from somebody that you are like a fan of already interaction.
*  That I think is a big component, too, because it's like I think half the income is like DMs.
*  Everyone's talking about how AI is going to change the world.
*  But what if that's not always a good thing?
*  What happens if insurance companies use it to jack up your premiums based on your WebMD history?
*  What happens if HR departments use it to make hiring decisions based on your browsing history?
*  What happens if politicians use it to sway your vote based on your online activity?
*  I'll tell you what will happen.

*  There was some Google guy, some executive at Google that was warning about what's going to happen with AI girlfriends,
*  with these sort of indistinguishable AI girlfriends that are going to interact with guys,
*  and how this is going to create profound loneliness and all sorts of real problems.
*  Yeah, I imagine so.
*  I imagine a lot of the DM conversations are probably AI chat GPT already.
*  100%.
*  Or you got some Andrew Tate type deal.
*  There's a bunch of dudes who are like pounding on the keyboard where the girl shows her tits, which is what he did for years.
*  Innovator.
*  Yeah, and the curve.
*  Yeah, you're going to not have any idea whether it's even a real person, right?
*  Because there's a bunch of AI-generated girlfriends or girls, rather, that have OnlyFans where they don't even exist.
*  They're not even a physical being.
*  Yeah, there's some pretty big Instagram pages, I think, that are just like fake.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Yeah, and it's just like even I think they're owned by entities like companies that have like an army of AI chicks.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Which is crazy.
*  And they generate a lot of money.
*  I've seen the comments section on a couple of them too, and shockingly, well, maybe not, I don't know.
*  But there's a lot of people that are engaging with it like it's a real person.
*  And I thought it was pretty obvious it was AI, but I mean, like some people are pretty stupid.
*  Well, there's a high percentage of people in this country that have a below 85 IQ.
*  Like a real good percentage. Isn't it like 15 or 20 percent? Is it something nutty like that?
*  Yeah, it's like the same amount of people that are like above that are going to be below.
*  It's like a standard deviation of like averages and stats.
*  Yeah, there's people that are about as smart as a Labrador.
*  They just can talk. Then you can trick them.
*  Yeah, you know, and if you can get those dumbasses that work at Subway to donate five dollars a month and you get enough of them.
*  Have you seen the UFC collab with that only fans?
*  No, there's a UFC collab. Yeah, only fans check.
*  Pull it up. What is this?
*  So there's this girl who to spark outrage and get engagement.
*  She breaks like exotic cars.
*  She'll stand on a Lambo and just smash the windshield or something.
*  And just like shake her ass. And then it gets tons of views.
*  And there's a bunch of guys freaking out because she's disrespecting a nice piece of machinery or whatever.
*  But at the end of the day, she gets views from it and then more people go to her page and sign up to it.
*  But how much is a Lambo worth? Like Lambos are like half a million dollars, right?
*  She'll smash like the windshield only or like a window from like the driver's side and then do some like call to action or something.
*  Wow. Like pull up the UFC one. You'll be able to tell what I'm talking about better.
*  I know the girl you're talking about, but I don't. I didn't know she did something with the UFC.
*  Yeah, Dana White like posted it.
*  What? He's like, check this shit out.
*  What? Yeah.
*  Unless they un- Is it on the UFC Instagram?
*  Yeah, it was like a collaboration I saw a few days ago.
*  Okay. What?
*  They're giving away a McLaren or something for the next UFC event, I think.
*  And she's the one who's talking about it after smashing the window of a Lambo.
*  What? Yeah.
*  Really?
*  I thought it was kind of a weird combo too.
*  This is the girl? Oh, don't do it. Don't. Is that a crowbar? Oh, what the fuck are you doing? Oh, Jesus.
*  That's why I'm giving away this McLaren 600 LT at PowerSlab for free. Check out the links in our bios on how to enter.
*  Wow.
*  Wow, we're the dumbest fucking race.
*  What are the accounts that collabed with it? It was UFC, right?
*  Yeah, it was for PowerSlab event.
*  Of course it's for PowerSlab. That's just as dumb. We are the dumbest motherfuckers that have ever lived. We really are.
*  What do you think about PowerSlab?
*  I don't. I don't. I don't get it. I've watched it a ton of times on like little Instagram reels.
*  You know, when it shows up, I watch guys get KO'd. I would never advise anybody to do it.
*  I don't care how good you are getting slapped. I don't care how good you are at slapping people.
*  For me, the whole idea of fighting is to hit and not get hit. The whole idea is the skill. It's like you impose your skill set.
*  It's like a human chess game. That's the opposite. You're just standing in front of each other, whacking each other in the face.
*  But I will watch. So if people want to do it, that's your jam. You know, if you're some giant fat guy.
*  We see one of those guys actually had a fight, a dirty boxing fight with Yoel Romero.
*  He's like the freaks of all freaks.
*  He's like the dirty boxing king, dude.
*  He's also super juicy now. He's a heavyweight now. So Yoel is 47.
*  So he was competing under pretty rigorous testing with UFC as far as like, you know, I'm sure you would disagree.
*  But look what he looks like now. We could talk about that later. Yeah, definitely. This is Yoel now.
*  He smashes this guy. Look at the size of him. This is not a good video, Jamie. Find another video of it.
*  There's the actual video of it from the fight event. That's like someone's camera from the side view.
*  But he's huge. Yoel's like 220 now, 225 maybe. He's fucking massive.
*  He used to suck down to 185. And then what would he walk in at though? I think like two.
*  Well, when he would weigh 185, this is back when Yoel was fighting, there was actual weigh ins.
*  Yeah. You know, so right now there's actual weigh ins, but it's a ceremonial weigh in.
*  Like tomorrow at the UFC, I'll host the ceremonial weigh in.
*  So the fighters weighed in at like nine o'clock in the morning. The ceremonial weigh in is at 5 p.m.
*  They've had the entire day to rehydrate. So Yoel back in those days was 185 when you weighed in at 5 p.m.
*  at 185. And you couldn't believe he was 185 because I would be like 200 pounds and I'd be sitting there.
*  I'm like, how? How am I bigger than you? This doesn't make it.
*  This like defies all known laws of physics and gravity. Like it doesn't make any sense.
*  He was massive. These enormous traps. He was one of the rare guys that when he would suck weight, he didn't look smaller.
*  He still looked fucking huge, man. He had like a really is really round muscle bellies.
*  So it's almost like bodybuilder esque in terms of like how much how much bigger you look just cosmetically to you.
*  So this guy that he's fighting is a slap fight guy. Look at the size of you all now.
*  He's definitely less lean. Yeah. He's less lean. He's eating whatever he wants, but he's still got a six pack.
*  But he's fucking massive, dude. So how do you end up in this league?
*  Like, what was I think this is Mike, Mike Perry's thing. I think he's putting this together.
*  He's involved with it in some way, shape or form. So you all just basically like toying with this guy.
*  This guy has literally no business, no disrespect to the man, but no business in the ring with this world class athlete.
*  Like how much do you got to get paid to go in and fight? You well, you have fifteen dollars.
*  Like watch how he hops up in the air before he decides to go. What is that about?
*  He just decides to like hop in the air. He's like enough. Let me end this. He just decides it's time to end it.
*  He's fucking huge, dude. Look at his back. Look at his back. That guy used to weigh 185.
*  And by the way, if you see the back of his neck, he has a fully fused neck.
*  If he wasn't, you know, thirty six when he entered into the UFC, that's how old he was when he first started fighting.
*  He was already past his professional prime when he first started fighting in the UFC.
*  You know, if he had gotten into MMA when he was 20, probably nobody would have ever beaten him.
*  He's the freak of all freaks when it comes to like athletic specimens. Like he's the freak.
*  Yeah. When was his last fight in the UFC? Quite a while ago. He fought Adesanya, I want to say five years ago.
*  When did he fight Israel? And I think maybe had one other fight other than that.
*  But you know, he was knocking guys dead at 40.
*  Dude, the cost of the pandemic. March 7th, 2020.
*  There you go. So that was his last fight in the UFC. So the last four years, he's been competing for Bellator.
*  And so they're a little less stringent. They don't have a USADA deal or now whatever it's called.
*  Drug Free Sport, I think they call it now. That's the new company, which is essentially the same protocols.
*  But they don't wake you up on the day of the weigh-ins or anything. USADA was gross.
*  Like they would take these guys that are dehydrated, starving themselves day before the fight, wake them up at six o'clock in the morning.
*  Did you see that article I sent you about the USADA corruption?
*  Yes. So let's talk about that.
*  Yeah. So basically, and this was like a WADA press release too. So it's not like it was some journalist or something.
*  It's like on the official WADA site. And they were basically exposing how USADA was covering up test results.
*  For which athletes?
*  Unnamed.
*  Which sports?
*  They wouldn't say. They just said like Olympic level athletes and elite athletes and kept it very vague.
*  Really?
*  And essentially they just closed what they had tested positive for.
*  And even that one of them was an Olympic caliber athlete and their entire career.
*  They got to go until retirement without getting exposed just because they helped USADA supposedly catch other people.
*  Oh, they were narcs?
*  So like, yeah. So if you help them catch people, then you could get away with using like full board testosterone.
*  No! Really?
*  Yeah.
*  Oh my God. So they're like a drug dealer that works for the government.
*  Yeah.
*  Wow.
*  And this was like one of the reasons of many why Hunter and others are very critical of USADA and are glad they're not under it anymore.
*  Well, there's a lot of stupidity with their regulations.
*  Like one of them is BBC 157, which is natural in the human body. You know, in peptides, all they're doing is helping you heal.
*  You're literally dealing with a sport where you beat the fucking shit out of each other every day in training.
*  And you're not going to like assist these people in healing.
*  Like, wouldn't that only benefit everybody?
*  There's no like fear of like harm.
*  There's no like no one's dying from BBC 157.
*  Within the code, there's a provision whereby an athlete who provides substantial assistance can subsequently apply to have a proportion of their period of ineligibility suspended.
*  Wow. Look how they phrase that.
*  What dirty language.
*  Proportion of their period of ineligibility suspended.
*  What does that mean?
*  It means you're you're allowing them to cheat.
*  However, there's a clear process for that, which does not involve allowing those who have cheated to continue to compete while they may or may not gather incriminating the environment.
*  What? Wait a minute.
*  What are you saying then?
*  So it doesn't do that.
*  They're saying it doesn't do that.
*  Well, they may or at the bottom, what is now aware of at least three cases where athletes who had committed serious anti-doping rule violations were allowed to continue to compete for years while they acted as undercover agents.
*  OK, so they pretended that they wouldn't let someone compete if they were doping, but they still did.
*  Yeah.
*  Essentially while they were on shit.
*  Wow.
*  Imagine if that's like boxing in the Olympics or something like that.
*  The athlete was allowed to line up against their unknowing competitors as if they had never cheated.
*  In that case, when you saw it eventually admitted to water that had been what had been going on, it advised that any publication of consequences or disqualification of results would put the athlete's security at risk.
*  What? And asked Wada to agree to nonpublication.
*  What?
*  Secure.
*  Were they worried about that with Lance Armstrong?
*  The fuck are you talking about?
*  Security at risk.
*  In other case of a high level athlete, you saw it and never notified Wada of its decision to lift an athlete's provisional suspension, which is an appealable decision despite being required to do so under the code.
*  Had Wada been notified, it would have never allowed this.
*  Wow.
*  Interesting.
*  It sounds like this was somewhat how they operated as if they had a high profile enough person or certain circumstances they would kind of autonomously decide, hey, if you work alongside us to catch other people because you might know something that we don't or what have you, that we'll just let you, you know, no one will know.
*  That's so dirty.
*  That's so dirty.
*  That's literally contrary to the whole reason why they exist.
*  Yeah.
*  What's really crazy is, I mean, according to the UFC.
*  So what happened was the UFC had some disputes with them and decided to sever their relationship.
*  And then you saw the like publicly said that UFC is going to allow their competitors to do steroids now, which is not the case at all.
*  Like they already had a contract in place with drug free sport.
*  I talked to the guy from drug free sport and he was essentially laying out the pro.
*  It was essentially identical.
*  No BPC 157, no testosterone growth, nothing.
*  Like you can't do anything.
*  The standards are actually much higher now to in contrast, like you said, I would claim or at least suggest that they were doing full spectrum bulletproof testing.
*  But it turned out they were almost never EPO testing.
*  The HGH testing was never really done.
*  And then also the isoform was at the isotope ratio mass spec was not really being done either.
*  Was that a like a budget thing?
*  Like it was too expensive?
*  Yeah, I believe so.
*  And also time intensive for some of these tests as well.
*  And I guess for like the number of tests they were conducting, perhaps it was too extensive or I don't really know what the exact motivation was.
*  Often you would think it comes down to budget and time.
*  But also if you have an expert who just thinks it's not warranted to go further, like the same way if you went to a doctor and you'd be like, should I test this?
*  They'll be like, oh, if we know this, like who cares?
*  It's not necessary.
*  Like I don't necessarily know.
*  They went to the depth and rigor to claim somebody did or didn't cheat.
*  I wouldn't cheat if I have preliminary data that you would exclude having to go further.
*  Sometimes you don't have to test further if there's not an atypical finding.
*  But like if they're not testing for EPO, for example, and maybe there's an event in Mexico City, right, which is 7,700 feet above sea level, that place is brutal.
*  That's where Cain Velasquez, who was known as like probably the greatest cardio heavyweight of all time, he fought Fabricio over Doom and he did not prepare properly.
*  Fabricio actually moved to the mountains above Mexico City and trained there for like four months.
*  So Fabricio speaks fluent Spanish, lived in Mexico, like he was really got ready and he beat Cain Velasquez on that night to become the champion.
*  And he had tremendous cardio and Cain was just dying.
*  That's how brutal Mexico City is.
*  So imagine when you're competing at that altitude or maybe Colorado Springs or one of these like really high altitude places, which we have events, Salt Lake City, and you don't test for EPO.
*  Yeah, that's crazy.
*  That's crazy because that's the place where you would do it, particularly if like you're defending your title or you're challenging for a title.
*  Yeah. And it's like some of this stuff, even if you're looking for it, is quite difficult to detect anyway.
*  It's like micro dosing EPO is still they're trying to refine the parameters and determine with greater scrutiny how to detect it.
*  How long is the life is detectable inside your body?
*  I believe it's like a few days and that's if you're using like that's not a micro dose protocol either.
*  Well, how much of a benefit do you get from micro dosing?
*  Fairly significant given you can even just retaining your baseline parameters if you're weight cutting can be quite helpful.
*  So it's almost like offsetting, for example, the suppression of hormones or the suppression of like any sort of parameter that would decrease with heavy nutrient deprivation.
*  If you can sustain it at normal is performance enhancing in contrast to your competitors who are also weight cutting and might not have the same advantages.
*  Well, that's why T.J.
*  Dillashaw did it when he was dropping down the flyweight to fight Henry Sohuto, which is when he got popped.
*  And, you know, but he was he looked like a skeleton.
*  Did you ever see those weight cut? Yeah, that was insane.
*  I might be speaking on the detection time of EPO, by the way, but it's at at minimum the micro dose protocols that are being implemented still.
*  Even most recent literature, you find upwards of 50 percent of the studied participants where they're actually looking for it.
*  Still pass their testing. Really? Yeah. Wow.
*  Well, one of the things that I've read about sauna is that sauna use, especially like directly after cardio, imparts like like a micro dose EPO effect.
*  Have you read anything about that? Not for not recently now.
*  So, I don't know. Maybe you could brush me up.
*  Well, maybe we could find it. But I know it's helped my cardio.
*  It helped significantly because I went through an injury once where I couldn't do any kickboxing or any hitting the bag or anything for quite a while.
*  And whenever I did come back from like three or four months off of that, it would be the first few days were fucking brutal.
*  And it wasn't brutal at all. And it was because of regular sauna.
*  Sauna bathing can increase the production of EPO, a hormone that stimulates the production of red blood cells.
*  This can improve endurance performance by increasing the amount of oxygen.
*  Now, it says here's how plasma volume when you sit in a sauna, you sweat, which comes from blood plasma as your blood plasma levels decrease, your kidneys release EPO.
*  So how do they detect endogenous versus exogenous EPO?
*  It's similar to how they would detect for bioidentical testosterone and other hormones they look for.
*  Does it look like a endogenous signature? So different compounds, there's different ways to analyze.
*  But in general, it's going to be either the molecular mass of it or something to that effect would be have a blatant difference between what you would make naturally,
*  naturally, endogenously versus exogenous origin, which is the way they make it in a lab, does not necessarily look exactly the same.
*  So even though it's EPO that you're injecting, it's actually like recombinant, AKA made in a lab and not like it's not like they're literally pulling EPO out of a guy and then giving it to you.
*  It's like grown in a lab, essentially. Right. Right.
*  Well, that was one of the things that Jeff Novitski actually said could be an issue is that it is possible, at least theoretically, to take testosterone from animals.
*  So find a mammal based testosterone instead of getting it from. So they create it from wild yams, right?
*  Yeah. So wild yams from Mexico, apparently, where they get all the testosterone that when you buy testosterone, sip and eat or whatever.
*  And soy. Yeah. Soy. Yeah. What do you mean?
*  They use soy to like the phyto. Some of the compounds in the soy as well as the yams look similar molecularly to the cholesterol that would get basically enzymatically converted to testosterone.
*  So you can just manipulate that slightly to have like a highly reproducible at scale for low cost way to make hormones.
*  And that's how testosterone is made. That's interesting because soy is always associated with like soy boys.
*  Yeah, it's associated with high estrogen levels. Yeah. I think the two primary ways they synthesize testosterone now is soy and yams.
*  So Novitski was saying that at least in theory, a really good scientist could actually extract it from animals and then it would be impossible to differentiate.
*  Yeah, I think maybe the first time I came on, we talked about the carbon isotope ratio testing and having a CIR proof testosterone formulation if athletes are doing that.
*  And I did dig into it after we talked about it a bit more.
*  And it does seem like there is strong evidence that suggests they're aware of it and are trying to find new ways to refine even the carbon isotope ratio testing.
*  Now they're looking at like hydrogen ratios because it's more minute and specific, apparently, as opposed to with the carbon content.
*  They've seen suspicious testosterone formulations that look similar to endogenous carbon isotope signatures.
*  And your diet, even what you ingest, can change what your signature is too, because they have to use as like a reference.
*  They use, for example, from your urine, they'll find some other compound that is like upstream from testosterone, for example.
*  And they will use that as a benchmark of like this is what your signature is of the carbon content of sex hormones.
*  And then if your testosterone has a different carbon isotope ratio than this, they know that, OK, however you got this in your body is different than the upstream hormone.
*  So through that, we can infer that, you know, it's probably of exogenous origin.
*  But if the exogenous origin one looks like the upstream hormones, like you, you would never be able to tell.
*  So it's possible if you were sophisticated enough to make the exogenous look like the upstream.
*  Yeah. Even though you've injected it.
*  Yeah. And if you had like animal grade testosterone or cholesterol, even from like a medical grade compound facility or something like you could probably react it down and create like a CIR proof testosterone.
*  God, it would be it seems like it'd be hard to keep that under wraps for very long without it getting out.
*  Maybe. Yeah. But it's like the access to lab equipment and high level testing is not as the barrier is a lot lower than it used to be, for sure.
*  Like there are Ivan have heard of people paying off water accredited labs to get like testing done.
*  Really? Yeah. So they could like assess where they stand in terms of like some of the testing that they would do to see if they pop or not.
*  Is that legal? No. So they bribe water.
*  They allegedly there's water accredited labs, not just in the states, but like in other countries where they're a bit more corrupt and you can persuade them to test your samples.
*  So you send your piss to Guatemala or somewhere. Yeah. Yeah. And then they go, yeah, senior.
*  You got problems. Senior, that look good.
*  Yeah. But yeah, if you do enough homework, you can develop a biological passport internally with your own team and, you know, be know your bulletproof rather than just guessing.
*  Yeah. Well, there was some concern with Brock Lesnar at one point in time before he tested positive.
*  And one of the concerns was that he was testing himself, that he had gotten tested like a number of times, which generally you don't do.
*  Now, why was that recorded, though, like that they have his medical records because you can just like pay for blood tests and urine analysis.
*  I might be speaking at a turn. I might be speaking at a school here. I don't remember.
*  I don't remember the thing, but I remember someone who knows things.
*  Tell me. Yeah. You know, I'm kind of on the inside.
*  So someone someone who knows things on the inside told me, dude, he got tested like 20 fucking times or something crazy like that during camp.
*  Oh, he was for sure trying to get around. Well, he's also pissed hot.
*  This is when he fought Mark Hunt and a giant lawsuit involved right now.
*  Oh, yeah. I don't know if that lawsuit has been if it's still ongoing or what the deal was.
*  But Mark Hunt was furious. Yeah.
*  It's obvious when you look at the guy. I mean, he was like 39 years old, 300 pounds, like cutting down to 265.
*  He's fucking huge, man. Yeah.
*  What's even more interesting, too, is the storage of samples.
*  A lot of sports don't actually do it.
*  So with Olympic testing, oftentimes the positive test results come retroactively to years in the past.
*  Once they've refined the testing and actually are able to detect long term metabolites of Terenobol or something of that nature.
*  But in a lot of sports, like especially in the in the US for like traditional professional sports, they're not storing urine typically.
*  Right. So if you have more refined testing get developed, oftentimes there's no way to actually penalize an athlete who was ahead of the testing curve at the time.
*  Right. And at least from what I've seen, there's a really good paper.
*  One of the guys I know who's on the inside on this, his name is Alex Caliari Turner.
*  He has excellent information and studies on this stuff.
*  But he did a paper that basically outlined how I think 75 percent of the medalists that have tested positive in the Olympics at the Summer Olympic Games for the past.
*  It was like a full decade of analyzation.
*  It was like 75 percent of them tested years later, not at the actual time of winning their medal.
*  So if they're only being popped, you know, three out of four people are getting popped retroactively over a half decade later or more based on advancements in testing.
*  You can just imagine how many sports are getting away with passing testing given that retroactively they're not being tested at all.
*  Right. So it's like if you're ahead of the curve now, there are a lot of sports where as long as you pass the test now,
*  even if what you took had a more refined assay developed, you know, five years from now, they're not going to go get your sample and retry it.
*  Right. That makes sense.
*  But wasn't there a famous Russian wrestler who was popped because they went back and looked at his his old stud like once they developed new testing protocols?
*  Wasn't an Olympic athlete? Yeah.
*  That's why because Olympic Games, they started storing samples 2004.
*  So they're a bit more rigorous about that.
*  And there are there are probably some sports that store, but the majority don't.
*  Yeah. And it's like, you know, you could say it's corruption or you could say it's, you know, people trying to the sport, trying to cover it up.
*  But I think sometimes it's just like budget constraints here because it's like you still have to be a profitable enterprise.
*  And right. You know, I don't know how much you can scrutinize the economics on something like that.
*  You're also managing at scale, right? Like how many athletes are you dealing with?
*  Yeah. How much time do you have to go back and, you know, review all the different urine samples?
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, but it gets crazy because it kind of it highly suggests that in a lot of sports, as long as you're ahead of the curve, you're probably good.
*  Yeah. Now, obviously, you have to actually beat the test now, which is more and more rigorous by the year, of course.
*  But at least historically, what we've seen is it's the testing usually lags behind the methods that are being developed to get around it.
*  Is there anything right now that is not being tested for that you think is effective?
*  Yeah, like in general, the most effective stuff is going to be bioidenticals, which are being tested for.
*  But it's like at the scale, it's kind of up for debate because sometimes they don't test at all.
*  Like, you know, we saw with you, Sada, they were barely doing adequate in-depth testing for bioidenticals with no EPO testing or HGH testing.
*  So I would say those are probably the go tos, you know, like EPO, especially an HGH testing.
*  There are other compounds that I think some people think they can get away with that sometimes they do.
*  Sometimes they don't. Like, I think it's called Trimetazidine.
*  There was some like top level tennis player who just popped like a week ago or something.
*  And what is that? It's like an angina medication that the entire China Olympic team got popped for a few years back.
*  Yeah, it was like 23 Chinese swimmers who were like, oh, I'm going to go with this.
*  Yeah, it was like 23 Chinese swimmers before the Tokyo Olympics got popped using this thing.
*  And then they claimed it was like food contamination or something.
*  And they were like, oh, that's I guess that's what happened.
*  And then a bunch of those two of those athletes won medals in the recent Paris Olympics and 11 of them were allowed to compete still.
*  What does it do? It shifts your efficiency of fuel utilization.
*  So basically, in general, to create ATP, your body would oxidize fatty acids as well as glucose and an endurance event, which is heavily oxygen sapping.
*  If you can shift, which is what this drug does, it inhibits a process by which your body proportionally oxidizes more glucose than fatty acids,
*  which is a less oxygen intensive process. So you can basically conserve oxygen proportional to the amount of ATP you're producing.
*  So in an endurance event, if you can have more oxygen for less cost internally, then it's highly performance enhancing.
*  Wow. Or it should be. You know, it's kind of speculative as to if it's actually performance enhancing.
*  But it's kind of a weird coincidence how many people have popped for this drug.
*  Oh, by the way, you said the first time I was here, you said the Russian Olympics, the only people who didn't pop were the figure skaters.
*  Yeah. Yeah, there was a Russian figure skater who's 15 who was on this angina medication.
*  Well, that kind of makes sense, right? Because one thing you would want is more oxygen and endurance when you're figure skating.
*  It's pretty cardio intensive when you're spinning around and flying around. Yeah. Yeah, for sure.
*  But they said that steroids, they found that like gross motor skills.
*  Like, he's so loud, dude, you can nudge him, keep him from fucking snoring so loud.
*  But they found that like testosterone and things along those lines, like actual steroids, it was not good to be stronger as a figure skater that it didn't enhance.
*  But that was Gregory, whatever his name was, from Icarus.
*  Yeah, yeah. And like I could see obviously the compound selection will differ greatly depending on what sport because, you know, there are some sports where, you know, being heavier is going to be problematic.
*  Right. And you might, you know, want something that could enhance, I don't know, your cognitive capacity or whatever it may be or like slow down your heart rate, for example, for archery or different applications for sure.
*  Like beta blockers. Yeah, like for archery, for example, things like propranolol, like highly effective as well as for, you know, public speaking, playing piano publicly.
*  I think there's like famous pianists who use this drug too. Yeah, I've heard of people using beta blockers. Snipers too. Really? Yeah. Makes sense. Right? Yeah.
*  Yeah. Just dropping that that anxiety response. Yeah. And if it crosses the blood brain barrier, like propranolol does, it actually calms you down very significantly. It's not just about lowering the heart rate. It also like de stresses you like it's an anti anxiety drug essentially.
*  Wow. Yeah. You've never tried it? No. For archery? I'd be wondering if it was. I thought about doing it once. I even asked my doctor about it. He was going to get it for me. But I was like, I don't want to cheat.
*  Like half of the bow hunting thing is about being able to keep your shit together. And if you could just do it. Like if I could just shoot at a deer the way it shoot at a target. I don't think it would be the same. Yeah, fair enough. Yeah. It's like part of it is a purist. Yeah.
*  In that regard, because part of it is the discipline of managing your mind. That's what I like about it. I like that it's hard to do. Yeah, I don't want it to be easier. You know, it's fucking hard to do. And that's literally why I like it. Like if I could take a drug that would make it easier to do, I don't think I would like it. I'm very effective right now. I'm very, I'm real successful at bow hunting, you know, relatively for like it's it non. If like, I go to a lot of really great places to hunt because I have money. I'm fortunate. I'm lucky. I'm lucky. I'm lucky. I'm lucky. I'm lucky. I'm lucky. I'm lucky. I'm lucky. I'm lucky. I'm lucky. I'm lucky. I'm lucky. I'm lucky. I'm lucky. I'm lucky. I'm lucky. I'm lucky. I'm lucky. I'm lucky. I'm lucky. I
*  am like, yeah, you're in it. But relatively speaking, bow hunting is not a successful endeavor. It's like maybe 10% of the hunts like when people get tags, maybe, probably less in most places actually harvests an animal. How often do you do it? I do it twice a year I go on a big elk hunt. And I do like a bunch of pig hunts and stuff like that. In between that maybe one deer hunt. And it's like,
*  How intensive of a prep is it and like the whole process of doing the trip is it like a multi-day thing?
*  Yeah, I go for like a week the really intensive part though is the preparation for it
*  And I was gonna tell you about this too because I actually fucked my body up getting ready for this one
*  So when hunting season approaches for like three months out of hunting season
*  I ramp up all my cardio and all my bow hunt my archery so I practice in my backyard. I practice archery
*  I'm shooting at 85 yards. I shoot an 84 pound bow and I might shoot it a hundred times a day
*  So I'm pulling 80 pounds 84 pounds a hundred times in a day
*  And I'm doing it day after day after day after day. I'm doing it five six days a week
*  So I was developing like severe pain in my lower back on my right side
*  That led to like sciatica and I was also
*  Developing some severe neck pain on my right side
*  So this is it's all it's really an unbalanced thing right because I really should draw something back with me
*  I should probably like at least draw back my bow with my left hand as many times
*  I draw back with my right but I don't so you draw back. So I'm pulling it's
*  84 pounds to pull it back
*  It's at least for the beginning of the cycle and then the cams rotate over and it significantly lowers like the holding weight is I think?
*  My holding weight is like 20% 20 or 25% of the actual weight of the bow
*  But what happens is as you're pulling back and you lock it in place
*  The way archery works is you want to what's called pull at the wall, right?
*  So where the string hits the end where it can't pull anymore on a compound bow. I'm pulling hard against that wall
*  So I'm steady, right and then I'm real
*  Trying to relax this shoulder and pull and I'm stabilizing everything with this lower back with my lower back muscle
*  So on my right side, it was just getting locked up like
*  Painful and stiff and sore
*  Like hurt even when I walk and I would just keep going
*  Do it for hours three hours a day
*  Just hours and hours and hours and I just developed a real problem
*  To the point where like when I was the last trip when I was going up hills my my hips were getting numb
*  Like my glutes weren't firing. I was getting sciatic pain. It's pretty bad
*  So I knew after hunting season was over. I was gonna have to dress it
*  So I got some stem cell shots, which definitely helped I started doing a lot of stretching
*  No archery for a couple months a lot of like hard foam like it's I have a from elite flexibility
*  They make like a PVC roller with like a very thin layer
*  So it's very hard and I was doing a lot of rolling rolling in the sauna
*  Cold plunge sauna stretching and it was getting a little better slowly
*  but it was brutal like it was taking a long time to recover and
*  Then I started doing this thing called new fit and what new fit is is electrical muscular stimulation
*  while you're going through exercise routines and so they slap these
*  electro pads all over your muscles and
*  Fully contract you and then you go through exercises while you're doing it and it's like
*  Significantly increased my rehabilitation. I've only been doing it for a few weeks, too
*  I've only been doing it for like three weeks all my back pain is gone
*  mobility is back
*  No, no more sciatica at all. No issues at all and everything is like much looser
*  It's like coming back. So do you find that more effective than stem cells? No, I think it's the combination of things
*  It's very hard to tell like what is actually working
*  But when you add one thing and then also you get a significant response
*  I'm assuming that this new fit thing is having at least
*  Responsible for I mean, there's some sort of synergistic effect, right because I'm using peptides
*  I got this like I said, I got stem cells shot into it
*  So this is like a and takes a while for the stem cells to take place
*  I'm sure that's part of it, but then this new fit things pretty significant
*  So I've been doing that quite a lot. I've been doing that four days a week and it's it's legit man
*  It's really legit. I know Mike Tyson was using that when he was preparing for the
*  fight with Jake Paul
*  So I know a lot of other athletes. Yeah use it a lot of people use it for rehabilitation
*  It's like it really reduces the amount of time that you have to recover from like surgeries and injuries and stuff like that
*  What else are you using now as part of your nothing new nothing new?
*  I'm still BPC 157 TB 500, you know
*  I'm more than stuff like that like the same stuff that I've always used before
*  This is the only thing that I've done that's really new this new fit. Have you ever seen it before?
*  No, you can find like some examples of
*  Cuz like I said Tyson was using it. So it's no more time intensive
*  Because it's during training. So you're what you're doing is so I'm doing it for rehabilitation
*  So so this is what it looks like so they slap these electrodes to you
*  So your muscles are just like locked up depending on how much you can tolerate
*  You know, so I get them to crank that fucker up and when you're doing it your muscles are like completely
*  Flexed through the whole thing. It's like it's kind of painful and then while you're doing that you're going through all these different exercises
*  Okay, so they're like kind of
*  Rehabilitative type exercises as opposed to the actual workout that you'd be doing for me
*  what I'm doing is rehabilitative, but other people do it for hypertrophy and
*  Bodybuilders do it apparently to like say if like you've got like trap issues
*  Like you don't like you need to like have one area where you want to improve
*  They're slapping it to that area and then doing all these exercises
*  Either I
*  an entrepreneur
*  That I'm friends with asked me what I thought about it as like a replacement for exercise
*  Oh just a replacement
*  Yeah, and it was like such like a rich person question
*  Like how do I not go to the gym and still like go to the gym?
*  There was a place in Boston when I lived there in the the 80s that had that I forget what it was called
*  But you would basically go there and their claim was they would get you you have a six-pack
*  You get jacked and all you do is lay there
*  Lay there they put these electrodes on you just
*  Have you ever seen those like ancient
*  Like belly shaking things for women to lose like back in the 40s
*  Yeah, just sit there shaking back and forth. No, I'm sure it's more effective than that. Obviously
*  Yeah, nothing, but I don't think it's a replacement and I would imagine I would speculate that
*  The time it would take to stimulate yourself if it's for hypertrophy if you just worked out more
*  You'd probably get better results perhaps
*  It's the the idea is that it's enhancing you past what you would normally get because you're in this very
*  Unique state of constant contraction. Yeah, so there's no contract relax contract relax. You are just
*  contracted you just
*  And then you're going through all these exercises
*  So you have to kind of force your way through the exercises while you're contracted. It's kind of difficult
*  I think if you were injured it probably has a lot of viability
*  But I would be highly suspect of it being used for like a guy trying to break a plateau
*  Who's a veteran lifter for example, right? Right. Yeah, I would agree and no bodybuilders. I know
*  Attribute any success to something like this, right?
*  Well, this guy was telling me that some bodybuilders use to target areas that they like I'm having difficulty make maybe your calves
*  Yeah, like people have a difficult time growing calf muscles most
*  Biggest nuisance of a body part genetically. It's cap. Yeah, John Jones. That's the thing
*  Yeah, like one of the best kickers in the sport
*  No calves. They're like non-existent. Yeah, it's so genetically predetermined seemingly that you know
*  You'll have guys who are top Olympia caliber bodybuilders and if they haven't had calves for their whole career
*  They don't suddenly develop them even though they obviously know how to train and then people will shit on them and say you have no
*  Cavs, bro, like learn how to train. It's like this is my job
*  Like do you think I don't know what to do a fucking calf raise, but they just won't grow. Yeah, like proportionally
*  So they lag behind significantly and it's pretty obvious when somebody has a liking body part when they're on stage
*  But it is like a very very
*  Difficult area to locally, you know
*  If you don't have the genetics for it in the muscle bellies, it's very difficult to make a bad looking calf look good
*  It's weird because you gotta go like John where everything else is pretty big, you know
*  He's got big chest big arms
*  This is not to say don't train calves because people get all riled up about you know, skipping leg days and stuff
*  Well, especially for performance, you know
*  Like you certainly need strong calf muscles for performance so you can make them stronger
*  They just don't necessarily get aesthetically pleasing. Yeah, there's definitely ways to optimally train them that maybe not everyone does but in general
*  Like it seems like if they're lagging behind for you, it's it's pretty difficult to bring them up
*  Yeah, yeah, it's like one of the worst offenders is there anything else like that any other body parts that are like notoriously difficult to train
*  Ah
*  That's a good question
*  Probably there's probably something that I'm not thinking of I don't know
*  Neck maybe but that's pretty easy to train actually. It's just not many people do it
*  Neck you got to be careful though. It was an I you know, I use an iron neck, which I really believe in
*  It's like the only thing that I've ever done that strengthened my neck and not caused me any neck problems
*  Whereas I think those other ones like, you know those things where you put like the leather helmet on with the chain
*  Yeah, I think that's an unusual
*  Movement for your neck and I think you could probably get away with I know a lot of
*  Wrestlers and including Mike Tyson who fucked their neck up from neck bridges. Have you seen the f1 drivers?
*  Workout routines. No, dude pull up. Oh, they would have to do next. Oh, yeah
*  That's like what they do for their training mostly seemingly
*  They're just saying there was like a giant fucking contraption their head just like
*  Like an iron neck. Yeah. Yeah, but it's like it seems even more intensive like it's uh,
*  Yeah, but see what I'm saying is they're not bending the neck, right?
*  So what they're doing is they're forcing their muscles to stabilize the neck as they're facing resistance, right?
*  But what they're not doing is bending all the way down and bending all the way up with weight
*  Which I think is what's unusual and I think that's just a weird strain on the discs and with a lot of guys
*  especially wrestlers where they get strained from is like someone grabbing them with a collar tie and like pulling their head down and
*  They get it real low and then they're resisting that you can fuck your neck up that way or fighting off a guillotine or a darse choke
*  Or so or a triangle where you're like really fucked up and distorted you're resisting against it. You can fuck your neck up
*  So what the iron neck does that I really like is you're rotating and you can adjust the resistance on the rotation
*  So you have this halo you put it on your head you pump it like a Reebok pump
*  And if like form fits to your head you put a chin strap on and then you back up and so it's got a bungee cord
*  So very stiff rubber cord and as you're pulling back you have a lot of resistance this way and then you could
*  Rotate and then on the rotation you can adjust the resistance you can make it more difficult
*  But you're never doing any of this stuff. And I think this stuff is where at least from what I've seen people get hurt
*  Especially neck bridges neck bridges where your whole body
*  Oh, I can imagine you're doing all this and you're rolling like Tyson you ever seen Tyson's neck bridge routine when he was younger
*  No, but Tyson had a 20 inch neck. Yeah 20 inches now crazy. That is his neck would start at the top of his head when he was young
*  I mean, yeah fucking massive neck
*  But it's one of the reasons why he was also so good at taking a punch because his head didn't snap around like
*  Look out look at his neck. He's young that neck is crazy. Dude. That's like crazy
*  Parallel with his head. Yeah, like see look good. This is what he would do every day in training. Holy shit that looks
*  Yeah
*  This wrestler bridge does strengthen your neck but at a cost and I don't think it's at a cost for everybody
*  I think it probably can be done safely
*  but I think you probably have to scale up very slowly and very carefully and make sure that you have the
*  Supporting tissue and strength around that to not compromise your discs, you know, like when you're in these reared
*  Positions like you're never supposed to have all you know
*  At least bridging with like 60% of your weight
*  Sideways on your neck like this and then roll it over the side and then roll it over the side
*  While you're putting all the weight on the back your head or on your forehead. That's just crazy. That's yeah. Oh, yeah, I would
*  That looks fucking sketch, dude
*  Well Mike had to get neck surgery yo el Romero
*  Like I said had his whole neck fused his neck doesn't ever see him run
*  No, but probably looks in hilarious see you find the video yo el Romero sprinting. It's nuts. His neck doesn't move. It's like this
*  Like a robot like a Terminator
*  But it's also why yo el can take crazy
*  Punishment like y'all got head kicked once by I think it was Derek Brunson head kicked him and he didn't even move
*  Like look at him run
*  So his neck doesn't move his entire neck is completely fused and he has this giant scar on the back of his neck
*  He is a freak though, dude
*  Did you ever get the impression that if he just like threw himself into the fire more and fights?
*  He probably would have won a lot more
*  I don't know
*  I don't know if you can keep that kind of muscle mass and have the kind of cardio
*  That you need to throw yourself into the fire more because it was always it was kind of hard to tell if he was gassed
*  Sometimes right and then he would all of a sudden burst out exactly like that cost
*  The Romero fight is still to this day one of my favorite fights ever
*  and I don't know man like it almost a lot of the Romero fights it seems like
*  if he just started swinging and going in there that he might be able to
*  Take out a lot of dudes that he just let go to decision perhaps
*  But you have to like know how much gas you have in the tank and only he knows and that style that he has
*  Is a style for someone who's very explosive
*  It's very smart because you don't just explode and keep going you won't last you last two minutes and then you'd be dead
*  Yeah
*  So what he does is like kind of he looks like so relaxed and then he explodes on you and when he explodes on people they
*  Don't see it coming because he's lulled you into this false sense of security
*  By this slower speed that he moves at like did you ever see his knockout of Chris Weidman?
*  Probably that's the perfect example that he caught Chris Weidman with a flying knee as Chris Weidman was coming in for a takedown
*  He just like lulled him into like this is the speed we're moving at we're gonna move at this speed
*  This is how we're fighting. Oh, I'm dodging your punches. Oh
*  That out of nowhere BAM. He hits with his flying knee and just destroys his head
*  I mean it was one of the most brutal watch this
*  So see how he like moved boom
*  Yeah, I mean literally his whole body fought back it up again so we could see that one more time
*  Like before it happens
*  So they're fighting he's got him on the ground. Oh, so here it is. So you see as he moves
*  He's not boom. He just leaps into him. This is like a highlight thing. It's not showing the the whole
*  Exchange but in the fight, you know, Weidman's very aggressive very tough
*  And you know pushing a pace trying to get the takedowns Weidman likes to push a strong pace and really wear on guys and yo
*  Well, just would like kind of like move and relax
*  And then out of nowhere he would just blow on you and that's what he did with
*  Adesanya to like that was a very boring fight because Adesanya is like I see your fucking game
*  I'm gonna stay out here and wait for you to charge in on me
*  I'm gonna counter-attack and yo, I was like, come on come fight me and he's like, uh
*  I know what you're doing cuz he he exploded one time and caught Izzy with a left hand like a powerful left hand is
*  He's like, oh Jesus Christ
*  This guy moves so fucking fast when he wants to but he can't really fight like that for five minutes for five rounds
*  You can't really just keep exploding
*  That's like the problem with a guy like Conor McGregor like Conor McGregor was lethal for one or two rounds
*  But then you get into the third fourth and fifth is there's so much fast twitch muscle fiber engagement. There's so much explosion
*  It's like constant sprinting. Yeah, has he ever
*  Knocked out a guy after round two even
*  That's a good question. I don't know. I mean he certainly could right? Yeah, I mean he's not out of shape
*  I remember what you're saying though. It was like the later rounds. It was so blatant. He was gassed
*  Well, he was so fast in the first couple of rounds. That was the thing. It's like if he didn't
*  Fucking tune you up in those first couple rounds if you were like Nate Diaz
*  Some indestructible zombie and then you get into the later rounds and you're fucking tight
*  Like how's this guy still here?
*  And then Nate is just like slapping you and beat you up and Nate can push that 50% pace forever
*  Yeah him and his brother were very good at that. They didn't really explode
*  They just looked like touch you they just touch you all the time and you can't breathe because you don't have the time to relax
*  Right. So if he's constantly hitting you with punches that aren't that hard
*  Because you're always like because you don't know if these punches are gonna be hard and then occasionally would mix them up with like really
*  Hard shots and so you always have to be ready for the hard shot
*  So you never get to breathe you never get to relax
*  So you're constantly on edge and you just get worn out and he's relaxed because he's just hitting you and touching you and he's
*  Talking shit to you. What bitch what bitch what's going on bitch?
*  They keep hitting you this like 50% like literally like this not really trying to hurt you at all
*  Just just constantly making you tense up and just drain your gas tank
*  They seem relentless. Oh, dude. Well his cardio Nick Diaz, especially his cardio was
*  Insanity he swam back from Alcatraz
*  He did it on five different occasions in the ocean with great white sharks
*  Swim. What is it like a mile and a half or something like that in the fucking freezing cold Pacific Northwest Ocean?
*  I don't know but how far is Alcatraz how far is this swim?
*  They used to think you couldn't do it. They used to think no one could survive it
*  So that's why they put out Alcatraz they only put a prison out there
*  A couple of guys did escape and they don't know what happened to them
*  They found their clothes at the beach and there's speculation that at least one guy survived it, but how are you gonna train?
*  You can't train to swim and then you're gonna just swim for a mile and a half. Yeah, you're not gonna make it
*  I don't know. What's car cardio?
*  Regiments in prison. I would have no idea
*  I mean you could do cardio, but you're not gonna recreate swimming without swimming the resistance the current
*  Like all of it and temperature regulation. Yeah, you're just not gonna be able to recreate that unless you're doing it
*  They're not gonna let you practice like guys. It's gonna do laughs around Alcatraz like the fuck out of here
*  How far is it Jamie mile and a half? So a mile and a half in the fucking ocean?
*  With sharks when was that these prisoners escaped?
*  Like was this decade to go was a Clint Eastwood movie escape from Alcatraz
*  No, there's a movie about the actual escape from Alcatraz
*  These guys had made a paper mache model of their face
*  I like put it like with put some pillows and shit and threw a blanket over it and the guards and they would go to
*  Check thought these guys were still in their bed. Meanwhile, they had tunneled a hole through the wall of the of the of the cell
*  1979 film escape from Alcatraz presented inconclusive conclusions. What does that mean?
*  One of the islands enduring mysteries told the true story of three men Frank Morris and the brothers Clarence and John Algin out
*  Anglin who made it out of the prison in June of 1962 were never seen again
*  Nobody knows for sure whether they made good on their escape or drowned in the attempt true stories like that and others
*  embellished tales of man-eating sharks and killer currents spread by prison guards as a deterrent contributed to the mythology of
*  unassailable Alcatraz and the impossible swim
*  Well, it's definitely not impossible because Nick Diaz done it
*  Times but people do it all the time now, you know, it's it's like an endurance thing that people constantly do know someone did
*  979 times
*  Whoa
*  Does it monthly? Oh my god, what a fucking psycho
*  979 times that is rolling the dice on sharks, bro. Yeah, what happens when you
*  like Alcatraz is
*  still awesome
*  Still operating. No, no, no, okay. No, it wasn't operating. Oh, it's like a tourist attraction
*  When I was a kid we went to visit it and with school they took when I lived in San Francisco
*  They took us to Alcatraz our field trip was pretty cool
*  You had to be in these prisons where all these people used to get it's very weird. It's why does shut down?
*  I don't know. It's a good question. Why they shut Alcatraz down. Maybe when they figured out people could swim it
*  Yeah, I mean
*  It's not unassailable
*  Take a long time though, like how in a mile and a half in the ocean
*  How long does that take some people think it was because those guys got away, but it was because it was too expensive
*  No, you operate that makes sense, right? You got to get all the supplies and out there by boat by ferry
*  I don't even think they had that many prisoners there
*  Hmm, like, you know, but they had like super dangerous ones there, right? Wasn't that the whole idea was all murderers. I
*  Think it was like a like super maximum security like for the biggest psychos. No, you put them on Alcatraz
*  Yeah, what was that movie? I think Sean Connery movie as well. Yeah
*  Yeah, I think yeah. Yeah, I think that was about it, too
*  Yeah, but you know guys who have extreme cardio like that. That's a real weapon like
*  like power is important in the what's always important, but
*  Cardio is one of the most important things because you just when you get tired, you don't think right
*  You don't have you don't make good decisions and then you also you just you're just not as effective
*  You're you're not gonna scramble out of positions
*  You're gonna relax a little try to catch your breath like if you get taken down, you're not gonna like completely exert
*  Chuckledale said this to me once he said when guys get taken down they accept the takedown and the thing is they get taken down
*  And then they try to work their way back up to their feet
*  He goes I never did that when I got taken down the moment my back touched the ground
*  It was like hot lava and I just exploded immediately
*  I never let them hold me and that was the key to never getting taken down and held down is at the moment
*  He's a really good wrestler as well, obviously, but the moment someone would take him down. He would never accept it
*  He would just some guys accept it like fuck I got taken down
*  All right, you know overhook underhook, you know, like control posture work
*  My full guard try to get back up try to buy time where I have enough energy to escape and figure out
*  Am I gonna try to sweep him?
*  Am I gonna you know, am I gonna try to pummel and try to get back up to my feet?
*  Am I gonna try to scoot back to the cage bunch of different strategies to try to get back up?
*  But the thing is like when you're tired, you'll accept that takedown
*  Yeah, and when you see guys accept the takedown just pull full guard like that guy's fucking tired, you know
*  The recent Oliveira fight it was like tough to watch some of the parts where it was just like oh it's you know
*  You're on the ground now and you're fucked. Yeah. Yeah. Well that fight was crazy, huh? Yeah
*  Michael Chandler almost fucking had him in that fifth round. Yeah almost had him
*  I mean what a relentless motherfucker that guy is. Yeah, he's getting his ass kicked for four rounds
*  And then finally almost fucks him up
*  Yeah, yeah, it's a crazy when it comes down to like, you know do or die mode
*  How many times it almost turns around?
*  Mm-hmm. Well, it's also crazy that a guy like him who is pretty heavily muscled and
*  Is just such a fucking training machine that he has that ultimate gas tank even in the fifth round
*  Just explode and like in the fifth round. He was going hard, which is why I always thought he was a super dangerous fight for Connor
*  Yeah, he almost seems like a better cardio like Sean Shirk or something, right?
*  Well, Sean Shirk was one of the first guys who really did have crazy cardio did it
*  Yeah, I thought he was so before the time. Okay. He was a fitness fanatic like a conditioning fanatic, but
*  like so was
*  There's a few guys like Rich Franklin was like a fitness fanatic too
*  Like they dedicated a significant amount of their time just to strengthen conditioning
*  So they had this like ultimate gas tank
*  But like with Rich Franklin the problem was his skill level was never gonna compete with Anderson Silva
*  Anderson Silva was just a god at the time. I mean in his prime and was like 34 years old. He was fucking unstoppable
*  Lettuce ism differential between everyone and yeah was like obscene. It was skill too
*  It's like he had the ability to let punches get right here and he would just move his head slightly and then bang
*  Crack you was you all your momentum is coming in and he would counter you and he was just so
*  Skillful and he was like a computer
*  He would the first minute of the round first fight like first round of the fight
*  You would see him moving around and just like trying things on you and just sort of
*  Downloading your movements and what you're capable of he would see you swing like okay. I got that. Okay, I'll do a little of this
*  I'll kick him a couple of times and then by the end of the round
*  Okay, motherfucker and then you'd see him like like the you should know comedy fight is a great example that by the end of the
*  First round he head kicks Okami and drops him. He just starts tuning him up
*  He just he gets he gets what you can do is like you can't do it
*  I do and then he just starts turning it on
*  Yes, some of those fights back in the day just felt like a ticking time bomb for whoever he was facing
*  Yeah
*  People forget the thing about fighters when they fight past their prime is you get these guys like Anderson that fight into their 40s
*  And you remember them from their their later fights
*  Yeah, don't remember them when they were unstoppable like when Anderson was in his prime
*  He's one of the greatest fighters that's ever lived. Oh, yeah for sure. Have you seen that uh,
*  UFC interview where they like accidentally showed I think it was like HGH in the background
*  He opened his fridge. What are you eating? I'm eating growth
*  He's popped for some dumb shit too if I recall correctly
*  Well, did you ever see his coach his weightlifting coach probably when I was looking into it
*  But I'm assuming he's yoked out of his fucking mind
*  65 years old and built like Joel Romero
*  See if you can find Anderson Silva's strength and conditioning coach. I mean there was no way
*  There's just no way that guy knows what to take. Yeah, there's no way there's no he was in his 60s fucking jacked
*  I mean just super jacked like that's him
*  I mean look at that dude that dudes in his 60s mean muggin. Yeah
*  Tainted supplements likely cause a failed test not what's in my fridge
*  Look at the size that guy in his 60s. So obviously he knows what to take
*  Yeah, that guy knows some stuff so
*  Chandler you said good match for Connor. Is that ever happening or I don't know if Connor's ever gonna fight again
*  What's happening with his uh, he just got like
*  The civil suit. Yeah or whatever and he's being dropped by all his yeah companies or something. Yeah
*  You know, I don't know the real details of that case
*  I know his version of it and her version of it and what played out in the court
*  But the the reality is that guy's partying and he's partying real hard and he talked about it in the in the court case
*  You know, he's talking about cocaine like there. That was the whole thing that we're all doing cocaine and we're fucking dude
*  Some of his interviews you can tell he is out of it
*  Allegedly he seems at least excited dude. Have you seen the jake jillin all and Connor interview for Roadhouse?
*  He's just fucking tweaking the whole time
*  Just like yeah, I can't imagine he wasn't thinking what are you doing dude, right? Yeah, right
*  You know, it's funny Shane Gillis has a great bit about Conor McGregor and Roadhouse
*  He goes Connor. Gregor basically played a coked out Connor
*  Shane does like a Connor impression so it's fucking hilarious like
*  I mean, he's he likes coke. Yeah, but I think there's another issue to talk about and that is that
*  a
*  Lot of fighters when they've sustained a significant amount of damage over the course of their career and there's no way to not get that
*  Right, I mean we saw we've all seen Connor get beat up and knocked out. We've seen Conor's sparring footage
*  He spars pro boxers. He's sparring elite fighters. You're getting hit in the head a lot and
*  a lot of fighters especially towards the end of their career turn to drugs and
*  I think there's probably like a
*  Constant state of discomfort that they live in where their dopamine levels are all fucked up
*  They're their cortisol levels are all fucked up their bodies
*  Just you're not supposed to get punched in the head a thousand times a year
*  It's just not supposed to happen and that's the reality of consistent training
*  So if you think about consistent training like say you and me are sparring and we meet at the gym
*  Three times a week and we spar three times a week and it was let's say we spar five rounds three times a week
*  Five rounds of five minutes each
*  We might you might hit me 15 20 times a round and
*  Then we're doing that three times a week and we're doing that over and over and over again
*  And it's not even this is the thing people say oh you spar light sure sure sparring light is important, but
*  subconcussive trauma to the head is what causes soccer players to get CTE now soccer players are getting CTE from a soccer ball
*  I've bounced a soccer ball. I played soccer when I was a kid that doesn't hurt
*  But that that thump that's giving you CTE people who ride jet skis
*  Get CTE Wow you know that my friend Mark Gordon who is an expert in traumatic brain injury
*  and he
*  Works at the wounded warrior foundation about I think he works with them, but he were oh
*  Angel warrior foundation he works with a lot of veterans that suffer from CTE
*  And uses a lot of hormone replacement to help them because a lot of it is damage to the pituitary gland
*  Your endocrine system gets fucked up from you know breaches
*  You know explosions blown up in IEDs all those kind of things like those guys are fucked like the inside of their brain is fucked
*  And there's a bunch of different therapies they apply to that, but the bottom line is that it's not just getting knocked out
*  It's just getting thumped a lot. They're just thumped in training, so we're sparring
*  You know we're friends if we're sparring I wouldn't hit you hard. I hit you like that
*  I wouldn't I wouldn't try to kill you I hit you like that, but that over and over again
*  You're gonna get brain damage
*  fact
*  No, if ands or buts about it
*  You're gonna get brain damage, and if you're doing that over the course of a 10
*  15 year career think about all those camps all those
*  Rounds all those times you sparred and not just sparred that way how many collisions I've been many times. I've been
*  Collided with doing jujitsu you accidentally butt heads you accidentally take a knee to the head you accidentally take an elbow to the head
*  It's constant so you've got
*  Consistent trauma to your fucking dome over and over and over again, and then you get a little bit of coke little bit of coke
*  And you're feeling good again
*  I bet I bet you know you get addicted to it and the guy obviously likes extreme things right
*  Which is why such a great fighter they're wild people. It's why John Jones like cocaine, too
*  They're fucking wild people they want to fight. You know they want to fight in a cage for a living
*  That's how they literally feed themselves by beating the fuck out of skilled people
*  Yeah, I can imagine
*  Something like the brain cell death that literally occurs could work almost results in a perpetual state of you now need
*  Drugs to achieve like baseline even yeah, so feel normal. Yeah, there's a drug. I didn't mention earlier
*  But it's worth mentioning you said what's not being tested for that's useful in fighters
*  Something called cerebral license is used to offset brain damage after fights and not being tested for by water yet
*  How does it work?
*  It's like one of the only sources of active
*  NGF and BDNF that you can actually get an effect out of seemingly so like
*  brain derived
*  Frippet the NF sensor, but it's something that could be
*  basically
*  Grow new brain cells essentially whoa yeah or offset deterioration as well during after fighting
*  Why would you not let people take that that seems like that should be standard that should be given to everybody like vitamins
*  Yeah, yeah, it's a the pipeline of it getting through a clinical like getting a clinical application
*  It's still in experimental phases, so I could see why it hasn't been getting widespread recognition
*  And for all we know it's not gonna prove to be super effective, but at least anecdotally from people
*  I know who've used it highly effective for neurogenesis. Yeah, what about somebody who doesn't have brain damage?
*  Just wants to get really smart. Yeah, yeah tough call. I think that might work
*  Right yeah a lot of people even nowadays are exposing themselves to things that make them stupider, too
*  So it might even become you know an adjunct kind of like preventative therapy right yeah sure
*  And it's like sometimes not even purposefully that you're doing things that make you stupider
*  It's just like like what kind of things would you describe?
*  I don't know like if you have kids you're never getting good sleep, or you're somebody who's constantly on stimulants
*  Which you could argue is you know bad lifestyle or whatever, but right?
*  Yeah, there are certain things that are going to kill brain cells and just aging in general
*  Have you seen the studies on creatine and performance with sleep deprivation?
*  Yeah, it's interesting another thing that not being tested for which I don't think it should be but like creatine adequate doses
*  Interestingly for years we all been told take your five grams, and you're good
*  But what's often not talked about is the fact that that dosage is not going to be widespread the optimal one for every single person
*  You will likely achieve muscle saturation with that dose
*  But it doesn't mean you're gonna get the full suite of benefits depending on your genetics how much you weigh muscle mass
*  metabolism so five grams for a 140 pound person versus a
*  240 yeah, so like some studies have found
*  Increased benefits up to like 20 grams a day
*  Yeah, and if your GI can tolerate it like could be worth trying to see if you get an effect out of you know
*  And then elevate from there do you take it oh, yeah, I take in gummy form that's hard to get an adequate dose though
*  How is that? Well how many gummies you need to take to get five take six it says take three I take six
*  Well, let's let's see what the doses go to try create
*  Okay, so I'm taking seven eight so some of the most recent studies are in like elderly women taking 20 grams well
*  Yeah, I'll start doing that
*  Start with like 10 see if you're gonna tolerate no problem with creatine okay
*  I used to I used to think it made my face fat, but I think I was just eating
*  I think one of the problems with gummies is oftentimes. They're less likely to meet label claims so oh really
*  I don't know if that's like a third-party
*  rigorously tested product or not but
*  Interesting something to be cautious of right and then there's two types right this creatine monohydrate, and then there's another creature
*  What is the other one there's different formats?
*  But some are like HCL is essentially just bound to
*  HCL instead of monohydrate which could be more tolerable for somebody who gets GI distress from monohydrate
*  Thought to be you know water solubility and other things but in general
*  Monohydrate is the one that has the most literature supporting it is tried and true as cheaper easier to access
*  Isn't there some other stuff H something that you take in combination with it?
*  BTA and HCL maybe
*  HMB HMB yeah, that's it. What is that? That's I believe a metabolite of leucine which is like very
*  Basically stimulates mTOR so could be useful for I think people who are not getting a sufficient amount of protein in their diet and need
*  Something to stimulate mTOR for adequate muscle protein synthesis
*  So like I don't know older people who don't get enough protein for example, right it has shown efficacy
*  It's just the situations and contextually where it is the most effective is gonna be somebody who is not eating enough protein
*  But it's like how many people are eating enough protein as well, right? Yeah, it's
*  Some studies have found that you know upwards of one gram per pound of body weight per day could be
*  Beneficial and most people aren't getting that my diet is almost entirely protein. Yeah
*  My diet is mostly pretty fucking hard to get your body weight and protein per day if you're not
*  supplementing with protein you're just eating meat and like
*  Animal derived sources and then even harder if you're a vegetarian too
*  If you're just eating meat and animal derived sources, it's hard for I think for a lot of people to get high-quality
*  Just if you're gonna eat over
*  I don't know a pound and a half to two pounds of meat a day like you could hit your needs pretty easily
*  Yeah, but that's not like a typical person I would say that's most most of my meals are meat
*  Okay, like my breakfast today. I ate like a pound of elk. Yeah, that was my breakfast
*  So what I do is I meal prep for the week on Sunday. So I'll take out of my freezer
*  I take a bunch of elk steaks. Hmm, and I put them on the Traeger
*  I slow cook them at like
*  265 degrees until I get them to the proper internal temperature and then I see room I cut them up and then I put them
*  In like a glass container and put them in my refrigerator and then I pull it out whenever I want to eat
*  So you have how much meat per day?
*  Multiple pounds multiple. Yeah cooked away. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I probably at least three pounds of meat a day
*  Hmm. Yeah, you might be getting I forget how many pounds of meat you need to saturate creatine stores or at least the equivalent of five grams
*  But you'd probably still benefit from trying supplementing more do I do take those gummies?
*  Like I said, it takes six of those a day, but maybe I get the powder, bro
*  I'm gonna take gummies
*  Let's see what's up they don't seem to make you they don't upset my stomach at all
*  It makes you wonder if there's actually you think the crazy in it then Wow
*  I've never had upset stomach from creatine they're taking in the past, but I'm taking it now more consistently
*  That I've ever taken it before because with the gummies, it's so easy. I keep it in the gym
*  I just bust it open. Yeah eat some of them. Yeah. Yeah, it's a taste good, too
*  One of the most slept on supplements for sure
*  I think I kind of got a I don't know like well not as much attention as it deserves
*  Maybe more recently it's gotten a bit more height because of some of the literature around its cognitive
*  effects and whatnot, but it's like super useful for a myriad of things
*  What is the mechanism for it giving you a cognitive?
*  Enhancing benefit. I think it's thought to be like local energy production in the brain. So some people
*  genetically or as the age or what have you have deficiencies in the capacity to produce ATP and if you can like backfill it
*  with like a readily available source of phosphocreatine then you could
*  Basically get it to baseline of where it should be
*  It makes you wonder like people that are on a vegan diet like what what are their creatine levels like
*  Oh, not good enough for sure. There's no way right? Oh, it's impossible
*  Even if you're somebody who eats a lot of meat, you might think you're good. But unless you're eating
*  Multiple pounds a day. It's unlikely that you've saturated stores
*  Well, that's like one of the more insidious things about these people that are
*  Prostitizers we're trying to get people to become vegan and they'll one of the things that they say is it'll improve your athletic performance
*  Which is like straight horse shit. Like I don't know of any elite athlete at the very top of any sport
*  That's a vegan. Do you?
*  No, I know some IFBB pros who are vegan, but really they do a lot to optimize their diets that
*  Requires like special protein
*  Supplements and this and that and a massive amount of steroids
*  Yeah, a lot of them are dope too. Yeah that helps. Yeah, there are definitely successful
*  like people who thrive I think doing vegan diets, but oftentimes it is more meticulous in the planning needed to
*  Like actually make it so you could thrive on it as opposed to like if you're eating enough red meat and whatnot
*  Like you sort of you can be stupid and still cover your bases
*  Right, yeah, so the difference between
*  One thing is like if someone say well a pound of broccoli will equal
*  You know X amount of steak in terms of the amount of protein that's but it's not the same bioavailability
*  Yeah
*  like the amino acid composition is not going to be the same and
*  It might not even stimulate muscle protein synthesis to the capacity that is needed to actually be anabolic. So like some
*  Vegans I would assume
*  Might actually benefit from supplementing with like essential amino acids on top of their meals just because they're not hitting a leucine threshold
*  So and that's where like an HMB also could maybe be have use as well
*  And is creatine is it sourced in a vegan way or is any of it derived from animal sources?
*  That's a good question. I'm not sure but if you can make testosterone from soy, right?
*  I think creatine you probably get
*  Pretty crazy what they can synthesize. Oh dude. Yeah, you would never think that's where you get it from, right?
*  Yeah
*  Well, it just takes so many brilliant people working in so many different capacities to create like all the stuff that we have available right now
*  Yeah, like some dude like took a fucking yam is like hey these
*  Chemicals look similar to these chemicals that we like making our balls
*  Tweak it and like make it let's sell it to people as testosterone. Yeah, I don't even know and it works
*  Yeah, that's what's nuts. It's like super effective. Yeah. Yeah, it's very strange that it's also
*  Kind of derided that like people like look down upon it. Like why would you look down upon anything?
*  Especially as you're an older person. Why would you look down upon anything? It's gonna make you feel better. Yeah
*  No, I think more awareness is coming to it
*  But also in women for HRT, which is you can argue even more of a necessity then at least with
*  Men a lot can maintain residual
*  Hormone production to some capacity that could sustain good health long term
*  but with women once you have menopause like you are guaranteed to have like a complete cessation of
*  estrogen and progesterone production
*  Yeah to where you are guaranteed putting your brain and heart in danger if you don't replace those hormones
*  So it's almost like I don't know like unwinding some of the shitty information that was put out decades ago
*  That's the thing for women. There was a lot of shitty information put out about hormone replacement
*  Yeah, it's I think it was the women's health initiative. They had some study that showed like a
*  relative risk increase in breast cancer or something to the tune of some negligible insignificant amounts and
*  They were also using synthetic drugs as opposed to bio identical
*  So it'd be like the equivalent of me putting you on deca and then being like, oh, well you got cancer
*  So testosterone sucks, right? Yeah, which is fucking ridiculous
*  Yeah, so they were using like horse piss derived estrogens or something and then like some shitty progestin and
*  Determining. Oh HRT is bad because of some also relatively insignificant increase in
*  cancer risk which at least to date in bio identical hormones, we have not seen play out and
*  The upside far outweighs the risk seemingly that we can see right now. It's just not really
*  permeated the I don't know like
*  Masses yet. Well think about how many fucking people aren't testosterone replacement therapy and how few of them, you know that have problems
*  I don't know of anybody that has a problem with it
*  I know of so many people that have been enhanced by it and they feel so much better. They have so much more energy more life
*  Yeah. Yeah, it's a
*  Super impactful and for for women to like no more hot flashes while you're sleeping
*  Your bones aren't gonna degrade at the same rates like your brain is not like Alzheimer's
*  rates and women are like 2x that of men and it's really of
*  It's definitely intertwined with menopause shutting off their hormones Wow
*  Yeah, what there's so much shit information out there?
*  That's what's fucked when you hear about studies that like, you know
*  When the sugar industry funded those studies to demonize saturated fat because they were trying to say the saturated fat was causing heart attacks and
*  Not sugar when you see about and I think they only
*  Paid them like $50,000 or something crazy. Oh my god, you know don't know that well, I didn't know it's 50 grand
*  I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure it's like that's fucked up
*  $50,000 and it ruined and not that if it was a bigger amount of money it would be fine
*  But I mean, it's just shock
*  If they paid him 50 million you know, well, you know, they're unethical
*  But hey if somebody offered me 50 million who knows what I would do
*  No
*  $50,000 and these motherfuckers ruined people for decades and build a one of the portions is ruined like the fucking yeah food pyramid
*  Well, it's like they've they here is yep. There it is 50 years ago sugar industry quietly paid scientists
*  They wound up paying approximately $50,000 in today's dollars for the research. So he's even less than $50,000
*  So it's $50,000 today. So if 50 years ago, that's probably 10 grand
*  Yeah, they've had him 10 grand and these motherfuckers ruined everyone's health. Yeah got people taking margarine
*  Being scared of butter and eggs and and meat
*  Crazy yeah, so your diet is just meat. Yeah, mostly about fruit. I eat fruit
*  Yeah, yeah
*  Because you've been like cycling back and forth between I like fruit before I work out I like fruit after I work out sometimes
*  You know, I like fruit, but I very rarely eat vegetables unless I want to
*  Yeah, like if some asparagus and it's looking good off some asparagus, you know, I mean, I think if I see some Brussels sprouts
*  I eat it for taste sort of like I think of it like pasta except not as bad for you
*  I think it was like oh that would probably taste good. I like to eat some of that
*  I don't think of it as like this is like nutrition and fuel
*  So when I when I eat for nutrition and fuel it's eggs and steak. Yeah, that's
*  90-plus percent of my diet. Have you been following the boxing?
*  Gold medal debacle with that like first of all XY chromosome case closed
*  Yeah, give a fucking egg and this is what the enhanced game wants to do. So the enhanced games, you know, they're developing this
*  Olympic style event and they're they're spending a lot of money on it
*  They have a lot of big investors and they're gonna give real prizes like a million dollars
*  if you win the gold medal instead of zero, which is what the Olympics gives and
*  I asked them I'm like, how are you gonna address like trans athletes and they said we think we're gonna do chromosomes
*  But yeah, yeah, which is really the only way to do it politically, correct? Yeah, you know, you don't say this is not a woman
*  You say what do you chromosome forget it ma'am? What are you chromosomes XY?
*  Ma'am, you got to be in the XY box go over there, but I identify as a woman
*  Get over there get over there apparently they used to do sex testing in the Olympics in the 90s
*  I believe they stopped doing it and then since then it's been like these weird nuanced scenarios with those your testosterone level looking male
*  or whatever and you know, it's uh, it gets nuanced with the type of
*  like
*  Disorder you have because some are far more advantageous than others and if this medical report that was leaked of
*  This boxer is true
*  it's basically the worst offender of the disorders you could have because it's basically like a
*  five alpha reductase deficiency is
*  Basically just depriving your body of DHT
*  But if you have internal testes making testosterone you still have the full functional capacity of a male to build muscle and bone
*  And all the psychoactive effects and all that so lung size heart size now to be determined
*  Which I think that that athlete should
*  Go get the testing to actually disprove it if it was true or if it wasn't true
*  But they would have already done that
*  Whether smoke there's fire, you know
*  I just I think if too many people are calling you a man like there's this one case of
*  There was that runner who?
*  Right, so that's a very different thing. No, I was like potentially the same thing really. Yes, it's XY chromosome. I
*  had internal testes XY chromosomes five alpha reductase deficiency and
*  Had the testosterone levels of a male because of the internal testes
*  And you might grow up thinking that you are female because you haven't had adequate sexual
*  Differentiation and maturation from the lack of DHT. So it's almost like the equivalent to putting a
*  Kid at birth on like a megadosa finasteride or deutasteride and wiping out their DHT
*  So they still grow up with male level muscle development from the testosterone
*  But no masculine not sufficient
*  Masculinization to differentiate you and mature you completely from the DHT. Well, let's see
*  What is the latest on this? So let's find out what is the leaked story on this boxer and
*  Find out like like has anybody analyzed this is there any like conclusion that anybody's drawn?
*  I don't think so. I think it's still is the leaked report legit or not and story I could find this is November 6th
*  Confirms the live Olympic boxing champion launching legal action over medical alligator, but this is just about the legal
*  I know I'm just looking for any story about it having updated information
*  This was the most recent story was written then anything else was from October
*  Where it was saying that she's also saddened by the abuse she has received
*  Do you think they go back and edit this if it turns out she's a man?
*  He's saddened by the abuse that he's received
*  It was it was about the claims that they were stripped of their title or the gold medal. Oh, that's not true
*  No, they haven't been stripped
*  So if they're suing over that that they they can actually win that lawsuit over they're suing over something in the French media
*  Because they've gotten
*  And I feel like the Olympic Committee probably has to lean into you know, the whole
*  Politically correct angle of it to to not get the scrutiny of you let this person punch women in the head, of course, of course
*  Yeah, she'd never felt a punch like this. Yeah, so what they have all sports too. Yeah fucking fighting people
*  Yeah, it's pretty crazy. But so what is the leaked report Jamie find out what the leaked report?
*  Excuse me the leaked report on this person is that's what this has to do with it
*  I understand what it has to do with it, but find out what the actual leak report is like what is the leak report?
*  I
*  Think it was the
*  Basically assessment of internal testicles. Yeah
*  Okay, French journalists, but it's been there's been multiple studies or multiple
*  Articles written saying that this person has XY chromosomes. That was a supposed failed gender eligibility
*  test from some
*  Organization that yeah International Boxing Association
*  Did not allow her to participate in 2023 World Championships after she failed gender eligibility test
*  But the International Olympic Committee did authorize her presence at Paris 2024
*  But here's the thing like is this when when they say the International Olympic Committee did authorize what are they by what?
*  Yeah, this is the crazy thing is apparently their criteria was that you are female on your passport
*  Oh
*  But it's like, you know, if you look female at birth you easily could if you have this disorder
*  So Dylan Mulvaney change their passport to a female probably
*  Find out can you change your passport to female if you're transgender? I think you can
*  Yeah, I don't know if Dylan Mulvaney did it. I guess so low barrier to like you just have like a fucking ID piece
*  That says you're female therefore we're gonna ignore
*  Testis. Yeah, like what the fuck the whole thing is so crazy
*  This this is one of the weirder aspect and the reason why people harp on it so much
*  Why is everybody so obsessed with trans?
*  Because this is why because it's bizarre no medical documentation. You do not need to provide medical documentation to change your gender marker
*  So this is for on US passport. You can select M for male F for female or X for unspecified
*  Or another gender identity so you can have X on your passport
*  I think I'm gonna get that so no medical documentary so I could be a female I could just say I'm a female show up with a
*  full beard
*  Genetic marker you select doesn't need to match your gender on your citizenship evidence or photo ID
*  So the reason why this works is I don't know what's going on inside you. I don't know how you feel
*  I I'm I could be arrogant and
*  Completely
*  Not compassionate and I could just decide that you're just full of shit you're a guy or you could be in agony
*  Going through life feeling like a woman and not understanding why you have a dick. I
*  Think there's that too, but like I talked about in my comedy special
*  perverts
*  Disappeared like the flu during kovat like they don't exist anymore
*  Like a guy in a dress who gets a hard-on going into the women's room is a woman now
*  They used to be psychos
*  It used to be like Norman Bates in the movie psycho dressed up like his mom
*  Silence of the lambs it puts the lotion in the basket
*  It was like there was if you wanted to make someone in a movie scarier you put him in a dress
*  Yeah, he took a psycho killer you made him dress like a woman like oh this guy's fucking crazy
*  And then somewhere we just decided that doesn't exist anymore
*  And so there's no perverts and so anyone who just says they're a woman gets to go in the women's room go in the women's
*  Locker play in women's sports and you're completely ignoring this
*  Subset of society that has always been fucking terrifying to people
*  Creepy guys who dress up like women who pretend to be women or just perverts
*  I just want to sneak around women's room and smell their shit
*  There's people that are out of their mind and you've given them a hall pass
*  Yeah, yeah like I could empathize with somebody who
*  Didn't know and then would became aware of it and then once they became aware of it. They stopped competing
*  It would suck. Yeah for everyone involved obviously, but like I could understand like how shitty of a predicament that is
*  Yes, but it's like the onus is on you once you've been assessed to not compete anymore, right?
*  And to like confirm what the fuck is going on. Yeah, go fight guys
*  Yeah, and it's like even if you're at a disadvantage like well, it doesn't mean you fight girls at your advantage exactly
*  Yeah, yeah, if you're a disadvantaged fighting guys, you probably shouldn't be fighting. Yeah, like how many girls are
*  Transitioning and then fighting men or competing against men zero. Well, also here's the other argument. There is a spectrum, right?
*  So there are guys with naturally lower testosterone that a guy's like say yo, well Romero
*  Yo, well Romero has an advantage over almost everybody. Hmm, you know when it comes to like genetics
*  He's just like a fucking specimen from God, right?
*  So you got that which is the rarest of rare, right?
*  And then you have a guy like, you know fill in the blank. There's like a bunch of fighters in the UFC
*  I don't want to disparage anybody
*  But there's a bunch of guys you look at me like that's not specimen but super tough super technical works real hard
*  Very intelligent in their approach and they managed to fight really well
*  but if they go up against the guy who's a
*  Freak just a physical freak and that guy works just as hard and is just as intelligent and just as methodical in their training
*  They're gonna have an advantage just a natural God-given advantage. Just the universe has kissed them with genetics and those people exist man
*  And so you can't say well, then that guy should be able to fight women now because he can't beat yo
*  Oh Romero, like that's stupid. Yeah, that's fucking stupid. And it's also you're not protecting women
*  I thought that the left was all about protecting women like this was the whole thing about progressives protect people that are like
*  Not as safe like I don't generally worry about women raping me
*  Never yeah never in my life. Have I been in a bar? I hope some woman doesn't try to rape me
*  I hope someone doesn't try to root for me and get my dick hard and no one ever thinks that way
*  But women walk through life worrying about getting roofied or getting raped or getting dragged into an alleyway
*  They worry about that guys don't worry about that. It's just a completely different dynamic
*  so when you're comparing like trans this and trans that like
*  There's not a guy I've ever talked to in my life
*  that doesn't
*  That is even remotely concerned with a trans man going into the men's room
*  Yeah, I don't give a fuck if like what's that person that was?
*  Chas Bono Chas Bono Sonny Bono's daughter that became a man
*  Chas can come in the men's room. I don't give a fuck
*  It doesn't even freak me out at all
*  if Chas is in the men's room and I have a
*  Two year old son with me that I have to take into the bathroom go to the bathroom
*  I'm not worried about Chas Bono, but I am worried about a pervert if I if I was a guy and
*  I had a
*  Daughter and she was like 10 years old and she went into the women's room
*  And then I saw a man with a fucking five o'clock shadow and a wig on
*  Go into the bathroom behind her and I couldn't go in the men
*  I couldn't go in the women's room and see what's going on
*  I go
*  I don't know that might just be a really kind person who identifies as a woman it happens to have a beard or it could
*  Be a complete fucking psycho which are real things and by being this compassionate person
*  I'm supposed to ignore the the reality of psychos
*  Yeah, that's crazy. Yeah, this is where it becomes like a cult like this is where it becomes like you're
*  Indoctrinated into this very rigid ideology that you can't stray from at all
*  And if you do you're you're cast out of the kingdom forever. You're you're a heretic. You're a terrible person
*  Yeah fucked up man, it's I don't really know
*  Even the the scrutiny on it. I don't really know how they
*  Don't acknowledge how absurd it is like it's when you watch people defend it. They have to do mental
*  Gymnastics. Yeah, it just you ever see that conversation that I had with Adam Conover about it. No. Oh
*  Oh, it was one of the most brutal conversations of all time. It's about trans women in sports and also this was like a debate
*  Well, it didn't turn out to be it wasn't planned out
*  It just it just came about because he was doing you know
*  He's just we were talking about it and it got to the subject of trans women competing and his position was like
*  I'm in favor of a sport that's more inclusive
*  So if that makes it more inclusive for the trans woman and he was like in favor of hormone blockers for children that they've always known
*  They're a woman like what the fuck you don't have any kids
*  You don't know what kids are like you can tell your kids
*  Werewolf like stay keep away from the full moon. You're a werewolf. Oh, I always knew like their kids
*  Their brains not formed and also they want to please you and if you're a fuck
*  How many fucking Hollywood psychos have trans kids?
*  How many people were they fly the flag of inclusivity and they're they're a proud progressive?
*  And I'm proud that I have a queer child
*  How much of that is your influence is it 0% because I bet it's not I bet there's some sort of reinforcement of that
*  It's just like the the numbers are so extraordinary when you have parents that have three trans kids. You're like what?
*  Three what are the odds of that and you're nuts?
*  You're a nutty actress and you have three trans kids. What's going on here?
*  What's going on here
*  And you're not allowed to say it if you say anything you say oh this person who's clearly mentally ill might actually be mentally ill and
*  Might actually have munchausen syndrome
*  you know like they might be doing something terrible to their child because they're just fucking nuts and they want a trans kid like so they
*  Could fly it as a they could put their pride flag on their fucking front door and they feel like a better person
*  There are people like that and then there are also people that are just compassionate people that want people to be free and do whatever
*  You want they want you to have complete freedom to express yourself. I don't care if a guy wears a dress wear a dress man
*  If that's what you like, I don't care. You want to paint your nails want to have lipstick on?
*  I don't give a fuck have a good time. I want you to be happy. I'll be your friend
*  Just don't try to compete against women in sports
*  That's fucking nuts and don't try to make women uncomfortable by walking with your dick out in the women's locker room
*  this
*  how about the guy in Canada that's 50 years old that identifies as a
*  Teenage girl was competing in like young girls swimming and they they allowed him because Canada like you know
*  You live there off the rails you live in a communist shithole that place is nuts
*  Yeah, and they allow some of the most bananas trans stuff of all time
*  They on taxpayer money in Canada. They paid for a guy to develop breast milk
*  Do you know this story now? Oh, yeah has an adopted child paid for them paid for this person
*  lactate
*  Imagine the toxic milk that's coming out of this man. They're in this like what is in there like water
*  Are you generating you don't even have the glands for it like what's actually being secreted there? What is that?
*  Yeah, it's like if you asked me would it be good milk quality from some guy on trend or deca?
*  And he's just fucking secreting shit of his nipples. I'd be like fuck. No, dude. Fuck. No, yeah, like what is happening?
*  What is in that milk?
*  What is that gonna do to the baby that's sucking on it and all in the name of inclusive?
*  Inclusivity all in the name of being a kind compassionate open-minded person. That's not open-minded
*  That's nuts
*  And it's cowardly because you're afraid to say what you know to be true because you don't want to suffer the repercussions
*  You don't want to be called a transphobe whatever the fuck that means. You don't want to be called a bigot
*  You don't want to be called any of these things. So you'll go along with some of the most preposterous ideas
*  including
*  Pretending that perverts don't exist. Yeah, I hope I don't know if Pierre is gonna get into
*  Winning the election and get Trudeau out but God seems like a reasonable guy
*  Well, he seems way more reasonable than Trudeau who seems completely insane. Yeah, and like candidly
*  I'm not like a political expert by any fucking means at all. So don't take anything. I'm saying seriously
*  apparently last time I was here people thought I was like by not
*  Saying anything about it. I was like endorsing Trudeau or something. I was like saying anything. I don't know
*  There was like comments about how like Derek knows better. He knows who this PR guy is
*  I'm like, I just don't follow this shit like I should probably yeah, but he yeah, he seems a
*  reasonable and in contrast to true. Oh, he's like a fucking
*  Full-on long show full on lunatic who's completely changed his tune on so many different things including going after guns
*  What they did with the trucker the trucker strike, yeah, like the debanking thing you guys talked about recently
*  It's like not new news in Canada. I know yeah
*  Well, they did it to people who donated yeah to the trucker convoy, which is really crazy
*  So you just say hey these people shouldn't be mandated to get a vaccine that has you know a safety profile
*  That's really like we don't really know yet. We don't know there's no long-term studies
*  We don't really know what's gonna happen and you're just like mandating this
*  Yeah, why why I don't have to do it why you making me do it it turned out you really didn't have to do it
*  So this is what what's turned out now?
*  You know, was it the here? I'll send it to you Jamie. So they released a study
*  Recently where the actual government went and looked over here
*  I'll say this so they went and looked over what the actual results were from the pandemic and
*  the findings are
*  They're you know, not that shocking to anybody who was actually paying attention
*  But completely contrary to what the instructions were when we were young and this or when you know, COVID was recent rather
*  So COVID-19 this is the house released a 500 page report on COVID-19 pandemic key findings
*  COVID-19 likely originated from a lab related incident in Wuhan China crazy you get banned from YouTube for saying that banned
*  Okay over two hundred billion dollars in relief funds lost to fraud with criminals exploiting
*  Weak oversight prolonged lockdowns and arbitrary mandates caused severe harm
*  economic devastation mental health crises and
*  Historic learning loss while lacking robust scientific support policies ignored natural immunity pushing mandates
*  That eroded trust and harmed public perception of science. Absolutely
*  WHO and CDC compromised by political interference offering
*  inconsistent unscientific guidance that fueled public distrust and the key players included federal agencies and Cuomo's
*  administration actively obstructed oversight efforts and hid critical evidence
*  Select subcommittee on coronavirus pandemic basically said all the conspiracy theorists were correct every single one of them
*  No repercussions no retractions no apology from Rachel Maddow none of it
*  Yeah, man, it's uh, yeah in Canada. The lockdowns were pretty absurd
*  I don't hear they were it depended on the state and whatever but Canada was like get your vaccines
*  You're not leaving to go anywhere. Yeah. Yeah crazy
*  Did you have to take it? Yeah, dude fucking sucked. Did you have a side effect?
*  No, well at least that I could tell and I've never do a D dimer test. Yes
*  Oh, that's good. Well from what I understand
*  I talked to a friend of mine who's very knowledgeable in this and he said that one of the real problems was the lack of
*  Aspiration that they didn't aspirate when they injected people even when they did Biden on television
*  They just jam that thing into his arm and shot it in there
*  So is it supposed to stay like a local or something?
*  The idea about it was it's supposed to stay local right supposed to local but apparently there's been
*  If you talk to Brett Weinstein a bunch of other people's there's a lot of debate as to whether or not it is ever local
*  that they've been able to find the evidence of the spike protein all throughout the body and
*  The the issue though was if you didn't aspirate and you went right into a blood vessel. Oh
*  So that could be the cause of myocarditis all these different neurological conditions all these different things
*  So the lipid nanoparticles and this vaccine gets in your system your body reacts to it like it's being attacked
*  Right. Well if it gets to the heart your heart doesn't heal right?
*  Which is why your heart doesn't get cancer your heart scars like your liver heals your liver regenerates
*  You could lose half your liver, you know, you can donate half your liver to someone and it'll grow back in weeks
*  Yeah, liver's resilient. It's nuts
*  But your heart's not like that so the heart scars over and it leads to you know, enlargement of the heart myocarditis pericarditis
*  So this is the thought this is what my friend told me who's a very intelligent person
*  I want to name him
*  but he said that the real issue is that they didn't aspirate and a significant number of people that are
*  Experiencing these long-term issues from the vaccine. It's because it went right into their bloodstream when it was supposed to be intramuscular
*  there is a
*  Several times now because especially if you're on TRT, you're probably more
*  Understanding of how to inject yourself almost than somebody who's like a random pharmacist
*  That just jamming people as fast as they want every single day
*  Just as part of their gig and you're kind of risking it if you just let somebody else pin you like sometimes you feel like
*  You know, hey, can I do this?
*  Right. Yeah, right, but even then like if you jam it into your arm, it's possible that you could hit a blood vessel
*  Yeah, have you ever heard of trend cough I have what is that? Yeah, so it's thought to be that if you get into
*  Like you nick a vein or something or you'd like hit a blood vessel for example
*  And you get some of it bleeding immediately into systemic circulation rather than being intramuscular entirely
*  It goes very quickly up to your lungs and you basically have a coughing fit get induced by your body trying to like expel
*  Whatever is there and so like I could absolutely see something that wasn't meant to go
*  Immediately into systemic circulation being more problematic like with trend cough. I've experienced it personally back in the day
*  This is like one of the most sobering things about bodybuilding is if you get trend cough, it's like the most pathetic
*  Scenario you'll ever find yourself in because you're just this muscle-bound dude who just injected yourself with like cattle steroids
*  And you're just looking at yourself in the mirror hacking up along sweating your fucking face off like what am I doing with my life?
*  You can't get around it other than just like cough along for three minutes
*  It takes three minutes for it to go it depends but like how much you have and all this a bunch of stuff
*  But yeah
*  It's like basically if it happens you can feel it coming on you just like fucking brace yourself on the sink
*  And you can get ready to hack up along for a few minutes
*  Jesus and is it a
*  Consistent thing or is it a one-time thing like right after injection or is it something it's after injection
*  But it's like you know who knows what that does once you get like solvents and fucking you know like
*  Whatever else is in your compound in your solution into systemic circulation immediately like I don't know
*  What is trend is something that the craziest of people that I know have taken including like jujitsu guys
*  That really want to get super jack they take trend
*  And I'm like what is it about the trend and they apparently get like ultra violent when they're on trend yeah, so it's a
*  unique compound that was called trend balloon is that what it's yeah, and it used to be
*  Used in for like I forgot what the clinical application was but it was a pharmaceutical approved
*  Steroid back in the 80s and then was you know basically taken off the market similar to around the same time that
*  Interestingly enough Biden was the one who spearheaded getting like steroids
*  Scheduled essentially Biden did yeah, he was like a forefront of pushing for the banning of them or scheduling
*  I don't have muscles. Nobody has muscles
*  Yeah
*  and that's like he's blamed often by the
*  Bodybuilding community for the lack of refinements and anabolic steroids because now we're stuck with the same drugs
*  We've been using since like the 80s
*  so like every drug category has had
*  Significant refinements over the years to make them more effective less side-effect ridden etc like GLP one medications for example
*  highly effective and
*  Constantly being like lightning through pipelines to create really really refined ones that are less problematic
*  And with steroids that was being done in the 80s and then once there was you know the Ben Johnson
*  Debacle I believe it was yeah that brought all this you know public outcry as Canadian
*  Getting tested positive for a wind stroll. I think and people were like is this just gonna become like a fucking
*  Like chemical warfare essentially in the Olympics and whoever's dope the most is gonna win people are freaking out and the response was
*  Biden getting it including testosterone scheduled
*  Wow, yeah, and then there was this huge stigma developed around them and the taboo of being on steroids was developed
*  and that's kind of what led to this probably slowing down progress decades and
*  Likely preventing people from getting steroids developed that were far less likely to kill them
*  Yeah, so we get up like a really refined
*  highly effective compounds by now that
*  Don't make your heart explode if you just if they just continued probably well
*  I know that one state I think it was Oregon
*  Essentially decriminalized everything I think they've taken that back now because I think it was like a just Oregon's a disaster
*  Portland in particular like you go
*  There's just needles and drug addicts and it's like open-air drug marts everywhere
*  Because all the homelessness and the camping on the street the tent situation
*  There's fucking nuts and they're super tolerant progressive people so like overwhelmingly
*  Right so they just
*  Look at it like in terms of compassion for these people we need to fund them and you're basically giving them money to stay homeless
*  It's really nuts. So when a society like that
*  Decriminalizes everything we're just gonna have fucking people are gonna go haywire with meth and and you know
*  And whatever the else they want to get but they also did it with steroids. They did it with everything
*  They essentially decriminalized all drugs hmm, but I think they took did they take that back Jamie?
*  I would be curious even if it was decriminalized though what the access would be like because it's still gonna be contingent on
*  Compounding pharmacies being able to make stuff legally which from what I understand is actually getting worse
*  Scrutiny as opposed to like it getting better. I'm a scrutinizing peptides now, which is yeah really crazy
*  Oregon law rolling back drug decriminalization takes effect making possession a crime again
*  So is it of all things did they just change the law totally?
*  So as a democratic controlled legislature passed the recriminalization law in March
*  Overhauling a measure approved by 58% of voters in 2020 that made possessing illicit drugs like heroin
*  Punishable by a ticket and a maximum $100 fine the measure directed hundreds of millions of dollars in cannabis tax revenue towards addiction services
*  But the money was slow to get out the door at a time when the fentanyl crisis was causing a spike in deadly overdoses and health officials
*  Grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic. We're struggling to stand up the new treatment system
*  state auditors found
*  Okay, so they just couldn't keep up with what was they didn't follow through with the whole idea of these
*  Addiction centers and rehabilitation centers
*  Yeah, and like some of this stuff is like I don't even know how much it would help being able to possess
*  Something when you can't even get it prescribed to begin with right you can't manufacture it
*  Yeah, like if you if you're allowed to get cocaine if you're allowed to possess cocaine
*  Well, you buying fentanyl a's cocaine from the cartel like what do you yeah like in Canada? It's not a
*  I'm pretty sure it's not a crime to possess steroids, but to sell it and distribute it
*  It is a crime and there's still no pharmacies that are making like pharmaceutical grade
*  Steroids that aren't testosterone could a pharmacy make it and give it away
*  Have you had some Elon Musk type?
*  Person I don't think so probably not right so if it's decriminalized and you're allowed to possess it
*  Are you allowed to make it? No, I think just like the process of distributing
*  I don't even know but I know like oxandral and for example, Anovar was recently like banned entirely and it's been
*  Allowed to be prescribed for certain neat like hyper specific niche purposes for decades
*  It's been around since the 80s and it's banned in America as well. Yeah, like recently it was added to like
*  It was basically D approved. But why good question a parent? I but you can still get the COVID-19 vaccine
*  Yeah, easily. They'll still tell you to get it. Yeah
*  Try to give it to kids. Yeah
*  Yeah
*  It's crazy because like how many people are dying from Anovar?
*  not many
*  Yeah, like what's the numbers? It's like what is like Brazil nut deaths?
*  They it's definitely not the safe is safe drug, but I mean like it's you know, when it's used appropriately it can be fine, right?
*  Yeah, but there's not a crisis. No. Yeah, that's the thing. It's like why are you passing laws when there's not an issue?
*  yeah, I don't know what the effect of RFK will be but it sounds like
*  He might be able to influence things now in like a positive direction to that stuff. He looks a little saucy
*  Oh for sure. He's 70. He's I think he admitted that he's on TRT
*  Clearly, I mean if you you would have to be the craziest genetic freak of all time to carry that kind of muscle mass at 70
*  Naturally. Yeah. Yeah, so that's good. And he also is open to the idea of
*  Changing the classification of psychedelics as well, which I think is gonna be really important to people
*  There's a lot of things that morons are preventing society from using and that's really all it is people who are ignorant to the effects
*  Ignorance to the writ they're ignorant to all of it and they're compromised
*  Generally by pharmaceutical drug companies. Yeah, I definitely think psychedelics have utility one thing
*  I do see that freaks me out those people
*  Permanently changing their brain chemistry with like heavy ayahuasca exposure or whatever. Oh, yeah. Well, have you seen uh,
*  I've seen multiple cases of this on social media as well as in real life people have gone like retreats and then come back
*  Unrecognizable in their demeanor and how they behave and not in a good way like like weirdos. Yeah. Oh, yeah
*  I know a few. Yeah, like have you seen a liver King recently? No, what's going on?
*  He seems like I don't like borderline schizophrenic now
*  Okay, but is that also I think he was mentally ill, right? Maybe I would have listened
*  Let me just classify my definition of mentally illness is someone who lies. I think it's a mental illness
*  Okay, I think lying when it's really obvious. Yeah, like, you know if I try to tell people I'm six foot three
*  That's an obvious lie if I say that over and over again until somebody comes up with a ruler
*  That's crazy. You have to be a crazy person
*  That's a mental illness if you lie and say you're black and you're actually white and you like work for the NAACP
*  Like the Rachel Dolezal lady kind of mentally ill right? Yeah, that's meant that's a mental. There's something wrong
*  You're not like not thinking clear and you're doing a thing that we generally like universally says a bad thing which is lying
*  Right, so if you're doing that you're lying about taking steroids when it's super obvious you're on steroids
*  You're 46 years old. You look like a fucking superhero. You're right. It's just super jacked
*  You know and then gets caught. Okay, so now he has to come out and say that he's now imagine
*  You've never been famous and then all of a sudden you are really really famous really quickly over the course of a few years
*  Like social media all over tick-tock your profile is elevated to the point where you could say to the regular person's tree
*  You know who liver King is like, oh, yeah that roided up guy
*  Everybody knows who he is then the hate because your labs come out and finds out he's on a shitload of things
*  This guy's juice to the tits obviously for a guy like you or a guy like me
*  We look at a guy like that like you've got to be on the juice
*  You don't even look remotely normal. They everyone says that though, too, but a lot of people believe them
*  Well, a lot of people are just ignorant right? Yeah, but the people that knew like yourself
*  100% you knew that that guy was on steroids, right? So then
*  imagine the
*  Anxiety that comes with being exposed and then the hate now
*  I don't this dude
*  I don't know what this dude does in terms of like social media if he reads comments, but just imagine the
*  psychological effect of being
*  Bombarded by people calling you a piece of shit and a liar and a fraud all
*  day long
*  Every time you check your Instagram or whatever you got your YouTube the comments are filled
*  With people who hate you. Yeah filled with it
*  And you're just like sitting there stewing in your own shit and just freaking out about your decisions and your your brain probably gets
*  overrun by stress
*  Yeah, yeah. Yeah for sure. It's uh
*  I don't even know for for him specifically either if he did psychedelics or not
*  I'm pretty sure he's talked about it openly
*  But it was just like some of the videos were really odd and it kind of reflected behavior
*  I've seen of people who have like experiences gone awry
*  Yeah, certainly not representative of what happens if it's done properly. Well, I think it depends on if it's done properly to who?
*  Yeah, like your baseline state and like what you're yeah
*  I think there's people like this is the argument that Alex Berenson said had when he wrote that book, you know
*  He used to write for the New York Times
*  He wrote a book called tell your children and it's all his argument is that marijuana is not safe for everybody
*  Right is safe for a lot of people. I know a lot of people use marijuana all the time
*  They don't have any problems, but I do know
*  Multiple people that have gone schizophrenic for marijuana
*  No, is it they were going schizophrenic anyway, and then these high dose marijuana experiences were the tipping point
*  We don't really know but we do know there's a correlation and I've seen it
*  I've seen it with multiple people where they were really normal and then all of a sudden they start talking to you about like, you know
*  like someone's talking to them and their head and there's a chip and
*  Elon Musk is gonna have them be the king of Mars and like people lose their shit man
*  And they they go into this world of paranoid fantasy and delusion and it's
*  Horrible to see especially to someone that you care about. It's really fucking weird kills your REM sleep to marijuana does
*  Yeah, well if you're using it like to sleep it can reduce sleep latency, but significantly harms REM sleep
*  So you might not be getting quality sleep every night which exacerbates the effect definitely fucks with your dreams
*  Yeah, you know how I know this
*  Sober October when we do sober October like immediately have these wild dreams like super vivid dreams
*  I'm like, where are these things been? So like for the whole month is crazy
*  Do you track the sleep metrics when you're doing sober October verse? No, I was doing it for a while with whoop
*  I was like checking my recovery. I wasn't that I'm basically a feel person. Like how do I feel?
*  I'm pretty good at knowing how I feel and if I feel well rested if I got eight hours sleep and I feel well rested
*  I'm not even gonna check mine. I don't care. I feel great. Let's go. Let's go
*  I just like I think so much of it is mental
*  You know so much of is like the energy that you have to approach your day is
*  Enthusiasm and health, you know, that's where your energy generally comes from
*  Yeah, the stress of tracking can sometimes like defeat the purpose as well for some people
*  I think it's also you know, I've heard people talk about like addiction, you know
*  Like how many people are addicted their phones most of us, right?
*  There's an addiction to checking like health metrics
*  There's a and there's also an addiction like competing but I would say that that's an addiction that's fairly positive
*  Because you're addicted to these numbers that are correlated with health benefits. So it's like what is addiction?
*  Okay, if you're a gambling addict and you're losing your house and your children don't have food. Okay, that's a detrimental addiction
*  Detrimental addiction but if you're addicted to exercise and you're super fit because of it
*  You're gonna live longer and you're healthy as fuck and you look great
*  Is that really an addiction? I'm not sure if we're talking about the same thing
*  We're talking about the same kind of pattern but like I've been addicted to a lot of things
*  I've been addicted to martial arts for sure
*  Like if I don't I would be like out in public and if people if people were boring to me
*  I'd be thinking of combinations. I'd be like talking to them. I wasn't thinking about what they were saying
*  I was thinking about how it hit them. I think about like if they step like this then I go at that
*  But what if I step here? I would like working out footwork and I would do it in my head because I was an addict
*  But I was addicted to something that was very positive. Yeah. No, it's uh
*  You need somewhere to attribute your I don't know dopamine too. I guess yeah, if it's positive
*  It's like probably the best thing you could hope for as long as you don't go over the top
*  It's pretty difficult to do with health right? So well, you can break yourself down with overtraining
*  You know, I would say that my good friend David Goggins is broken his body with overtraining
*  He's he's got no cartilage in his knees and he's running thousands of miles. He's a complete psychopath
*  He must be in agony like every step he takes and he does not give a fuck
*  He just keeps going it's really crazy to see his doctor looked at his knees and said this is from him directly
*  He said I don't know how you could walk on these knees forget about run thousands of miles
*  Yeah, they had a cut his his knee because it's bone-on-bone
*  His bone was distorting so much by growing to kind of like deal with the inflammation and like it's like some
*  I forget what it's called something wolf syndrome something so they had a cut his leg
*  Cut his fucking tibia bone and shift it down so that it's flat
*  So they could run flat bone-on-bone
*  Dude it's madness
*  It's even more madness is the guys who get their tibia
*  Smashed open and femur and then get height increasing. So that's crazy
*  Do you do we found that one guy was like six to who did it, dude?
*  I'm doing a podcast with him in two days. What is it called? I got my knees done
*  Is that way he took his page down though, didn't he? Yeah, I think he was off social media for a while and
*  I
*  was actually gonna do a podcast with him last year and then it didn't end up working out and he's
*  Available and into the idea still so that's what is he fully healed now. He went from six foot to six foot six
*  Jesus Christ look at the size of him and this is him wheeling himself around
*  And he was a massive guy too. Look at the size of his fucking arm
*  Yeah, the guy is like a genetic freak for muscle for sure and let's become taller. They're cranking their legs
*  Not so basically they go in and shove these rods into your legs
*  either in the tibia or the femur or you can do both if you want to max out and
*  you can basically micro adjust stretch it to create a separation between the bone which then fills in with new bone over time and
*  This is him seven months after the lengthening process
*  Legs look like dude why I got sweatpants on see what those little toothpicks look like
*  Yeah, so this guy went from like nuts
*  I don't know what his original height was but he's six feet now and he was like I think five six or five seven
*  That's crazy. So I have a lot of questions about is your athleticism permanently fuck now
*  Are you ever gonna be able to squat again? You know, like right what's life like now? What was the surgery process?
*  Rehabilitation you what are your mechanics?
*  Change if the learn how to do everything the distance between your shin like your kneecap and your foot if that changes
*  Dramatically like your whole timing is different. I have more a different leverage that everything's different
*  What does it do to your hips? Yeah, you know
*  Are you gonna wear your hips out earlier like your body's probably like has to compensate for these freakishly long shins now
*  Yeah, and this guy too. He's a unique
*  Phenomenon even among the people doing this crazy surgery because he got the full six inches
*  Which is not necessarily typical having both
*  bones broken to do it and then
*  Maxing it out at the weight he's at too
*  So he has to support the recovery unlike I can imagine seemingly like 300 plus frame or something
*  She's yeah, right. So a lot of people who get it done are like five six trying to become like five way 150
*  Yeah, right, it's still probably fucking insane regardless insane
*  Yeah, but it's just you're only stretching one bone, right?
*  Yeah, I have to are they doing the tibia as well it you pick so the tibia and the fibula rather
*  Yes, both of them femur or tibia or both
*  Yeah, I could be miss speaking but I'm pretty sure it's one or the other and both yeah
*  He has both done and he like maxed it
*  Yeah, so he's a recovery like yeah good question so so this is this guy after how long
*  A couple weeks after he gets his surgery done. No, no, no after he gets the bars pull off
*  It's all it's like week by week. I think jumping after height surgery. Oh, look how skinny his legs are
*  So he's pretty skinny. So this is him in the beginning. He's trying to do it
*  I would be terrified to do that. See I would be my curiosity is how athletic were they prior and then what is their maximal?
*  like what's their max out point of recovery in contrast to their baseline because
*  Yeah, you could show me a box jump that looks like you're somewhat functional
*  Yes, they like stick a rod in it and micro I
*  Think like a year probably or I don't know months over a year you're walking around with these like iron shin plates
*  Yeah, yeah, it's pretty nuts, dude
*  And getting all the bitches now
*  Yeah
*  Looking all sexy and tall now
*  There was one guy Jamie that you pulled up before who had it done and they showed him doing some
*  Athlete athletic drills like cone drills and coordination drills and he looked fucking great
*  He looked like a real athlete even though he got it done. It didn't look like it was unless he's just
*  Unbelievably athletic before and maintained a lot of it
*  I would like to know like did you have a decrease like could you what I mean you obviously look insane right now
*  But what you used to be able to be able to do
*  Yeah, some of the stuff I'm curious about too is like how much of the content you see online is like sponsored
*  versus actual like user content just reviewing their experience because you could see like for example hair transplants
*  tons of people get sent like fully paid to go get a
*  Transplant done as long as they speak positively about it and whatever so imagine a guy who's getting like
*  Specialized attention which you would want if you're getting your fucking legs broken and you're getting it covered or whatever
*  You just make sure you talk about it positively right how much of that content is like legit versus
*  You know somewhat manufactured. That's a very good point. Yeah, that's also one of those things where if you're a social media influencer you
*  Probably want to appear like you're doing all the right things
*  Yeah, you would never want to admit that you fucked yourself up for height increasing surgery. I can't walk right
*  I'm in pain all the time. I can't run anymore
*  You'd become the case study for like why did not do it? Yeah, yeah
*  I wonder I mean I wonder like what kind of an effect that would have on your mechanics
*  I really do I would imagine for martial arts like, you know where everything is like
*  Like if I'm throwing a kick, I know
*  Exactly where my shin is gonna land from the distance that I'm at
*  Yeah, I've got like this mine my mind is coordinated for this short body
*  I know exactly how much distance I have to cover if all of a sudden you add six inches to that
*  Oh, yeah, you're all your everything is weird
*  Dude, even gaming even gaining a bit of muscle can throw off your depth perception of how strong like for example when I was in
*  High school I played basketball and I started working out in
*  grade 11 and gained like 50 pounds in a year and
*  my three-pointer that used to be just like
*  Just fucking money every time I knew exactly how to shoot the ball like it was you know
*  Just second nature to because you've been doing it for a decade or whatever
*  And then all of a sudden you add this extra force production that you're not accounting for
*  All of a sudden everything's thrown off. Oh and also you're sore all the time because you're lifting which makes you tight
*  Yeah, I became a brick house after that. It's a giant problem with pool, you know
*  Playing pool when I lift weights and then play pool it takes like an hour before I can loosen up and play good
*  Oh, I guess I'm everything's off. It's like my arms not listening, right?
*  It's all stiff like for pool you want to like when I'm playing really well. I'm barely holding on to that cue
*  It's like I'm almost letting the cue do all the work
*  It's like a very gentle thing
*  but then when I've been doing a heavy kettlebell session, and then I try to play pools like
*  Everything's just
*  Tight and goofy and clunky and you kill you don't feel it like pool is like a feel game
*  Like you're feeling how many rotations you're putting on the ball to get it to move to the next position
*  Like literally you're within one or two rotations correctly
*  Yeah, and that's the difference between getting into an area where you can make the next shot or not. Yeah, so it's all
*  Feel like these got like Fedor Ghorst who's like one of the best players in the world
*  He changed cues he changed cue companies
*  The same weight the same like taper the same tip millimeter
*  And he said his shot was about 10% off. He was 6 to 10% off. I was like what like how he's like
*  Just it's off. It takes a while to recalibrate
*  Yeah, this is one of those examples where like, you know an MMA to like if you gain a bunch of muscle from
*  Drugs even like it's not necessarily beneficial your mobility could be inhibited flexibility
*  Gas out quicker even in BGG
*  It's like and you can sauce to the tits but like it might not be helpful to the capacity
*  You can actually push it right, you know
*  You might gas out quicker all of a sudden you can't do things that you used to do
*  I think the key is moderation in lifting in regard to unless you're on the sauce
*  You know if you're doing anything like MMA or any skill based thing because as soon as you're tight and sore
*  You're not gonna learn well
*  You're you're you're not gonna have a snap to your punches. You'll be pushing punches, you know, there's there's a
*  Fluidity like some of the hardest techniques almost look effortless
*  Because there's a fluidity to the like if you're landing a kick for example like a hard kick like a spinning back kick like
*  What John Jones knocked out steep a me ocha twist? There's a
*  There's a dance going on with your nervous system with all your muscles moving in coordination. If you think of how
*  Complex that movement is right. He's standing like this sideways and he's looking for them and at the right moment
*  He pivots on the ball of his foot turns his heel towards the person
*  Rotates his entire body this way and shoves his leg
*  Pushing off his back leg with all of his weight and there's a timing
*  You don't want to hit him here and you don't want to hit him at the end of it
*  You want to hit him right in the sweet spot?
*  So you've got to know your foot on extension is going to be properly
*  Distanced from his rib cage in order for you to get maximum force and it's all happening in a fraction of a second
*  And when it lands it's like getting hit by a fucking car and if you taught it but it's a dance
*  And if you're doing here, he seemed to this look at this fucking dance man. Watch this. Look at that turn. Boom
*  I mean, it's perfection. I had a feeling that if anyone could appreciate this it would be
*  Yeah, but you for sure given this is like your signature, right? Oh, that's my specialty kick. Yeah, that's yeah
*  So not that is everyone is impressed by it
*  But like I knew you would see it as like I was so hyped up for it because I always wondered why more people don't
*  Throw it and that's also the same kick that Max Holloway landed on Justin Gaethje at the end of the first round
*  He fucked him up in the end of the first round with a spinning back kick to the face
*  Which is a crazy kick to take them out to sick fight
*  But that it's but you know steep is one of the toughest guys ever walked the face of the earth for him to go down
*  Like that look at the force look at the force
*  Boom I mean your whole his rib went in like look how deep it goes in on impact
*  Look how fucking deep his heel isn't look at that. That's insane
*  That's like the body equivalent of that Tony Ferguson picture, right?
*  Ticked in the face. Yeah, I mean that is
*  Incredible amount of penetration. Look at that
*  Oh, I mean all of his organs just went in shock right there
*  And if he was on the other side it would be even more devastating because that's not even the side where the liver is
*  That's just general organ trauma. You know
*  And he just can't take it. He just goes down and then that's a wrap. So what happens when Aspen all fights John Jones?
*  I gotta hope they fight. I want to know it's gotta happen, right? Here's a question with Aspen
*  All what happens with Aspen on the second round?
*  Like oh, I guess you want to talk about a guy with sprints
*  Yeah, you want to talk about guy was fast twitch Aspen all is one of the fastest heavyweights
*  He might be the fastest heavyweight in the history of the sport
*  I don't think anybody moves like that guy does and at a 250 plus pound frame his movements fucking extraordinary
*  And that's something you have to deal with like that is a crazy ability
*  His ability to move like the way he moves is so much different than everybody else in the sport like
*  Google
*  Let's let's come up with a good Aspen all fight
*  About the Curtis blades fight was pretty quick
*  But how about the last one with the Pavlich fight where he won the interim title? That's a good one
*  Yeah, all of his fights like all together he's fought like ten minutes
*  Everybody gets blown out
*  Yeah, but let's let's watch one of them like the the only loss
*  He has was he blew his knee out throwing a kick, which is crazy what you didn't even get hit
*  He threw a round kick in his ACL exploded. So let's see Marcian to Bora. That's a good one
*  He's so fucking fast dude the Andre Ilovsky fight you can see that's pretty fast, too
*  Put the tabura one. It's the left left hand side go above that above that to the left right there click on that
*  No, but it's gonna be a just click on it doesn't control this. That's fine. That's fine
*  I just want to show his movement. Look how fast he moves in. I mean that guy's so fucking fast
*  He moves like a hundred and seventy five pounder. He doesn't move like a 250 pound guy
*  look how quickly he closes the distance man his hand speed and
*  full range of skills
*  Incredible stand-up knocks guys out with one punch black belt and jiu-jitsu
*  Really good wrestler his everything and he's young. So what's your prediction if it happens?
*  It's you got it's hard to bet against John
*  It's hard to bet against John, but John's not a real heavyweight John could make light heavyweight 100%
*  He weights 230 right now, maybe a little less than 230
*  There's no doubt in my mind that if John just changed his diet and went by he hasn't put that much mass on
*  That you would say 205 is out of reach. No, it's a
*  Fluffy weight. Yeah
*  Yeah
*  I mean look he had always had the reputation of fucking all the heavyweights up at Jackson Winkle John
*  Always everybody said like when Brendan went down and trained with him Brendan was a heavyweight Brendan shop
*  He's like he fucked me up. He goes dude. I was like top ten in the world as a heavyweight
*  I thought it was the shit
*  He fucked me up because he beat my ass and he goes he beat everybody else's ass to all the other heavyweights ragdoll
*  Dudes way bigger than him. He's just a freak
*  This is wingspan is like how much longer than his height though, too crazy
*  Crazy reach and also just skillful
*  His skills are so rock solid in every way shape or form his stand-up his submissions. He's crazy strong
*  He's got just an insane mind for fighting and would he blow out Pereira you think where it's not even a worthwhile
*  The problem is the ground John so much better on the ground like world's better
*  You know and it takes so long to get really good on the ground and we've seen Pereira get in trouble with guys on
*  The ground that are nowhere near John's level nowhere near John dominates everybody
*  He took down Daniel Cormier Daniel Cormier is an Olympic wrestler
*  I mean, he's a fucking phenomenal wrestler and John took him down and took him down multiple times
*  It's a different dude, man
*  This is what we're talking about like with genetics, right?
*  They're just blessed and then with John it's blessed and his mind it's not just it's his personality his like
*  Ruthless competitiveness. He's like he's not going to fucking lose. He's going to find a way to get you and he's gonna do it clever
*  He's not trying to take a bunch of punishment and stand and bang
*  He's not gonna point the center of the octagon. Let's go right here. We stand right here
*  Never gonna happen with John Jones. You're not getting none of that son. You're getting knees to the gut
*  You're getting your knees kicked you're getting fucking just liced up with elbows where your fucking heads bleeding
*  He's gonna slowly dismantle you and find a way to submit you or punish you beat you to death on the ground
*  But can he do that with a guy like Aspin? All who's a legit?
*  255 pound natural who moves like he's 80 pounds lighter. He's a freak man
*  Yeah, Aspin all is a freak like I've seen a lot of heavyweight even Francis
*  Who's like the greatest?
*  Scariest power striker I've ever seen in the heavyweight division. No one's scary than Francis
*  Francis does not move like Tom Aspin all Tom Aspin on is
*  Significantly faster than every other heavyweight. That's a real problem. That's a real problem
*  But John has been used to fighting guys like Alexander Gustafson guys who are really fast at light heavyweight
*  So the speed is not gonna be as much of an adjustment like John's used to really fast people
*  We fought leota machida when machida was in his prime
*  Machida was a lightning bolt man, and he caught John a bunch of times
*  But then there's the thing of getting caught by leota machida is not like getting caught by 255 pound Tom Aspin all
*  That's pretty crazy being at the top of the sport for like two eras essentially
*  There's no one like it. Yeah, like when I was like a fucking teenager watching UFC. It was like leota versus him
*  You have like Mauricio Shogun who fights and he's
*  14 years at the top. Yeah 14 years and
*  Debating whether or not he's the pound-for-pound best fighter alive right now Islam Makachev
*  Currently holds that standing and I think that is voted amongst experts
*  I think that's what it you know air quotes experts. Some of these guys don't know jackshit
*  There's guys who vote on this that literally have never rolled a day in their life and that's a fact
*  But the memes pretty funny though where it's like every time Dana
*  Says John and they'll put it in front of like it'll be like I don't know some obscene scenario
*  It'll be like somebody getting a terminal illness diagnosis or something and then Dana way comes and he's like but John Jones is the best
*  fucking fighter of all time
*  I want to make sure that what I said was accurate like who does get to decide what the pound-for-pound list is I believe it's
*  MMA journalists and experts now
*  There's MMA journalists that I know that are really nice guys
*  And I don't want to say any names
*  But I know they never worked out a fucking day in their life and they love the sport and they cover it fairly and they're
*  Very knowledgeable and they're very good at reciting stats and understanding things
*  But how much do you really know ratings were generated by a voting panel made up of media members see that's a problem
*  Media members were asked to vote on who they feel the best top fighters in the UFC by weight class and pound-for-pound
*  A fighter is only eligible to be voted on if they are active status in the UFC now
*  This is not to disparage any of these media people like I said, I love them. I'm friends with a lot of them
*  They're great guys. They
*  there's no way you
*  Absolutely understand someone's ability especially when you're talking about pound-for-pound unless you've done martial arts
*  I just don't think I can see like when John threw that kick. I see that kick. I go that was beautiful
*  That's beautiful because I know how it kicks. I know what's supposed to happen. You're just guessing
*  You're guessing on what you never done that on somebody if you've never done that you don't know how beautiful that is
*  You don't really get it. You kind of get it, but you get it the way I get flying a plane
*  I never flow plane. I kind of see they pull the lever that guy did a great job flying that plane
*  Look how he landed. Perfect. I don't know what's really going on, you know, but when it comes to martial arts
*  I know it's really going on, you know, and when you look at a guy like John Jones, I
*  Don't think you can make a greatest of all time complete argument because I the way I like to look at it I
*  say
*  Who had the highest?
*  Expression of martial arts excellence during their prime like what I don't mean the entire career
*  I don't mean now. I mean when they were hot when Anderson Silva was hot
*  How good was that was that better than anything that ever existed because I think it might have been and
*  Though that's what I look at when I look at like pound-for-pound best
*  So the argument is John Jones has had some really close fights
*  He's had like split decision fights that he won
*  He had a lot of people thought that you know, some of his fights could like the Dominic Reyes
*  I knew that was could have easily gone to Dominic Reyes
*  Yeah easily and I would not have been mad at that
*  And you know, I might go back and watch it again and decide Dominic Reyes won that fight
*  But there's those 10 9 rounds are like, I don't know
*  You can say 10 9 John or 10 9 Dominic and either way you've lost the title or you've won the title back
*  You know, like it's it's real weird
*  Makachev is so fucking good. He's so fucking good that he head kicked Alexander Volkanov ski in the rematch
*  He submits everybody submitted Dustin Poirier
*  He's a fucking monster when he gets guys on the ground
*  He just crushes them and you could argue that he's dealing with a deeper talent pool
*  So his weight class is in my opinion the most talent rich weight pool in the sport 155 pounds
*  155 pounds is filled with assassins
*  205 pounds is not
*  265 is definitely not it's the giant difference
*  It's been a while since those divisions were like really heated with depth like back which ones
*  Light heavy especially they used to be like the fucking division to watch
*  Imagine though if Pereira was coming up when John Jones was a champion that would be exciting
*  That would be exciting Pereira is a different cat man
*  He said did you hear what Mark Goddard said to me in the fight?
*  After he fought Khalil Rowntree Mark Goddard came up to me goes mate the sound it makes when he hits them is
*  Ungodly he goes I've been doing this for 20 years. He goes the sound he makes is just different. It's ungodly
*  He just kept saying that he wanted to make a point to say this to me
*  He came up to me like immediately when I got into the octagon. It's like the sound is ungodly
*  His power is so different. Hmm
*  Do you know like Francis hit that punch pad and he got like a hundred and twenty seven or whatever Pereira got 190
*  Oh, yeah that one ninety. Yes, don't crazy that is with a kick. The highest I got was like 157
*  Some guy got like 190 with a kick. We're pretty impressed. I think some guy might have broken
*  200 with a kick some Muay Thai guy
*  Pereira did 190 with a punch
*  With a punch yeah, and it was after training he just wallops this fucking thing
*  They come out of nowhere like there's not really a there's no call
*  Yeah, there's no tell and he doesn't have to hit you full power because he has so much power like those leg kicks that
*  He fucks everybody with hmm. There's no turn of the hips at all
*  He's just slapping you with and all of a sudden you can't walk well
*  And then he's like marching you down and it just takes one shot his power is so crazy
*  Different than anybody else's because everybody gets hit on the chin, but when you get hit on the chin by that guy
*  It's like you can't get hit you get hit. It's like everything is just like you're like what the fuck you see in their face
*  Yeah, I remember the first time I was here. We were talking about how this guy
*  Pereira is the only one who's ever beat out of Sanidad and he's like this fucking assassin. We're like, oh, that's you know interesting timeline
*  Didn't know it would transpire into like this
*  Degree of success where not only does he beat him, but then he like switches divisions fucking smokes that division too. It's crazy
*  Yeah dominated two divisions and the only reason why he didn't stay at light heavyweight or middleweight rather
*  He's literally killing himself to get to 185
*  Yeah
*  And I think that likely contributed to the KO to look at us on you landed a perfect right hand
*  That right hand is gonna fuck him up every day of the week no matter what you weigh
*  It's just perfect and the timing the way he did it like leaning up against the cage and just looked for the opening and just
*  Caught him coming in bang dropped him hit him with a left hook put the arrows in no one he's down
*  That KO was perfect
*  But you got to wonder like how much of his inability like you went completely unconscious
*  How much of that is because of the drain the dehydration?
*  Because we know that the brain takes longer to rehydrate than the muscle tissue
*  Yeah, so like they saw them back for sure
*  Yeah, fighters always say that it impacts their ability to take a punch
*  They talk about it like openly like I took punches better when I went up to 55 like a good examples
*  Olivera Olivera was like notorious for kind of like folding at 45 he goes up to 55 and he becomes unstoppable
*  Yeah, no, it's uh
*  I'm surprised he ever sucked down to that to begin with it's pretty he's so big that he was getting making 185 and then fighting
*  at 226
*  That's even more aggressive than the cost of cats I think yes
*  Yeah, it's he's I think he's got the most regret. He had the most aggressive weight cut now. It's pretty marginal now
*  I think he gets into the low 220s like 220 to 20 and then you know he cuts 15
*  Not that bad for a big guy with a lot of muscle dude costa needs to go back to brawling. Yeah
*  He used to be so exciting and now it's just kind of like has different strategies each time and then I don't know
*  It just doesn't seem to be working out. It's hard to know what happens to a guy when he gets really owned
*  Yeah, cuz that's the thing. I think he's like psychologically just I don't think he's the same guy like that's the guy who walked down
*  Yoel Romero, and we're like oh my god
*  Yoel Romero met a bigger freak than him because regardless of whether or not you think costas juicy that guy's got
*  Extraordinary genetics, you know I mean that's why he's such a beautiful man perfect features like incredible frame
*  This frames incredible and whether or not he's juicy the reality is the guy has insane genetics
*  And he was a fucking warrior especially in that yoel Romero fight yo else terrifying to everybody and
*  Costa just walked him down and beat his ass and that was not a close fight
*  It was primarily a stand-up fight which were yo else the most scary and costa was in no danger
*  He beat the shit out of yoel Romero, but then he fought a guy was just way more slick and
*  Adesanya just was piecing him up in a way where he couldn't respond. He just he was making
*  He was what he was doing was a very effective strategy on people that weren't as skillful as Adesanya
*  But that strategy Adesanya was easily exploiting
*  He was like exploiting with distance and with faints and distant management and chopping at the legs and just he had him all fucked
*  Up by the end of the first round
*  He was realizing I can't touch this guy and he keeps hitting me and what he would touch is he is he would be rolling
*  with the punches or he blocked the kick and just move away from it as he's getting hit and then just
*  Keep stabbing at him from a distance and it was just he was too good
*  That's Izzy in his prime when he was at the top of the food chain and at that moment
*  He felt he fought the best Israel Adesanya that's ever been and that's like we were talking about like how good does a guy?
*  Compete in that one
*  Set this gap of a couple of years or three years where he's just it is prime
*  I think that was what it was that was Izzy in his prime which is one of the greatest fighters of all time
*  Against Paulo Costa who just didn't have the answers to that and once you've been bested like that and guy dry humps you when you're down
*  He beats your ass TKO is you and then humps you you just like I thought I was the man
*  Yeah, so then he has all these doubts and then he goes into these the next fights
*  He missed wait for one fight fought at 205 remember when he fought
*  Who the fuck did he fight?
*  I
*  Damn it. I can't Marvin Vittori
*  He fought Marvin Vittori and they were supposed to be fighting 185 and they fought it like 205 and he still looked like he
*  Was out of shape. Yeah, he looked like he's mentally all fucked up from that fight
*  Yeah
*  I could imagine the downward spiral that you would have to try and contend with as well after you like
*  Go from top ranked. I think he's lost like three in a row. It's crazy
*  I'd like to see him get back in the form, but I don't know if he can anymore, you know
*  I don't know if you're psychologically the same guy
*  Did you watch CGI?
*  What is that the Craig Jones invitation, oh, yeah, I was thinking what does the CGI stand for
*  Yeah, I watched it yeah, what do you think well, I think it's great that these guys are getting a lot of money
*  I think that's awesome. Yeah, it's kind of crazy. They decided to compete against Abu Dhabi in the same weekend
*  I thought that was kind of nuts
*  But I guess if you want to be controversial and Craig is certainly controversial and you want to get a lot of attention
*  It got a lot of attention and then of course the money
*  I mean he came into the studio with three million dollars in cash was it three. Yeah, wasn't it?
*  It was one million. Oh, it's one minute. Okay, but even that gave up
*  They gave out three billion dollars, right? So three three different divisions got a million dollars
*  So he brought in a million dollars in a duffel bag, which I've never seen that before
*  It's crazy to look at. No. Yeah, it's
*  You know, it's fun Craig's fun it's funny guy fucking hilarious
*  He's the most hilarious guy in jujitsu. Yeah, he's like really silly. He's very self-deprecating and he's super skillful
*  I mean his jujitsu is like second best in the world. Like he always talks about what's yeah, he named his team the B team
*  Yeah, he's not gonna beat Gordon
*  You know Gordon is a freak and Gordon is like a real psychopath like Gordon trains every day of the week Gordon verse
*  Nicky Rod who wins Gordon no question. Yeah, Gordon's better. He's just better Nicky Rod might get to Gordon's level one day
*  I mean, but if they're not training together, I don't know if he will
*  You know, I don't know if he's training with you. Look he's beat him every time they faced him
*  Yeah, and Nicky did catch him in a footlock, but Gordon's like good break my foot. I'm still gonna win
*  Yeah, and he submitted him easily in Abu Dhabi and when they had their second match
*  You know Gordon was alleging he was greasy
*  Well, he was difficult to get ahold of and that's been something that people have said about Nicky before but it might be oily food
*  Yeah, I don't know. I don't know what's going on, but I know guys did that I know guys would take baths
*  This was in the early days like the pride days
*  They would lay in a bathtub filled with baby oil
*  So they would lay in this bathtub with water and like fucking gallons of like pee-ditty style
*  Like just supplies of baby oil in that water and they bathe in it then they would wash themselves off dry themselves
*  off and then to the touch their skin would not feel like oil at all until they started sweating and then when they started sweating
*  They would be like a fish just you just couldn't grab them
*  yeah, that was the thing that it was alleged that certain strikers from Brazil used to do before they fought and
*  Guys just could not get a hold of them. They would just be so slippery
*  You couldn't take them down if you take them down
*  You couldn't hold them down easily just slip right out of your hands like a bar. So then how would you?
*  Avoid
*  Do they screen for that somehow in the UFC or like how's that work?
*  The problem is what I'm saying that you could oil your skin up and then wash it and they would still be in your pores
*  And you wouldn't even be able to detect as long as you were dry
*  They would rub you with like a cloth or something like no, there's nothing on his skin
*  Like what unless they have like baby oil detection wipes that you then send to a laboratory
*  To find out this person put baby oil on so are you never allowed to put baby oil on or you only allowed to put baby
*  Oil on until the week of the fight like when when are we gonna say no baby oil ever for a person?
*  What if they like baby oil if they like to you know, what's the like cocoa butter? What do you it's so it's weird
*  It's weird. And so the the solution to that is everybody has to wear long-sleeve rash guards and spats
*  That's the solution and that's what they should do
*  So the best way to stop these greasers is you put them in leggings leggings and tights simple
*  Yeah, remember that was like a bit of a controversy at least in early UFC. It was like oh, yeah. I know guys greased
*  100% I can tell you 100% guys greased even like between rounds the two
*  I know one guy who didn't just grease he put Vicks Vapo rub all over his chest
*  And then he would grab guys and pull their head into his chest
*  So you'd be getting sweat and Vicks Vapo rub in your eyes and he'd be kneeing you in the face
*  Crazy. Yeah. Well when they weren't testing for things dudes did a lot of dirty shit. Yeah, I heard another story
*  I can't substantiate. I will say no names, but a guy allegedly
*  Gave blood to make weight
*  So he not didn't give blood but had blood removed from his body and chilled in his room
*  So he can make weight and then went back up to his room and got that blood put back in his body after his body
*  It's probably you know resupplied itself with a significant amount of it depending on how much time it is between the fact they withdraw
*  The blood I don't know how long how much time you but you could think about like how much weight blood is
*  Yeah, and if you can get like, you know, how much can you take while you're still conscious?
*  But you take these bags of blood and keep them chilled and then let your body
*  Refill and reproliferate with blood and then go back into the room and now your blood doping with your own blood
*  Totally undetectable and you made weight with blood cutting. Yeah, and that's like another
*  microdose
*  Vector that people use still to this day blood all against blood transfusions
*  Well, that's what there's probably multiple factors why you're not allowed to get IVs and that might be one of them
*  Yeah, but it's like detecting that is always just through your data that they have to assess or they assess for like plastics
*  In your bloodstream, which you can get around just by storage technique
*  right
*  Plastics in your bloodstream. Would you get around that if you injected it with a glass vial and a needle as opposed to?
*  Like some people are like freezing as opposed to just like storing it in liquid format
*  And then whatever you're storing it in it can all make a difference in terms of like easing it
*  Yeah, you can freeze your blood and then put it back in. Yeah. Whoa. Yeah, like thought I don't obviously but how weird is that?
*  super weird
*  How long is your blood good for? That's a good question, but I would imagine longer if you're freezing it
*  Jesus Christ the things people do just to get a little bit of an advantage
*  Yeah, but it works man. I guess yeah
*  Yeah, and it's like at least of the doping methods like one of the least easy to detect because there's no like substance that is
*  Stimulating anything. It's just your own blood that was supposed to be there, right?
*  So the only way they'd be able to detect is to detect whether or not you've had an IV
*  Yeah, well, I would be like they'd look at your biological passport data and see unusual elevation of
*  hemoglobin hematocrit
*  Probably around an event and you would also see a
*  disproportionate suppression of reticulocytes which are like immature red blood cells
*  Because if your body has similar to the testosterone if you administer it you stop producing naturally
*  So if you put in exogenous blood you're going to suppress the natural production of red blood cells because you have an adequate supply
*  right, so you would have a disproportionate ratio between
*  like blood cells
*  Oxygen-caron capacity markers and immature blood cells and it's like why is this differential so significant all of a sudden?
*  We're and it might flag in a typical finding and get further scrutiny
*  And yeah with blood transfusions because there's no way to really prove anything
*  Oftentimes penalizations occur based on like
*  It looks so fucked up that we have to penalize you because we assumed you did it
*  Like how would they detect that?
*  It's just such an aberrant finding that's different from everything you've ever showed in your data that you must have cheated
*  Right, so the biological passport. Yeah, because it's like with other compounds like testosterone you need to have like
*  Confirmation via isotope ratio mass spec or whatever but with blood it's like what did you do?
*  Like there's no compound to prove was or wasn't there
*  it's just like the blood but it is illegal right so you'd have a nurse that can keep their mouth shut or
*  Or a significant other who is a nurse or a different things
*  Yeah
*  And some of this stuff isn't like hard to really learn either
*  Like it's actually a pretty good profession is learning how to take like some people do
*  phlebotomy as like a
*  low barrier to entry
*  high-paying job
*  so like being somebody who takes blood is like
*  There's not much of a requirement from like credentials to be able to do and it pays well per hour
*  Mmm. Yeah, and if you had a family member who's a phlebotomist and they could hook that up. Yeah. Yeah
*  Yeah, what are the other different ways that they can get it?
*  Like how rock-solid is like the let's forget about drug sport with what they have now
*  But the you saw the protocol that they were using before how what are the best ways to get around that?
*  Well, because they weren't actually testing
*  Almost at all for EPO and GH. How much what percentage were they testing for it? Um
*  you probably have to ask hunter to confirm but my understanding was like best-case scenario you were
*  getting EPO tested if somebody like
*  Reported you as like, you know, there's a bunch of people trying to out you as a cheater
*  And is this a finance thing? Is this a I think it was a lot finance and time intensive and
*  Because it some of this testing is not as rudimentary and crude as like, you know
*  Just detection of synthetic steroids in your urine
*  you have to actually like manually do work to like combust down and
*  Assess the ratio and there's like nuance and interpreting this stuff too
*  Because it's a lot of times you will have an expert who has a different opinion than another expert in terms of it
*  If it looks weird, right?
*  so you have to like bring in multiple opinions to maybe of experts who then kind of come to a
*  Consolidated answer on did you cheat or not and it gets pretty complicated so doing this at scale on a
*  Sport that has no offseason
*  with people globally
*  Competing right pretty fucking costly for sure to do properly
*  Well the MMA conspiracy theorists they always point to like people doing their camps and like faraway lands
*  Hey
*  Because if you want to do a camp in Dagestan like how many times is you saw to go into Dagestan?
*  Yeah, and what happens to those guys when they get over there and they get smacked up by those bearded dudes
*  Wake up at 6 o'clock in the morning. Yeah, they'll feed you their goats. Yeah, we talking about fuck you come back tomorrow
*  Yeah, fuck you. Yeah. No, it's uh
*  Also, they probably know when you're there. Yeah, we got that town wired. There's absolutely
*  logistical problems that lead to
*  Lower barriers for certain people. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, like do you camp in Thailand son? Yeah
*  You gotta wonder like I would like to see like what are what's the data on people that do their camp in Thailand?
*  How often are they tested versus a guy who's got a camp in Iowa and even like the rigor of the person who's hired?
*  to do the testing because it's like how
*  You know scrutinous is whoever you're outsourcing your hiring in that area to like, you know
*  They could be like a local who is you know, like pledged allegiance to that fucking right, you know, whatever
*  So, I don't know man. It's it's tough for sure because if there's no way to like truly bulletproof it
*  I think but at least the UFC developments as of recent they've confirmed
*  They're doing like isotope ratio mass spec and actually doing some of the higher level testing for bioidenticals
*  That could catch the microdosing and the things that are very difficult to detect
*  Stuff is still gonna squeeze through for sure
*  But it's gonna be better than it was where they were either not doing it or then letting letting people do it
*  Maybe and then asking them to be fucking snitches for them
*  It used to be back in the day that there was always rumors of like big camps that would hire scientists
*  And that you know, they would figure out ways around dude that is a
*  Growing profession is it? Oh, yeah
*  There's like so many pharmacology nerds who are like like I've even been asked to help people in the Olympics before
*  Really? Yeah. Wow
*  Because you're a pharmacological nerd. Yeah
*  And so these these people ask you to cheat for them to help them cheat
*  Which is also a criminal offense my understanding due to there's actually a law now it's like the Rod Chankov act or something
*  Oh, wow, so if you like help somebody you're also
*  Doing a crime
*  Wow, yeah
*  So, you know, obviously not worth doing for me. I never did it but well, especially somebody like the Olympics
*  There's no money in it. Yeah, make any money. This is crazy. Yeah
*  Like pure pride and for winning a medal it's pure exploitation
*  That's what it is because it's not like there's no money like why are you making all the money?
*  Well, these people are noble. They don't want to get paid like no you're just not paying them
*  They don't even know how much money there was because in 1936 there was no money. All right, there was no sponsors. There's no nothing
*  Yeah, I remember was no TV. Yeah, that's it
*  Okay
*  The bill makes it unlawful to knowingly influence or attempt to conspire to influence a major international sports competition by use of prohibited substance or
*  prohibited method a
*  Violator is subject to criminal penalties a fine prison term of up to ten years or both and mandatory restitution
*  Yeah, interesting. So yeah, there's definitely
*  And when you hear about stuff like this too, it's like there's always the thought in the back of your mind as a competitor
*  What are people doing that? I'm not and curiosity strikes. What do you think is the answer? What's like?
*  like the
*  Biological when you look at it objectively so, you know what?
*  What we should be doing is doing everything that works or what we should be doing is have the most insane
*  Testing that everybody has to be a hundred percent natural no if ands or buts and there's no cheating
*  That's really hard because I too have the same questions you had of the enhanced games where it's like, oh, we're gonna have you know
*  Medical assessments that ensure safety and blah blah blah, but it's like if you're going full board
*  It's impossible to be healthy
*  And say yeah
*  So like as much as you could argue
*  It's probably better to not be using Frankenstein designer drugs or doing weird methods to get around cheating
*  The alternative is not necessarily like far superior in terms of health because if I'm allowed to use a gram of test
*  You know, like I'm not gonna stop at 200 migs, you know, right? I'm gonna go full full fucking sauce to the tit
*  Yeah, if you can get a physiological benefit of being on trend and just fucking oh, yeah
*  You're right it out of your mind. Yeah become like a fucking dopaminergic psycho and just like
*  You know, you will absolutely take that risk regardless of what it does to you
*  Yeah, especially if you're trying to win, right if people are willing to cheat when it's really dangerous
*  you could lose the medal and you can get outed and publicly shame like Ben Johnson or
*  You don't have to worry about that because they're allowing you to but they would like you to take
*  Like a sustainable dough and you're like fuck you what you're sustainable. I'm trying to be number one bitch
*  Yeah, and like all I love the idea of the enhanced games by the way, but it's like
*  At least my concern would be what happens when you put up no guardrails and then alternatively if there are guardrails
*  Now it's set up for corruption at the medical provider level who's assessing what you're healthy enough to do and like
*  You know
*  Are you going in to get your blood drawn at the trough point after injections where things look like they're half out of your system
*  Versus before like it's almost like a new level of doping that would be introduced right right, so and I'm sure
*  They're very well spoken eloquent guys who are on top of that stuff and I'm sure have answers to that
*  Or you know have some idea of what they're gonna do
*  But like those would be my questions as to and I'm not saying it needs to be safe, right?
*  You know it might just come down to accepting that this is the fucking chemical warfare games, right? Yeah
*  What's there's nothing wrong with that if you're gonna expose yourself to that risk people do that in bodybuilding all the time
*  That's like literally what bodybuilding is yeah, yeah
*  That's what's crazy right bodybuilding is huge sport is not possible without illegal drugs
*  And there's no Rodchenko Vect for bodybuilding either so there's like
*  Literal the guru stuff is crazy in bodybuilding. Well, how do they get away with it since it's completely illegal?
*  Well, I mean like obviously you're going to jail if I'm a guy who's arresting people who are on steroids
*  I go to the mr. Olympia might grow in jail
*  Yeah, right you'd think if you wanted to just like hit your quota for the year
*  You just show up to the Olympia Expo and just be like all of you everybody in the fucking car get in the paddy wagon
*  Yeah, yeah, I don't know man. That's uh how did you get it?
*  When it comes to possession in the states and like how scrutinous they are on anabolic
*  I think it's mostly if you're importing mass amounts that will flag you because you're likely a distributor at that point
*  Okay, so if it's like personal amounts
*  Typically you would buy it domestically to not like red flag yourself because I think in in the mail
*  You can't even have your mail get checked if it's domestic
*  So if you are buying from you know the other side of the country
*  No one would know that you were sent anything
*  It's only if you're buying like growth hormone from China or something
*  Oh
*  Get flagged and you have enough kits that happen to get flagged and customs
*  Then they keep a note on your record of this guy might be doing something so he might be a steroid dealer
*  Yeah
*  Yeah
*  And then they'll have sting operations and try and figure out who's actually distributing because they have resource allocation
*  Bandwidth problems too, so they have to go after the big fish, right?
*  So do guys go to Mexico and bring him across the board not anymore now they used to know
*  Yeah, back in the day, yeah people like smuggle it up their ass to get it here
*  Imagine taking trend that was in a guy's asshole it Dan Bills Aaron used to he talked about how when he was in
*  Buds he would like go with his buddies to get gear from Mexico and then they'd smuggle it up their asses back into the US
*  Yeah bottle broke
*  Fucking yikes but whole glass cuts buddy. I watched that in a video. It's called one guy one cup
*  Oh, yeah, ever seen that one. No back in the lively
*  I saw the og variance of that and never what I I can't watch another one guy one cup is way more horrifying
*  This girl takes a mason jar up his asshole and breaks
*  I think it's a mason jar some kind of a jar up his asshole and it breaks and it's just chunks of broken glass and blood
*  Fall onto the ground as he squashed it's horrible, but I watched it multiple times
*  There's a lot of crazy people in this world. Yeah, do you think that I I'm of the opinion
*  Let me just say what I think I think that
*  Most substances should be legal and I think people should be able to figure out what's good and what's bad
*  There's a lot of things that are legal like Adderall's legal. I don't take Adderall
*  You know, I'm 99% sure I have ADHD. I don't even know what it is. I don't know it's real
*  I think it's probably a superpower
*  But if I went to a doctor and I was complaining about I can't focus on any one thing
*  I'm kind of all over the place. They'd probably give me some and that would have a legal stimulants
*  I don't think it's probably think it's not good for you. So I don't take it, but I could right
*  Why is that legal and cocaine is not like why is this legal and that's not why is whiskey legal and marijuana is not?
*  This doesn't make any sense to me. Why is Xanax legal psilocybin is not like what are we doing?
*  Yeah, well you could argue that well, that's the reason why clinical trials exist which assess
*  You know safety profiles of these drugs and they wouldn't make it through otherwise
*  But like obviously we've seen that that's not once you get financial interest involved
*  It's kind of hard to overlook that a lot of shit makes it through that
*  Probably shouldn't have and stuff that maybe should have made it through didn't make it through
*  So, you know, like I am of the opinion that you should be able to take what you want and be educated about it
*  Hopefully first
*  it's tough though, because it's like if you have a guy who's
*  Like I don't know manic and he has access to like meth and like
*  Pharmagrade meth at that or something. Yeah, which it actually exists too. Oh, yeah, and you end up with like a Hitler or something
*  Yeah, yeah, the trend thing. Is that the worst one psychologically from anabolic steroids?
*  I would say probably that and then maybe secondary
*  You know some people could argue halo testin is a drug that supposedly Mike Tyson was using when he bit the Vanderhoof
*  Yeah, and it makes you like fucking short-term acutely extremely angry. Well, how did you hear that? He was using that?
*  I don't remember exactly. I think it was like he didn't test positive for it
*  I think it was just like highly room like a very prevalent rumor, but I for they probably didn't test for it though either
*  No, it was back then it was really easy to get around like oral steroid detections back then as well if they were even testing for it
*  But yeah, I don't even know if they were testing back then
*  Yeah, the trend is the worst offender for your psychological state not just because the drug is
*  Bad, but it also like ruins your sleep. So you get like trend cough
*  I mentioned but trend sweats is another one where it almost induces like a menopause like hot flash
*  Ah
*  Sweating in your sleep and you wake up just fucking drenched
*  And it like really fucks up your sleep and it makes you hyper paranoid as well
*  Which is no good because even though you're this jacked
*  sometimes confident guy others you're like you're
*  Unreasonably insecure and you like a very common outcome is for guys to think their girlfriends are cheating on them
*  Just out of nowhere by being on trend
*  Yeah, and they end up becoming you know oddly behaving
*  sexual deviancy is also a very
*  Common I've heard that yeah, you know on trend and it's thought to be the progesterogenic activity because it's derived from
*  nandrolone, which is a progesterone receptor agonist as well and progesterone is
*  Thought to be very implicated in gay sexual tendencies as you grow up if you had a heightened exposure to progesterone and utero
*  Highly dopaminergic drug as well, which in excess can cause like a really weird sexual deviancy as well
*  And yeah, it's like really fucking potent good at what it does it builds lean mass and it's like a really dry compound doesn't make
*  You watery also has a unique
*  anti-catabolic effect so you don't in a deficit you keep muscle and
*  Sometimes even grow while you're cutting and oh, yeah
*  It's not like steroids don't all do that to some degree more or less
*  But this drug is like uniquely potent in its anti-catabolic action to where you could be like
*  Extremely nutrient-deprived and still hold on to a lot of your muscle
*  And because it's so good at making you extremely strong to without an excess of body weight
*  It's like highly sought after in many sports
*  Because you don't have to worry about jumping up in weight class while you're getting the strength increase
*  That is humongous
*  Yeah, so it was one of the drugs that was used in the Dutchess cocktail
*  Which is what Rod Chankov would have at his athletes swish around in their mouth. Oh really? Yeah, it was absorbed buccal. Oh
*  So it was like it was almost like the equivalent of IVing the drug right into your bloodstream
*  You would swish it around your mouth and this alcohol and it would absorb buccal into the bloodstream immediately
*  So you wouldn't have to actually have it go into your stomach and then get processed
*  Through a first pass metabolism so you could get in and out of your system way faster Wow
*  Wow
*  So why is that one good for fighters? I?
*  Would think that like the psycho are emotional though. Yeah, you could argue that the emotional instability is not good
*  Yeah, but paranoia makes you very
*  aggressive
*  the psychoactive effects in the gym can be very helpful for training and stress resilience and
*  Some people it's not everyone who becomes paranoid on it. It's highly individual dependent some people you will often hear people say
*  Oh people overblow the side effects of trends not that bad and then other people who will say it ruined their life
*  So it's highly individual dependent like any drug
*  But it's very good at making you extremely fucking strong without
*  blowing you up with water retention and
*  staving off
*  Loss of tissue while weight cutting as well
*  There's another factor that comes with steroid users, and that's the addiction to the feeling of being on steroids
*  Yeah, because once they get off steroids, and they don't feel like Superman anymore. They get real weirded out
*  Yeah, and they want to get back on again. I've seen that oh yeah, dude. It's a
*  The thing that will often kill people is the desire to maintain
*  these huge sizes in perpetuity too because it's like a
*  Ultimately steroid use often stems from
*  Like body image insecurity so if you achieve you know the outcome you sought with this thing
*  To think that you're gonna be you know a confident person after you've lost the 30 40 pounds lean that you gained
*  Like you were already probably somewhat mentally not perfect to begin with except Dorian Yates. Oh, yeah
*  He's a unique cat. Yeah, he's lost all the way looks like a normal athlete now
*  Yeah, healthy. Yeah, he had me on his podcast
*  This year, and he said
*  Anytime he's done seminars and people ask if he misses being a mass monster
*  He says they're more upset about it than I am
*  He has a unique perspective on it, which is really cool to see it's very intelligent
*  Yeah, yeah, very calm, and you know just the way he approaches things
*  But goddamn dude when that guy was getting after it he was he was one of the original freaks
*  We're one of the first guys we're just like what like that's what they're pushing it to now
*  Yeah, he left humanity behind
*  It was so big
*  It was ridiculous if you think about what he looked like versus what Arnold looked like just a couple of decades earlier
*  Oh night and day yeah, you could argue. He was like the catalyst almost to a heightened
*  Standard of amount of muscle you need to be competitive
*  I mean he was so big he blew his bicep out and competed in one with a torn bicep. Yeah
*  Yeah, yeah with like a hole in his arm. Yeah, that's fucked up when you get that big and you have to like worry about
*  Exploding your fucking muscle every workout because you're so strong and that's what you need to lift to get the stimulus like that's crazy stuff
*  Well Ronnie Coleman's the crazy example of the price you pay for that like that guy's all fucked up now
*  Yeah, yeah, it makes you wonder if he would have been the bodybuilder. He was if he just trained
*  Higher volume and like right higher reps less weight
*  Yeah, cuz literature now suggests that you don't need to necessarily train like that. Look at the difference between two of them
*  Yeah, Arnold on the left and Dorian on the right Dorian's twice the size
*  Yeah, it's fucking back dude. That's crazy
*  That back is it not that Arnold isn't insane. He was fucked pretty insane. I actually think Arnold looks better
*  Yeah, he's more aesthetic for sure
*  Look at his back look at Dorian Yates back and look at Ronnie Coleman's back. Yeah
*  Jesus guys were huge Ronnie Coleman was crazy, but Dorian was like
*  Weirdly thick like look how thick his fucking muscles are man. It's just not first of all judging guys that are that big
*  Good luck. I don't get it. They all look awesome. They all look crazy. There's even harder judging a bikini show
*  So there's different classes at the Olympia including women's bikini and there's like a few poses
*  They'll pull up a comparison of the women's Olympia for bikini. What is the bikini versus regular Olympia?
*  Well, it's just like the best bikini competitors against each other for the Olympia crown of bikini category
*  What's the bikini category versus the regular?
*  Miss Olympia category Miss Olympia is like bodybuilding. Oh, this isn't bodybuilding
*  Well, it's like a form of bodybuilding
*  Right, this is women who still look feminine so like right put it this way with men there's different categories
*  There's open men's bodybuilding
*  classic physique and men's physique and each of them has like an
*  Incremental noticeable difference in the amount of muscle you need to be competitive and in women similar
*  Differences exist in categories where they have women's bikini
*  wellness
*  Something else and then bodybuilding is the one where you can you pretty much need to be on like male
*  Level steroids to be competitive and this is a reality of female bodybuilding that a lot of female bodybuilders
*  Look, I know female jujitsu competitors who take steroids, which is that's crazy. There's not even any money in that
*  Yeah, you're juicing yourself up
*  But if you want to get that lean and maintain that much muscle as a woman like what do they take?
*  Well for bikini you might be able to do it naturally all but most of them are probably still taking a little bit something
*  But it's not like masculinizing. There's a lot of things they can take that are natural or over-the-counter or
*  Like super microdosed amounts of anabolic that don't cause masculinization
*  but above that the thresholds for categories above that are like
*  If you go to women's bodybuilding like it looks like you remember it or it's you know dudes with wigs on basically
*  Yeah, I mean they've they're trans men basically yeah like like based on their hormone profile
*  They are more male than you and I probably whoa
*  God look at that lady. That's crazy. Is she miss Olympia?
*  She number one. That's a women's physique. See that's not women's bodybuilding. What yeah, so this is like a different category
*  That's less muscle than bodybuilding
*  So what's women's bodybuilding that lady probably
*  Who's miss Olympia? I did they still have women's bodybuilding. I think they do
*  Hmm yeah, that might be it look at that lady down the lower left hand cheese those ladies are huge. Oh my goodness
*  That's got to be it. Those are dudes
*  That's a dude's body
*  Like size wise yeah, not saying that's a dude's body
*  That's a dude's body
*  Like size wise yeah, not saying you're a dude ladies. Don't hurt me
*  Yeah, by the way, you know more power to anybody who wants to do whatever they want
*  It's just like the reality of the exposure to these hormones is they are
*  Masculinizing and you can blame Biden for that wow yeah, because he stopped the development of them and by now we probably have non
*  Masculinizing drugs that work as well as the ones that make you a dude. Oh my god
*  Have you ever thought about bailing out of Canada dude?
*  I would love to I've considered it, but there's weird stuff around like
*  unrealized capital gains and exit taxes and shit that basically traps you there really
*  So like I could physically be president in the States and live here
*  Maybe for six months of a year, but to like get out of the system fully you gotta like pay the piper on
*  Every company you've ever built even if you don't have the money from it because you never sold it
*  There's gains that were made in Canada the value of it. They have to pay on it's like how do you pay for it?
*  I don't have any fucking cash because it's all the company so they make it very difficult to leave the country
*  Yeah, yeah, and maybe that changes with Pierre
*  I don't know but like one of the main problems with the economy is there's no incentive for business owners that are
*  Doing well to stay like everything is structured around. How do I get around this fucking system? Not how do I stay here?
*  So like I know personally every friend I have
*  Successful has either already left or has tried to find a way to leave
*  actually, I know one person who hasn't but he's like
*  Really entrenched in the system and like it would be impossible to unwind at this point
*  so I don't know how much of it is
*  he actually wants to be there or
*  think it's a beautiful place to live in British Columbia, for example, but yeah, like
*  Yeah, it's fucking cost of living is obscene and the tax
*  Some kids were doing a tick-tock with food at a Canadian supermarket like a bunch of chicken wings and how much it was
*  Oh the dollar too is horrible. It's like a dollar every dollar in US currency equates to
*  140 Canadian. Whoa. Yeah, so your dollar goes super far in Canada
*  and then
*  Jesus and then to buy
*  Like I don't know a shitty shack fucking house that's not even a house in Vancouver. It's like millions of dollars
*  Yeah
*  Yes. Yeah. Yeah, I think the cost of living is
*  only exceeded maybe in real estate by like New York maybe
*  Wow. Yeah, it's like one of the worst offenders on the planet for cost of a home
*  So basically back in the day our parents one of the main ways to become
*  financially stable was getting early on a property and build equity in it and eventually you'd have a you know
*  Something that accrued in so much value from since you got it that like that's your main nest egg or whatever. Yeah
*  nowadays, it's not even possible to afford the lowest threshold of a mortgage on like a
*  Place that's not even nice so you have like families staying in like
*  500 square foot apartments with big families because they can't afford anything it says impossibly unaffordable housing report ranks Vancouver third
*  Most expensive in the world. Yeah
*  Hong Kong and Sydney. Well, Sydney that's interesting, huh? I would never suspected Sydney Australia to be that expensive
*  That's nuts. Yeah. Well, listen brother anything else you want to talk about for bail out of here?
*  It was a good one. Yes. Yeah, a lot of fun. Yeah. Thanks for having me. I appreciate you
*  Miss Olympia wellness we missed out on what's that a focus on the lower body? What? Oh butts? Yeah top half
*  Oh, yeah, so I was gonna say half doesn't matter for real. Yeah, shut the fuck up
*  Why are they standing freight face forward? That's in hips. Let's see them glutes. It definitely matters, but not as much
*  Yeah, it's not focused. Yeah
*  Anyway watching the posing
*  You you were saying it's hard to judge men's bodybuilding with women
*  It's at least with the bikini category, especially their hair is really long and they have extensions too to make it look even longer
*  So when they turn around basically the only thing you can judge is like ass down essentially because their whole back is covered by hair
*  Oh, that's weird. Yeah, so it's like a pageant for your butt
*  I'm all in now I could by the way like any bikini competitors probably fucking furious with that statement
*  There's absolutely trend
*  Probably not but like they're judged on other things, but that's a the main factor
*  Okay. All right, man. Well been a lot of fun more split more plates more dates on YouTube
*  What is your website? Yeah more place more dates calm
*  You
