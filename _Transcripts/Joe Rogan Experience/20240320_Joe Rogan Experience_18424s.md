# Joe Rogan Experience #2122 - Protect Our Parks 11
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [March 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV71YMAwIXY)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day!
*  Oh, it's back. Hell yeah!
*  Hell yes, we're back!
*  Let's go!
*  So much shit to talk about.
*  You see that wild shit that's going on in Scotland where they're targeting comedians for hate crime laws?
*  Still?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  What's his name? Contracula?
*  Well, yeah, that's the same place where that guy, Dankula, right?
*  Count Dankula?
*  Dankula!
*  Sounds like a weed head.
*  Do you remember that one?
*  No.
*  He got in trouble for making his dog do a Hitler.
*  He trained his dog to go holler, and then he would just do it to fuck with his girlfriend.
*  German Shepherd.
*  You got in trouble for that?
*  No, it was a little pug.
*  Yeah, it was a cute little pug.
*  Pull it up!
*  Bro, I think you got arrested.
*  I've done that one.
*  They brought him to fucking jail.
*  You get in trouble for that? I do that every time I see a dog.
*  I did it with my friend's kid.
*  Yeah, you push his elbow and he does it.
*  Oh, really?
*  Please, Scotland, we won't target comedians under new hate crime law.
*  That's what you say now.
*  But stand-up shows still come under its scope.
*  Jesus Christ, Scotland, you have one of the biggest fucking comedy festivals on earth.
*  That's true.
*  Every year. It's a huge comedy festival.
*  But they're pretty queefy over there.
*  They will be. They'll just queef it up.
*  But this is so queefy.
*  Hate crime?
*  Age, disability, religion, sexual orientation.
*  Fuck my whole act.
*  Yeah, everyone's whole act. I was going to say Marat's whole act.
*  Just throwing up hatred on certain grounds.
*  It's everybody's act.
*  Sexual orientation, yeah.
*  What? These are just things that exist.
*  You've got to talk about age.
*  This is so ridiculous.
*  Wow, Scotland got weird.
*  Is that a real thing? No way.
*  The training materials based on Scottish government's explanatory notes, which accompany the legislation.
*  This included examples of a range of scenarios where offenses might take place.
*  But this does not mean officers have been told to target these situations or locations.
*  But they can if they want.
*  Yeah, but if they can if they want.
*  Dude, the mugshots from this are going to be hilarious.
*  This is so scary.
*  How are you getting it up?
*  Getting arrested for an AIDS joke?
*  What's been explained to me by my friends in the UK, specifically Francis Foster from...
*  Trigonometry.
*  Trigonometry, he's awesome.
*  He was telling me that this government is on the way out.
*  And that they're out of their fucking minds.
*  They're just doing shit to try.
*  Every fucking generation goes this way, then that way.
*  This way, and they go too far left, then they go too far right.
*  So these fucking kooks have decided they're going to target people and put them in jail.
*  Did you hear what happened in Belgium?
*  The dude got a year in jail for memes that were shared.
*  Memes that they shared in a private chat.
*  No, what?
*  Yes.
*  Oh no.
*  They gave him a year.
*  We saw the memes.
*  The memes are nothing.
*  Wait, we saw the memes?
*  Yeah, you can see the memes.
*  The memes are online.
*  They're not that funny?
*  No, one of them was like a Hitler one that was like anti-Hitler.
*  It was like an anti-Nazi meme.
*  And this was one of the ones that was cited as being one of the offenses.
*  It's in a fucking private chat.
*  Imagine if our protect our hearts.
*  How did they get in?
*  How did they get in?
*  Before the show started, the conversation was cut out.
*  We should delete our data right now.
*  I think we should have a mass delete.
*  Turn the keys.
*  The podcast alone.
*  Yeah, this is worse than the group chat.
*  By the end of this episode, it'll be worse than...
*  You think?
*  That's how it always goes.
*  You gotta see this.
*  Look at this kid falling.
*  I don't remember most of the back half.
*  You gotta see this Belgium story and realize this fucking dumb shit is happening in 2024 with the internet.
*  2024.
*  And you're going after people's phones, their private chat.
*  Well, if everyone's private shit got leaked, we'd all be...
*  Would they go to jail for it too?
*  How far are we from being able to listen to anybody talk at any time?
*  The government can already do it.
*  How far is everybody from being able to do that?
*  And everybody assuming that everything you say all the time is being recorded.
*  You know how fucked we're gonna be if that happens?
*  You got Alexa in your house. Your phone hears everything.
*  But it's also, it's like, if it was actionable.
*  Like if you start talking about things, like say if you're talking about some kind of medication that you can't use or some new law that they're gonna pass that's gonna fuck up free speech, whatever it is.
*  If you're talking about that and then all of a sudden cops show up,
*  If you're like, I want to kill these motherfuckers.
*  Because people say that shit.
*  You get around a guy and he's drunk and he makes $50,000 a year and he sees where his tax money is going to and he can barely get by and he's fucking hammering,
*  I wanna fucking kill Nancy Pelosi.
*  They get crazy.
*  People get crazy. Doesn't mean they're actually gonna do it.
*  He's just getting drunk. It's just drunk talk.
*  Other than that guy.
*  The one guy who just did it.
*  Listen, put that hammer down and listen to me.
*  I wanna kill Nancy Pelosi.
*  He goes, nope.
*  That real go-getter.
*  Yeah.
*  That guy was like, nope.
*  What a wild moment when he looks and sees the cops.
*  He's like, I guess it's now.
*  How about, how crazy is Paul Pelosi that he only had one hand on the dude because his other hand was on his drink?
*  Yeah.
*  How much faith did he have that he can get away with things?
*  Well, they knew each other clearly.
*  They knew each other.
*  Do you think so?
*  Oh yeah.
*  The guy broke into the house with a hammer.
*  Seems like Paul was trying to keep it chill.
*  I don't think they knew each other.
*  No, I think that was the rumor.
*  That was the rumor that he was a gay lover.
*  That's what I heard.
*  Yeah, no, no, no.
*  There's a video of the guy using the hammer he hit him in the fucking head with to break into the house.
*  Like he's banging on the back door.
*  That sounds like ex-girlfriend shit though.
*  Exactly.
*  Does it though?
*  I think it's a schizophrenic in your house with a hammer.
*  Nancy Pelosi was like, you said you wouldn't embarrass me.
*  It's a gay quarrel.
*  Maybe she sent someone in to whack him.
*  Maybe she thought about half of that 200 million she stole.
*  And she's like, you know what?
*  This is a horrible video, man.
*  I hate this video.
*  Oh shit.
*  Because look at him.
*  He's not even looking.
*  This guy's got a fucking hammer.
*  And he's got his hand on the hammer.
*  And then the guy breaks the hammer loose and just bangs him in the head.
*  Jesus.
*  A bunch of times.
*  And no, he hit him more than once I think when he went down.
*  He hit him again.
*  But the thing is like he's snoring.
*  Now when you're that old and you get knocked the fuck out like that, that is really bad.
*  I mean he might not ever be the same again.
*  He got hit in the head with a fucking metal hammer.
*  Still holding the drink though.
*  You're right.
*  Bro, it's crazy he only had one hand on that hammer.
*  That is so nuts.
*  It's his superiority.
*  His confidence that he has that everything's going to be fine.
*  What's his night shirt with the...
*  That's a big guy too.
*  Big crazy looking motherfucker who just broke into your house and he has a hammer.
*  He'll be on Kill Tony soon.
*  He thought that he was going to keep that guy chill until the cops got there.
*  And once the cops got there he was going to keep him chilled and they were just going to arrest that guy.
*  I feel like leading him forward too.
*  It's like come on, come on.
*  You can't let a guy turn your hand that way, stupid.
*  You're against your thumb now.
*  If someone's grabbing something and trying to take it from you, look, always have something this way.
*  Wait, that's the...
*  David de Paes.
*  This is the guy breaking into the house.
*  He's so calm.
*  I know.
*  He's a fucking psychopath.
*  I love it.
*  He's so calm.
*  So he pulls out a hammer.
*  Look, he's got like a sleeping bag.
*  He's a fucking crazy homeless dude.
*  Wow, he got in there pretty easy.
*  Do you think he had anything to do with the Pelosi's?
*  How does this guy not have top-notch security?
*  I know, right?
*  How are you so confident that you could just sleep in that house in your crime-infested city?
*  That is so crazy.
*  I mean, that city is infested with crime.
*  He's so calm.
*  He looks like the comic book guy from Super Bowl.
*  He's totally got a plan.
*  And he's also confident no one has a gun.
*  I like how he pulls out carefully all his tools and then the plan is smash it.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Look at this.
*  He still can't get in.
*  So he bashes through this fucking door, which took a while.
*  Pelosi's pretty calm.
*  I would be freaking out.
*  Insane.
*  The guy broke the door with a hammer.
*  Good point.
*  Maybe we missed a whole chunk where the guy just runs up to him and blows him.
*  Maybe he broke in.
*  This is the fantasy.
*  The fantasy was like, and then Pelosi's like, I'm not banging you with a cop's in here.
*  You broke my door.
*  Exactly.
*  And then he hits him with a hammer.
*  Maybe we're missing context.
*  Thank God you're here.
*  Bro, that's a horrific video to watch, though.
*  I won't listen to it.
*  It's horrible.
*  It's a clunk.
*  It's a horrible thud and then the snoring.
*  Regardless of what you think about them stealing money, that's terrible.
*  That's just terrible.
*  They definitely stole a lot of money.
*  I follow her stock tips.
*  That's stock tips?
*  I say stole money.
*  What I should be saying is engaged in insider trading that's legal.
*  There you go.
*  And it's just nuts that it's legal.
*  It's nuts that they can pass laws and they know the laws are coming and then they buy
*  up stock and then they get paid.
*  Yeah, but they can't be stopped.
*  Who's going to stop them?
*  They would have to stop them.
*  Other than a hero with a hammer.
*  Other than one heroic schizophrenic.
*  I mean, how do you stop them?
*  Bro.
*  They make the rules.
*  It's kind of a weird feeling to know that everybody knows that you got all your money
*  by being a corrupt politician and you're just wandering around.
*  Yeah.
*  Just like what are you going to do about it?
*  Listen, the companies needed financial support.
*  We supported them.
*  We were rewarded for that.
*  That's also why they probably need to keep making money.
*  Like they need security.
*  Lots more and more security.
*  Yeah.
*  They need security.
*  Whoa.
*  Higgins going wild.
*  Let's hear it.
*  He did so good.
*  Isn't it funny that Pelosi only gets the blunt of it?
*  Like everybody else is doing it too.
*  She's the Speaker of the House.
*  Right.
*  She's the Speaker of the House.
*  But look.
*  Who's Higgins?
*  Who's Spy?
*  What does this mean?
*  Spy is like the SMP 500.
*  Hold on.
*  But isn't this based on the percentage of their returns?
*  Right.
*  So maybe Higgins is a new guy that just is in there getting really rich.
*  Pelosi's getting...
*  Right, but he's going after it hard.
*  He's going wild.
*  This is like the guy wearing the coat in Goodfellas.
*  Yes!
*  Higgins.
*  You got the Cadillac.
*  He pulls up with the Cadillac.
*  I said take it easy.
*  Take it back.
*  Take the Cadillac back.
*  Higgins, chill out.
*  I'm only here for one term.
*  I'm going to get mine.
*  Bro, that was such a good scene.
*  Such a good scene in Goodfellas.
*  You realize they have to kill that guy because he's got a Cadillac.
*  Get your shine box.
*  No, no, no.
*  That was a different one.
*  His defense, he said that lacks context.
*  Insider trading.
*  Viral Post leads to claims of a potential threat.
*  He says it lacks context.
*  What's the context?
*  Those numbers provide a distorted view of the facts.
*  Oh, okay.
*  Tell me more.
*  I like it.
*  He talked it.
*  Tell me more, sir.
*  What does it say?
*  Higgins argument is our argument.
*  See what his statement is.
*  It's out of context.
*  Right.
*  It's funny that he has to...
*  Here it goes.
*  These numbers provide a distorted view of the facts that a spokesperson for Higgins, better
*  even than a lawyer, can't even get a good point.
*  He's like, I'm going to kill that guy.
*  He's like, I'm going to kill that guy.
*  It said he had less than 100 grand in the stocks.
*  So when he went up, yeah, yeah, yeah
*  It's like the Pistons winning two games in a row also if he has a minimal investments and holdings
*  And it just gets lucky and he's got one of them is like Nvidia
*  Yeah, the Nvidia is a common one to hold because I've had it for years it doubled definitely jumped up when Nancy
*  Fucking passed them bills. Hey Nancy. You're even the video
*  I got a lot of money
*  My
*  What do they care I mean she banged Kennedy did she pull that photo yeah, she was super young and hot no
*  Just knew him well, I think if you're in Kennedy's orbit
*  Everybody considers him like our greatest of all-time president
*  Hey look at the young hands
*  17 Pablosi Wow 17 Mark
*  Still older than us do you really think Jeff came banging 17 year olds yes, yeah
*  Yeah, probably 100% was around upon is that an insane come imagine bringing that up in a history class
*  Imagine being in like a history class
*  And telling the teacher you know what I think yeah, probably though banging a lot of 17 year olds
*  It's kind of crazy, but to be like the leader of a country like that
*  It's almost like a prerequisite you have to be a poon hound
*  That's how you the only reason why you have the ambition to get to that spot in the first place
*  Yeah
*  And up until Clinton it was just you kind of made fun of the girls
*  And if you're not and you get in a position like now I'm skeptical like what's your motive? Yeah?
*  War and money or pussy I'll take the guy who just wants pussy every day of the week
*  It seems like the best ones
*  Clinton when he was president Trump Trump for sure Obama want a dick
*  But our favorite is JFK news like the known biggest poon known the known biggest
*  What about those older guys the drawn guys you think?
*  Yeah, which ones like the ones that got time you guys yeah, yeah, we're drawn
*  Back in the drawing days you could do
*  You're not gonna be a long enough for someone to sketch you could kill you could kill a lady
*  You can kill every bone in the next town everybody and then they asked you did you kill moving to Annapolis?
*  Sorry, they did it again
*  What were their investigations like oh, yeah, you know did you kill him nope no forensics
*  That's right sounds good. Yeah
*  Yeah, just evidence. God the lawyers back there. It's like I just I just lost the witch trials. I'm your new
*  Which trials are the wildest shit?
*  They even give you a lawyer back there that's like pretty new yeah, they have to give you a lawyer
*  So you're just like I can read you can't good luck with your trial
*  I think mostly they drown them too wasn't really a burning thing the burning things kind of a misnomer right and
*  I don't know the drowning thing they used to do
*  Was they had this thing where they would put you in like lock you to a chair and throw you in a pond
*  Whoa, and then they'd be like if she's a witch she's gonna get out right no one ever got out
*  You know she's a witch she would just leave if they floated they were proven to be a witch if they drowned too bad
*  But at least they weren't a witch
*  This type of test was also a myth carried over from Eastern early European history
*  Oh, no, it's just like the burning at the stake now. They just they're just cunts. Well. That's not true though
*  I guarantee they kill some some people alive. They definitely burn some people they definitely what if they didn't have a lake near them
*  Listen man, they killed people in horrific ways and just lied about it when they wrote it down afterwards
*  Oh, yeah, there's a lot of that the Museum of Torture in Amsterdam. I want to know rules
*  It's just like this pyramid that you're supposed to let a guy put his ass on
*  It's a good one apart. Yeah, it's a coffin with the spikes in it and they close it on
*  Well that fuck yeah, yeah
*  So the witch trials and Salem consisted mainly of a physical examination for the witch's test heat
*  Which is teet? Oh, what is that?
*  Which the Puritans believed was a sort of third nipple from which which which is familiar with suck blood oh?
*  My god woe be unto a woman with skin tags or a weird mole
*  You got skin tag
*  Surprisingly modern language on that yeah a weird mole they think of familiar sucking blood out of your third tip
*  You know that those ended the witch trials
*  Some lady was like you're a witch and everybody went ah and that was it
*  Oh really ended because they were getting annoyed with how she was just calling everybody
*  She hated a witch well. You know how it started fifth one it started with ergot
*  They had a late early frost and when you have an early frost sometimes
*  What's our guy wait a minute, but they've proven that ergot was in wheat during that time
*  It's just saying during then Massachusetts. What's our guy you went off?
*  I
*  Massachusetts would not have had that problem, but I don't know why it says they would have known how to fix it by them
*  Yeah, but they found evidence
*  Grasper got but the problem is they found evidence of find that because I know they found one of the reasons why they came up
*  With this theory in the first place they found evidence of ergot
*  What's ergot? It's like a fucking fungus that grows on wheat and it makes people trip balls
*  For sure there was one that happened in France
*  Bunch of people died
*  Yeah
*  it's it's actually the thing that they found in those vessels that that show that the the Romans and the
*  Ancient Greek were doing those psychedelic rituals they found these
*  Pottery vessels that have ergot in them where the is it available anymore ergot. I think is it's still available
*  It's super toxic to kills people that that when popular was started in a
*  1976 edition of Science magazine where it talked about the ergot theory, but as of now they think that it is not probably true
*  But why do they think it's not true?
*  I'm always when they start dismissing psychedelic stuff. I'm always like how do you know for sure for sure?
*  Because if ergot does exist and ergot is a thing that grows on wheat and it's really common bunch of people are just fucking
*  freaking out about things
*  Fascinate through the cultural fascination of LSD during this period was it's a 70s
*  So this theory came out the 70s
*  It said so people the theory came out like what so when people started using acid the very camera
*  See I was under the impression that there was actual evidence of ergot and like samples that they got I'm looking for that
*  So that's why I found this by typing in evidence of ergot
*  I might be mixed up because I know they found evidence. I've heard this story. Yeah, I've heard it, but I'm not sure if it's true
*  But I know they found evidence for sure in these ancient pottery vessels
*  So they know these like people that were involved in the like illucinean mysteries and all that shit that was going down in Greece
*  2000 plus years ago they were trapping balls
*  This says it led to this theory being put in the school curriculums as an explanation for the trial
*  No way school curriculum stuff that I don't know that they have
*  Actual evidence of it other than just being passed on I think I'm done with acid we got mushrooms. I don't need acid anymore
*  On the opposite you like acid more way more in acid lately what you get to control it no smooth smooth
*  It's a chemical
*  You know hitting the floor, but you are trusting move back
*  Chemists with your sanity yeah exactly
*  most trustworthy
*  CIA's writing this down right now. No like dose orange you fear with the good stuff
*  The stuff we used on Jack Ruby also, it's liquid you put it on paper on your hand
*  In so good that's gonna be a lot of you think seats in your hands. I don't think it's seats in no
*  It definitely does that's how the original yeah, that's how what's his face?
*  Larry what is I have touched it a lot of my bare hands. I've never gotten anything
*  What was the name of the Albert Hoffman? That's how Albert Hoffman discovered it
*  He was actually looking so it was a women's fertility drug
*  But what it was to it that was what it was to induce labor was it was it dried in or was it still wet I?
*  Think it's got it on his hands
*  I mean we think and he had a crazy dose apparently and then went on a bike ride and this dude just
*  Balls I had a festival I had a festival in Western Georgia a couple years ago
*  And and somebody was testing all the coke like we got a test at first and we're like I thought I'm gonna try it
*  But they were like you know
*  Chemically test like a fan they're like hundred percent pure by coke from that guy and then later they went to get acid from this
*  Check out a bus and they were like tested it
*  Zero percent acid in that what was it some sort of like liquid mescaline and then the guy who was like had it was
*  Like it was freshly dipped. It's all over my hands, and he just started flying whoa stories
*  I know as a music engineer of this being true because of the guy that like made acid was a grateful dead engine half a century
*  The guy who made acid one of the guys oh a guy who made it like the one of the guys
*  Oh the guys right okay, so not only is LSD absorbed through the skin on contact
*  But it can apparently stay potent for half a century
*  San Francisco sound engineer Elliott Curtis found that out for himself when he was fixing a
*  1960 synthesizer and then tripped for nine hours straight
*  completely unaware that the device
*  Encrusted with decades old LSD
*  Acid and made up a story bro. Yeah, or
*  Imagine if you leave a synthesizer, and you know I'm gonna paint this bitch with
*  Eventually gonna touch this someone's gonna get their greasy fucking hands
*  Well the old myth is a
*  Manson dipped a bunch of Bible pages and acid and then brought a Bible in the prison that would just eat it every day
*  Well Manson was in touch with Jolly West Jolly West visited Manson when he was in prison Jolly West was the head of MK
*  Ultra and they did LSD experiments on people and that's the that's the primary theory in the book chaos
*  Take chaos by this guy Tom O'Neill they made him crazy. It's buddy
*  Do you know fit Simmons it was next-door neighbors this guy was writing this book on the Manson family murders for 20 years
*  That's Tom O'Neill the books insane
*  So this Jolly West guy
*  Visited Manson when he was in jail visited Jack Ruby when he's in prison and Jack Ruby went nuts wait
*  Before they did the thing yeah before they did the thing look
*  I think what it was was they were trying to get rid of the anti-war movement
*  And they were trying to get rid of the civil rights movement
*  And they were trying to get rid of a bunch of different things that were going on at the same time and one of the ways
*  They did it was to a make all drugs illegal
*  but one of the best ways to make all drugs illegal and discredit the hippies is
*  Dose up a bunch of them who get it to murder people in horrific ways and then all of a sudden the hippies become the most
*  Dangerous force in America
*  If you've got the power of the media behind you and you've pushed that narrative and you make it happen
*  You know you're essentially waging war on
*  American civilians you're essentially waging like a psychological war on the population that's paying your salary
*  It is a wild thing they did, but they definitely did it damn yeah CIA is fucking lame
*  You they have too much power like all groups that have too much power
*  You're gonna do some wacky shit the Dulles the Dulles brothers they can kick rocks as far as I'm concerned
*  Who's that those airport? Yeah? That's them they might be
*  In the assassination of Canada how they killed JFK. Oh shit. I think there was a lot of people involved in that
*  I think that guy was he was tossing up the apple cart a little too much too much
*  They were like uh-uh too many people and back then again. This is just like 50 years past the drawing of people
*  I mean
*  You know like you go to fucking look for a photo from 1890 good luck, bitch
*  So you know see here you are 60 70 years later. That's nothing yeah, and then you're dealing with one president
*  That's gonna get rid of the fucking Federal Reserve shut the fuck up you are
*  What the fuck is this guy doing and then he's gonna get in a convertible and
*  Drive to Texas where they hated him in Texas pretty balls suddenly
*  But they hated him in Texas great headshot they hated him in Texas like Texas was red oh yeah
*  He's driving through Dallas. They hated you ever go to the X in Dallas. Yeah, go out the side
*  Yeah, is it weird how little it is like the area yeah?
*  Yeah, anybody who says you couldn't make that shot is fucking mines out of fucking mines
*  All the arguments that he couldn't make that shot are so stupid you think yeah, didn't get you got three off pretty quick though
*  Here's the thing and he missed one by like a mile it doesn't mean even that that was him
*  It doesn't mean it just means he was in that building like it
*  We're back on the same page the thing about it is the thing about it is they made up a
*  Theory on the count of three one two three and everyone just shot boom boom boom no they they did something like that
*  They saw him they probably all had a signal something
*  They're not if they're gonna shoot the fucking president
*  Now there's a guy open an umbrella for no, no that's nonsense now. You saw I've seen that
*  Some people think his fucking bodyguard shot him it's a whole secret service guy shot him look
*  It there was probably a bunch of people shooting at him. He got hit in the neck for sure he grabs
*  It's from the front yeah from the front he grabs his neck. Yeah, they altered it when they got to the second autopsy
*  They did two op toss them autopsies
*  They did they got his body initially in Dallas, and then they flew it to Bethesda
*  So in the interim they changed what was listed as an entry hole in his neck to a tracheotomy
*  And they say it's just like no no that was just like
*  lot of shenanigans between the two
*  Autopsies they wouldn't let him do it you got her. Yeah, they took the body
*  They were general showed up it was heavy-duty shit all people they're like
*  He's got to go the best book on this is best evidence by a guy named David Lifton who was an accountant
*  They hired him to go over the Warren Commission
*  And he went no, I'm sorry so back into the left
*  So this guy goes over this nobody would read the whole Warren Commission report. It's like fucking 900 pages
*  Oh, yeah, this dude read all of it. He read all of it and found all these inconsistencies all these things
*  It didn't make sense. Yeah, and so he writes his book about it his research was just reading it
*  Yeah
*  Doing a lot of people died dude a lot of people that saw the assassination died in weird ways
*  Bobby to like a giant number of people that were on the scene. Oh really yeah, yeah weird ways
*  Like they did a statistical analysis of what are the likelihood of all these people being either murdered or suicide
*  Whoa within a short period of time it was very low. Well, thank God for Zapruder. He was like the original world
*  Yeah, yeah
*  God he had his fucking it is any crazy that we know about this because of Dick Gregory
*  Is that right?
*  Gregory the comic brought on the herald of Rivera show we know about this because of her aldo and dick Greg
*  I didn't know that. Yep. They played it live on TV and it's fucking crazy. You gotta imagine that was 12 years after the assassination
*  Completely stopping a comic to become a full-time activist. Yeah, he started that just like right around here
*  Here
*  Right here he gets hit boom he's hit
*  Is he yes? Oh the neck he's hit now. We know something's going on. Yes. I was going wife does nothing
*  Thank you. I mean he literally got shot in the neck. I mean he's he's already probably dead
*  Seems pretty serious, but now watch this one. This is a rough one. This is why I'm voting for RFK. Oh
*  Oh
*  He's spewing yeah
*  He's had exploded
*  Exploded it's like oh, no, this is AI
*  enhancement of this Jamie
*  How come nobody's thrown there's a pruder film in the AI to clean this shit up
*  Good point, bro. That is clean the wildest video. Can we see that again? He got death ahead of head blow
*  That was tough you're right. He's probably already dead. He got hit through the neck with a bullet. He's already dead. He's dead
*  He just hasn't died yet. Wait a minute. Oh
*  She's lucky she didn't get in the way
*  And then she freaks the fuck out. Holy shit. Who's that guy behind? Who's the guy behind though?
*  Everybody's freaking out this gunshots going on. She has to do with it this lady. She had something to do with it
*  Oh, yeah, it's a hot. She's there with no man. Here's what's interesting
*  Here's what's interesting the spray goes forward, but the head goes backwards
*  Yeah, the head goes back into the lap, but it doesn't really it does because you open up a hole and it sprays out
*  As and then you go back right but it general Jen
*  Generally doesn't go that way it goes the other way what behind the bullet goes through and then sprays out the back
*  Did the bullet get out the back? It could be more than one person hitting him in the head at the same time, too
*  We're starting off heavy, huh? What happened? Oh hello
*  You know you have to consider. There's probably multiple gunners in the in the grassy knoll
*  They're not gonna take a chance when they're gonna assassinate the president. They're gonna have multiple dudes shooting
*  Yeah
*  Hmm, that's brain bro brain. That's great
*  They said that she climbed this crazy the news report initially said that she climbed out to try to retrieve parts of her husband's brain
*  Oh, that is just not true. Did they say she brought it to the hospital? I don't know I heard that she had like in a pocket
*  She did looks like he went and grabbed something and then went back. She maybe did grab a piece in full shot
*  Apparently she brought it to the doc to the hospital. Oh, it is a good one. I tried to give it to know again
*  Can you put that yeah, I'm actually gonna do that just glue your brains back together. They can do it teeth
*  Teeth of the brain such a such a while hey if we're doing this what happened to the bowing guy oh
*  The bowing guy realized that he's a piece of shit. We tell me what's going on. Yeah, we did figure that out
*  Yeah, we talked about on stage the bowing guy realized the guy who committed suicide realized that he did a terrible thing
*  By accusing a company of cutting corners, and he felt embarrassed he felt stupid
*  He shamed this great company that has done so well for all of us
*  How many times we flowed on a Boeing plane and he did the right planes are amazing kill himself
*  He knew it. He was like what have I done so he killed himself, but the wheels are falling off doors are coming off
*  That's a fun. You're a gg
*  That's a leg bowing whistleblower told friend not to believe suicide before he died oh Christ oh
*  Hey, if somebody says I killed myself that means I didn't come with up any time you hear that though
*  You're like are you about to kill yourself though?
*  But it's not if you're Julian Assange yeah, right if you really think they're gonna whack you that's what what's his name said to
*  McAfee yeah a lot of those guys
*  No
*  Wild boy he's going because he has the chiefs John McAfee was one of the only guys
*  Yeah, I didn't even have him live on the podcast I had him on the phone
*  We did a podcast with him when he was running from the law
*  In his country because someone he says they set him up by killing his neighbor, but he was also
*  Allegedly online showing people how to cook meth
*  There was a account that was linked to him that was like he had a lab
*  In his backyard I mean he is document this dude had a fucking full-on. He was a genius billionaire
*  He's a full-on meth lab he created McAfee anti viral software hell. Yeah, just fuck
*  He had a sex back where was he in believes his house was he in Belize wild story?
*  See if you can find the story of his meth lives in Belize this boy we had him on our podcast
*  We have him live in a zoom yeah
*  That's amazing what was this what year was this during COVID?
*  Like a John Goodman character. He's so crazy. He was so funny on this
*  He's so crazy, but also really was in charge of like anti virus software
*  He's a real genius
*  He was on everyone's computer and he said what he said is that he gives you donated them computers here have some computers
*  I had like malware in at the government, so he gave him like 50 laptops no okay
*  That's what he says I
*  Mean that's how they do it. I mean that's how I would do it. Yeah, if I was him. That's how we did it
*  We sold like that type of we sold like spy technology to our allies. That's why
*  Yeah, yeah
*  Huawei phones like the most sophisticated phones in the world. What was that? What was the alien movie? That's how they beat them
*  At the end he was making various types of bass independence independence day
*  That's what he says. I think it's the finest drug ever conceived he wrote one singling out the indescribable
*  Hypersexuality of the super perv powder, but warning that I had visual and auditory hallucinations
*  And the worst paranoia of my life that guy
*  That guy had the worst paranoia of his life well hitler liked it. Why he's so clean cut there
*  But he's so different when batten shane got to him
*  By the time he fell off to me
*  So when we had a podcast with him he was on the run
*  Oh
*  He made himself a friend
*  You know what man something I admire
*  Kind of admire that I admire the the billionaire who goes totally off the rails he just lived only with prostitutes
*  It only prostitutes is either one of the women shit to a hammock. Yes, just yes
*  Oh
*  Apparently he was having ladies shit through a hammock on him
*  He was like he was like do I ask you about your sexual proclivities like yeah, you asked us if we were gay right away
*  Now he was like if that makes you uncomfortable I've done way more Matt was like from like higher hammocks
*  So the splat was bigger
*  What a psycho don't you love the fact that there's a guy like that running around
*  Oh, yeah, I want more guys like this your his neighbor office. Oh, yeah, sure kill you got to sell your property
*  I was like shit again. I think they were framing framing the boy
*  They might have been or saying he's been on that fucking hypersexuality
*  Merlin on the drugs he said he was on
*  Like I don't work. Yeah drugs. Let's get rid of bro. He's a guy doing meth who's heavily armed. Yeah being shit on yeah
*  There's believe what happens there allegedly
*  Got a bunch of like armed. He just started building an army. Yeah, he was he was
*  Having fun off one of the bros
*  Also, it's like how come this guy gets to have an army. Oh, yeah, he got suicided in
*  Spain Boeinged yeah
*  Ah he got suicide I think he was when he tweeted he was like if I die it I didn't do it
*  He's on a pound of crank
*  Fucking Garmin watches
*  Now we could blame them if I did do it bro, you know, that's good
*  He could have redlined his heart he's 80 years old doing crank beast. How old was the guy when he died?
*  He was no way
*  He's in methed up 70s methed up 70s is like
*  75 yeah, you look good. They were like 70 when we interviewed meth up 70s is like
*  Yeah, you know pro athletes when they're 35 their knees are fucked or a fat guy's heart
*  Yeah, that's a rough fat guys get two seats on the plane speaking of Boeing
*  Yeah
*  Yeah, it's a weird one that guy's a interesting fucking character he would be a great movie
*  Yeah, yeah in the movie have him kill his neighbor to that fuck. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you decide it's your movie
*  Let's let's kill. Yeah, and you gotta get the hammock
*  I
*  Awesome because they only mowed the glass
*  Dog to that's what I heard what yeah, the neighbor did something to his dog
*  Maybe kill one of those dogs over the line. That's what I'm saying. You gotta go full John. It's cool when John wick did it
*  Yeah, that's how you do it. Exactly. My dog imagine hurting Carl. Yeah, I would never shoot my neighbor
*  Yeah
*  Math be like they killed my dog not just
*  Guard dog meth engineered in a fucking lab. He built on his property
*  Documented online he wanted the community to know about this meth lab
*  He wanted to know about how proficient his meth lab was no fucking really like
*  Scientifically accurate everything was measuring everything perfectly and I beakers and all this shit he documented it at all
*  It's all shit. I'll keep meth lab and believes
*  All day, but what it is is just that's just engineered meth. That's what bath salts was was they took bath salts
*  Yeah, that meth not engineered. It's just different. It's like so there's different like there's
*  There's different things that you can do to a compound. So it's not exactly the same compound
*  Like five methoxy
*  Dimethyltryptamine was legal for a while because it wasn't technically dimethyltryptamine. It's even stronger than
*  So they add an oxygen molecule to it. Look this is better than meth
*  It's if you can engineer meth if you're a super genius who makes fucking software that can stop viruses
*  I bet you'd figure out I'd make some killer. Yeah. Yeah, and this dude cooked up some fine shit, apparently
*  Damn. Yeah, make you want to try it
*  Into math is the thing is I have a feeling you never want to go back to normal
*  Like flying first class that was one of the things that lady said the lady in the FTX
*  The lady in the FTX trials. She was talking about how
*  Being on amphetamines all the time makes you realize how normal sober
*  Interaction how fucking boring they are and she like tweeted it. I would take I would take adderall at work
*  I know it was great. Whoo
*  I was working like customers. I was the front desk
*  People what is like hey?
*  Wacked so you act he got a dollar sign whacked
*  So you got whacked for money? That what it means saying? This is when he said like oh if I say so if I suicide myself
*  I didn't okay
*  Getting subtle messages from US officials saying in effect. We're coming for you McAfee
*  You got up we're going to kill you you we we're going to kill yourself
*  I always said yeah, it's an interesting way to say I got a tattoo today
*  Just in case if I suicide myself I didn't I was whacked check my right arm
*  So what happened to him though it was it a suicide or was it something else was he in Spanish prison?
*  He was in prison. He was just about to be extradited when he was found supposedly hanging
*  Shouldn't have happened, but the one looked into it the Spanish
*  Authority said suicide of course they did of course. That's what they were paid to say that's what the
*  So you're getting a tattoo saying hey if it comes out that I'm dead
*  It's because somebody like killed me and instead you got an artful shwacked
*  Yeah, it looks nice
*  Why would the government kill him that's what I don't get why don't we
*  Know too much about what did he do all the all the malware?
*  Yeah, and I say massage they all got the so what do you think it is you think he found some stuff out when he was
*  Like I think he was like one of the architects of that type of thing
*  I think he probably fucked with them, and they were like don't fuck with us. Why'd you give us malware now?
*  We're gonna fuck. I'm gonna tell everybody right he's on meth. He's going. I'm gonna tell everybody
*  He's talking shit
*  They like to talk on meth and if he really did have all their stuff
*  That is a crime like if you really did install malware and get top-secret shit that they'll kill you for that mm-hmm
*  They might not even bother taking you to the benefit joining the Ben MGMT
*  McAfee said he and his team exploited a flaw in the Android operating system that allowed him to read encrypted messages from whatsapp
*  Whoa, oh he could read his motor investigated
*  Reported he had sent reporters malware infected phones to make this hack work whoa
*  You can't ruin his reputation either course about the phones had malware on them
*  He said how that malware got there is the story which we will release after speaking with Google
*  Good for you taking involves a serious
*  Arquitecture crazy move look at this it involves a serious flaw
*  In the Android architecture, what is that flaw? I just wanted to make the MGMT joke
*  I
*  Says McAfee moved MGT to mining of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies always a criminal
*  Yeah rules like we shook night city he stuck easy on Kimmel. Oh, yeah
*  He's pretty much. He was like you know lots of ways to kill somebody
*  He makes us like hire someone to stick him with a needle with fucking aids
*  You know I'm talking about and everyone in the audience like
*  What though he did that on Jimmy Kim?
*  A flack jacket bro. How wild cool Kimmel had shook night on it was cool Kimmel right?

*  Oh, yeah, the fires were crazy in California. You ain't never seen anything like it. They're here now. Yeah
*  Bullshit, listen, they they're they're bad
*  But not they're not bad like it is in LA because it doesn't rain there, right?
*  Everything like you know, they have those things like the colors for fires. Oh, yeah, what's the fire warning? It was always red
*  It was always red
*  It's not red for like three months out of the do not smoke a cigarette on Laurel Canyon
*  If you're an asshole do not these fucking assholes that throw cigarettes out the window when they're done with them these littering cocksuckers
*  You're not even allowed to smoke in your car with the windows up on the way up Laurel Canyon. You're not yeah when it's like
*  I don't because it just goes up in a blaze. So I was coming home one night
*  I got evacuated three times when I lived in California three fucking times
*  But I was coming home one night and the whole side of the highway
*  I was coming from home from fear factor the whole side of the highway for an hour was on fire
*  You send us pictures from your flip phone, bro. It was it was just like one side of the highway
*  Yeah, one side green. It was mad. Yeah, it was like it was like a scene from the fucking that's what it's like
*  That's what it's like. It was like a scene from fucking a Hobbit movie
*  Why are we driving that way the rings
*  Apocalyptic dude, this was not nearly as bad as this is the 405
*  This is head to Santa Monica, but this is this is much more contained than what I saw
*  What I saw was an hour of driving a full hour going like 40 miles an hour 50 miles an hour
*  Oh, no, but it was raining ashes like snow
*  So you were you were seeing ashes fall out of sky like snow the whole right side of the highway and dude
*  Sometimes that shit jumps you get a crosswind it jumps it hits a car it gets other cars
*  There was in Northern California a whole highway full stop cars. Everybody died. Yikes. Everybody got consumed by fire
*  Where you going this is like praying
*  Donald Trump, please help us. Please save us Jesus Christ, and you don't know where the fire is you're just guessing
*  It's not like fire going right to it
*  You don't know you don't know where you're driving you can't see this is a windy road
*  This is some poor uber eats driver. He's like, I'm gonna get there bro. This is so nuts, man. This is so nuts
*  Oh, man
*  So this is what I don't miss and I know they have fires out here
*  But bro, you ain't never seen fires like those dry climate high grasses
*  And the worst is when it rains a lot earlier in the year because then you get extra grass
*  Oh
*  Often it stops raining everything turns brown
*  But it's natural fires right like it's supposed to happen
*  Well, we saw the side of my somebody that off on behind pink dot behind my old window. You saw it start just there
*  It's like a straight uphill with like it just gone gone within like 20 minutes. It goes in like a little like one bush on fire
*  burns through the houses yikes, man
*  There was one time in LA when we were at the store and above pink dot was on fire that was it
*  Yeah, that was that one. Yeah, was that
*  But was that what the one where we were like seeing the helicopters fly overhead they were trying to dump water on it planes
*  We're dumping water on it. It was nuts. It was like a war was going on right above the sign
*  There was yeah, I saw I was right up that hill. Yeah, I was in Salt Lake
*  I was driving to Stan hoax down in Bisbee. There was like it was crazy
*  I was driving you could watch the helicopters picking up the water out of the lake
*  No and flying over the highway and dropping it on the mountain that was on fire
*  Then I got to the fucking Grand Canyon, and it had just burned
*  For for real like two hours straight. It was just the moon like there was no
*  Vegetation it was just stumps
*  Everything was black. It was crazy. Yeah, it was crazy those forest fires are wild
*  That's not so wake up called how vulnerable
*  Yeah, really are that was the one time where people in LA were cool
*  Like everybody was so cool after the fires early. Hi
*  Good to see you. Yeah, happy to be alive. Did you remember in New York when fucking Canada caught on fire?
*  That's crazy. Those missed you know the conspiracy theory about that. They popped up pretty quickly
*  So I'm just saying I don't know whole Manhattan was full of ash and dark
*  Conspiracy is the color of the smoke
*  The color of the smoke was strange ready coincided with
*  There was a shipment that was lost
*  The shipment that was lost somewhere was some kind of chemical and this chemical it was a
*  Toxic chemical and there was a high volume of it
*  It was lost and then also these fires break out in Canada and this fucking orange
*  Smoke is making its way across New York weird smoke like a weird color smoke now that could be I'm a moron
*  That could be the Sun the way it goes
*  The fucking Sun I've never seen orange smoke before it was orange
*  I was a Montauk it look weird nor has anybody that I know ever seen like that kind of orange
*  They told everybody to change every filter in your car. Whoa. It was like emails
*  Did anybody do like an analysis of the smoke and go what the fuck is this?
*  Now it just smoke or did something burn somewhere that was toxic never does smoke and I was doing shows
*  I didn't know I woke up late. It was on the ground
*  The first day I was like am I fucking this hungover that it's like one day was cloud everything's hazy
*  Yeah, right. Did it look orange?
*  Until like night two or three day two or three
*  See it coming. It was crazy like it first. It was just slightly smoggy. You were like I don't know
*  I remember driving in being like this is fucking weird am I dumb?
*  Cuz no one's mentioning anything and I was like it's fucking weird out right yeah, and then by the yeah by the
*  The most like the height of it. It was fucking insane. It was just orange. It was like a cluster
*  Come on that seems weird it was scary. It was weird isn't that weird look at the color 2 p.m..
*  Oh, yeah, look at that if it's like Rachel Dolezal. I'm not
*  I'm not a chemist ladies and gentlemen. I don't know anything about
*  Smog color, but that seems highly unusual
*  It's super unusual. I'm just gonna say that
*  There's
*  Conspiracy theories that are warranted so I didn't get it nearly as bad as
*  As New York well it's cuz it was coming down towards us. Can you flip through these faster? Yeah, why don't you move quick?
*  Only take trust me those orange for a lot neuro gums don't just
*  Yeah
*  How dare you young Jamie you're being so nasty they try that earlier you change

*  Motherfucker to bring the heat. It's just a good dude man, and he said I was like dude open up a place here
*  It's like we're talking about it, so I hope they do I mean like a real good sub shop come a lot
*  There we get your own oh, he'll come by he should move here
*  We just come back to all the good podcasts again next month. Oh, he's worthless in New York love that dude
*  Yeah, get him down here. He can make a name for himself. Why is he worthless in New York? Well nobody respects him
*  Listen this is a land of rebuilding yeah, that's right. That's what they said after they stole it from the Comanche
*  I
*  You burned we get the casino
*  Don't even think they have a casino. They don't get a casino
*  They were too fierce nasty. They had a poker
*  They get a casino with that fire out you guys should get something Germany like a water park
*  This is you ever seen this is that a Comanche? Oh, that's legit. That's
*  Blood of the white man on it. No, that's why we got it. It's probably got some beer blood
*  Probably from before the white man even showed up and fucked everything up
*  It's so smooth I have a friend who has a ranch out here that apparently was where the Comanche lived
*  It's just overrun with arrowheads. They carve him down. Well. They make them. It's called flint napping
*  They actually put a piece of buckskin over their knee and they hold this like slate. Oh Jesus Christ. That's don't do that
*  That's like literally it could be a thousand years old
*  Oh
*  That thing is spell on me. It's actually probably about four or five hundred years old well, but
*  Allegedly, I don't know. This is what someone told me but the thing is that like these fucking guys man
*  They made those things by knocking rocks together. There's like a very specific way
*  It's called flint napping like you knock it off to make a flake
*  And then you have to like knock it against like something soft like your leg and they chip away till they make this razor edge
*  These things Jesus like it they figured out how to do it and
*  These fucking things are all over this guy's ranch. He sent me a bunch of them
*  He sent me like ones that are like all marked off by like this this like this is got this guy's flint napping
*  They had all the time in the world. No no this guy's a guy that like knows how to
*  Recreate this shit
*  Hard they get it
*  This guy fucks
*  Like one of those
*  With like a leather butcher apron on yeah
*  This is these people are a problem though because some of these people are not this guy
*  I'm not saying this guy, but some of these people are unethical and then they go to the very the sand
*  Oh look what I found. Well the appropriation to it does look pretty real. It looks a lot like that one
*  you know what's okay to appropriate Indians white people you see the
*  I
*  Make this
*  It's like Boston Globe they had a photo of st. Patrick's Day, and it's black dude dressed like a leprechaun like hey

*  That was a quote from Connor. Oh really acting is harder than you have to listen to me
*  Mo that's not true
*  Okay acting Roadhouse or fight Khabib again shut the fuck up
*  Crazy talk that's crazy. I think he probably just meant that he's bad at it
*  He broke his fucking leg in a fight. No he broke his leg like that's harder. Yes
*  Harder
*  But his level of if he's good at it or not right the guys promoting a movie there you go
*  I think he's making but acting is a great promoter
*  Completely blown out versus doing

*  Time consumption time consumption action and fighting and stunts
*  It's also memory in the line and you have to time things correctly on engaging with another person

*  It's like Pelosi in the drink
*  There he didn't let it go. He's still holding it. Yeah, that's what kept him alive humping that machine. That's a fucking five-pound weight
*  What was he doing? That's a 25. He was trying to do decline benchpress
*  It's a tough move. Why the fuck would he be doing decline benchpress? Because he's been working out
*  He wants to mix it up. He wants to do some of these he needs some fucking kettlebells in his life. A decline?
*  He keeps going he does it in a second keep going he does it when he's doing stuff he does it this keeps you funny though

*  Yeah that's different
*  But I've known him forever
*  I've known him forever
*  I've known him since he was
*  He has a problem with all these tall guys over 5'8
*  Is that the issue?
*  Well he was confident when you knew him. Newer than him
*  First time I met him he was like fuck it I don't like your confidence you asshole
*  Yeah exactly
*  He's like welcome to the comedy scene
*  He's a comedian, it's out of love
*  He's always like you youngsters

*  He's in an arena
*  He's in an arena man
*  Of all the things we just said about Bobby that he'll be mad at
*  Me saying he's like Voss
*  Is gonna be the one
*  That's awesome
*  Voss is hilarious
*  I meant he's like Voss when it comes to talking shit
*  And when you're new and you show up
*  Voss will be the first guy to be like look at you
*  Dumbass what are you doing here
*  And it's out of love
*  It's also like seeing if you can hang
*  Yeah
*  Like are you gonna get upset if someone talks shit about you
*  Come on we're having fun
*  So many people have told me Voss was mean
*  And it's like he's the nicest dude
*  Sweet guy
*  Listen there's one of the best things that can ever happen
*  Is you bomb and then you hang out with your friends
*  And you go oh my god I just ate dick
*  Bro what the fuck happened to you up there and then you're laughing
*  You feel terrible but at least everybody's laughing
*  And you're having a good time and busting each other's balls
*  Bro I watched 15 people walk out
*  No yeah
*  That was funny
*  It was fucking hot death dude
*  Montgomery tried to do that to me
*  The other night at the mothers
*  I got off stage and I was like
*  This time I meant it
*  Because I actually did do very bad
*  I was like fuck I sucked up there
*  And he was like yeah what was that
*  As soon as he said that I was like you fucking
*  Worry about you
*  I used to have a friend
*  I went in there
*  Talking shit to myself the second somebody
*  Else was like yeah that sucked I was like don't ever worry about what I'm doing
*  God I'll never do that again
*  You never know are we
*  In a play together
*  Like are we having a real conversation
*  How you doing right
*  I don't know man
*  Yeah what was that
*  I got a free bear claw from a dumpster
*  I don't know where to go
*  Okay
*  I went too hard on him I feel bad about it
*  Well he was the best
*  He murdered last night I killed Tony
*  I mean fucking murdered
*  Fresh minute does a fresh minute every week
*  Alright he's got a minute
*  That style is like he could write
*  About anything because it's so his style
*  And if you know who he is
*  He's so ridiculous
*  It's one of those things like Hedberg
*  Like when Mitch Hedberg would go on after like a rapper
*  Like they would put him on after like comedy rap
*  And it would be death
*  But once people figured out it was Mitch Hedberg
*  And he got appropriate opening acts
*  Then people came to see it
*  They knew it bro
*  Like typical down the line comedy
*  And they're like not this weirdo
*  Some guys would play music and they would have funny songs
*  They'd close with that and then they'd have Hedberg go up
*  Man Hedberg was great
*  He'd go on letterman and a joke would bomb
*  And you'd go I'm aware that joke is stupid
*  Which you never saw on late night
*  It was so polished
*  My mom loves those applause breaks
*  Mitzi she gave him two spots once
*  She gave him two spots once he was going to be in town
*  She gave him two spots and then somebody called in
*  Whoever and she was like oh cancel that new guy
*  And I was like working the phones like comedy hero
*  New guy
*  Cancel him
*  Mitzi didn't give a fuck
*  Call that Hedberg guy and tell him he's got one less spot
*  Whoa
*  Hey I'm sorry
*  So Tuesday's out
*  Fucking Jeremy Dingle called in
*  For who?
*  Somebody that she liked at the time
*  It didn't matter
*  It was like the fucking Hedberg's going to do a spot
*  Was her finger that far off the pulse?
*  Yeah
*  Paramedics had their finger on her pulse
*  No it wasn't just that
*  She didn't know about anything that was going on outside the store
*  Nor did she give a fuck
*  But she seemed to kind of like a gimmick
*  She seemed like a gimmick?
*  She would have liked him then
*  Yeah she had some wacky ideas about like selling sitcoms
*  And she wanted like comics
*  But that was what was going on back in the day
*  So you gotta imagine like that's why the comic store has podcasts now
*  Why?
*  Because we all started podcasts, the podcasts got huge
*  So back in the day the comic store was seeing all these comics
*  Developing and getting sitcoms
*  Like from all the way from Chico and the Man
*  With Freddie Prince
*  You know he was like the first
*  The first comic to get a fucking sitcom
*  And then there was Samford and Son was that along that time
*  With Red Fox
*  And then it was of course Roseanne
*  And Tim Allen and Seinfeld
*  And Brett Butler
*  And then there was the formula
*  Everybody wanted to get a fucking sitcom
*  So Mitzi had these ideas of like developing sitcoms
*  So she created these like characters
*  You should be this guy
*  She named Mencia
*  She named him
*  What do you mean named him?
*  It's not his name
*  She told him that
*  Wow
*  She was right
*  But it was not just that, it was like a bunch of different things
*  She wanted people to do things
*  It wasn't as bad as like some comedy club owners had terrible fucking suggestions
*  What are you doing over there Ari?
*  Ari's playing grab at us
*  Trying to kiss me or something
*  Kiss
*  My buddy opened for Gallagher and he was
*  Joe List
*  And Gallagher's like you're tall
*  You should do a whole basketball thing
*  You should come on stage with a basketball
*  And then dunk it and then do your act
*  And List was like I'm not going to do that
*  Kid Rock will hit you with advice
*  He was hitting me
*  He was like you dress like shit up there
*  You should be wearing a suit and a bow tie
*  Like Sinatra
*  Like those guys use
*  You could really separate yourself
*  Yeah I like it
*  I'm thinking he's right
*  I'm thinking you and bow tie
*  He was the first to facetime me after SNL
*  To be like
*  He facetimed me and was like
*  How do you think you did?
*  I hate that question
*  Tell me I fucking bombed you dickhead
*  I fucking hung up on him
*  Yeah good
*  He was fucking with me
*  He's funny but
*  How do you think you did?
*  He wanted me to own the libs dude
*  He was like that was pussy shit
*  He was like you should have won all day
*  He said retard he said gay
*  No I know but for him that's
*  He saw my stand up show and was like
*  You're not going hard enough
*  You need to say like the N word
*  I don't know
*  That wasn't his actual note for the record
*  Sure
*  He'll get rowdy though
*  We haven't done this since you did SNL
*  We did
*  Actually I don't think we did
*  Didn't we? No that was before
*  Any nuggets behind the scenes
*  That no one knows
*  Green Room and podcast spill over so much
*  I don't know what it was
*  It was so weird such a fucking corporate thing
*  You got in there finally
*  What a completion of a fucking storyline
*  I know but it seems like a fun night
*  It is a fun night
*  To do the sketches and fuck around and the party
*  My family was there the party kind of sucks
*  I've been to the party a bunch of times
*  And it's great sometimes
*  It sucked even knowing the guy
*  Say goodbye to another fucking person
*  So we can go drink
*  The whole time I just had to say hello thank you goodbye
*  To every single person that was there
*  It was like a wedding
*  Did it feel like a rite of passage?
*  What did it feel like for you?
*  It's a cool win
*  I think it's nice for that
*  I mean obviously it just brought the story back up again
*  But
*  You were defended quite a bit
*  But it was also
*  Honestly this was like them saying sorry
*  That's what it was
*  Admission of guilt
*  It was the closest they can come to an admission of guilt
*  Which is what it was
*  Here's the thing
*  Here's the thing
*  It's like acknowledging a talent
*  It's like recognizing hey
*  This guy might be one of the biggest comics ever
*  And it's happening right now
*  And we should probably get back on board
*  Don't go 20 years
*  I agree but it's
*  Annoying with the cancel shit
*  Because they go he's doing great what are you talking about
*  He's also a good comic who worked his way up
*  And has a sketch show and all this other shit
*  And sells a ton of tickets
*  So they have to acknowledge it
*  Isn't that always the goal?
*  Sure
*  But if you were doing that well and not doing well
*  Nationally they wouldn't be like
*  He still deserves an apology if he wasn't doing as well
*  Exactly
*  No no no no
*  Listen listen listen
*  I'm not saying you suck but I'm saying
*  If you're not huge
*  You still got fucked
*  It's better for everybody if they don't say the words
*  It's better for everybody
*  Everybody knows the truth
*  But it's better for everybody if they don't say the words
*  Because also it keeps them silly
*  They stay silly
*  What do you mean silly?
*  You stay silly
*  You stay ridiculous
*  You've made ridiculous decisions
*  And you've got kind of a ridiculous enterprise
*  You stay ridiculous
*  Yeah that's what it is
*  The worst starship ever
*  You've got this thing
*  You're trying to be the fastest runner
*  And you're wearing 150 pounds on your back
*  And you had a fast runner and you dropped them
*  Yeah it's like stay ridiculous
*  Don't apologize, stay on the course
*  It's better for Gillian Key
*  I agree
*  I thought it was nice
*  I thought it was nice
*  I think it's good if we're going to talk about all the culture shit
*  I think it's cool they brought me back
*  And it's cool I said yes
*  I think it's a nice moment for everybody
*  Because I don't want to be a guy
*  You don't want to be a guy that's like
*  Fuck everybody that said fuck me
*  I don't want to do that
*  Can we just stop?
*  And that's what they offered the fucking olive branch
*  They were the ones who
*  They should
*  And they should, they did the right thing
*  Most people were just like
*  That person forever that I hated once
*  They did the cool thing
*  They see where the tide is going
*  You steer into the waves
*  And also they got caught up in it
*  Everybody did
*  They got caught up in it
*  And so I don't have any problem with that
*  Is it effective now?
*  100%
*  TMZ tried to do a whole thing on him
*  I read every single tweet about it
*  Because I'm a psycho
*  And it was like I like him more now
*  Bigger fan, that's hilarious
*  Thanks for this
*  TMZ knew what they were doing
*  There was another one too with an Asian comic
*  TMZ didn't care at all
*  They got fucking what's his name
*  Corky
*  Corky from Life Goes On
*  I was like, I'm gonna tell you something about my TMZ guy
*  That's AI
*  Corky was not alive
*  Corky was like, that was fine dude
*  We're human, we're allowed to be made fun of
*  It was like, hell yeah Corky
*  Corky from Life Goes On is still around
*  I'm saying Corky is going strong
*  He's chugging along
*  He's a go-getter that kid
*  Big headed weirdo
*  He had his own show
*  Corky's a beast dude
*  That show was the wildest thing
*  They put a guy with Down Syndrome
*  At the star of a show
*  Quite a noggin
*  He's very high functioning
*  That's how powerful a role is
*  He's still the reference
*  To reference
*  Of Down Syndrome
*  Well Billy Elliot's in there
*  Don't get going
*  No, no, no
*  I'm saying
*  People with Down Syndrome
*  Can have higher
*  They have regular IQs
*  A lot of the time
*  And huge dicks
*  You know the Louis
*  Mantra or whatever
*  They burn your house down
*  You build a couple twigs and leaves with a house
*  And they go, he's got a house
*  You're like, well I had a mansion
*  And now I'm living in a twig hut
*  They're not happy unless you're completely destroyed
*  I hear you, but what did you choose to focus on?
*  It's great, it's an S&O
*  No, no, no, that is true though
*  That was like a thing
*  That I was worried about
*  I should say something in the monologue
*  No, I'm not saying that
*  The idea is that because I'm hosting
*  They're going to go see
*  We didn't do anything wrong
*  We didn't do anything wrong
*  But that was funny, don't look that up please
*  That was funny
*  It was perfect
*  It was a perfect way to handle it
*  You used to have a great joke at the New Jersey Room
*  About meeting like a waitress
*  Because where do I know you?
*  At the time, because you were the topic of conversation
*  Every single time
*  Someone would be like
*  For real, it would always be like an Asian woman
*  Would come up to me and be like
*  You were really funny, what was your name?
*  Can I look you up?
*  Please don't
*  Literally if you looked me up
*  The first thing would be like, hates Asians
*  Damn
*  That headline, oh man that's not true at all
*  I get to watch them go
*  You said there was a waitress
*  That was so funny, where do I know you from?
*  You're like, I've been here before
*  She goes, no
*  I've been so long
*  I think I've been here, we probably hung out
*  Well Yang likes you
*  Yang's the bro
*  I love Yang
*  Ron Yang, David Taylor's a little friend
*  Yin Yang twins
*  Whatever, we don't need to discuss this
*  What else is going on?
*  Congratulations
*  What did you do this time?
*  You must be in trouble, it's been a week
*  What are you doing?
*  I find if you stay offline
*  That's the key, if you don't see it
*  Wait, do you have a new one? I don't even know about this one
*  No, I just got there
*  I've just reached Not Online
*  You're a Not Online? I'm Not Online
*  Good for you
*  SNL knocked me out of it
*  This special, when I put out my Netflix special I deleted Twitter
*  Twitter's evil
*  And I deleted Reddit, because I was reading those comments
*  Everyone's smiles slip back into that
*  You have the app, that's how much you're evil
*  Since SNL I've been way off
*  Because I know, you don't want it
*  A lot of people are saying I suck
*  Listen, there's going to be a bunch of people
*  That think everything sucks
*  You're dealing with giant numbers
*  Each individual seems significant
*  Even if they're fucking morons you never want to talk to
*  Beethoven's symphony has bad comments
*  On YouTube
*  I bet it does
*  It's very funny
*  Shit was whack
*  Boring
*  Play more Drake
*  You can't be focused on that
*  For real, Drake is better than Beethoven
*  More than Beethoven
*  This is why it doesn't work
*  You've got to think of it in a numbers way
*  The human brain is designed to recognize
*  Threats and problems
*  When everything's great you don't think about it
*  So if you have ten positive people
*  Shane, you're the fucking man, that's great
*  One guy goes, this guy's lame as fuck
*  This guy's got to act
*  So fucking
*  Say a bunch of shit
*  That one stands out
*  You've got nine people that think you're awesome
*  One douchebag thinks you suck
*  Now when you scale that up to millions and millions of people
*  And who's writing comments
*  The majority of them are
*  Disgruntled people that are unhappy with their position in life
*  Do you think toothpaste feels that way
*  When they're like, who the fuck was that one dentist
*  The one out of ten
*  What a corny fucking dentist
*  One guy won't recommend me
*  After all I've done for you
*  What else do I have to show you
*  Also I know what you're doing right now
*  And I appreciate it, game recognize game
*  You drink one motherfucker
*  I'm drinking them, I've been drinking them
*  No you're not
*  I feel like the pot just got started
*  The pot did just start
*  That mushroom chocolate's not fucking around
*  Has it kicked in
*  Oh yeah, feeling good
*  I can't look at the screen anymore, it's too wavy
*  Do do do do
*  Do do do
*  Boy imagine if they didn't make all that stuff
*  Illegal, they didn't do the Manson thing
*  And they just like let psychedelics roam
*  What would, no the other one
*  That one too, that one too
*  I mean Charles, but that one too, they whacked her too
*  They definitely whacked her right
*  Oh I was talking about Manson
*  She was annoying
*  Damn James
*  Damn, looks like my bed
*  There's so many fucking amazing visual artists
*  She got rid of her like she's bothering us
*  Oh that's exactly what it was
*  She apparently was talking
*  And she banged both of them
*  She banged both brothers
*  Bobby and JFK
*  Do you think the second one was on recommendation from the first
*  Probably get her off of his back
*  You got to fuck my brother
*  If you fuck my brother
*  Wait until you have Bobby's cock
*  Marilyn you're too fucking crazy for me
*  I gotta run a country
*  If you think oh I failed Jack
*  That's not what you can do for me
*  That's what you can do for my brother
*  The mob and the CIA are trying to kill me
*  I don't have time for your nonsense
*  Why some say come on the face
*  Do you think that one brother's watching her at whatever the inauguration was
*  When she's sitting in front of the wife
*  And the other brother just looking at his brother going
*  Either way she took a shot in the face too
*  Can you imagine you're the president
*  And you're banging everybody
*  And everybody knows but nobody talks about it
*  That was the world back then
*  That was the world back then
*  Everyone was being bros
*  When I said earlier I think it has merit to it
*  Like who do you want
*  Do you want the warmonger or the pussy hound
*  The pussy hound
*  Always trying to keep us out of war
*  Just keep them
*  Keep them pussy hound
*  Jesus Christ Marilyn
*  Good lord
*  What's that on the side
*  She's making a face
*  She looks old there
*  Poor lady been through a lot
*  That's a bad picture
*  Come on son
*  Look at that 25 year old
*  Normal Christian 25 year old to the left
*  Who was the playwright
*  Tennessee Williams
*  Yeah
*  No
*  Tennessee Williams
*  So was the playwright
*  She married Demagio
*  Demagio would put flowers on her
*  Arthur Miller
*  The Demagio one was rough
*  Why
*  Because he put flowers on her grave
*  He loved her
*  And this was like wow
*  Wasn't it like the overlap between Kennedy and Demagio
*  She was fucking killing
*  This high level dick
*  Look at this fucking the Jew got some
*  He looks like the guy from The Wire
*  He got a lot
*  He married her again
*  Women like that
*  They're just a drug
*  It's a drug
*  It's fucking John McAfee's meth
*  That's what it is
*  Look at this dumb fucking bitch
*  And every fucking high level fucking part
*  How dare you say that
*  Hey Miller you brought your dumb fucking bitch
*  Don't be
*  I hate when you're sexist and misogynistic
*  She was this fucking high level novelist
*  She had a crazy IQ higher IQ than Einstein
*  Give it a go
*  There is literally zero shot on earth
*  That's actually true
*  I'll bet you a million dollars
*  I'm sure it's on the internet
*  There's no way
*  Slow down SNL
*  Five bucks
*  Twenty
*  That's an SNL paycheck
*  For the record
*  Matt TV paid more
*  Guess how much money
*  You get paid to host SNL
*  How much
*  $5,000
*  Oh
*  More than I thought
*  We rated 21 Jump Street's
*  fucking dressing room afterwards
*  Five grand for a week of work
*  We rated 21 Jump Street's
*  21 Savage's
*  Unless they just fucked me again
*  Wouldn't that be like a million
*  Five grand
*  Wait so what does 21 get
*  Musical guests
*  You might get 10
*  You got a little more
*  If Siren Life bounces back
*  If that is what like the first step
*  And then bouncing back
*  The next week is Sydney Sweeney
*  Who?
*  It went fucking guys saying gay
*  And retard to
*  massive awesome tits are back
*  Blah
*  I don't know who that is
*  You don't know Sydney Sweeney? She's Marilyn Monroe
*  You've seen her
*  I'm sure I've seen her
*  That's John McAfee's meth
*  That's why she's at the party
*  Ari you piece of shit
*  Well the 90's are coming back
*  Funny guys
*  He's going to bring her wherever the fuck she wants to go
*  What do we need?
*  Timeless there she is
*  Ample blism
*  Congratulations to her genetics
*  I love when you see a story like that
*  She addresses those Glen Powell rumors
*  And I'm like I don't even know what you're talking about
*  Well someone wrote a monologue for her Ari
*  You know she's got to talk about some things
*  That are in the news
*  It's probably not really her act
*  Ari's like her act sucks
*  She bombed
*  The tragic truth about Marilyn Manson
*  Marilyn Monroe
*  Concealed intelligence
*  During her fame
*  A lot of how Marilyn Monroe acted for the cameras
*  As behind the scenes
*  A lying lady
*  It is said that she was a star brilliant with a high IQ
*  There you go
*  But it doesn't say it's higher than Einstein
*  It's higher than Albert Einstein
*  It's unproven but it does say that it was as high as 168
*  And Einstein was close to 160
*  Was he 160?
*  No I know this is an urban
*  It says some believe
*  I believe that she was an alien
*  Some believe different
*  Illegal
*  It's a tweet
*  It has to be real
*  It's verified
*  Does it have community notes? If not shut the fuck up Jamie
*  That's a wash
*  You owe me five dollars
*  I'm more proven than you
*  I'm just certain that's not true
*  Isn't that what community notes is for?
*  How come there's no community notes
*  On that statement
*  Well can we amplify it?
*  Speaking of which Ari went to the migrant meeting
*  Oh yeah I went to the meeting with the
*  Migrants in my neighborhood
*  What'd you do? What'd you say?
*  Said kill them
*  What's the meeting like?
*  Is it like fucking in someone's basement?
*  No it's in a community center
*  It was pretty wild
*  Protect our community
*  On that whole line around the neighborhood
*  Of new migrants
*  They're gonna piss in the bushes so we gotta raise
*  They all sound like me
*  They're gonna raise money for porta potties or they're pissing in the bushes
*  Well your park went to hell so the community is fucked
*  Guess what porta potties are gross
*  They're gonna keep pissing in the bushes
*  No they'll piss in them if we tell them to piss in them
*  If we get them that but they're not gonna get it to them
*  Yeah but they're not gonna regular porta potties
*  They'd sit down in with a little sink in it
*  They'd rather go behind
*  These aren't homeless people
*  Porta potties are just a hole with the fucking blue water in it
*  It's disgusting
*  You ever look down that?
*  They set up porta potties of us all the drunks instead of pissing in the park
*  They'll piss on the nose they still do it
*  Most of them
*  But a few dudes pee on trees right?
*  That's why they set them up they're like hey don't be an animal
*  Fucking piss in these that we set up so we can have the trees tomorrow
*  When you're sober
*  No I don't think your piss kills trees
*  I don't think so
*  It does
*  If 200 people a night fucking piss in them
*  Listen to me dog piss kills your lawn
*  Yeah it does for sure
*  Yeah man dogs
*  If you have girl dogs just squat and pee
*  Boy dogs wanna like mark
*  So boy dogs piss on things
*  But girl dogs just squat
*  So they leave these little dark puddles in your lawn
*  Like it kills the grass
*  What?
*  Don't drink girl dog pee
*  What wouldn't the forest be ruined by like animal piss?
*  It's a good question
*  It's a good question
*  There's a lot of squirrels
*  There's a lot of
*  I think grass is pretty unnatural as it is
*  Maybe it's just the grass
*  But they're always putting the things around the trees
*  Like don't let dogs piss so it'll kill the tree
*  In the UK they have urine deflectors everywhere
*  Cause people pee all over the buildings
*  They set up porta potties
*  Look at the porta potties in the park
*  Urine deflectors
*  What's a deflector?
*  So it won't catch in a corner
*  Oh so you can't piss on it cause it'll splatter on you
*  So just step back
*  Or no it just won't gather in a corner
*  You ever drink piss?
*  So they just assume people are gonna pee on that
*  Or they're stopping people from peeing
*  They can't get underneath the piss up
*  So if they're gonna pee let it drip away
*  From the fucking crevices
*  Should have put that on the R. Kelly chicks
*  Remember when we were talking about
*  There was just pee and poop everywhere
*  Oh yeah
*  Running the streets
*  Pre plumbing
*  They said they're having a problem with some people that come from other places
*  To new cities where they just still
*  Decide to shit on the ground
*  Cause they don't know the difference
*  They've been doing it their whole life
*  I don't care I'm just gonna shit
*  I'm not gonna go to some little closet that smells awful
*  When I get into shit right here
*  I see human shit in New York all the time
*  You can tell
*  It's unsettling cause you're like damn it
*  I know
*  Whoa
*  It's kinda pretty
*  It looks like you're praying to the lord of piss
*  They just go in there
*  And piss on a wall
*  It's so well made
*  Isn't that incredible? Look at the artwork involved
*  What craftsmen we had back then
*  I would love those right now
*  You're out in New York
*  It's a place that's three quarters enclosed
*  To go in and piss on a wall
*  Look how beautiful that looks
*  It's a vintage public urinal in Paris
*  Amazing
*  Look how beautiful
*  These public urinals used to be
*  Pissoir
*  Look at the other ones though
*  Show Shane the other ones that you showed
*  The New York City one
*  Look at that one right there
*  That's insane
*  Show the whole thing so you can see the top
*  Look how beautiful that fucking thing is
*  It's like a subway entrance
*  Isn't that amazing? The craftsmanship they have
*  Standard
*  They had little ads on the side
*  What was that ad for?
*  Is that a price though?
*  To use it? Minutes?
*  I'm sure you can get blown in there as well
*  What does MTS say?
*  Ah 15
*  Bonjour, you must pay
*  Digestive depository
*  Interesting
*  Is that below it?
*  Do you have to pay to use it?
*  That would be nice
*  What does A15 mean?
*  It could be minutes
*  Close the door because the dogs really want to get in
*  So you get 15 minutes?
*  1875
*  All the New York subway bathrooms had to be
*  Locked up
*  They still have that though now
*  Those public bathrooms
*  Don't they have the National Guard subway now?
*  Yeah it's bad
*  The lady got stabbed
*  There was a shooting
*  Good times
*  What is New York City doing?
*  I don't know
*  It's getting wacky
*  That whole letting everybody in thing is just crazy
*  I think
*  That might have been 15 minutes
*  People started using them as places to talk
*  For private conversations
*  Without the Nazis finding out
*  Without the Nazis finding out
*  Come on in here while I take a shit
*  I'm going to tell you how we're planning the rebellion
*  Enclose automatically self cleaning unit
*  1980
*  1980 they were replaced systematically
*  1980
*  Had a good run
*  100 years, 105
*  It seems like the 80s are so recent
*  But if you had to go back and live back then
*  When I grew up
*  You were in a different world
*  You left the house, you were gone
*  No one knew where you were
*  There was two pictures of you
*  One when you were like 8
*  One when you were 10
*  No one has real evidence that you were ever alive
*  You just
*  People would vanish
*  I think about that a lot when I'm laying in bed
*  I think about my parents in the 80s and the 90s
*  You just go out to dinner
*  You go to a friend's house
*  You skateboard all day
*  You don't know where anybody is
*  It was nice
*  When I grew up people would open the window and yell
*  For their kids
*  They would yell
*  Bobby!
*  Get home!
*  This is wild
*  But now people would tweet and go
*  This mom is a little aggressive
*  She's a little controlling
*  Oh yeah, the homeowners association
*  When I was a kid I lived in San Francisco
*  And then we moved to Florida
*  And then we moved to Boston
*  We moved to a place called Jamaica Plain
*  Jamaica Plain was rough back then
*  We didn't have any money
*  And our next door neighbors were in a punk band
*  And the fucking entire basement
*  They converted
*  We moved to a session place
*  And so they had carpet
*  7-8 layers of carpet
*  That was their own sound deadening
*  And it was so loud
*  Didn't we look them up once?
*  It was Alice in Chains
*  Death in the shopping mall
*  Oh, okay
*  I remember they had a song
*  My baby is a mutant
*  Oh, you know the music?
*  I could never sleep to it
*  I heard them sing it 150 times
*  Wow, were they any good?
*  They're pretty good if you're into that kind of music
*  And I would go down
*  They'd let me watch them perform
*  Watch them rehearse
*  I was like 8
*  It was pretty cool
*  I guess I wasn't 8, no I was 13
*  That was Boston
*  And so these people were
*  They recorded this
*  There's a video I think that's available on YouTube
*  At least the song is available on YouTube
*  It was a different time
*  I had a ramp in my backyard
*  And every kid in the neighborhood would use it
*  There it is
*  What's that Jamie?
*  Not the song you asked for
*  Oh, they're working
*  Oh, it's another one, man on a tightrope
*  It's still going
*  It's probably all
*  You can't play it
*  We're going to get copyrighted by then
*  That's what you're allowed to
*  Did you ever go over and knock on the door and go
*  Hey, quiet down a little bit
*  It was just a weird time
*  If you consider
*  How people grow up today
*  If you grow up today, you're growing up in the weirdest time
*  I know, it's fucked
*  Ever
*  But it's like every civilization
*  Has had to deal with that
*  When they invented the printing press
*  When they invented cars, when they invented airplanes
*  Every generation
*  Has had to deal with some new weirdness
*  What is that?
*  I told you to get the fucking Eagle beer bomb
*  Oh
*  It might be early
*  Behind the microwave
*  I saw it
*  Then I got in here and I was like damn I should have gotten it
*  We can't play the America Fuck Yeah song
*  We can sing it
*  Why?
*  Because we'll get copyrighted
*  I'm sure there's a copy on the internet
*  Can't you reach out and sing
*  It doesn't have a
*  It's a group
*  We'll make a
*  We gotta get it
*  We'll say hell yeah
*  America
*  Fuck yeah
*  Come and save the motherfucking day
*  America
*  Fuck yeah
*  Freedom is the only way
*  Jamie, can we get in trouble for that?
*  I don't know
*  Jamie
*  I don't know, I'm not a lawyer
*  I'm not a lawyer
*  Come in your cousin
*  Doesn't Kid Rock own all his music?
*  I don't know, we should call him
*  If we asked him if we could use American Badass
*  That's just as ridiculous
*  Wait, so we're not allowed to have fun and use music anymore?
*  What did you guys sign?
*  What did you sign?
*  It's just being on YouTube again
*  Damn
*  Let's go back to 4chan
*  Why can't we play Spotify music?
*  That's what I'm saying
*  Because it's on YouTube
*  We're also on YouTube users, just bleep it out for them
*  No, he can't do that
*  You probably could
*  That's where it went to watch it
*  Who needs a radio when I can sing?
*  Mock
*  Eegg
*  Burr
*  Burr
*  I think that's a copyright
*  That's alright
*  We can come up with our own stuff
*  I guess that's what we're supposed to do
*  Urgh, gotta piss
*  Urgh, I got a callback
*  That's a big urgh
*  Did he dive?
*  Did he actually fall?
*  They took a pratfall
*  Larry David
*  What if he disconnected
*  Mark
*  What the fuck Mark
*  So what's going on with you guys now that Mark's gone?
*  I'm tired of all his quips
*  He needs to get more fucked up
*  He has no quips
*  He's always ready
*  I'm trying to build a quip for her
*  It just hasn't presented itself
*  Don't force the genius
*  He left the door open
*  That's Carl and Bandit
*  He left the doors open
*  Bye man
*  Mark
*  Bandit's trying to sneak into his bed
*  Dude, you get outside that door and there's fucking two dogs
*  Aww, Bandit came into her daddy
*  Dogs are in
*  He wanted to hold Carl so badly
*  Will Bandit fuck things up?
*  Hey Bandit
*  She's not relaxed
*  I've seen her chew cords
*  Shut up dude
*  He's trying to cause trouble
*  Never once ever
*  Has she been around cords?
*  She's been here
*  This is a good dog
*  She wants her daddy
*  She does
*  We got a little hot tongue action
*  Don't kiss the dog
*  When Ari was inside before
*  She was sitting outside the door
*  Just staring up at the door
*  Knowing that he was in that room
*  It is a cute dog but it is autistic
*  Why say that?
*  She's going for Bud Lights
*  It's not a dog
*  It's more of a cat
*  It's not like a fund, it's a quiet weird
*  It's a skinnish dog
*  She doesn't like fireworks
*  That's literally every dog
*  My dog doesn't like fireworks
*  It's weird dude
*  She's a serious dog
*  She's a solemn dog
*  If you're trying to insult her it won't work
*  I'm not insulting her
*  You guys know these types of dogs
*  You've seen these types of dogs
*  Sullen
*  Sullen
*  You left the fucking doors open
*  Oh the dogs get in?
*  Some how
*  God damn it Mark
*  Anybody want cigars?
*  Cigars
*  It's a whole new foundation delivery
*  Hell yeah
*  There both dogs in here or just one?
*  Both dogs
*  I know Ari's gay dogs here
*  I know right
*  Trying to have a good time with your gay dog
*  Why do you have a bandana on this dog?
*  Is it blood?
*  Because he's in the west bro
*  He's in Texas
*  Obviously he's got a pocket bandana on
*  It went green last week
*  Why did it have green on?
*  For the environment
*  Because of your people
*  Optima
*  Opti IRA
*  By the way, Opti IRA, Free Palestine
*  Try it
*  They love Palestine those micks
*  Everybody loves the underdog
*  And when you were the underdog forever
*  They've been through it
*  They're the end words of Europe
*  When I went to Northern Ireland
*  And I saw the fucking cars
*  The police cars that are to this day
*  Armored with big steel plates all around
*  Because of the IRA bombs
*  We need headphones
*  Otherwise we're going to talk over each other
*  It's going to be very annoying
*  You have to have headphones Ari
*  You particularly
*  Ari just has
*  Disjointed off hand conversations
*  The thing is
*  When you're listening it's so hard
*  I know we're having a good time
*  I'm telling you it was worse earlier
*  It was rough
*  I never take the headphones off
*  We'll find our groove
*  I took them off
*  I had them on in the beginning
*  It made me feel bad
*  Because we were talking over each other
*  It's because of you Ari
*  Literally no one had them on
*  We all did and then you ruined it
*  Is this supposed to look like you?
*  You're a destroyer of worlds
*  America
*  Fuck yeah
*  Fucking hebe
*  Alright
*  Going back in
*  Ari you're next for Siren Life
*  I went there a couple years ago
*  And Shay was like
*  Give him a tour, it was pretty cool
*  And he goes, if you go in the back way
*  I was like, can I go back there?
*  See what's there? He was like, yeah there's nothing there
*  And I'm like, can I walk through the doors?
*  He goes, yeah but it's a superstition that
*  If you walk through it before you're actually hosting
*  You'll never host
*  And he's like, oh yeah I'm going back there
*  What are we talking about?
*  Superstitions are hilarious
*  Especially when it comes to that
*  Like, oh no, you're going to take away my five grand?
*  I could not believe
*  They were like, alright you've got to sign these contracts
*  And I was like, alright
*  Then we'll pay you, and I was like, how much is it?
*  It's five grand, you get five grand
*  I didn't
*  But your agent gets ten percent
*  Your manager gets ten percent
*  You get $150
*  For a week of work
*  The most stress
*  It'd be fun if I didn't have
*  I could see it on you
*  I was fucking stressed out
*  You had both sides on your shoulder
*  You went through it, and you went through it bigger than ever
*  That's the beautiful thing about it
*  You go through it bigger than ever
*  And it worked out
*  It's great, and it shows that you're awesome at sketches
*  And it turns people to Gillian Keyes
*  Which is, I think, the best sketch show on the internet
*  Thanks, fucking awesome
*  Brother fucking OnlyFans Dad
*  This is one of the best fucking sketches I have ever seen
*  You got a gang of them at
*  The Trump speed dating
*  It's fucking genius shit
*  That's all, yeah
*  Genius shit
*  And that's the best part
*  It sends people towards the real shit
*  Independent comedy sketches
*  That are done by the people that are actually funny
*  There's no one fucking with them
*  There's no network notes
*  There's no executives
*  There's no watering up the fucking chili
*  It's just
*  Don't fuck with that, dude
*  I already had it last time
*  Don't fuck with the Carolina Reaper
*  Wicked Cuts, Beef Jerky
*  Mark, bong one of those
*  Bong one
*  I'm taking a mushroom
*  You had a fucking block earlier, you're fine
*  It's time for America
*  It's time to take America back, Mark
*  Mark, we gotta take America back
*  Come on, man, let's go for the troops
*  Hold on
*  We had one drink in four days
*  You had two fucking comics
*  You used to do that
*  After September 11th
*  When comics were eating dick
*  How about a round of applause for the troops, everybody
*  It was an easy way out
*  It was an easy way out
*  Any birthdays
*  Who's having a birthday?
*  First date, last date
*  A round of applause for the ladies
*  Can you imagine at bombing and someone's like
*  Who's having a birthday in the audience
*  No, you're not including me
*  I wouldn't cheer for that
*  That's you, Ari
*  Most unreasonable people are like me
*  It's my birthday
*  I'm a 45 year old white woman
*  It's her birthday
*  Especially if you don't have special days
*  That's the only special day
*  Well, that and the bachelorette
*  Most days suck, except for 90 day fiancé
*  When that's on, it's awesome
*  But other than that
*  My lady watches that
*  That is a wild show
*  That's the one lady show I can sit down and watch
*  Well, you learn a lot
*  You want to talk about the threats to marriage
*  The threats
*  This is like the argument against gay marriage
*  It's bad for the institution
*  What is it?
*  The institution of marriage
*  What about this?
*  A reality show
*  You gotta get married after 90 days
*  You gotta get married after 90 days
*  You gotta pick one of these hoes
*  There's other ones
*  The bachelor, love is blind
*  They don't even talk to each other and then they get engaged
*  Bro
*  It's banana
*  90 day though, it makes it worse than gay marriage
*  You don't know what they even look like until you meet them
*  You don't know anything
*  They're going to hell
*  According to which bible?
*  90 day makes America look great
*  They're willing to leave this country to go live in Pensacola
*  In a condo
*  It's great for China
*  It's great for China
*  China's like look at these idiots
*  Look what we're doing
*  Over in China every day
*  It's like fucking the ninja show
*  What's that ninja show?
*  American Ninja?
*  That's how the show rules
*  That's what I'm talking about
*  So they're all competing against each other
*  There's all fucking chest puffing
*  And they're getting rid of all femininity on television
*  I bet China's TV is just ours
*  10, 15 years ago
*  I bet China's TV is ours if we had fucking control
*  Well they don't let them watch our TikTok
*  You want state control?
*  State control
*  That's what I'm saying
*  America needs state control
*  Real men
*  Just guys
*  Just enough nonsense
*  Daddy's home
*  We need just Tom Hardy
*  Isn't it funny that everybody really kind of wants the big daddy in the sky
*  To take care of everything
*  That was the plot of Marvel
*  Every election
*  Thor's brother was like
*  You want to be led
*  Everybody's the big daddy in the sky
*  Who's got the clippy?
*  You got the four skin?
*  Thank you
*  Oh you're good
*  Carl doesn't like ice
*  He's got ice
*  He's got ice
*  Carl doesn't like ice?
*  Carl doesn't like noise
*  He doesn't like Jews
*  Carl's definitely free Palestine
*  You think so?
*  Carl's definitely up the raw
*  Carl looks grumpy
*  Carl looks like he reads a newspaper
*  He's looking at you
*  Carl does now have strong convictions
*  And he can be persuaded in either direction
*  His eyes are about to pop out of his head
*  Carl could convert
*  If the Jews win this one Carl could convert
*  He's going to go where the money is
*  If
*  Boy if you want to convert to the Jews they make it hard
*  You guys make it probably the hardest
*  I know the test is crazy
*  There's a lot at Delta Club
*  There's a lot going on
*  They don't make you take a tattoo at least
*  How did Sammy Davis pass?
*  That's such a wild flex for a woman to force you
*  To convert
*  To get tattooed
*  Well the four skin looks better when it's gone
*  That's a wild one
*  You gotta have a circumcision
*  You can make a chick convert
*  At 37 you gotta chop your forehead skin off
*  You gotta clip your dick
*  And risk infection and death
*  And the loss of your dick
*  At 37 that's how good that pussy is
*  Yeah well my friend got circumcised
*  At 33 and he's happy
*  By the way tip for everybody you can just lie to the in-laws
*  And tell them you did it
*  You don't actually have to do it
*  What you just said is the ultimate anecdotal experience
*  My friend got his dick mutilated
*  And he loves it
*  He kept getting infected
*  There's a lot of shmeg mud
*  Tell your friend to clean his dick
*  What kind of dirty motherfucker
*  Is constantly getting dick infections
*  He's Indian?
*  Yeah Indian fella
*  What are you blaming that on?
*  Well I'm just saying it's a lot of curry
*  But
*  Curry coming out of your dick what are you doing?
*  You're eating like an elephant?
*  Tossing it into your mouth
*  Tossing fucking curry chicken
*  Into your mouth with your dick
*  Slumdog
*  That's ridiculous
*  Just saying it gets in there
*  The bacteria
*  Who's on circumcised here anybody?
*  No way
*  JMo
*  He's got a rean eater
*  Carl's on circumcised
*  You haven't circumcised Carl yet?
*  He's French
*  I'll talk to a guy
*  I think we might have talked about it before
*  You guys ever see a dog's dick?
*  I see a dog's dick every day of the week
*  No no I'm talking about
*  My dog in the morning
*  Every time I see him
*  I'm talking about actual boning
*  The bone
*  It's weird looking at organs
*  At the old studio we had a walrus one
*  A petrified walrus one
*  How old was that fucking thing?
*  Where is it?
*  Where's that walrus?
*  I am the walrus
*  You ever see him get hooked up?
*  Baculum
*  Steve Rinella
*  You ever see him get hooked up?
*  Two dogs
*  He's back
*  He's too sober
*  Now he's going
*  What show is that guy on?
*  Bonham Leap
*  Time travel show
*  Was that the early 2000s?
*  Early 90s
*  Early 90s
*  Is there one where he hops into a Down Syndrome guy?
*  Yes
*  Ionic dude
*  He opens his bedroom door
*  The mirror shows a Down Syndrome guy
*  And he's like I'm retarded
*  Do it from the beginning
*  Do it from the beginning
*  He goes I'm retarded
*  I'm retarded?
*  That's the language they used on dramas on TV back then
*  Beatles
*  Ah
*  Oh my god
*  Finally
*  That's how I wake up
*  I was just going to say that
*  Oh shit
*  By the way every female comic is like
*  You know what it's like getting attacked by the way you look
*  I'm like have you seen Gillis's page?
*  It's just nothing but Tardville
*  Tardville all day long
*  I love hearing that when it's like you have no idea what it's like to get made fun of for how you look
*  I'm like it's all I do
*  I have some idea
*  It's the only thing I deal with
*  But it's different, this is why
*  If you're a talented guy and you look like shit
*  You can still get laid
*  Well hold on I don't look like shit
*  I'm not saying you, I'm not saying you
*  Just retarded shit
*  Let's say someone far worse off than anyone in this room
*  You can still get beautiful women
*  Because you're talented
*  That does not work the opposite
*  True but they can get
*  Puss or they can get dick
*  Without being talented and hot
*  And they cannot be hot and get dick
*  And they can be a 7 and get real high level dick
*  They cannot be attractive at all
*  And get dick whenever
*  We're talking about mathematics
*  Well we've all fucked a couple of toots
*  No put those back on
*  I mean mathematics in the sense that like each thing has a value to it
*  And the more
*  Like wealthy, famous
*  Like what's that guy's name
*  That super, super fucking old dude that owned Fox
*  Rupert Murdoch
*  This dude is worth
*  Billions of dollars and got divorced
*  Right or he was going to get married
*  Had this fiance
*  And she's like really into Christianity or something
*  But the crazy thing is he was talking about the rest of his life
*  He was like the second half of my life
*  Wow
*  Like he's 90
*  If you see him walking around like this guy's crazy
*  It's because this guy knows he can still sling dick
*  Stephen Hawking
*  That was his lady
*  Whoa
*  Oh he did it again
*  So he's got a new one, he's engaged again
*  He was a molecular biologist
*  He's 92, he just got engaged again
*  This is what I'm talking about
*  You got that kind of cheddar
*  You can sling dick
*  Deep, deep into the 90s
*  There's not a woman
*  He divorced Terry Hall
*  Easy McAfee
*  He's slinging
*  Slinging bitch
*  Maybe because women like competency
*  But this is the difference
*  Maybe they're attracted to competency
*  Which is fine
*  That's what people should be attracted to
*  That's what people should be attracted to
*  But this is why a woman can say
*  You don't know what it's like
*  Because you don't know what it's like
*  Because there's always this other thing
*  But I'd rather be the woman
*  I'd rather be the woman
*  She's better than me
*  If you're hot
*  Or not hot
*  But if you're not hot
*  Then you're judged unfavorably about something you have no control over
*  And that's your value to a lot of people
*  That's the difference
*  There's a difference
*  Of course the original statement though
*  Was female comics talk about
*  People always comment on my looks
*  And it's like
*  That's all they do with me
*  I think it has a different value for women
*  True, I can go
*  Shut the fuck up
*  I'm just sold out
*  I'm going to go off in the world
*  There's a thing that separates you from everybody
*  And that's talent
*  For a woman, unattractiveness is the trump-er
*  That's number one
*  A hot lady
*  Steals
*  Not in my adult life
*  Only as a kid
*  I was a good looking guy
*  I did well
*  I got lucky with jeans
*  But it's just if you're a woman and you don't get lucky
*  That's a bad sentence
*  Like if your whole world
*  Around you, especially today
*  That's one of the things that social media has fucked
*  Young girls up
*  You're looking at girls that are way hotter than you
*  Before they use filters
*  Before they use filters
*  And then they throw filters on
*  They look insanely good and you know there's not a fucking chance in hell
*  The jeans that you got dealt
*  The fucking hand of cards you got
*  Is going to compete with that
*  But then you get to marry a nice guy
*  Yeah
*  You get to get married to somebody
*  You're not in that world of like
*  Here's me in a bikini picture
*  You're like here's a nice guy, we're going to raise a family together
*  I don't know
*  There's some benefits to that
*  Maybe they're not in our world of fucking
*  But guess what? If Kim Kardashian wants to marry a nice guy
*  She can do
*  She can't
*  If she decides to just go grab some nice guy
*  Well he was the guy who was working on my house
*  Do you know what's going to happen if she marries a nice guy?
*  Day one TMZ is going to stick a camera in his face
*  He'll never be normal
*  He'll never go outside
*  He won't be nice again
*  He'll throw the rob
*  Who gives shit out of him
*  And they'll ruin him
*  I don't know
*  We're having fun now
*  Is it possible
*  To super mindfuck is when people get famous
*  Like Jordan Peterson style
*  When they get famous when they're older
*  He got hotter
*  He got higher and then went looney bins
*  What it is is he started eating only meat
*  Little bonks
*  What do you think is bonker?
*  What do you say that's bonkers?
*  He's a little bonky
*  Too famous?
*  Entering rehab
*  He unfortunately
*  Did not know the side effects
*  Of benzodiazepines
*  Sounds like an actor
*  The guy just took him
*  He'll tell you he took him because he was really struggling
*  But I think part of the reason why he's struggling is
*  His wife is going through cancer
*  I thought he was supposed to be a smart guy, read the label
*  That's crazy
*  Listen man
*  Read the label
*  If you did something
*  Play golf, you play golf
*  If I came to you
*  I don't play it
*  What is the first thing you do that I don't do?
*  Golf
*  If I came to you and go how do you do this?
*  I would just listen
*  Because you do it and I don't do it
*  If you're a doctor or psychologist
*  You call your friend who's a psychiatrist
*  You say I'm going through this
*  What should I do? Take this, don't worry
*  You're going to feel way better
*  He takes Xanax, he feels way better
*  But he doesn't realize that one of two things
*  That's commonly used that will kill you
*  One's alcohol, the other is benzos
*  He's an alcoholic if you're a full on
*  All day drinking
*  No, his doctor didn't tell him that
*  So he didn't realize that until he tried to get off of him
*  And it took like a fucking year
*  That guy got physically wrecked
*  Peterson rules, but
*  Anytime any of those intellectuals become famous
*  They kind of stink
*  And then when you get fully sucked into the culture war as an intellectual
*  Either side, I don't love it
*  Because then it's like you're wasting all your mental energy on the culture war
*  Not curing cancer
*  Social fame
*  But it's also to recognize that if you don't fight against this shit
*  It just keeps pushing and gaining more boundary
*  More ground
*  It moves the goalposts, it does
*  And you have to have really smart people
*  You just want a crying spree
*  You want a crying spree
*  Sorry about your voice bro
*  Because he really feels that way
*  I know it seems crazy when you look at it out of context
*  But if you look at him crying in the context of the conversation
*  It's because he really feels that way
*  I go on crying sprees but I keep them
*  Offline
*  The thing is, he's not
*  He's just being himself
*  And he's being himself in front of all these people
*  In a three piece suit
*  And he's being himself with all these people watching him
*  He's being himself in a three piece suit
*  He's getting dressed up to go be himself
*  And the weird three piece, sometimes they're like multi-colored
*  But he does that because he thinks it suits
*  He's cool
*  It's cool, it's just fame ruins a lot of people's work
*  They're doing great work
*  The Kimmel, same sort of thing
*  It's like, the guys are all becoming something else
*  But it's also because you're part of a system
*  Jordan's not necessarily part of a system
*  He's like removed from a system
*  But then the problem becomes are you constantly
*  Fighting that system
*  Or are you just speaking about things
*  The way you see them
*  Well the question is why is there a system fighting him
*  Why can't he just exist and talk about
*  What he wants to talk about
*  Why is someone always coming down on him
*  It's just influence
*  That's what I'm saying, but why can't he have an influence
*  And why do we have to attack him
*  It's because of the internet, it's because who likes him
*  It's just people arguing on the internet
*  They're like, Jordan Peterson rules, listen to this quote
*  And then people that don't like the things you like are like
*  He's actually a Nazi
*  And then the people that call him a Nazi
*  They're like, you're gay
*  But why do we have to be like this
*  I thought I had something there
*  But it is just the internet
*  Nazis never been subjective
*  I'm not going to kill him, which is weird
*  That's why you would infuriate me
*  That whole punch a Nazi thing
*  I was like, who decides, who's a Nazi
*  He's been called a Nazi, Jew face 101
*  That's a fun one
*  They were calling Dave Smith a self-hating Jew
*  Because he's criticizing the way Israel's bombing the fucking shit out of Gaza
*  Free Palestine
*  The whole thing is so nuts
*  You guys are going to the overboard dude, you got them
*  I'm on the side of Hamas
*  I like the way they're killing the Palestinians
*  You like how Hamas is killing Palestinians
*  Tunnels is one thing you guys can agree on
*  You're saying how Hamas is killing the Palestinians
*  Their own people
*  Yeah, when they line them up and execute all their fucking people running against them
*  Do they do that?
*  Yeah, it's cool
*  The Jews tried to have a ceasefire and they wouldn't go with it
*  The Jews threw out a ceasefire
*  Like, hey, let's do a ceasefire
*  And Palestine was like, nah
*  No deal
*  When was that?
*  October 6
*  The day before
*  Yeah, pull it up
*  I'm sure the terms dictate whether they say yes or no
*  You know what the wildest thing is?
*  That there was protests in the streets for months
*  Hundreds of thousands of people
*  Protesting Netanyahu
*  In Israel
*  He's one of the leaders, he can be against your leaders
*  Without being against the countries
*  But it was right before it happened
*  And then when it happened, they put a squash ball on him
*  Netanyahu was ready to go
*  Netanyahu was ready to
*  Throw down
*  No, he's ready to go, brother
*  Netanyahu, Hamas, get rid of all the old guard
*  Get somebody young in there
*  Get some 40 year olds in there to fucking say hi
*  The thing is, man, the people that have gone through this
*  You're not going to erase this
*  You're not going to erase the memory of what they did to Gaza
*  You're not going to erase the memory of what those people in Israel
*  Experienced when those dudes are fucking
*  Parachuting down
*  And gunning people down
*  And chasing down kids at a rave
*  You're not going to erase that
*  What's she thinking?
*  Hillary said it
*  Remember there was a ceasefire on October 6th
*  That Hamas broke by their barbaric assault on peaceful civilians
*  Scroll up so we can see that trustworthy picture
*  There she is
*  What did she say?
*  There was a ceasefire, it did not hold
*  Because Hamas chose to break it
*  Hamas have consistently broken ceasefires
*  If Dave Smith was here
*  Dave Smith would be able to lay this out
*  We need a real Jew
*  I know there's nothing about this
*  I found out about Dave because
*  Ari's state of the country
*  State of the Union
*  Smith's a smart guy
*  I can't keep up
*  He's a genius
*  He's one of the best at retaining information
*  Sometimes you're talking about, wait, wait
*  Who? Say that again?
*  He just can talk about
*  Basically any international crisis
*  That he's investigated
*  He investigates things to the point of
*  He'll be able to tell you the root of the conflict
*  Sure, his wife loves it
*  Oh my god
*  That's gotta be a tough household
*  There's no way he's only telling us that
*  He's telling her that too
*  She's probably petrified
*  Back to the female comedian thing
*  About you're looking retarded and that whole thing
*  Thank you
*  What bugs me is it's all men's fault
*  But they judge each other
*  That's true too
*  There's a lot of lady on lady
*  Judging of appearance
*  All this is gonna go out the window with CRISPR
*  With genetic engineering
*  They're gonna change people
*  And turn them into fuckers
*  We'll always talk about body positivity
*  But everybody's getting Botox, lap band
*  And they're all on a Zembic
*  Which one is it?
*  Well, they don't want to die
*  But they want to pretend they're okay
*  And they want to pretend that it's fine
*  To be exactly how you are
*  Because it's uncomfortable to deal with the fact that you gotta make some changes
*  And so let's not make people uncomfortable
*  Let's let China win
*  There you go
*  Let's let Russia win
*  Let's keep everybody weak and fat
*  And stupid and lazy
*  And addicted to their phones
*  And then let's shut the power off
*  Alright, you're just describing Shane
*  That wasn't a pun
*  You suck it out, bitch
*  That wasn't a pun
*  I got puns
*  The puns are in the works
*  You can work out here with us tomorrow
*  What's tomorrow?
*  The comedian workout
*  I gotta fly home tomorrow
*  I thought you were home
*  No, I gotta go to my parents house
*  We got a little fundraiser for the coffee shop
*  NOR in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania
*  It's called NOR
*  So this will come out tomorrow
*  I'll be there
*  Yeah, that's probably a mistake
*  But it's called NOR
*  Check it out
*  NOR
*  NOR
*  It's a good coffee shop
*  You gotta have a plug on SNL
*  Did you get a plug?
*  Yeah, I talked about it
*  You heard the joke before
*  Oh, that's right
*  You did get on the Mala
*  I'm gonna get a bunch more
*  You got away with a lot
*  You got away with a lot
*  Can you hand me one of those beers, Ari?
*  How's the new...
*  First of all, I got leaked that you were in a Tarantino thing
*  Which I think was bullshit
*  I'm not
*  I don't believe them
*  I feel like I'm talking to one of them UFO guys
*  That's bullshitting me
*  There's a few of those UFO guys that talk to them
*  I'm like, you're bullshitting me
*  You son of a bitch
*  You son of a bitch
*  You're in a fucking Tarantino movie
*  I don't believe him at all
*  He's not in a movie
*  I would tell you right away
*  I'd tell you guys everything
*  With blabbermouth
*  If you're in Tarantino's last movie
*  That would be very cool
*  Did you meet with him?
*  No
*  I've never met him in my life
*  He's the man
*  He's the fucking man
*  I sit down and talk to him
*  He's like a legit movie genius
*  He's awesome
*  He's the man
*  Would you tell me about Reservoir Dogs?
*  When they were like, you gotta put a woman in
*  And he's like, no
*  I just wanna do the movie
*  Didn't you tell me that?
*  No, it wasn't me
*  Different guy with your face
*  But I believe it, that's great
*  He's like, this is how we're doing the movie
*  I wanna get a woman in there
*  But it's about a bank robbery
*  Then they all shoot each other
*  They cut a guy's ear off
*  He was like, no, I'm not doing it
*  And it was a hit
*  Just let people do their thing
*  Not a hit though, underground
*  It led to pulp fiction
*  Creative hit
*  Not a financial hit
*  They were both speaking correctly
*  The guy that he was a partner with
*  In the early days
*  He is tied up right now
*  With legal issues
*  Of an undisclosed environment
*  There were no female characters in Reservoir Dogs
*  Because the movie took place over the course of an hour
*  In this warehouse after the robbery
*  These guys aren't going to bring their girlfriends to the robbery
*  Joe didn't happen to hire any women
*  We had a drunkard born there
*  We had to get a normal life
*  We gotta raise this baby
*  You ruined your suit, you got blood all over it
*  When the piano starts in the movie
*  Fast forward
*  Was that like movie an homage to a Chinese or a Japanese movie?
*  Probably
*  What's it, Jamie?
*  I'm fucking dying
*  Jamie, that's not the type of back talk we need
*  We need research, not back talk
*  Has there ever been a guy that's never had one miss?
*  You're gonna be okay
*  Never had a miss
*  You know what, one miss?
*  What was that one?
*  Hateful 8? Bullshit
*  What the fuck?
*  I didn't love it
*  I didn't love it
*  I was so excited
*  Yes, of course
*  I was so excited for it
*  Because Django and Inglourious Bachelors are top bangers
*  Top five for me
*  Inglourious Bachelors, me, pulp
*  Yeah
*  Pulp was the first
*  A little bit over the line of reality
*  Holding the fucking body up with a glass thing
*  Django was so nice, dude
*  But hateful 8
*  It was so slow and tense
*  When he's like, hey, put these handcuffs on me
*  He goes, no
*  And he puts it back and you're like, fuck this shit's gonna go back down
*  He beat the hell out of Jennifer Jason Lee
*  That was fun, I forgot about that
*  Look at it with the black eye
*  This movie has got some real Rihanna
*  It looks like Rosebud
*  This movie fucking ruled
*  It ruled
*  Who done it?
*  It's way too drawn out
*  It was his reaction, but that was his response
*  That was him going, shut up, I'll do my own thing
*  It's a western who done it
*  It's an awesome movie
*  But pulp fiction still holds up
*  Pulp fiction
*  Lost best movie to Forrest Gump
*  Gump rules
*  That's how dumb that fucking thing is
*  Gump is
*  Obviously
*  Obviously you love Forrest Gump
*  Get out of town
*  What is this type of thing?
*  It was a good movie
*  It was a good movie
*  Gump ruled
*  Oh, where's your pre-posting now?
*  Gump was great, but it was no fucking
*  Pulp fiction, shut up
*  Gump was, no, dude
*  Giant drop down
*  Guys, what are we talking about?
*  Gump in Vietnam? Hilarious, dude
*  Gump's a comedy
*  Gump is so good
*  Trim's dude
*  You gotta really step aside
*  His drill instructor
*  Gump, why did you put that weapon together
*  So quickly, Private Gump
*  Because you told me to
*  Jesus Christ, you must have an IQ of 160
*  You are gonna be a goddamn general someday
*  Gump, disassemble your weapon and continue
*  Taste like cigarettes
*  And JP
*  Gump, dude
*  It's obviously pulp fiction
*  Best soundtrack
*  Pissed out, let's go pulp fiction
*  I'll go soundtrack for soundtrack
*  Dude, Shawshank Redemption
*  Was legendary
*  It was, for sure
*  Pulp fiction had the best soundtrack
*  Man, the 90s were good
*  Hold on, pulp fiction over Gump soundtrack?
*  It reinvented the whole what is a soundtrack
*  Gump soundtrack was literally the quintessential American
*  It's classic rock
*  It's America
*  Running on empty
*  Also true, also true
*  But both pulp fiction was like
*  You're having bands you've never remembered
*  They're so cool
*  There's a difference
*  Fortunate son, let's go
*  This is just a collection of popular songs
*  This is mainstream
*  What are you talking about
*  This is the most essential American song
*  This is the definition of American songs
*  Gump is the story of America
*  You've never heard that song and you're like, what is this
*  Pulp fiction fucking rules
*  I would probably rather watch that
*  He's rediscovering old bands
*  Son of a preacher
*  I don't even remember this song
*  Mainstream vs. Indie
*  It's not just that
*  Forrest Gump was mainstream
*  Here are the biggest hits of each year
*  But still great songs
*  That's the problem with arguments of who's bigger
*  That's the problem with awards
*  It reached number 21
*  We need the right and the left
*  JMo, let's fire it up
*  Let's find top sales of all time
*  I guarantee Forrest Gump's soundtrack might be
*  The number 21
*  Forrest Gump was a great movie
*  It's not really in competition with Pulp Fiction
*  Nor should it be
*  They're two different kinds of things
*  They're two different kinds of things
*  But to sit here and say Pulp Fiction
*  Should have won is crazy
*  I think it's a better movie
*  Way better movie, more iconic, more lovely
*  More people love it
*  More people love it, cooler people love it
*  You're just saying dumb things
*  That would have catched up
*  It's no stats to back this claim
*  More manly
*  In the face of evidence that shows
*  That Forrest Gump is a superior product
*  According to the marketplace
*  Ari Shaffir rejects this
*  In favor of just
*  Philo Buster
*  It's defending his career
*  You have to be cool
*  Urge Overkill is cool
*  Discovering new bands is cool
*  That soundtrack was awesome
*  I've never heard anyone say
*  The Forrest Gump soundtrack was awesome
*  What?
*  Nobody
*  Forrest Gump soundtrack was awesome
*  I don't remember it at all
*  It's all wrong on MTV
*  We're going to go on the billboard
*  Time has come today
*  Oh my god, look at what we got here
*  Fortunate Son
*  Pound Dog by Elvis
*  They're better songs
*  It's just as a soundtrack
*  Buffalo Spring, The Doors
*  Garbo, get out of here
*  You fucking god damn
*  You Zionists
*  Ari, Zionists
*  Ari, you're being obnoxious and annoying
*  Put your headphones on
*  You're annoying
*  Put the headphones on, free Palestine
*  Put the headphones on
*  You colonized this fucking conversation bro
*  Yeah, go back to the tunnel
*  I hate you dude
*  When was I playing in the tunnel?
*  Tell me what you know about the tunnel
*  Tell me what you know about the tunnel
*  Put your headphones on so we don't talk over each other
*  You're the only one that's talking
*  Everybody pauses when other people start talking
*  because we have headphones on
*  What you talking about?
*  I got weird
*  I got weird
*  I got weird
*  I was open Ari as you fucked up your notice
*  He goes, we're all wearing headphones
*  That's all I'm going
*  No, literally nobody is
*  At least Norman's got
*  I call you married again
*  Just put them on
*  Norman's got them around his chin
*  He can at least keep up
*  Remember the Titans soundtrack
*  Another good classic
*  How about Vision Quest
*  Vision Quest
*  What's that?
*  A movie from the 90s
*  My 90s might be from the 80s
*  It was a movie
*  It might be late 80s
*  Now that I think about it
*  It's a movie about a wrestler
*  Matthew Modine
*  We're not allowed to play music?
*  Did you see Iron Claw?
*  You would like it
*  It's heavy duty
*  Come on JMo
*  What's Iron Claw?
*  It's about the
*  Van Hoos
*  That's the one
*  Homeboy
*  Zac Efron
*  It's really well done and sad as shit
*  Oh, bro
*  The pro wrestling world is mostly sad at the end
*  It's like the dark days
*  Of wrestling
*  Open mic
*  High school gym
*  By the way, all those open mic high school gym
*  Wrestling matches
*  That's part of your ticket that you get punched
*  For CTE
*  Look at that
*  Zac Efron
*  That's the real family with the dad
*  It's a tragic family
*  I heard the movie is awesome
*  I have not seen it
*  I was
*  Confusing with the man with the iron fist
*  No, very different
*  Which has got a fucking great soundtrack
*  That's a good soundtrack
*  Wutang
*  Oh my god
*  There's also a Wutang
*  Any soundtrack
*  With Spirit in the Sky
*  Wutang Black Keys collaboration
*  Really?
*  The baddest man alive
*  The Black Clan
*  One song
*  One of the members of Wutang
*  Not Inspector Dick
*  RZA
*  One of them cut their dick off
*  To what?
*  One of the Wutang
*  Cut their dick off
*  Give it a go
*  Where'd it go?
*  Method Woman
*  Come on
*  Inspector Dick
*  Isn't the GZA like a master level
*  Chess player?
*  Like a high level chess player?
*  Not the RZA, the GZA
*  I think the RZA is too
*  With the GZA specifically
*  Are we listening to music?
*  Damn, you two you cunt
*  It's a great
*  Yeah, that is annoying
*  Remember we played a whole Freebird on here
*  What was that we played?
*  Oh my god that was glorious
*  I talked too much
*  You didn't talk through it
*  I read the comments
*  What's that?
*  So you get the comments
*  You lose the music
*  Hit it
*  Put it down
*  America
*  Fuck yeah
*  We need some uncopy written versions
*  Of this song
*  But you can't even do a cover
*  It's a cover
*  Del Nicky with a cover
*  I don't fucking like
*  Del Nicky
*  Del Nicky
*  Steal from ya
*  My favorite one was Conor's
*  When he was talking about you
*  When Khabib
*  That's an illegal name
*  Shut up Joe
*  You fool ya
*  Call the police
*  Call the police that's an illegal name
*  Listen I have to do commentary
*  On the rules
*  No
*  If someone lands an illegal knee I have to let the audience know it's illegal
*  Conor was talking about
*  The
*  Fired up
*  Talking about the commentary
*  He gets fired up, he gets on twitter, he gets on voice twitter
*  He's the only guy on earth that uses it
*  I mean your wife DMs Joe
*  Shut up Joe
*  You fool ya
*  This is the spring buck
*  Remember the Reebok
*  This is the spring buck
*  That was an illegal knee
*  On the head of a grounded opponent
*  Shut up Joe
*  You little fool ya
*  Listen
*  This is my thing
*  I think not only should it be
*  Legal
*  I think all knees on the ground should be legal
*  100%
*  Knees to a grounded opponent to the head should be legal
*  This is the cage
*  It's the only problem because you can't move your head out of the way
*  If someone's got your head pinned against the cage
*  And they knee you in the face that's disastrous
*  But every other place
*  I feel like you should be able to knee somebody in the head
*  On top, on the bottom, it would stop stalling
*  It would stop people like hanging out in the turtle position
*  You wouldn't be able to, there's a lot of reasons to stop
*  You should have knees on the ground
*  So I think what he did 100% should be legal
*  If you're on your back and a guy's on top
*  You can knee him in the head
*  That should be legal
*  You should have the advantage of being on top
*  But you should also be able to knee him in the head if you're on top
*  That's like realistic
*  That's what fighting really is
*  That was during the Khabib fight?
*  There's no chance he was on top throwing knees during the Khabib fight
*  No he was on the bottom
*  Even on the bottom it's illegal
*  Because he's also got a knee on the mat
*  Exactly
*  So if a guy's grounded and he's on top of you
*  Inside control
*  So if a guy's on top of you, his head is here
*  If you lift your knee up, you can just slam his knee
*  It's illegal
*  You can't throw a knee or a kick to a grounded opponent in the face
*  I see
*  Fire him up dude
*  Tell that to Don Fry
*  Well in the early days everything was legal
*  In Pride they used to stomp
*  In Pride they used to do
*  They used to do soccer kicks and stomp
*  Pride week?
*  Back before Pride was about
*  They love knees
*  They're always on the knees
*  Mark
*  Here's a good question for you Ari
*  Because you're the gayest person here
*  I agree, what do you got?
*  You look like you own a gun range
*  Women are swooning over me
*  When did Pride become automatically associated with gay?
*  That's a big shift
*  That is, over UFC
*  If you just say Pride
*  First it was MMA
*  It used to be America
*  It was the first Pride thing
*  If you say you had Pride though
*  You would say you had Pride in America
*  Remember that Norm joke about that?
*  Yes, I love that joke
*  Can I get a little music from you Mr. Shaffir?
*  America
*  America
*  America
*  That's the IDF talking
*  America, fuck it
*  Come again to save the motherfuckin'
*  Damn, you took it down there Fanny
*  I pay taxes
*  I pay taxes, I live in this country
*  Texas rules
*  Let me
*  Have my goddamn beer
*  Stonewall
*  Stay away from that, I got a joke on this
*  In 1970
*  Stay away from Stonewall
*  The Lesbos
*  Gates didn't even have the fucking manhood to defend themselves
*  The Lesbos took it
*  Stay away from Stonewall, that's my one good joke I got right now
*  Please
*  So 1970
*  It was 1970
*  Yeah, but that's when they started calling it gay Pride
*  1970
*  When did it catch on?
*  When did it catch on?
*  It was the lines
*  Oh yeah
*  You ever see the Black Power speech?
*  No
*  Oh, Martin Luther King took a day off one of the rally campaigns
*  And this guy was like waiting for the opportunity
*  He goes fuck white power
*  How about us? How about black power?
*  And they all started chanting it
*  He's such a good speaker
*  I got back, it was too late, it caught on
*  Who's this guy?
*  You made this story up?
*  It's possible, I don't think I did
*  I don't think I did
*  This is how Flat Earth got started
*  They speak confidently
*  They say a bunch of nonsense
*  It's 50-50, both that I made it up and it's 100% truth
*  I can't tell ya
*  I wish we had the fucking internet
*  I wish we had Fred Hampton give a speech
*  Dude
*  I would get the people going
*  I would be revolutionary
*  I would die for the people
*  Come on
*  Did you ever see this deleted scene from Forrest Gump?
*  No, this is wild
*  It's Forrest Gump hanging out with Martin Luther King
*  They had to get rid of this scene
*  Smart move
*  Why did they have to get rid of this?
*  Well, they raised a kid
*  He's played
*  They just had to cut the cross
*  He comes over, all the dogs are trying to attack him
*  And he gets a stick and he throws it
*  He's like, sorry about that
*  It's too ridiculous
*  That's so ridiculous
*  Whoa
*  They would have torn him to shreds
*  He would have had zero chance
*  staying alive
*  He would have had no skin left
*  That's actually offensive
*  I think even back then
*  they were like, we gotta cut that
*  That's so ridiculous
*  All they had to do was toss the stick back
*  and civil rights would have been accomplished
*  I'm willing to buy that he's awesome at ping pong
*  Yeah, exactly
*  I will go that far
*  It was ridiculous in the right way
*  I will go that far with ping pong
*  You can't tell me
*  No one from the African American community
*  could have figured that out
*  No dude was good at dogs
*  Hold on a second, he has a rapist uncle?
*  What is this?
*  Yank
*  Oh
*  That's funny
*  That's a Michael Jackson scene
*  You can't do that anymore
*  There's so much implied
*  This is like day one
*  You can't pants a kid?
*  Not anymore, not these days anymore
*  That's crazy
*  I've been pantsing kids my whole childhood
*  That balding old man
*  That balding old man
*  who has zero chance of pussy
*  Come on
*  I can't do it, Mark can do it
*  If you're bald, you can't pants kids
*  No, it's the way he looks
*  Listen to me
*  This is very important
*  The odds of a woman choosing that guy
*  over anybody are very small
*  So that guy is probably horny
*  And obviously not competent
*  He's wearing a fucking vest
*  What if he's a beast?
*  I doubt he is
*  This is a crazy person
*  A crazy person
*  as hard as a rock while he's tormenting a child
*  That's it
*  This is a fucking creep
*  with two terabytes
*  of kiddie porn
*  on his fucking hard drive
*  That dude runs a discord server
*  That was originally people looking at
*  AI child porn
*  That was supposed to be Kevin Spacey, he didn't get the role
*  Not in real life, the real guy is
*  an actor, it's a movie, it's a different time
*  I'm just joking
*  But if that was a real human
*  that was alone with a little kid
*  and that's your move
*  Not like, tell the soul, hey Bobby
*  you wanna know what I do for a living?
*  Who is that guy? That's not his dad
*  That's some fucking creepy dude he got stuck with
*  You get stuck with
*  this fucking 50 year old incel
*  who wants to pants you
*  and then go jerk off to his discord server
*  This is a fucking psycho
*  That guy's a psycho
*  That guy's a straight up psycho
*  He's tormenting a young child
*  who is so vulnerable
*  He can't do anything
*  I would pants my nephew
*  If that guy pants me I'd get a knife
*  You'd get a knife?
*  And the next time he pants me I'm gonna take a necronutrient
*  That fucking guy would do a fish and that guy
*  would come out deep throat
*  He tried
*  That's what his goal was
*  Me deep throating him
*  I had a little tiny knife back then
*  It would have probably taken it away from me
*  I had a little fucking swiss army knife
*  When I was a little bitch ass knife
*  You would have caught him? 100%
*  I was vulnerable man this guy was a weird dude
*  Just get a pre-cocked
*  Get a pre-cocked and get ready to go
*  These headphones are doing nothing
*  You ever get sexually assaulted by a man
*  You were in a very serious religious group
*  January
*  That was the L-Trend
*  What happened to you in the tunnel?
*  Oh yeah
*  It's storage space
*  It's just storage space
*  Why does it have to be sex trafficking?
*  What about this shit smeared
*  bloody mattress?
*  That's a Snopes
*  That's a Snopes
*  That's a snopes
*  You all look at the Black Power speech
*  But you look at the fucking Jew tunnels
*  This guy's not a journalist
*  There's one fake one
*  That you guys made
*  About the tunnels? Yeah you'd be like that's AI
*  I don't know why the acidic Jewish community literally won't just make a statement
*  Just be like hey here's where it is
*  Well the Jewish communities aren't responsible
*  For like one psycho who made a tunnel
*  That's synagogues
*  That wasn't one guy brother
*  At least that's synagogues
*  Dude there's so many tunnels you guys don't even know about
*  Definitely
*  They go all the way to Cleveland
*  Wow there's a lot of tunnels
*  Hey now that we're talking about the Jews
*  How much do you guys control the weather for real?
*  It's not like that dude
*  You can guide it
*  How do you help the forest fires?
*  You can't go from like 85
*  To like 60
*  If it's 78 you can go to 82
*  All right
*  No one's listening but me and you
*  Why was the smoke
*  Orange?
*  In just in New York and not in Toronto
*  What did your people do?
*  Was it you guys or was it the CIA?
*  Who burnt the fucking chemicals
*  And made the fucking sky orange?
*  With a lot of menorah candles
*  I'm sure there's a lot of Jews made the sky orange
*  These are the type of conspiracies
*  Air quality similar to Bay Area's
*  2020 orange sky
*  Similar, super similar
*  And Asians
*  It's super similar to when the Bay Area had
*  Fires right next door
*  Where you could see the fucking flames and it turned the sky
*  Orange
*  Super similar to a place where the
*  Fire is
*  Thousands of miles away
*  Super fucking similar
*  To the flames
*  That caused the gray
*  To look red
*  The fucking flames
*  Super similar
*  Who's see that boy again?
*  Oh it says air quality, I'm sorry
*  I misread it, it said air quality
*  The air quality is real similar, I thought they were talking about the sky color
*  I'm sorry
*  I got carried away
*  I blame Protect Our Parks
*  And Bud Light
*  These types of theories distract from
*  I sit around and talk about controlling the weather
*  Distracts from
*  Actual what you guys are
*  You know
*  What are you really up to in the temple?
*  What have you guys done?
*  What have you guys done to trans kids?
*  Weinstein, Epstein,
*  Vadoff
*  Quite a list
*  False
*  Okay, what were we fucking
*  Googling?
*  Oh, the description
*  In this post paints a false picture
*  Of the tunnel discovery which was
*  Reported to police by synagogue
*  Officials. Wait, wait a minute
*  The synagogue officials?
*  You want to disbelieve it
*  You don't want to believe a
*  Realistic explanation

*  It must not be true, let's examine the author
*  Who wrote it?
*  Please
*  For the audience
*  USA Today is the
*  Article
*  Go back to the fucking thing I was reading
*  Hannah wrote this
*  It says
*  The description in this post
*  The description in this post paints a
*  False picture of the tunnel discovery
*  Which was reported to police
*  By synagogue officials. Did they report
*  The tunnel? Is that what they're saying? Because that's not real
*  I don't know who reported it
*  There's no actual report
*  They saw Jews coming out of the ground
*  And they were like hey
*  I've been good about it
*  Is this a fucking movie?
*  City officials
*  Said there was one tunnel
*  Not a series of tunnels
*  Incorrect, incorrect
*  All the way to Cleveland
*  All the way to Cleveland
*  More misinformation
*  The protect our parks actual Jew
*  All the way to Cleveland
*  It was adjacent to the synagogue
*  Not under it
*  It wasn't under it you fucking liars
*  Mattresses shown in the
*  Viral video came from behind
*  Wood paneling inside
*  The synagogue, not from the tunnel
*  It's amazing how everybody wants to go to underage
*  Sex trafficking
*  It's from behind the synagogue
*  Kanye was right
*  It's not related to the tunnel guys
*  It was underage sex trafficking
*  Everybody goes straight to that
*  Every time, it's so funny
*  This was a tunnel for you fucking dumbass
*  Oh yeah, couldn't be storage space in Manhattan
*  But hold on guys
*  Definitely not storage space for beds
*  Guys, guys
*  Look how crazy this set
*  What this is saying
*  The mattress is real
*  This blood stained mattress
*  Is still real, who gives a fuck
*  If it was 12 feet to the left
*  So it's in the synagogue
*  But it's not in a tunnel
*  That's under the synagogue
*  Who gives a fuck
*  This is crazy
*  It was in the garbage
*  It's right there
*  It's not right there
*  They threw out a fucking mattress
*  What's the blood from though? Why the blood?

*  Last part says an unverified video
*  Chicks
*  Ari, Ari, Ari
*  Look at the end of it
*  It says an unverified video shows what appears to be a high chair
*  But it shows only one such seat
*  Little kids
*  And it was located amid trash, clutter and dirt
*  In a basement room
*  Not in a tunnel
*  So it's there
*  Not 12 feet to the right
*  The whole thing is so crazy
*  No that wasn't in the tunnel
*  That was in the other shit that we discovered
*  We don't throw things out
*  Someone else might need a high chair in two weeks
*  I thought you'd just sell it
*  I'm not gonna sell it
*  Just clean it up
*  Sell it for later
*  Why chuck it? We might need it
*  When it's catholics I'm like
*  Oh, confrontation began
*  Over a tent to fill it into tunnel
*  Why would you fill it in
*  Once it's already built
*  Just regulate it
*  But isn't it crazy though
*  You're allowed to have a basement
*  You can't have a tunnel
*  You have a secret room
*  You gotta do it up to code
*  I heard everybody complain
*  You have a tunnel in there?
*  I have a tunnel in my club
*  When you go into the audience
*  We need a real tunnel
*  We're under the ground
*  Listen Shane Gillis
*  When you think about the architecture of my club
*  It's a secret tunnel
*  When you go inside and you go downstairs
*  You're under everything
*  You're under the street
*  You're in a tunnel
*  You feel at home there
*  I do like tunnels
*  Wait, the thing with the guy saying
*  I heard Jews was not real?
*  I'm gonna put a stained mattress
*  In the tunnel so you can see it
*  When you get up to the stage
*  Right next to the stage
*  No worries Ari
*  It's just a stained mattress
*  They were throwing it out
*  They were throwing it out
*  It was amidst the rubbish
*  It was stuffed into a dark corner of their building
*  Yeah, throwing it out
*  Eventually when I get done fucking people on this mattress
*  They find an old t-shirt
*  They're like we should find somebody who can use it
*  Somebody wants a shit stained mattress
*  That's a gay squirter
*  That's an enema
*  That's an enema release
*  What's with the wigs by the way
*  With the ladies
*  That's how to do it
*  Wear a wig and a costume
*  Today you're gonna be a gypsy
*  They threw out a high chair
*  And everyone's like under excess chocolate
*  Tomorrow you're a leprechaun
*  Everyday you're a different thing
*  I'm so bored
*  I want you to bake pies and dress up
*  Tonight you're a squirrel
*  You're a Jew
*  How do you feel about the Jew hate right now
*  I don't see any of it
*  If you go to Palestine you will 100% fucking see it
*  If I went to a very specific region of the world
*  Online it's more emboldened
*  Online it's more emboldened
*  But I'm in New York and all over the country
*  And really the world and I've never seen any
*  I've not been all over the world since October 7th
*  I've been all over the country
*  I've never seen a single thing in my real life
*  So I think it's you gotta shut your computers off
*  And live your fucking life
*  But isn't it what we talked about
*  About reading comments
*  It's that, they're shoving the worst shit in front of you all the time
*  So you think that's the world
*  It's not the world
*  I'm the juist looking guy in the world
*  If there was any fucking anti-semitism
*  If it was any realistic, it would come to me
*  I want to send you as a correspondent
*  For the JRE to go to the free Palestine protest
*  I'll go to that
*  You should go to that
*  I'll try to blend in
*  That nose is so punchable
*  It's such a target even for hooks
*  Would you say that everyone could do so much damage
*  That's the whole thing
*  You're talking about Jew, you're a Jew
*  Jew face, super Jewish guy
*  Never had a problem
*  Would you say that goes to everything
*  Black people are not that preyed upon
*  Almost everybody
*  Me and his friend, Nate Marshall had the same thing
*  You just imagine all these terrible things happening
*  When day to day life, 99.9% is
*  Fun, everyone just enjoying the weather
*  At the same time
*  If you're Ari Shafir
*  Nate said the same thing to me
*  It's just like, I'm in fear of all this stuff happening
*  Depends who you talk to
*  If you're online more, everything's terrible
*  The south side of Chicago where violent crime
*  And murder is higher than it is in Afghanistan
*  At the peak of the invasion
*  Then that's not real
*  I guess so, but I'm not there
*  So you're saying, imagine this terrible place
*  No, you don't have to imagine it
*  But I'm just saying, if you make a blanket statement
*  That everybody's life is less
*  Terrible than what you're seeing
*  In the media
*  Almost everybody, statistically insignificant
*  If you just shut off your computer
*  You wouldn't see any anti-black hatred
*  Anti-antijewish, none of it
*  Just go out and go for a hike
*  Everybody's pretty cool with each other
*  If you're talking about hatred, yes, that's true
*  You can go find small things on college campuses on a day
*  And wouldn't we all agree
*  That most hatred is rooted in you just don't know that person
*  And you've got to understand them
*  You'd be pretty cool
*  And all
*  SNL was pretty chill
*  And you're like, guess what, I hate them
*  And you're like, nah, they're pretty chill
*  Bud Light coming out of an eagle's asshole
*  And I'd say that
*  Bud Light coming out of an eagle's asshole
*  Regular Bud Light
*  Bud Light coming out of an asshole
*  Of an eagle? Of an eagle
*  Of an American eagle, this is what you're doing
*  You're felching a fucking American eagle
*  Damn, we're not even allowed to show that cool
*  America's number one video that we always share in the group chat
*  Fuck yeah
*  Can we just play that and see what happens
*  Do it! You gotta do it like this
*  And
*  I think the fact that we can say shit online
*  But you don't get any repercussions
*  Has added a lot
*  Yeah, exactly, you say like
*  You say horrible crazy things
*  It's all fine, it's all fine, life's great
*  You mean this place? This place here
*  I'm saying in general
*  Like you say shit online, you say mean shit
*  And you'll never have a repercussion
*  I think that adds to a lot of it
*  It's all virtual
*  It's all nonsense
*  No one's saying it, they're posting these things
*  They're posting mean things
*  They would never say that in an elevator
*  But they would say it online
*  It's all augmented tribalism
*  We're so tribal
*  It's all tribalism
*  It's all stupid
*  And it's also if you have fucking social media
*  You have this ability to fucking isolate groups of people
*  Or attack groups of people
*  It's so fucking dumb
*  In the real world, most people get along
*  If there's communication
*  And it's a lot of optics
*  If you're cool in this communication, everybody's cool
*  It just got warm in New York on a day
*  High 6, there's no left and right
*  There's no high class, low class
*  What a good day
*  How many dicks did you suck that day?
*  6, 7, or 8
*  But they were from both sides
*  From both sides of the galley
*  I feel like that was what was next
*  It doesn't matter
*  The Upper East Side is right
*  Upper West is right
*  What do you mean right?
*  They're dudes
*  Economically, they're right
*  They're quiet, they're salty
*  We got everything there
*  Let's just hit it, dude, who cares about the strikes
*  God, America's the best
*  You sent me that once a month
*  Behind the mask and then in
*  Listen, this is the best place to be
*  Despite all the chaos
*  The chaos exists in the world
*  We're just talking about Scotland's trying to arrest comedians
*  I know, it's so easy here
*  It's great
*  We didn't talk about that fucking guy in Belgium
*  Jamie, show the memes
*  So these guys can see the shit that this guy was sharing
*  Gerard Depardieu
*  The memes are fucking so innocuous
*  They're so nothing, they don't even come close to the memes we share
*  Oh my god
*  Arrested? How do they go to that?
*  Because America rules at memes too, bitch
*  America's number one
*  You can keep shitting on America when everybody's trying to move here
*  So what does that tell you?
*  That's what I'm saying
*  Well, everybody keeps coming here
*  Exactly, you sound like my uncle 15 years ago
*  I'm just saying
*  You're talking about my grandparents
*  Yeah, mine too
*  Sicilian
*  Who's talking shit on America like that?
*  All kinds of locals
*  No, no, just online, shut it off
*  Everybody knows we're number one
*  Well how about the, I'm gonna leave if this guy wins
*  But you're not gonna leave
*  Yeah, but they don't ever leave
*  Maybe this time they'll go to Canada where it's a thousand times worse
*  Maybe this time
*  How would you like to live in Minnesota if it was fucking gayer?
*  Welcome to the show
*  Welcome to the show
*  Welcome to Minnesota if it was fucking gayer
*  Welcome to fucking Canada
*  Right
*  Gayer and colder
*  Imagine Minnesota but not cool at all
*  Just gay
*  Yeah, no Somalians
*  Unless Trudeau's on Halloween
*  Bro, they might get rid of that dude, if they do they can pull it around
*  Who? Trudeau
*  That Pierre Polovet, how do you say it?
*  He's pretty sexy that guy
*  Did I say it right? No, I didn't
*  He's very French
*  He's brilliant, he's smart
*  We've been trashing Canada because of how gay Trudeau is
*  But Canada does fucking rock
*  Canada rules in the summer
*  Canada is one of the old times
*  You pissing in there?
*  You son of a bitch
*  He's pissing in Bud Light Canada's dirty bitch
*  You should make this part of your new campaign
*  Where I piss in bottles
*  Why don't you try to ruin my campaign you little nasty motherfucker
*  Alright use this whiskey bottle
*  Piss in that whiskey
*  Don't dig a cat, get a bottle
*  Don't piss in the bottle that's half full
*  Some of my drink you monster
*  Don't make it taste better
*  Get a bottle
*  Online
*  Pissing it
*  That's the whole care of the Monks
*  Toronto's a fun town and Vancouver's fun
*  Good crowds
*  Good chicks, good drugs
*  If you bring up Trudeau though
*  They go ape shit
*  Who brings up the government? Can you imagine being in Canada?
*  Everywhere I go, if I go to Canada I'm like
*  Fuck Trudeau
*  I don't go to Canada
*  I do, pisses the line
*  I say fuck Trudeau they get fired up
*  The truckers hate them
*  Regular people hate them
*  Historically Canada is a good country, they go hard dude
*  They're nice people
*  That's why they're so subject to this bullshit
*  Because they're trying to be nice
*  That's why they're so vulnerable
*  Because they're trying to be nice, because they're genuinely nice people
*  Sorry
*  It's cold as fuck up there, people cooperate
*  They're nice
*  I'm going to get fired up
*  Get fired up
*  Easy big fella
*  No they're not that fired up
*  I might be dumb and wrong
*  But those are one of those countries that like the UK
*  Like when they go to war, which they always do
*  They always call on the bros
*  It's always Scotland
*  Canada, Australia
*  All the dominions that are just like
*  Settler white people
*  We've been making money for you all these years
*  When they call on like Australia and Canada
*  To go to war, they go to war dude
*  And they go hard
*  They've always gone hard
*  Canada rules, historically Canada rules
*  Historically
*  Right now they're being gay
*  Canada has a fantastic
*  History of combat sports
*  Solid chick hockey players
*  And comedians
*  Rory, Norm MacDonald
*  The other guy, Jim Carrey
*  Those donuts
*  But for fighters
*  Tim Horton's rules
*  Listen, there was a guy in the
*  1980s
*  There was a guy in the 1980s
*  There was a French Canadian named
*  Jean Nives Terrio
*  And he was a fucking assassin
*  In kickboxing
*  He was the man
*  What about Saint Pierre or whatever
*  Yeah but I'm talking about the 1980s
*  There was a guy named Jean
*  It's not related at all Martin
*  It's close to related
*  Shut up
*  This is like kickboxing in the 1980s
*  I read this guy's book
*  I started running stairs because of this
*  You read a kickboxer's book?
*  Oh yeah
*  You dumb as fuck
*  I've read about 30
*  Kickboxers books
*  Every kickboxer book that anybody ever wrote
*  I read
*  I did sit ups and then I kicked that guy
*  In the fucking head
*  That would be a dumb fat dude's interpretation
*  Of what a world class combat sport athlete would tell you what to do
*  That's a nasty thing to say dude
*  That's true
*  What a disgusting thing you just said
*  When was the last time you read Steinbeck?
*  You're reading fucking GSB's book
*  You're reading fucking retarded camouflage books
*  I haven't read these books since I was like 21
*  From the time I was 15
*  No I did it because I was trying
*  The same reason I got this stupid tattoo on my right arm
*  Of Miyamoto Musashi
*  I read books on how to fight
*  If this didn't work out you would have been the dumbest motherfucker
*  I know
*  But it worked out
*  This is Miyamoto show
*  I got lucky
*  Telling girls at bars this is muu muu shu
*  It's all connected
*  If you can read about a dude who's figured out how to fuck people up
*  With his feet
*  He just kicked people in the face for a living
*  I'm like tell me how you did this
*  That's what kickboxing books are about
*  So this guy was Jean Yves Theriot
*  Oh my god he was a fucking assassin
*  He's from Montreal
*  And he's a French Canadian
*  He fucked everybody up
*  He just turns and walks
*  I'm telling you man he was a fucking assassin
*  Dude you don't understand
*  This guy was my hero when I was a kid
*  Where'd he go?
*  When I was kickboxing this was the guy I was trying to be
*  I was trying to be this dude
*  You gotta understand
*  Oh they kill him one?
*  You gotta understand there was no money back then
*  He jumped off those people so fast
*  He was a fucking assassin
*  He was a very nice guy
*  He had a fucking gay cop mustache
*  It was awesome
*  And one of the things that he said was that he increased his kicking power substantially by running stairs
*  So I started running fucking stairs
*  I read this dude's book when I was like 15, 16 years old
*  He was a monster
*  He was fucking everybody up
*  You gotta understand this guy's record was just littered with chaos
*  Everybody he fucked
*  But kickboxing back then
*  Here's the deal about kickboxing
*  They were just like we're seen
*  Kickboxing back then
*  It was all above the waist
*  Come on man don't do that
*  Nobody had figured out tie boxing yet
*  Because the ties had not come to America yet
*  Jack talked tie
*  Jack talked tie very well
*  I don't know what that means
*  Remember the fuckers
*  Remember the fuckers
*  That's Rick Rufus
*  Rick Rufus is the American hero
*  Oh dude he was a monster
*  Rick Rufus was so good
*  But that's Don the Dragon Wilson
*  That's Don the Dragon Wilson
*  I actually
*  It's nothing I'm making this up
*  That guy's a legend
*  Don the Dragon Wilson
*  That guy's got both tucks
*  I want you to Google Don the Dragon Wilson versus
*  69
*  God damn it
*  Dennis Alexio, Don the Dragon Wilson versus Dennis Alexio
*  This is like a peak in your childhood here
*  Don the Dragon Wilson
*  You could have gotten into wrestling
*  You got into this
*  I could have gotten into serious brain damage
*  Alright this is Don
*  This is Don the Dragon Wilson
*  This is Don the Dragon Wilson
*  Versus
*  Dennis Alexio
*  So Don the Dragon Wilson is like
*  A legend in kickboxing
*  When there was no money in kickboxing
*  54 and 1
*  Look at that hair line
*  He was a monster
*  So he fought this guy Dennis Alexio
*  And Dennis Alexio who was a fucking assassin
*  But he didn't understand leg kicks as well as Don did
*  So get a little further on this
*  Don just kicked his fucking legs out from under him
*  Dennis Alexio was a tank
*  He was actually in one of those
*  John-Con Van Damme movies
*  He was in Kickboxer
*  He was like his brother that got killed by Tong Po
*  That's right
*  He kicked the column
*  Number 3
*  So this was like a really important fight
*  Because it was one of the first fights
*  Between kickboxers
*  He started leg kicking them
*  And by the way Don the Dragon Wilson as good as he was
*  Was not a tie
*  He was not a real expert
*  Or a Dutch guy like Ernesto Hust
*  Or any of the greats
*  There were so many great guys that came out of Holland
*  He was a guy that was like an American guy
*  Who learned how to do leg kicks
*  And started fucking people up with them
*  When they allowed them
*  Were the Dutch nasty at it
*  Because they colonized Southeast Asia
*  They were so nasty
*  First of all they were big
*  Did they colonize Southeast Asia
*  I don't know man
*  Listen man
*  There's Rob Kamen
*  Who's one of the greatest of all times
*  Ernesto Hust, Peter Ertz
*  So many guys
*  Do you think the possible Dutch brought it to Southeast Asia?
*  No, they learned it
*  They were down there
*  They learned it
*  When World War II popped off
*  It was Japan attacking Dutch colonies
*  To get the rubber in Southeast Asia
*  So they were down there
*  Is that what it was?
*  They had the best colonies down there
*  They had Sri Lanka forever
*  They ran the shit
*  That's why they're good at kickboxing
*  Because they colonized Southeast Asia
*  The Dutch are the best colonizers
*  Because once they had everything
*  They were like, you guys can take it back
*  With certain countries
*  They were tiny
*  They were like fucking Cincinnati
*  They did what England did
*  They just became a bank
*  They did that
*  In the 1970s
*  Dutchmen traveling to Japan
*  Learned Japanese kickboxing
*  Which blended elements of Kyokushin karate and Muay Thai
*  And Japan, not Southeast Asia
*  Over the next 50 years
*  You watching Shogun?
*  It's fun, right?
*  It's like a Japanese Game of Thrones
*  The commercial looks good
*  I guarantee they ruin it
*  They put ladies in it
*  They already have to
*  No
*  They were written, why are there no black people on Shogun?
*  People were like, it's because it's about Japan
*  1600s
*  What the fuck he's saying
*  1600s Japan
*  You're fucking swinging every
*  Virtue flag you have
*  Wave it
*  Let's get black people on Shogun
*  That's so crazy
*  That is so bananas
*  That could be good
*  Why were there no Japanese people on Alien?
*  What the fuck are you talking about?
*  What are you saying?
*  It's a movie you fuck
*  Why is there no women in reservoir dogs?
*  Because it's a movie
*  It's a movie about a moment
*  That happens to have only guys in it
*  That's okay, just like the Barbie movie is okay
*  It's fine
*  It's all Barbie
*  It's fine
*  Barbie movie when, have you guys seen it?
*  It was great
*  I enjoyed it
*  I did not have a problem with it
*  It's not a competition
*  It's a good movie
*  Where are the black people in Shogun?
*  There was one, I guess, there is one in the show
*  Of course
*  But this is complaining
*  Oh, Blackthorn
*  I haven't gotten to that yet, you son of a bitch
*  Is it that good?
*  It is fucking good
*  Better or worse
*  Than Tons of Energy
*  Way better
*  And historical
*  Fuck me
*  But why the awards?
*  Who cares? To me it's better
*  Because I'm fascinated by Japanese culture
*  Is it as well done as that?
*  Better than married with children?
*  Why the fuck is the son of anarchy?
*  It was like cool
*  The son of anarchy would be awesome if it was on HBO
*  If they got to go gangster
*  First couple years dude
*  Entirely
*  It opens up with him
*  It opens up with him executing a stalker
*  And then fucking her while he's bleeding out
*  It was pretty fucking good right away
*  They got wild at the beginning
*  At the beginning it was pretty fucking good
*  Later it was like, eh
*  Then they got that sweet sweet ad money
*  It was like, what are we doing here?
*  The Hells Angels should be a show
*  They were all on crank and fool
*  Did you ever read Hunter S. Thompson's book?
*  It's fucking great
*  You know, Dunk
*  I had read chapters of it
*  But I never like
*  What happened?
*  We're out of BLs
*  We have more beer
*  This is the Joe Rogan experience
*  Throw $1 million at the problem
*  We have a million dollars
*  To an esteemed guest like Shane Gilles
*  And bring that menorah over here will ya?
*  Train by day
*  Get Carl out of here
*  Look at that Carl's like a 9-11
*  Isn't that the greatest promo of all time?
*  I love it so much
*  But when Nick said that
*  I couldn't believe he said it
*  That's our new introduction
*  You just made it
*  Shout out to Red Band
*  Red Band put it together
*  It's funny to see when you were there
*  Oh shit, a shout out?
*  Nick Diaz?
*  That was incredible
*  Meanwhile I'm like fucking in awe
*  The one time you took me to the
*  You took me to one fight
*  And I was standing there and Cameron Simons
*  Won a fight
*  He's this little South African white guy
*  He just beat the fuck out of the guy
*  And then he stood up
*  And ran over to where I was sitting
*  And was like, hey, big fat man
*  I was like
*  I'm sitting there holding beer
*  No way
*  That's the dopest shit
*  That's the internet
*  He literally was on a dude's back
*  You know how many times
*  I've been with Theo
*  And Dustin Poirier fights
*  Dustin Poirier and Theo are homies
*  And they're like fucking point at Theo after he wins
*  It's nuts
*  It's amazing
*  How about when Dustin Poirier said at the last UFC
*  I missed it
*  Because I'm just trying to get the most out of him
*  In an interview
*  He gave a William Montgomery reference
*  I ain't never going to stop
*  He literally said it
*  And it sounded like William Montgomery
*  But my brain did not register
*  I've seen William Montgomery doing DMs
*  Get the fuck out of here
*  He talked about it on Instagram
*  He's the man
*  Poirier's win that night was gigantic
*  The best
*  That was the coolest moment of the night
*  Louisiana, Lafayette
*  My thoughts on that fight going in was that that dude is a dangerous grappler
*  He's a judo black belt
*  He's a fucking French special forces guy
*  Saint-Aunis
*  He's a dangerous motherfucker
*  But Poirier has an advantage, stand up
*  And in stand up you can't bridge that gap that quickly
*  Oh yeah
*  How long have you been doing stand up?
*  He's been doing stand up since he was a little kid
*  He's got a wicked striking
*  Everything is wicked
*  Leg kicks are wicked
*  The striking is wicked
*  You can't beat him
*  You get into the second, third, fourth and fifth rounds
*  You start making fundamental, like, tactical mistakes
*  That's when conditioning and
*  Knowing what the fuck you're doing takes over
*  And those guys with high level experience
*  They've been in hell
*  Poirier's been in hell
*  Absolute hell, so many times
*  I love Poirier, but Gagey
*  My favorite fighter
*  He's amazing
*  He beat Poirier
*  He won in the end
*  He won recently
*  Those guys can fight ten times
*  And it might be five and five
*  I love both of them, but I think Gagey's my favorite fighter
*  Poirier was fucking sweet liberty chance
*  Gagey's awesome
*  You can't stop him
*  He's fighting Max Holloway, UFC 300
*  Really? Who's coming?
*  Where is it?
*  It's in Vegas
*  Let's go
*  April 13th I think
*  Let's go, do it
*  Yeah, April 13th
*  I went to one of the O'Reilly show in Austin
*  Where you going bitch?
*  I'm recording a special two weeks later
*  Two weeks?
*  You'll be inspired
*  Do you have a game book that weekend?
*  Halifax or Ontario or something
*  Are you going to fucking do comedy for communists?
*  Halifax is a fucking
*  Bunch of fucking Trudeau
*  Buttlickers up there
*  Halifax goes hard
*  Halifax is outsider fisherman, they don't even know who they're ruled by
*  Halifax goes hard
*  They just care about the lobster
*  They're so mad right now
*  Yeah
*  The UFC is tough because
*  They're all cool
*  There's so many good ones
*  Cheeto, Sugar Sean was tough
*  I love Sugar Sean
*  And Sugar Sean is the man
*  He's cool, he's a cool Tony
*  You can't like them personally because
*  They're going to get hit at least once
*  Of course you like them personally
*  They're all awesome
*  It's not like a football player where you're like
*  Somebody punched you in the face
*  Sugar Sean is cool
*  I've hung out with him a bunch of times, he's awesome
*  He likes comedy
*  Could you come please meet my friends
*  He's awesome
*  Sugar Sean's awesome
*  Cheeto Vera is the bro
*  Both those things are true
*  They're both the bros
*  So then they have to fight
*  And you go god damn
*  I love both those dudes
*  Yeah they're both amazing
*  It's hard when you're doing commentary on two people you love
*  And when one dude is just piecing the other dude up
*  Sugar Sean put on a fucking clinic
*  He did
*  Yeah, and in the end
*  That's what Jason Perot was calling for the whole time
*  Making a brawl
*  Like he fucked this dude up
*  And he hit him with a shot to the body and really hurt him
*  Oh yeah
*  That was a good fight
*  Oh yeah
*  Oh yeah got me
*  Cheeto put on a clinic
*  A chin clinic
*  Yeah he's got a good chin
*  He might have the best chin of all time
*  That fucking
*  That knee to the face had him looking at his ankles
*  Crazy
*  His head snapped so far back
*  Have you ever seen it? Like on slow mo
*  His head snaps all the way back
*  All the way back
*  And he never even stumbled
*  No
*  No indication that he was wobbled
*  No indication that he was hurt
*  He just fucking, still dangerous
*  Bro he's an animal
*  He refused to be hurt
*  All those guys like comedy
*  BJ Penn used to like it
*  I remember BJ Penn coming up to you at the weigh-ins
*  And was like
*  BJ's the man
*  You ever see that fucking
*  Camouflage jacket
*  That I wear like puffy camouflage jacket
*  Cheeto got me that
*  He was wearing that and I go bro that's the dopest jacket I've ever seen
*  He goes you want one? I go fuck yeah
*  So he sent me one
*  He's the man dude
*  He could not be cooler
*  I wish they didn't
*  He could fight and beat the fuck out of each other
*  But that's just how it has to go
*  And at the end of the day you gotta admire
*  What Sugar Sean did
*  What he did was masterful
*  Undeniable dude
*  He's nasty
*  He's masterful
*  He just keeps getting better man
*  That's awesome
*  That's huge
*  The first time I met Sugar Sean
*  It was a fight you brought me to
*  I was in the back and he was like
*  What's up dude
*  What's up man
*  It's cool to meet you man
*  Fighters are some of the coolest fucking people you ever meet
*  We went to the fight in
*  Atlanta this is years ago with Santino
*  And Theo was there
*  It was like Elvis showed up
*  Theo was huge in the UFC world
*  And then Poirier hugged him
*  And I was like oh god I'm nervous
*  First of all it's like real similar
*  Thinking watch
*  A lot of Protect Our Parks fans
*  UFC world
*  I can't tell you how many bros come up to me
*  When's the next one bro
*  And they go like in this last week
*  When's the next one coming up actually
*  I know now
*  Because
*  In this culture it's weird for dudes
*  To just get together and just be dudes
*  Which is so strange
*  Isn't that weird
*  But you can
*  You just have to achieve escape velocity
*  Ever follow bros being bros?
*  You would love it
*  It's a bunch of guys kicking like boulders
*  Like lodge boulders down the cliff
*  And they're like yeah
*  Or throwing ice on ice
*  Anybody need to know this guy
*  I'm good
*  Dudes being dudes
*  Why is that not okay
*  Women suck
*  They're so gay
*  They're similar to a lot of gay
*  There's a lot of similarities
*  Women are gay
*  If they weren't girls they'd be gay
*  You could laugh out a lot of dumb shit
*  From what you imagine as a queen gay
*  If they weren't girls you'd be like oh my god
*  This person's so gay
*  But I think women like dudes still
*  Women like guys
*  Which is gay if you're a girl
*  Yeah
*  And they're taking up the ass
*  A lot of them
*  I don't know what fucking sample group
*  You're gay
*  I'll send you a couple numbers
*  Joe
*  Joe give me a look
*  Remember that joke
*  Like it on a big brown dick
*  What happened to fun
*  Yeah girls are gay
*  Imagine being a girl
*  Imagine all of a sudden
*  You got transported into a girls body
*  With a dudes mind
*  But a girls needs
*  So you need to get filled
*  That's the real quads of leaf
*  I'm a woman I need it
*  I need my dick
*  You're so straight but you want cock so bad
*  I'm not thirsty but I need to drink
*  I need it
*  But then the aftermath is a bitch
*  If you're a dude trapped in a girls body
*  I guess it wouldn't be that big of a deal
*  Being a lady
*  Who gets filled
*  What are we doing after
*  If they ever get to a point where it's
*  Genetic engineering
*  Where you can literally become a woman
*  Dude this is a matter of going through a procedure
*  That'd be nice
*  A pill quick
*  Would you be willing to do it for a couple of days just to see what it feels like
*  No I'm not gay
*  Wait for sex
*  I thought you meant the life experience
*  I thought you meant the life experience
*  Wanting their life experience is gay
*  You want straight to get filled
*  You immediately want to get
*  You want to get filled
*  Wanting the life experience is gayer than having gay sex
*  Just to see what it's like to live like a bird
*  It's not wanting
*  It's like military service
*  I want to see what it's like to have
*  Someone looking at me for a minute
*  I would like a vagina for a minute
*  Are you giving a discount on that coffee
*  Oh you can
*  You know how they have compulsory
*  Military
*  Service in like South Korea
*  And Israel
*  Maybe try out being a woman for a few days
*  Every guy
*  Get some coffee
*  This is what they mean when they say that
*  Right
*  It seems like they have multiple orgasms
*  And getting double stuffed
*  Double stuffed Oreos
*  Who wouldn't want to be
*  Wait we're talking about sex again
*  Being in my ass and my vagina
*  Being afraid to drink things that people give you
*  That's gotta be tough
*  For real though
*  Wanting to experience being a woman
*  Out of some type of
*  Gay ass
*  Sympathy of like
*  I wonder how hard it is
*  Not sympathy
*  Maybe it's better
*  Just have fun for a day
*  Free drinks all night
*  Wouldn't be cool
*  I've been asking for a decade
*  I'll give you free drinks
*  But you're gonna have to give up
*  That fucking bussy
*  We'll talk
*  What? Busy?
*  Jesus Christ
*  I had that fucking video
*  Where he's talking about what he did to dudes in jail
*  Oh yeah
*  Chris Rock had a bit about it

*  Maple syrup
*  Or honey

*  Oh yeah you told me about this
*  Multiple like survivors poems
*  They have poems?

*  I'm getting like
*  God it's so funny making fun of guys
*  Who have been assaulted
*  Yeah that's tough man
*  I bet that poetry's good
*  It for sure rhymes
*  How many prison rapes do people get in trouble for?
*  What's the ratio?
*  That was a very intense video
*  Anyone else art?
*  Making fun of guys that get assaulted in prison
*  Does suck
*  How many guys really think your asshole's a pussy
*  And what's wrong with them?
*  I mean I get it I've gone down in a chicks butt
*  Yeah we all have
*  Yeah but that's a chick not a dude with a fucking bandana around his head
*  It's not a clean butt
*  And a ball bag right in your face
*  When they're like are you making decent?
*  I like how you're saying it's clean
*  How clean are you making that?
*  In a prison shower
*  It's literally a shit pipe
*  Shit pipe
*  Good band
*  How clean can it be?
*  Let's eat off this fucking
*  Let's clean it off
*  Eatin ass has gone up tenfold
*  Girls did it
*  They had that scene where she bent over the one hot chick
*  And girls
*  And the guy was eating her out
*  You think that's what started it all?
*  It's porno
*  Had nothing to do with porn right Ari?
*  That's what gave the girls writers the fucking idea
*  You watch girls?
*  He watched girls pretending if he had the fucking girls
*  He would be a girl
*  Nah that's the gayest thing
*  That's so gay dude
*  You watch girls?
*  That wasn't a bad show
*  That gave it like two years
*  Your New York guys are different dude
*  Me and Joe are Texas guys
*  We're kinda fucking tough and straight
*  We don't watch that fucking show
*  We watch fucking BattleBots
*  That's a 30 year old Joe
*  I watch rodeo
*  You watch New Yorki?
*  A lot of rodeo
*  We watch rodeo on BattleBots dude
*  You guys are sitting back home in gas
*  Brooklyn watching fucking girls
*  We watch prairie dogs get assassinated on YouTube
*  That's sad
*  Prairie dogs that shoot them with 50 calibers
*  You know what's sad?
*  When a beautiful beautiful horse
*  Steps in a prairie dog hole
*  And snaps its leg
*  You gotta shoot it in the face
*  Fuck prairie dogs
*  Prairie dogs are good boys dude
*  What about a cow?
*  I do love cows
*  Cows are so fun
*  Don't they send dogs out in the middle east
*  To run over land mines?
*  No
*  They send fucking people
*  That's better
*  They'll let fucking Jews
*  People run across
*  Alright good
*  We gotta get those land mines out
*  Yeah we're not gonna get those
*  Damn
*  Let me show that guy
*  What is that a ground hog?
*  Prairie dogs
*  They're so cute
*  You don't see it like the JFK assassination
*  Look at these cocks
*  Man
*  I'm talking land mines
*  These aren't land mines
*  These are shooters
*  Nobody's eating those
*  They just get rid of them because they fuck up the cows
*  What was that?
*  Is that a ground hog?
*  Or a caddy shack?
*  What is it a nutria?
*  Those are alright to kill
*  They ruin the plant life
*  In Louisiana
*  Why is that okay but that's not okay?
*  You know what's really not okay?
*  Squirrels are cute
*  Squirrels are great guys
*  You know who's great and underrated?
*  Possums
*  Possums are fun guys
*  They're Irish
*  Disgusting
*  That tail is bad news
*  What's the difference between a possum and an opossum?
*  Nothing
*  It's like a cult and an occult
*  They look bad
*  Occult?
*  That's a thing right?
*  Occult
*  Like satanic shit
*  Devil worshipping
*  See if you can get some zebras running across some minefields
*  No
*  Unleash Jamie with the darkest stuff
*  Wait till you see these guys clearing out minefields with just animals they found
*  Bring it on
*  I've seen that
*  Zebras?
*  Whatever they got their hands on
*  They just send them through minefields
*  Really?
*  Jew tunnel
*  Pull it up
*  Did you say Jew tunnel?
*  I said Jew tunnel
*  I was trying to make a Utah connection
*  I was like I am not
*  I'm going to make a Jew turn
*  Jew tunnels
*  Jew tunnels equally is nonsensical
*  It has nothing to do with zebras
*  Zebras crossing a minefield
*  Jew tunnel
*  You gotta sit there and go what the fuck does that mean?
*  What does that mean even though?
*  Hey have we shamed you out of using the stack of notes?
*  No he's still got them
*  It's in my pocket there fatty
*  Let me see how big it is
*  Well I cut it down
*  It's a Collins new joke that last night he had a fucking
*  He has it ready
*  To avoid back pain
*  But the amount of shit I get on the road for this thing
*  Because of this show?
*  Yeah
*  Oh my god dude
*  It's gotten worse
*  It's still there
*  It's so much bigger
*  You don't even have that many jokes
*  40% smaller
*  Did you write down every joke multiple times?
*  Don't fuck up the order
*  Because that top one is all my new shit
*  This is literally insane
*  He does always have new
*  This is like right up there with the writing in the movie Seven
*  In fairness he's always got new
*  Don't fuck with the notes
*  That top one
*  Just keep the top one abreast
*  Why are you doing this?
*  I like the writing
*  Try reading that
*  That's my new shit
*  I won't read it I swear to god
*  You can read it I just don't want you to ruin it
*  That's a good 12 minutes right there
*  They killed last night
*  Crush your last night at the creek
*  It's a very effective method
*  Mark's always got new
*  Mark you're a great comic
*  This is still odd
*  Take it easy
*  You're one of my favorite comics to watch
*  Every time you go on I go I gotta see what he's got
*  Shut up
*  Why are you being nasty?
*  No I'm being honest
*  Aggressively complimentary
*  Norman that's a fact
*  You wrote on a map?
*  That's all I needed
*  You wrote on a map?
*  That's what they give you at the hotel
*  You have a phone right?
*  I don't like the typing
*  Farts queef
*  Queef it kills
*  If you do mass murder
*  These notes are gonna be evidence
*  A lot of this is working
*  It says farts queef
*  If you ever try to apply for a visa
*  To another country
*  New page is good
*  Get a book
*  Pegging
*  Why don't you have one of those little books
*  What book?
*  What are those things called?
*  What are those little tiny
*  Moleskin
*  It's too hard on the back
*  That's not
*  You literally have a football
*  In your pocket
*  I've been told that before
*  Right right right
*  Football is a bad reference
*  I was looking for Ketchersmith
*  There you go
*  That's better
*  Crying orgasm is killing
*  You have a baseball in your pocket
*  Soder has that one
*  Crying orgasm
*  He's got a bit on that
*  His new shit
*  He did the mothership last week
*  He just put on a special
*  And he's got a new 40
*  Soder's
*  He's a monster
*  Soder's the most underrated
*  He's in the top 20
*  Of that at least
*  He's so good
*  Of that
*  Of underrated
*  I'm saying easily he's underrated
*  We're gonna make awards again
*  He's underrated
*  People don't give him his respect
*  I think he went to the acting road
*  And all this shit maybe
*  He's finding his lane
*  This is what it is
*  He's coming into his own right now
*  Soder is
*  I don't know
*  He rules
*  It was you Shane
*  Soder is the best
*  It takes a while
*  It's a weird process
*  You gotta keep grinding
*  You gotta put it on the internet
*  Like Ari with Jew
*  When Ari with Jew
*  When that popped out
*  Soder's on the road
*  It's on YouTube right now
*  He's a million
*  He's an animal
*  It's kind of nice
*  There's so much YouTube shit
*  And the cream rises
*  It's also the community
*  If we say he's awesome
*  We're not lying
*  If someone's good
*  He's pretty good
*  He's got potential
*  But when you get to that Soder level
*  You go yeah this guy's super legit
*  He's around go see him
*  He came to the club he murdered
*  He only murders
*  He always murders
*  Since the day I met him
*  He's so nice
*  He's such a likable
*  Fun dude
*  We didn't kill Tony together
*  Someone mentioned Cat Williams
*  He just goes into a Cat Williams
*  He got a standing o at some point
*  He opened the podcast with a Cat Williams impression
*  And then you're like
*  I can write a joke but I can't do any of these
*  So he can do the impressions and the
*  Impressions and the voices
*  Drones are only fun in the United States
*  Fuck
*  That's funny
*  It's so true
*  It's an awesome time for comedy
*  There's so many good guys coming up
*  It really is and you read the comments
*  I can't believe it I got killed Tony
*  On YouTube then he got my favorite podcast
*  I'm a comedian doing a new special
*  Everybody likes what they like
*  It's a great time
*  They can find out about so much stuff
*  There's so much stuff that's available
*  To see now
*  People are getting spoiled
*  They're like that went on Patreon
*  You fucking cum guzzler
*  You're just reading comments
*  Most people are really happy
*  The overall thing is like
*  Wow what a fun time to be a comedy fan
*  If I was a kid
*  I was listening to Richard Pryor tapes
*  With my girlfriend when I was 16
*  Everybody loved that shit
*  All the ideas like college kids or whatever
*  They all liked Adam Sandler
*  They're always the generally fun fans
*  We have a David Tell special
*  Coming out in a week
*  He's on the podcast Friday
*  Really? Hell yeah
*  I've seen it
*  It's grills
*  He's another one
*  He's so underappreciated
*  Top 20 of underrated
*  It's a weird plus minus
*  Top 20 underrated comics is possible
*  You're saying leave him out of the top 20?
*  No
*  He's just a great comic
*  He's a great comic
*  You understand what I'm saying?
*  Why are we rating?
*  This is how dumb men are
*  When I say top 20
*  Don't even talk about it anymore
*  He's in this range of whatever
*  He's trying to cover up for his bullshit
*  I'm saying
*  Top 20 of all time
*  Doesn't matter what kind of comedy you're into
*  He's in there
*  We've got a David Tell special coming out
*  The problem is dudes are so gross
*  We have to argue
*  David Tell is top 20 underrated comics
*  That's what you said
*  He's top 10 comedies
*  I know
*  But I'm saying also underrated
*  I'm saying people don't give him his due
*  Can we just say he's awesome?
*  Can we just not argue like a bunch of fucking queens?
*  I agree
*  I also agree
*  You're the one who's a queen
*  You're the one acting queenie
*  You guys are a bad neighborhood back alley queens with knee scabs
*  Arguing over stupid shit
*  We all agree
*  Most underrated is a fun argument
*  Of any sport, of any whatever
*  You go to who's best versus ratings
*  It's a fun argument
*  Who's the most underrated football player
*  It's fun
*  Who's the most underrated fighter Ari?
*  Chris Brown
*  Ben Henderson
*  Dan Henderson?
*  Benson Henderson
*  He was great
*  And maybe the most wins versus whatever
*  Dominates his division
*  People don't give him his respect
*  He's more of a pioneer
*  But it's a fun argument
*  Who's the most underrated
*  All time, not appreciated
*  World champion, all time
*  Underrated doesn't mean best or worst
*  You have to get rating into account
*  That's actually a really good one
*  That's a real good one
*  Thank you, one episode of Fighters Command
*  Sorry, what was the name?
*  Dan Henderson
*  He came in as a
*  Give me one of those bruskies
*  Oh damn, what about
*  Mighty Mouse?
*  Benson Henderson, he's a fun fact
*  Mighty Mouse actually is
*  He was one of the greatest ever
*  How about this? Imanari
*  Underrated, people don't know about him
*  His stats, his highlight reels are fucking crazy
*  Jason Ellis skateboarder
*  Underrated, great skateboarder
*  Underrated, horrible skateboarder
*  Wow, top ten
*  He was top ten in this trial
*  He was not, you know more than me
*  He wasn't like top ten in this trial
*  Top ten? Street skaters?
*  No, he's got a huge dong
*  A lot of tattoos
*  Not now, back then before fucking Jackass got to him
*  No, you're crazy
*  You're way off
*  There's so many better skateboarders
*  No offense to him
*  Street skateboarders of that time
*  He never can be wrong
*  I'm saying, I'm giving up for you
*  Shane, do you feel this? It's a real flaw
*  You know what he does, which is actually really impressive
*  Is whenever he is wrong he goes
*  Wow, congratulations to you
*  I'm gracious
*  He would know more
*  It's a psychotic moment
*  You never called it a black power speech
*  Interesting
*  You're disgusting, I hate you
*  I think you made that black power thing up
*  It's possible, or you're just not willing to see greatness
*  You're not ready
*  America
*  America does rule
*  We're complaining about all types of gay shit
*  What's your guys favorite shit in America right now, dude?
*  My poop yesterday
*  Now we're all sitting around going
*  What's the best stuff?
*  Whenever there's a bunch of people
*  telling you what you can say
*  and what you can do
*  There's always
*  the coolest thing
*  is the people that go, no
*  And that's what the coolest thing is today
*  That's the punk rockers of today
*  The people that are rebelling
*  against this bizarre system
*  that even the artists have somehow or another
*  accepted as being the
*  right thing to think and believe and
*  trust and go along with
*  you're in a fucking cult
*  And the people that are resisting that
*  knowing you're going to get labeled a
*  fascist or a nazi, just because you
*  see what the fuck is going on
*  People are out of your mind
*  How about everybody the fuck alone
*  Those people are the coolest
*  about America, because this is one of the
*  rare places on earth where you could still do that
*  for now without being prosecuted
*  But why
*  do we blow the people who
*  complain the most?
*  I feel like they're the biggest voices
*  We don't, they just like
*  But only if you pay attention
*  If you don't pay attention to that it goes
*  away, like radio
*  I know, but like when Elvis was shaking his hips
*  and they're like, can you believe it? This is appalling
*  This is inappropriate
*  Why are we listening to them still?
*  Why would you want to be that guy?
*  It is funny
*  You're a hater
*  It's funny when you see somebody going, this guy
*  Jordan missed three shots today
*  Don't be on that side
*  Listen, not everybody's going to make it
*  That's the reality
*  If you're all running from wolves, not everybody's
*  going to make it
*  There's going to be a bunch of people that get taken out
*  That's the only way that we stay alive
*  It feels like a weird stance to take
*  Like, I'm upset about this, I'm going to
*  You're like, you're complaining about that?
*  This is your life? Of course
*  But you're concentrating on the musings of more
*  But we know these people
*  But you're doing it too
*  Forget that, what's the great shit out there?
*  Soder
*  Soder, a ton of specimens coming out
*  There's a lot of great shit out there
*  UFC is great
*  You said comedy is awesome right now because it's dangerous
*  It's fun, people get so mad and everyone laughs at them
*  walking out angry
*  And it's better, the reactions are better
*  It rules
*  It's so popular right now
*  The failures among us are making more
*  Shane got the whole Saturday night
*  He's not even a model
*  If they didn't fire me, I would have never hosted that motherfucker
*  He would have still just been on there
*  I know, I just get weirded out
*  People we know are angry about stuff
*  That's cool
*  I know, but you want to give them a hug
*  Let's go for a hike
*  People we know, comedians, can you believe he said this and said that
*  I'm like, I have filtered all those people out of my life
*  I don't want to name names
*  You know what I'm talking about
*  You gotta figure out how to change conversations
*  Whatever they have to do is as they talk
*  talk about that horrible shit
*  Great weather today, huh?
*  What the fuck kind of advice is that?
*  Shift conversation away
*  And they go, politics sucks
*  Race relations sucks
*  You gotta go, hey do you guys see the new development in this?
*  I've hung out with you at comedy clubs
*  That's not how you talk
*  That is true
*  Have you had this MacAllan? It's great
*  With this advice, you should be president
*  Exactly
*  You're almost as old as Biden
*  So rock solid
*  I'm saying, everybody downs you with fucking conversation
*  Can't you just go
*  Can't you just go with something fun
*  Here, Ari, practice
*  I'll go, hey, you see the genocide going on in Gaza?
*  No, but dude, there's a hike up there
*  That is so fucking good, you can go up to Masada
*  Not right now, Ari, they'll shoot you
*  That's a different side
*  Negative, positive
*  Bro, they have long range rifles, they'll fucking kill you
*  You can still go to Masada
*  There's no doubt if they see you in the crosshairs, oh yeah, that's one of them
*  Dude, I love it, as soon as I got back from me
*  I was like, oh, there's a genocide going on there
*  I don't know, man, it was pretty fucking cool
*  Tea leaf salad's great
*  You at the cool genocide? I wasn't at the genocide
*  You're at your nuts
*  No, we're not nuts
*  We're just trying to get you to clarify
*  I'm saying, focus on positive shit
*  Oh yeah, ignore the genocide
*  Ignore the genocide
*  Alright, well you guys ruined fucking conversation without the genocide
*  Shut up
*  It's just weird that that's people's lot life
*  What do you mean shut up about the genocide?
*  Shut up, let's have fun
*  I agree, I agree completely
*  Ignore all the horrific things that are happening
*  Well, let's focus on the genocide a little
*  I think we should focus on the genocide slightly
*  And then have fun once we figure that out
*  Which what?
*  What about the multiple genocides going on right now?
*  What about the Uyghurs?
*  What about the Uyghurs?
*  Should we focus on that for a while?
*  Should we take a break from having a good time with bros?
*  And be like, let's focus on gen...
*  You ever heard of a bar where someone brings up fucking genocide?
*  It's the lamest conversation, guys
*  No one likes it
*  What I'm saying is, you have a tool ready to go
*  Change conversation away
*  From fucking dumb shit like genocide
*  And horrible shit like politics
*  And have it come back to some
*  New movie, oh that was great
*  I'm not talking about genocide, I'm talking about people
*  Annoyed by a word or a joke
*  Same shit, when it comes up
*  You're like, let's shift this conversation
*  Alright, I'll shift
*  The problem is social media, right?
*  Because those people will post it
*  And then they get a bunch of other cucks
*  Pile on
*  It's going to be a vicious clip
*  What I'm saying, in real life
*  Don't you think you should have a tool to steer
*  A conversation away from your dog?
*  Of course, of course
*  So I'm saying, as a society, we gotta have some having these conversations
*  Alright, alright
*  As soon as politics, religion, genocide
*  Any of this dumb shit comes up
*  The negative shit
*  That one seems important
*  Sure, sure
*  That's what everybody says about their thing
*  Let's shift
*  You guys ever go on Netanyahu?
*  Com
*  He's going to his OnlyFans
*  Ask Jews
*  God, you hear both sides of this stuff
*  Get so fucking downery
*  No, no, no
*  If we're going back to comics that became
*  Look, I'm not worried about comics that are actually righteous
*  And have a good point
*  It's just the comics that became
*  Speakers
*  Like just CNN, Democrat
*  Hardcore
*  That's fucking insane
*  You know what they have in common?
*  Insanity
*  Low ticket sales, all of them
*  Somebody's trying to post a lot about politics
*  Especially if you're talking
*  You're talking about like hardcore
*  Democrat politics or other comedians
*  It's almost
*  Entirely
*  Well it's weird, they'll get mad at you
*  You see people, that's all they talk about
*  And it becomes like, ugh, you're just not doing jokes
*  You're focusing on external
*  Things because you're not happy with
*  The way you're being received
*  Or it's making you not just write a joke
*  I was going to do a joke
*  I was going to do a joke about it but Jimmy Carr did it
*  And it's how like, if you go on stage
*  And you're like, for real I didn't mean that
*  I'm sorry
*  They still won't believe you
*  You'll not believe my apology
*  But you'll believe the joke
*  They want to believe it
*  You want to believe the joke
*  It's a game, they're just playing I Got You
*  They're playing I Got You
*  But why? This is what you want to do with your life?
*  Because it's just a fucking game
*  It's just like playing fucking pickleball
*  It's the same shit
*  It's just they're playing a game, they're trying to win
*  If they get you to complain about it, you lost too
*  I guess so
*  Now you're corny
*  You do to a certain extent, but sometimes you can make things seem
*  As foolish as they actually are
*  And if someone else
*  Isn't doing it, maybe you should
*  Like at a certain point
*  With some arguments
*  It really depends on how much energy you want to invest in it
*  Whether or not you recognize
*  Whatever energy you put out on this thing
*  If you're not doing it, this thing is coming back at you
*  Like times 100
*  You have to figure out what you want to engage with
*  And what you don't
*  Sometimes you should
*  I just get confused by it
*  It's confusing because you're not a fucking idiot
*  If you were a fucking idiot
*  You would be diving right in
*  Trying to get people to give you likes
*  It's fools
*  It is fun to see a comic
*  Shitting on another comic
*  And you look down the timestamp and it's like 2.48am
*  You should be DMing a slut
*  But you're doing this instead
*  You would DM a YouTube rabbit hole
*  We're all going to die one day
*  Since the daddy is only half sold
*  And it's Friday night
*  And you have 150,000 Twitter followers
*  You don't do that when there's an after party
*  Yeah
*  What do you care about people who suck
*  There's so much awesome shit to pay attention to
*  I know, we got a great time here
*  But the thing is that people suck in your industry
*  And they're doing better than you
*  You just have to understand
*  Someone disagrees with you
*  All these people that are going to see that guy
*  They disagree with you
*  You maybe should think about your delivery
*  You should maybe think about what you are
*  How you are being seen by people other than you
*  Also you're on the side of
*  Everyone's having a good time
*  Or you're against that
*  You decided that everyone having a good time is bad
*  Wow
*  What a weird understanding
*  Not bad
*  Wow
*  Not walking out, let me go fucking do something else
*  You hate good fun stuff
*  My friend is an agent
*  She's like, so who do you know that's funny
*  Because we're getting back into the funny stuff
*  We're not checking boxes
*  We're getting back into funny
*  500 people
*  You're a comedian agent
*  What an hilarious thing to say
*  That's a true sentence
*  We're going back to funny
*  We're forgetting this and that
*  I'm all about funny now
*  It used to be Buck Wilde
*  They would show you the best
*  Coolest stuff, the people who get set on a line
*  For the shortest amount of time possible
*  Anyone who could be good
*  They'd be like, here it is
*  Here's a bunch of check boxes
*  No one bothers going
*  Was that a DEI thing?
*  They didn't hold the line
*  All these clubs
*  Hold the line
*  Just book funny
*  USC is the winner
*  Are you going to do well?
*  Who's better?
*  By the way, the most diverse company
*  That's what comedy does too
*  Comedy clubs hold the line
*  They're booking whoever's funny
*  That's when they don't hold the line
*  They're booking whoever sells tickets
*  Ari, you're concentrating on comedy clubs and festivals the same way idiots comment on comedy
*  Festivals are gay and dead
*  Hold the line is funny
*  You've seen clubs go from great bookers
*  To suddenly, what happened here?
*  The mothership is holding the line
*  I'm telling you, it's not easy to do
*  You have to have extraordinary resources to hold the line
*  That's the reason
*  Because you have to have money to say, fuck you
*  You have to be able to say, fuck you
*  Eager used to have a list of people that would show the lineups to only one woman or less
*  He didn't show yesterday when there were four women
*  He was like, and he'll look back and go, I wish I would have just booked funny
*  He was getting pressure
*  He's a Holocaust survivor
*  He's getting pressure from people that own the club who are getting pressure from other outside forces
*  I'm saying, hold the line, do well financially, do well comedically, everyone will be happy
*  Just book funny comments
*  You've got to be willing to let it all fall apart
*  If you have a business
*  This is the only way you make money
*  And you have 50 employees
*  And all of them are dependent upon you to keep the doors open
*  If you have an email campaign
*  Or some kind of crazy campaign
*  Or protest or something
*  You run the risk of losing money
*  And you get scared
*  Most comedy clubs make a little bit more money than it takes to run the place
*  Most comedy clubs
*  They don't do great
*  So you're saying that Seattle Place should ban those people?
*  Because it's not holding the line
*  What are you, Captain Strongman?
*  I'm saying hold the line
*  Book funny people and don't worry about them because they're not real people
*  They're not real people
*  Most arey, most do
*  You're concentrating on the few that can't
*  Or don't, or cowards
*  I'm saying hold the line
*  When you have a good club that books good comics, it's great
*  And then suddenly they don't hold the line
*  And you're like, oh you're just putting people who sell tickets
*  Well the craziest non-holding the line is the Canadian Place
*  That banned Dave
*  Louis, and who else?
*  Schultz?
*  Louis Gomez
*  Dave Smith
*  Jim Florentine
*  One more person
*  Dave Smith
*  You're right
*  I thought Canadian
*  Because they're behaving like Canadians
*  They're not holding the line, they're not just like, we're just going to book funny, you guys do whatever the fuck you want
*  But they don't understand that they just bud lighted themselves
*  And that's what's going to happen
*  Hey, bud light's great
*  The thing that happened
*  You remember? Before you?
*  No, no, I don't
*  But that's what happens
*  That's what happened to Google when they released that fucking Gemini AI
*  That showed the founding fathers
*  Of being all black people
*  And all the Nazis were diverse
*  It's not going to work out for you
*  Hold the line, just do what's good
*  And don't fall prey to that
*  I understand, but they don't know that
*  They're just trying to stay alive
*  I'm just telling you that comedy club owners for the most part are barely making it
*  They're just doing okay
*  And they have maniacs working for them
*  I have to fucking count on a guy like you
*  Showing up, you dropping bathtub acid
*  You got from some dude in the parking lot
*  On Friday night
*  I'm telling you comedy clubs, if you actually do want to make a living
*  Don't fall prey to what the fucking bloggers are saying
*  Just book who's funny
*  Just book the good comics
*  Forget all that
*  When you get a world of shit online, it's scary
*  It's scary, but I'm saying hold the line
*  Don't fall prey to it
*  Just book the great comics
*  And we'll keep coming out in droves
*  If they have good social media and good marketing, that's possible
*  But if they fucked up and they went all Ice House
*  And they don't have
*  Then it sucks
*  Ice House did that?
*  Well, the Ice House never was good at booking the show
*  I say Ice House not in reference to the new Ice House
*  But with the old one
*  The old one was one of the greatest clubs of all time
*  But on so many nights
*  It would be the worst comedy there
*  It just wasn't good
*  Because they didn't have anybody that was booking it correctly
*  And then you could come in
*  And you could do shows there and it would be amazing
*  You could book your own shows
*  Put it on your Twitter
*  It would be amazing
*  But then you come the next night when you didn't do that
*  You're like what the fuck is going on here
*  Because they didn't establish the right social media presence
*  They didn't establish the right email list
*  They didn't have a good book manager
*  But look what happens to a JFL who doesn't hold it
*  And it was like we'll just book what we think you guys will want
*  And then it's like actually nobody really wants that
*  In terms of ticket buyers
*  So just fucking stay with what's funny
*  You will be good
*  Well they're finding out bro
*  But that industry is fueled by Hollywood
*  Just for Laughs was always in bed with Hollywood
*  And it never figured out how to disconnect itself
*  Even after Hollywood wasn't valid anymore
*  It should have been just like
*  This is the best comics that we know of
*  That are alive right now
*  Skankfest
*  No upscale tickets
*  For the fucking industry
*  Not only that
*  With Skankfest
*  You can't get tickets
*  But with Skankfest
*  But this speaks to what you're saying
*  Skankfest you fucking can't get tickets
*  It sells out
*  It's fucking swarmed
*  That's what people want
*  Mike when you get to my level you'll bail
*  Good luck
*  Hey good luck buddy
*  There's always like it's Tim Dill and Shane on Sunday
*  Everyone's like I think they might be gone who knows
*  I'll bail
*  One day when you get to me you can bail bud
*  I think he's gonna hold the line
*  I'm gonna hold the line
*  We'll see
*  Then I'll snort it
*  I actually got sick I'll be there this year
*  I'll be there every year
*  I actually genuinely got very sick
*  It's a fun time
*  I love Skankfest
*  My agent pushed back every year and I'm like I gotta go
*  It's an important thing for comedy
*  Because it's a festival made by comics for comics
*  It's wild
*  I already had like four of them
*  Nah I don't see any counts
*  You're talking too much
*  Also come to Skankfest Joe
*  No you're not
*  Ari is talking about gay ass shit
*  You guys are fighting about stuff you actually
*  Agree with
*  I don't give a fuck about some
*  Seattle club that fired fucking
*  Lewis
*  And Lewis was cool about it
*  Stop attacking this club
*  They do what they want to do I do what I want to do
*  That's fair
*  Yeah you go alright whatever
*  Respect my opponent he's a good man thanks for showing up
*  Yeah he went the bigger man on there
*  Which is good of Lewis
*  Easy big fella
*  There you go fatty
*  Too many jihars this is cold
*  This is a cold one and he's putting it down
*  Damn that was fast
*  Joseph
*  If you do that in Iraq they'd shoot you
*  They'd throw you off a building
*  With from an eagle
*  Yeah if you try to marry a guy
*  Iraq if you wear a dress
*  You know what my favorite meme is
*  Gays for Palestine
*  Gays for Palestine rules
*  And they still push in there
*  They're still on board with it
*  I swear to god that's a Jewish
*  Psyop bro
*  It's Russia and China
*  What's a Psyop?
*  Psychological operation
*  Designed to subvert the people's opinions
*  Gaslight you
*  It's a good trick
*  China's doing it right now that's why everyone's trans
*  It's happening it's real
*  It's a you know
*  One school they found that 50 something percent
*  Of the kids identified
*  As LBGTQ or non-binary
*  Just joking around
*  50%
*  What are the odds that that's real?
*  Well Dr. Phil
*  I like that Dr. Phil
*  He said it best
*  I can't remember
*  Oh he said
*  If it's all about equity and equality
*  Why the fuck am I paying 150 grand
*  For this college
*  If it's all going to come out equal in the wash
*  What am I going to the school for
*  Which is a good point
*  Well the thing is we're entering into a world
*  Where AI is going to eliminate most jobs
*  Yup 30% of jobs
*  We have to realize that right now
*  If you're involved in computer programming
*  Good luck fuck face
*  I know they told you you're supposed to major in this
*  Fuck face
*  If you're studying that
*  But by the way you can learn from that
*  Jamie what was your major?
*  Walmart
*  Recording arts
*  No gender studies
*  Kinesiology
*  That's why you got that girl name dude
*  Became the number one podcast producer
*  In the world
*  Just doing different stuff
*  Not humble at all
*  Is that your business card?
*  I'm getting a little nasty
*  Leave my Jamie alone he's a good man
*  Jamie how come you don't come to my house anymore
*  He's impotent
*  You've been gone
*  Since you've been gone
*  I need to bring you that meat thermometer
*  I bought a meat thermometer for you
*  That's a gay code
*  It's not gay
*  It's about digital
*  It unlocks grilling
*  It unlocks grilling
*  It doesn't work anymore
*  It just unlocks it
*  I'm knee deep in whiskey
*  Shut up
*  Suck on this eagles asshole
*  Give me a beer
*  Shut up and suck on this eagles asshole
*  Bring it on fatty
*  Put it in my ass
*  That's my favorite thing that you call me
*  I like when you call me fatty
*  I like when he calls you fatty
*  I feel less pressure
*  I only say it to people who are not fat
*  You said that to me
*  You said that to my Conan
*  It's not one of my insecurities
*  I don't like being short
*  So when you call me fatty I'm like that one doesn't even register
*  I don't like when they call you short I never call you short
*  I call you shorty
*  It's a term of endearment
*  You called me fat earlier
*  I said you're big fat fuck
*  I didn't call you fat
*  He said the amount of fuck you are is fat
*  If there's anybody that loves you more than I do they're related to
*  I never called you a short little tiny guy
*  But I am
*  But I don't do that
*  I only said it because it was important for trying to get a laugh
*  No you were reading a kickboxing book and you were gay
*  It's too cold
*  Oh you didn't finish it? Give me that Marcus
*  Oh you son of a bitch you have to finish
*  You can't give anybody all the trues
*  You can't give people your back washed
*  No no that's all clean
*  Bro you ever see those people that make beer
*  Like fermented beverage and the women spit into it
*  What?
*  Yeah Bourdain told me about it
*  He went to this place and they made him drink this shit
*  And he's like dude this lady was spitting in it
*  And like you have to drink it
*  I've had that
*  It was some South American
*  They spit into it and they bury it
*  They spit into it again and they give you a bucket
*  How much should I drink? As much as not to be insulting
*  That's not kosher
*  You fucking drink a bucket of fucking Ecuador the Amazon
*  That's right yeah
*  I guess you've been tripping out now
*  Most stories of this
*  Can I give you advice? I actually wanted to talk to you about this
*  I don't think you should have a podcast
*  That's about anything other than everything
*  I like to hear about travel
*  But you can always hear about travel
*  Let's do another podcast
*  No but no no no no
*  Just Ari Shafir sees the world
*  It doesn't matter if it's travel
*  It doesn't matter if it's fucking some AI dork
*  It doesn't matter
*  It's some shit podcast
*  It doesn't matter
*  Just you
*  Just you but don't limit yourself
*  I hear ya that's another one
*  The thing that always drove me crazy
*  You had to have these themes for every show
*  But it never stuck on theme
*  The only time it never stuck on theme
*  You and I reviewed one of my comedy specials
*  My earliest earliest comedy specials
*  That's risky
*  Which one was it?
*  I think it was like my first one
*  No usually I did a first one
*  I did a second one because I was on tour with you
*  I think it was Talking Monkeys in Space
*  Talking Monkeys in Space
*  Is that Denver?
*  No Ohio
*  Rocky Mountain High was Denver
*  But it was like
*  You had this thing
*  Where you would have guys review their comedy
*  And I had not listened to it
*  In fucking 20 years
*  So I forgot about it all
*  I was like well this is crazy
*  But that's also okay too
*  Instead of having this
*  This Ari Shafir sees the world
*  I get what you're saying
*  You're saying that's all I can do
*  But I'm saying that's just one thing
*  Travel podcast you'll be tripping out now
*  Mark Normans on this tomorrow
*  But I'm saying there's lots of other stuff you can do too
*  You know what we should do
*  Trust me about this model
*  We should go to Spain to discuss Spain
*  I would like to discuss Spain in Spain
*  Why don't we bring some equipment
*  And we'll do it in Madrid
*  That's fun
*  It wasn't Madrid though
*  It was outside Madrid
*  We've been waiting for 3 hours
*  But my point is Ari
*  You can do all those things together
*  I have MMA podcast
*  I think
*  You have more than one thing
*  But no all together
*  It's okay to mush them all together
*  Or you do lots of different things
*  I think you should actually do it
*  Kill yourself
*  But here's my thing
*  Instead of having it all in a bunch of different podcasts
*  Like I like the travel one
*  But I don't like the music one
*  Put it all together
*  I get it
*  Ari Shafir
*  This is the name
*  You've never done it
*  You can't touch your toes
*  I'll touch my toes right now
*  Watch this
*  Not bad
*  Ari Shafir
*  Ari Shafir
*  Ari Shafir
*  Ari Shafir Sees the World
*  Dumb Jew
*  That's a pun
*  That's not bad either
*  A lot of people click on it just for hate
*  Yes I agree
*  These dumb Jews
*  You can stand up here
*  Travel podcast
*  This out there
*  It's all under the umbrella of these guys
*  Doing shit
*  One
*  Put it all together
*  No one podcast
*  With all those things connected
*  Don't have multiple podcasts
*  We do different things
*  Eat food and do yoga
*  That's my old one
*  Just put them all together
*  Ari Shafir Sees the World
*  You've got a lot of content
*  There is a new travel podcast out there
*  If you call it Ari Shafir Sees the World
*  It's everything
*  It's anything you do
*  It's anything all together
*  And it's just you
*  I don't want to subscribe to four different podcasts
*  Shut the fuck up
*  Put it all together
*  My stand up is not a podcast
*  He can't lose
*  He can't admit he's wrong
*  What?
*  He can't admit he's wrong
*  What are you saying?
*  Skeptic tank
*  Skeptic tank was great
*  It's dead
*  It was themed
*  It was also Sees the World
*  We did stuff about areas
*  You had a theme
*  I will say
*  I did your pod
*  And it's a good idea
*  But it's all us talking about our bullshit travel
*  I'm just saying
*  I missed talking to you
*  I know we all should do that
*  You're saying start another podcast
*  Ari Shafir Sees the World
*  I see you in a top ten of iTunes right now
*  Can I have an opinion?
*  Can I have an opinion?
*  Obviously not
*  When it comes to podcast advice
*  Maybe you should listen to the guy who might have invented it
*  Just listen
*  You've been wrong every time you've ever suggested anything
*  You've been wrong every time you've ever suggested anything
*  You've been wrong every time you've ever suggested anything
*  When it comes to podcasts
*  You are consistently wrong
*  I remember the best early new podcast in the world
*  It's so stupid and shitty
*  2003?
*  What the fuck are you talking about?
*  I love you
*  I think you suck
*  I think
*  You've got a little gay ass Bourdain in you
*  You've got a little gay ass Bourdain in you
*  I think if you do the travel pod
*  I think if you do the travel pod
*  And you actually incorporate traveling into it
*  And you actually incorporate traveling into it
*  I think that would be one
*  Mark Norman have you peed yet?
*  No
*  I know those are coming Shane
*  I didn't know we were competing
*  I've done them in France, I've done them in Romania
*  I've done them in other places
*  Let's go to Spain and do yours
*  100%
*  Going overseas?
*  That's going to be too hard on the pod
*  I do it when I'm out
*  When I'm gone let's do one raw hours
*  And I don't think you have to
*  It doesn't have to be weekly
*  You can just do it when you do it
*  Right now I'm doing bi-weekly
*  Twice a week
*  I get it
*  It can be whatever, that's what it is
*  I would love to go
*  I would love to go to Spain, you and me
*  Hang out and chat
*  Kiss a little
*  In El Norte
*  What's in that pitcher?
*  Coffee, water
*  Give me some agua
*  I'm going whiskey and beer
*  You're always the most sober dude
*  And I took mushrooms and you didn't
*  You took one block
*  It turns out it wasn't bad
*  I took two blocks and it didn't do anything
*  I knew it, I knew I should have taken two right away
*  You're a bad shaman
*  I'm just trying to warn you with those blocks
*  I fill the half a block
*  Hey
*  But I'm doing whiskey
*  Next special, April 26 in Washington DC
*  Let's go
*  Oh special
*  Even though I should not devote my time to a podcast
*  I'm also doing a special
*  I also happen to be a stand up comic
*  We're both selling horribly in Tennessee
*  So come see us in Memphis
*  On the road
*  Next special, April 26
*  AriSavir.com
*  Washington DC
*  And now you got a new one
*  We both put one out
*  I put one out in September
*  October
*  It's harder, you got to write new shit
*  And we're working on it
*  So come see us
*  Now that Joe's gone we can promote
*  Say hello on the road
*  I think a travel podcast is
*  Obviously, it's a fucking great idea
*  That's crazy
*  You interview fucking Ian Fydance
*  About going to fucking Erie, Pennsylvania
*  It's not going to be that
*  It's all weird places
*  But I will go to Spain with you and do it there instead
*  You're going to fly to Spain?
*  I'll fly you to Spain
*  When we're free, over the summer
*  I'm thinking as soon as I get done with this hour
*  I can't wait
*  I'm going to take a couple months
*  It's my real
*  Chapelle Africa
*  I'm going to go live in Spain
*  I love Spain
*  You've never met a culture
*  That doesn't give a fuck
*  About anything
*  Let's just drink and eat small foods
*  No one gives a fuck
*  Across the board
*  The term siesta
*  Banks are just like
*  It's fucking noon, we're going to all take a nap
*  A little siesta
*  No, the siesta is
*  How long are you going to go for? A year?
*  I was only there six months
*  Six months? Wait, what was this?
*  I was there for a year
*  It's coming in an episode of You Be Tripping
*  You were there for six months?
*  It's coming, it's coming
*  I missed that
*  Get them
*  It doesn't like part black guys
*  I know, I know
*  He's shaped like a monkey, but it's still okay
*  It's still okay, man, he's a human
*  Holy shit
*  I missed it
*  It's about me
*  No
*  He's short, but he looks like
*  He's got gorilla hands
*  I'm shaped like a primate
*  You are very primate
*  You're primate-like
*  It's better than being a stork
*  I wish I was more primate
*  Imagine getting stork-fucked
*  You do until it goes sideways
*  Yeah
*  Like that dude came up
*  William Montgomery
*  Came up to you
*  He's like, what was that?
*  And you're like, I'll fucking kill you
*  Everyone's got a percentage
*  Well, I actually did
*  You put out a, what do you call it, a cold tank video
*  And your dong was really poppin'
*  Thank you
*  I'll tell you this
*  You know what, that'd be lost in the cold
*  It was before I got pre-cold
*  I don't know if you saw it
*  First time we did the cold plunge
*  Me and Matt, we had our podcast
*  That week, I was like, bro
*  I did the cold plunge with Joe
*  God damn
*  And then when you have to get
*  In next and he's standing next to you and his dong's
*  Just right like
*  You got a good dong, bro, thank you
*  You have an exceptional dong
*  Thick one, bro
*  And you can suck your own dick
*  Which, where was that fear factor app?
*  No, just flexibility
*  That's a flexibility thing
*  No, it does require huge dick
*  Just flexibility, if you had a one-incher
*  Yeah, you can't suck your own dick
*  But girls can eat their pussies
*  You have a different algorithm than I do
*  Wait a minute
*  You see those girls
*  You see those girls that are allowed to breastfeed
*  And pull their tits out because they have a fake baby
*  That's nice
*  They found a hacking assistant
*  They have a rubber baby
*  And they pull out these big juicy tits
*  And they stick them in the mouth of a rubber baby
*  Yeah, they have giant milky boobs
*  The whiskey bottle
*  Whoa
*  Girls can eat their own pussy
*  Wow, that looks like there's two girls there
*  I don't
*  I see the one you said was Kim Kong
*  Good for her
*  I don't recommend any of this behavior
*  But it is possible
*  It has been done
*  This is what I'm talking about
*  When someone brings up politics
*  You licked your own dick
*  But there's a giant difference between a dick and a pussy
*  Norman just said he licked his own dick
*  I licked it but it took a lot of stretching
*  And a lot of yoga and a lot of hours
*  You spit on it
*  No, I got to lick
*  Touch it to your tongue
*  But then I felt weird about it
*  I watched a dude in a video that a friend sent me
*  I really wish he hadn't
*  But this guy was
*  This guy was inverted
*  And he was like pumping into his own mouth
*  And ejaculating
*  And then he pumps into his own mouth again
*  And ejaculates again
*  He's a hero
*  If it was a woman, the guy would be a hero
*  If he's really Phil
*  It's Kump Tony
*  Did you say that?
*  Oh my god
*  I can't believe that came out of my mouth
*  He's the straightest gay guy that's ever existed
*  He's like at the cusp
*  Of being
*  He could cross over with any
*  Stiff wind
*  Any stiff breeze that fence blows
*  And he's in the land of gay
*  I think he's a heterosexual
*  But if in 35 years
*  He comes out as gay
*  We'd all be like
*  I wouldn't be
*  Tony does so well
*  He does well with clitters
*  It's stunning
*  The girls that he dates
*  Are so beautiful
*  They're so pretty
*  Listen to me
*  Tony has been killing it
*  Since the moment I met him
*  Even when he wasn't doing well
*  Tony
*  It's again a fucking talent thing
*  Do you have the talent
*  If you have talent, Jeff Ross gets laid
*  No disrespect
*  No disrespect to Jeff Ross
*  Highest laid to eyebrow ratio in comedy
*  Naaaaaa
*  Tony, me and
*  Me and Theo
*  Two days ago I was with Theo and we were talking about Tony
*  And it's so funny we all do the same thing
*  About Tony where we like
*  We make fun of him like
*  That show was
*  What I just did was unbelievable
*  But we all make
*  Fun of him and then we're all like
*  For real though, I love Tony
*  The show is amazing
*  He's one of my favorite people
*  But him personally, every time I see him
*  I'm like nice
*  That guy
*  When he hosts Kill Tony
*  He is the best host of any
*  Show that has ever existed
*  That's my position
*  He's so good
*  Tucker Carlson to Kill Tony
*  Last night
*  Tucker Carlson had no idea
*  What did you say? How'd you set it up?
*  How'd I set it up? We were all having dinner
*  I'm having dinner
*  With Tucker Carlson and Lex Friedman
*  And we're having steaks and having a good time
*  We guys talking about women's rights?
*  We were
*  A little bit
*  We were talking about wild shit
*  He told me some wild shit that I can't wait to tell you
*  I can't wait to tell you
*  Some wild shit
*  Please tell me about the war in Ukraine
*  I'm gonna tell you some shit that you're gonna
*  You're just gonna go whoa
*  We have 20 minutes

*  I'm hanging out with Tucker
*  We're talking about the club
*  I think it's amazing what you've done here
*  You wanna come to the club?
*  Kill Tony is on tonight
*  Kill Tony is the foundation
*  Is the bedrock of stand up comedy
*  Does he have any idea what you're talking about?
*  No idea
*  How much can comedians make doing comedy?
*  So I say
*  Kill Tony sold out Madison Square Garden
*  Two nights in a row in an hour
*  In an hour
*  He goes what?
*  I go really I'm gonna take you to kill Tony right now
*  I'm gonna go let's just go to the club
*  Do you have anything to do tonight?
*  He's like no I go great
*  I'm on my way with Tucker Carlson
*  Tony texts me back during the show
*  Show's happening
*  By the way at the beginning of the show
*  Before anything Ashley Judd
*  Wynona
*  Ashley doesn't say
*  Kill Tony she sings?
*  How do I fuck that up?
*  I blame Bud Light for my poor memory
*  Wait Judd Nelson?
*  Bud Light's the best
*  One thing I love about Shane
*  Is he's not a sell out
*  When that guy
*  I've been drinking it all night
*  Anyway Judd
*  Yeah she killed him
*  She goes on stage and sings
*  And the audience goes bananas
*  They go ladies and gentlemen Ashley Judd
*  Wynona Judd
*  45 second round of applause
*  So in the middle of the show
*  The show's already going on
*  I text him I'm coming over with Tucker Carlson
*  He goes jump on stage
*  I go fuck yeah
*  So Tucker doesn't know this
*  So I'm in the backstage right behind the curtain
*  I go this is the crowd
*  You hear him I think he goes this is amazing
*  We're gonna go on stage right now
*  I go I'm gonna bring you up
*  My two favorite people just drop by
*  Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson
*  We go to the curtain
*  Everybody goes nuts
*  It was hilarious
*  Kevin Patterson goes my grandma hates you
*  It was amazing
*  We saw him afterwards he was like I called him a fuck
*  N word
*  It was hilarious
*  Tucker Carlson has some zingers
*  Really?
*  To surprise him with it
*  It's not just like I'm gonna bring you on stage to a comedy show
*  This is a very specific kind of thing
*  By the way Tony you can do lots of stuff
*  Don't just do kill Tony
*  But you can do
*  You just bring him into that environment
*  What the fuck did you just say
*  You give an advice to Tony like I gave advice to you
*  Yes I'm making fun of you
*  I'm giving you good advice you fucking dumbass
*  He likes the zen too there Tucker
*  Yeah he does
*  Interesting
*  But to bring him into that environment no idea
*  No idea
*  And so he just goes on stage
*  The audience goes nuts
*  He sits down he's like this is incredible
*  Yeah
*  Damn
*  He had some zingers
*  Did Lucas come in?
*  David Lucas?
*  No David's out of town unfortunately
*  That would have been perfect
*  But William Montgomery murdered
*  William Montgomery murdered
*  Damn
*  William Montgomery is another dude who's just coming
*  Into his own right now
*  He's coming into his own
*  By the way I saw it day one
*  I saw William day one
*  I remember
*  I remember we were at the Vulcan
*  He would go on
*  He'd sit back stage you guys would be like man you sucked
*  I'd pull him aside and go bro
*  Well that's not real
*  I've known William Montgomery since LA
*  I've known him since LA
*  LA?
*  I never said he sucked
*  I tried to get him to ditch his notes
*  What the fuck was that
*  All I tried to ever do
*  Which he did was ditch the notes
*  That's it
*  William Montgomery he used to go on stage with a notebook
*  Read off the notes
*  You can't do that
*  I remember I was sitting there going dude keep reading the notes
*  It's so funny
*  He's so much better though right?
*  Right now he's better
*  I think he's extremely funny
*  He's funny as fuck dude
*  I remember I was at the Coltoni Houston I think
*  And it was like you just don't know what you're going into
*  It's just like are you really mad?
*  You know who's a fan of his?
*  The Black Keys
*  So I have the Black Keys in the podcast
*  We fucking love William Montgomery
*  You want to see him tonight?
*  So they were coming to the Colombo already
*  By the way never been to see Stand Up
*  Both Dan and Patrick
*  No that's not true
*  Not both no way
*  Patrick 100%
*  And he's the big Stand Up fan
*  They're both Stand Up fans
*  But I don't know if Dan had seen it before
*  But Patrick 100% told me
*  He had never seen live Stand Up
*  Until he came to my club
*  What? Never seen live Stand Up
*  He only watched it on YouTube or on
*  Netflix or whatever
*  So they tell me they're a fan of William
*  So I go William you're going to go up tonight
*  I'm going to have you go up second
*  Because you can't have William go up first
*  Because it's too weird
*  So he goes up second and murders
*  All the greatest hits
*  And they're dying
*  I was in the balcony with the Black Keys
*  While they were dying watching William Montgomery
*  And I set it up
*  It was amazing
*  So what's Tucker doing
*  What does he think after the show
*  He was blown away
*  We went to Mitzi's
*  He doesn't drink right?
*  He's hanging out with a bunch of fucking drunks
*  Got a lot of hugs
*  He hits on his shoulder
*  It's annoying sometimes
*  Do you ever see that guy trying to get Tucker Carlson without realizing it's him
*  He's fishing in Central Park
*  And some guy's like what are you doing here
*  He goes what do you mean
*  How much longer do we have
*  How much time
*  Go whiz bro
*  But he goes what are you doing
*  I'm allowed to fish
*  This podcast is like 6 hours old
*  It always is
*  How many hours are we in Jamie
*  4 hours
*  We could just turn it off and keep going
*  But we'd be doing the same thing
*  We're going to be doing the same thing in an hour in the fucking green room
*  That felt like an hour
*  That's what I'm talking about bitch
*  He's like why are you filming
*  I'm allowed
*  He goes no it's legal to fish here
*  The guy had no idea who he was filming
*  He just started filming a random
*  I thought it was like 5 years ago
*  No I think it was like early 2000
*  Well there's so many narratives
*  You're allowed to fish in any pond in New York obviously
*  Everybody's so mean, everybody's bad
*  It's all narrative
*  It's all just like vibes and bullshit
*  He's not a bad guy man
*  I hung out with the dude
*  He's not a bad guy, I met him a couple of times
*  He's just a guy
*  Went on the road with the dead, followed him around
*  He was a grateful dead head
*  They got the bad idea about all these people
*  He's in the fucking belly of the beast
*  And he recognizes
*  10 years ago
*  He's a fly fishing in Central Park
*  What a fucking dork
*  What a fucking hippie nerd he is
*  And you guys think he's the evil
*  He's a hippie
*  In Central Park
*  He lives in Maine
*  He hunts and fishes in Maine
*  And he lives in Florida sometimes
*  He's a good dude man
*  He's just very odd
*  He's very odd
*  He's the most Canadian American there is
*  No but he's like how you doing sir
*  He's just got that vibe
*  He's from California
*  He's from LA, he's a nice guy man
*  He takes on controversial subjects
*  And becomes a lightning rod for hate
*  If he told me he's ever done mushrooms
*  For sure he's done that
*  If he said he's ever done mushrooms I'd say I don't believe you
*  He did a lot of coke
*  Really?
*  I'm telling you man
*  He's a lightning rod for what?
*  Why did they get a vibe on someone?
*  Because he was on Fox News
*  He was challenging them
*  He goes we shouldn't be at war
*  On Fox News
*  Not in his off time
*  What are we doing in this fucking stand?
*  RFKs against war
*  But the problem is that we all want to classify people as on our tribe or not on our tribe
*  Good or bad
*  Are we in or are we out?
*  It's ideological
*  And as people like us
*  People like you and me and you as well
*  I would consider myself on the left
*  Most of my life
*  Until I was in my late 40s
*  What are you guys doing?
*  This is crazy
*  The plot was supposed to be free speech
*  Open dialogue
*  Communication
*  Acceptance of all people
*  As long as they're not doing something fucked up
*  To destroy other people's lives
*  I think it's just the militant left
*  Is what we're against
*  So it pushes everyone to the right
*  That's where China won
*  That's where China won
*  They empowered that fucking
*  Radical, excitable
*  Insane, schizophrenic
*  Fucking SSRI
*  Adled left
*  The left that was like the most bonkers
*  Of bonkers
*  Shane put your fucking headphones on
*  TikTok got in there
*  My headphones were on the whole time
*  You didn't get any
*  What do you think about this band of TikTok?
*  Get it out of our society
*  It's garbage
*  Get it out of our society and Instagram
*  And Twitter and Facebook
*  Ban it all
*  Listen this is the problem
*  True Jew
*  Because IDF
*  Because they're exposing what's happening
*  In Palestine
*  I'm so drunk I said to Jew
*  I think
*  He's spoken like a true Jew
*  Ban it all
*  Professor
*  I don't even
*  Two Jews are called the Squire brothers
*  I know my rights
*  But no
*  You can't ban anything Ari

*  Listen bitch
*  Stay off Twitter
*  Mark you did one you cow
*  I did four
*  Ari
*  Don't smoke John McAfee's meth
*  Yeah
*  Don't go on TikTok
*  Same thing
*  Obviously don't ban it
*  But not obviously you fuck
*  What you said was ban it
*  Yeah you're a god damn fascist
*  Anytime we get off the phone is better
*  Ban it all
*  Let people stay on the phone
*  If they're so fucking dumb
*  If they get killed by wolves
*  They're the slowest motherfuckers at the end of the line
*  Let them get killed
*  There's wolves motherfuckers
*  There's Chinese TikTok wolves
*  And they're trying to make you trans
*  And they know what the fuck they're doing
*  There are Chinese TikTok wolves trying to make you trans
*  In China they're doing push ups and kung fu
*  And they're fucking people up
*  Get that clip
*  You ever seen Chinese movies
*  I love Chinese movies
*  Chinese movies where they hire
*  Hot shot American actors
*  They're like B level
*  They just have them get the fuck beat out of them
*  They're amazing
*  Frank Will did a couple of those
*  The blurry porn
*  No it's Japanese
*  Oh is that Japanese?
*  Chinese does not blur
*  They don't blur?
*  They break out the minors
*  Bring it on
*  Send me a link
*  As long as they're wiggers
*  But for real
*  When they're 17
*  What are they doing the wiggers
*  Making iPhones? Do you want an iPhone or not?
*  No one cares about the wiggers
*  The Muslims are getting killed as slavery right now
*  You know you can't even buy a fair phone in America
*  I got high the other day
*  And I decided I'm gonna go full eco
*  You can't even do it
*  You can't buy a fair phone in America
*  What's a fair phone?
*  A $700 phone with no slavery
*  It's a phone that is like sustainably sourced
*  $9000
*  No it's not expensive
*  It'd be a couple hundred dollars more
*  You can place the battery
*  It's modular
*  Let's do regular ones
*  Ari you cock sucker
*  We're talking about fair phones
*  You can but you can only buy it if you live in another country
*  That's crazy right?
*  All these liberals here
*  You can't buy a fair phone
*  I don't know what the deal is but in America
*  You can't buy this phone called a fair phone
*  And the fair phone is a phone that's like sustainably sourced
*  They get all their cobalt through ethical mining allegedly
*  I don't know what's real
*  But you can pop off the back
*  Remove the battery
*  You can take every single piece of it
*  It's modular
*  It can be replaced
*  Why don't they have those?
*  They have it in another country
*  It should be readily available here for all the liberals
*  Yeah you're literally tweeting on a phone
*  That's made by slaves
*  Most of the virtual signaling
*  If you get to the
*  Siddharth Kara who wrote this book
*  And he did a lot of investigative journalism on the Congo
*  Talk about cobalt mining
*  Tiny Asian hands
*  You get to the end, no it's Africans
*  If you get to the end of the cobalt
*  Mining it's fucking people pulling out
*  Minerals with rocks
*  Sticks and shit, pulling shit out
*  And they're getting toxic fumes
*  Yeah but Trump's mean sometimes
*  Yeah
*  Give me a beer
*  Yeah which one of you guys is going to vote for Donald Trump?
*  Which one of us isn't?
*  I don't vote
*  I don't vote but I'm in whatever you guys decide as a country
*  I like that RFK
*  You're going to vote for RFK?
*  He seems fun
*  I'm going to vote for Donald Trump
*  So if you had to vote for Trump or Biden who are you voting for?
*  Well I voted for Biden last time
*  What?
*  I did yeah
*  That's so gay
*  I was mad about the comedy stuff
*  That makes it worse
*  You don't think it's going to kick up again?
*  What's that?
*  You just bong another one?
*  You might be my king
*  I'll do that to honor
*  I didn't want to do this but this is just to honor you
*  I didn't want any fanfare
*  I just want to do that for the love of the game
*  I do it a bunch of them secretly for the love of the game
*  It's good to see
*  I honor you with this
*  I'm all for the love of the game
*  Show the honor
*  Can I just say if you vote you're a fucking dork
*  You're a fucking dork
*  I like what you're saying
*  I like a no voting good call
*  I like Elizabeth Warren
*  Ramp up the Patriot Act Ari
*  Let's make it even more hardcore
*  And definitely start your travel podcast
*  That was the first one
*  That was the first one
*  That was the first one
*  I was hoping you didn't see it
*  Ari, definitely start your travel podcast
*  When you can't fucking travel anymore
*  Because you signed up for a ban on TikTok
*  You signed up for centralized digital currency
*  You took the vaccine
*  I'm going to Cuba
*  Everything! Oh great!
*  Communists
*  I want more bananas
*  Go plant bananas you fucking bitch
*  Take a sip of bananas
*  Plantains
*  Plantains, I need fried Cuban food

*  We're already banned on YouTube
*  Will you bong a couple?
*  Can you do some extra curricular
*  Offshore work
*  Is there a cover of America? Fuck yeah we can play
*  We can sing it
*  Dude, I can't believe people think we're dumb
*  Does this suck my ass?
*  Listen, let's be real
*  They're right, if you're right now
*  Doing a lot of string theory work
*  On a yellow legal pad
*  I was before this podcast
*  We're dumb
*  If you get on stage tonight
*  You're dumb
*  If you try to get on stage
*  After fucking Ari Shaffir
*  You're dumb
*  You don't know what you're doing
*  The same thing
*  But you
*  But if you're a string theorist
*  If you're a string theorist
*  And thinks everybody is fucking stupid
*  Because they don't understand your nonsense
*  You write on a chalkboard
*  With squiggly lines and N's and A's
*  Who was that academic guy who said stand up is easy
*  Because you have a captive audience and they're all drinking
*  A democrat said that?
*  Like an academic
*  God damn it, I'm going to find you
*  No, it was an academic
*  It was one of those high level academic names you know
*  Stand up is easy, it's a captive audience
*  And you're all drinking
*  So it's obviously easy
*  I want to bring you to the stand for three shows in a row
*  How about bringing you to the mothership and going after Shane
*  Good luck fuckface
*  Good luck fuckface
*  Gang, gang
*  Who was that?
*  But everyone's stupid
*  If you don't know
*  One of those kind of guys
*  They're all silly
*  Jamie, you've got to find this for me
*  Malcolm is a sweet guy
*  I've seen him on the podcast, I can kill him
*  In a small room
*  In a minimal amount of time
*  Is he the British gay guy?
*  Malcolm would eat hot dog shit
*  If he went after Shane
*  If he went after
*  Brian Simpson who's got a new
*  Netflix special
*  Right now, live at the mothership
*  Available right now, go on after Brian Simpson
*  Malcolm Gladwell or stop talking shit
*  Oh
*  Wait, that's him?
*  This is cutting end to the stand up
*  Dude, I'm uncomfortable that I remembered this
*  I'm sure
*  I'm sure he said this
*  In jest, in good faith
*  No
*  I think he said, well I don't know
*  You're right, you're right, maybe I'm going to get caught up in the headlines
*  Had Malcolm on the podcast, he's a good guy
*  Doesn't mean he doesn't stand up
*  He's dealing with people in a
*  tightly controlled setting
*  Then came Jeffries
*  With a rich set of expectations
*  Governing their behavior
*  This one's making fun of us
*  Don't deal with alcohol
*  And create an expectation that
*  Laughter is the appropriate response to what they're doing
*  I cannot imagine a better set of
*  Circumstances, an easier set of
*  Circumstances for navigating
*  A sort of situation than those
*  Yeah, that's one of the best
*  That's one of the best
*  Bro
*  In 1989
*  In 1989
*  Greg Fitzsimmons got attacked on stage
*  At Stitch's Comedy Club in Boston
*  In 89
*  This guy jumps on stage
*  Fitzsimmons and him get into a fucking Donnybrook
*  They're fucking brawling
*  In the middle of this comedy club in 1989
*  In Boston
*  The security guards jump on stage
*  They tackle this guy, Fitzsimmons this guy
*  And they're freaking it out
*  Fitzsimmons, the guy goes into the audience
*  They arrest him, they take him out of there
*  Fitzsimmons goes, anybody else want some of this?
*  Fuck it
*  Right away
*  He's got a fucking bloody lip
*  And he finishes his set
*  Respect
*  Imagine being an audience member
*  And going, here's some short pale guy
*  I could take him and you're like, you chose
*  Greg Fitzsimmons
*  You idiot, all he does is fight
*  He fights people that get him in trouble socially
*  He's an Irish guy
*  He's an Irish
*  I've been friends with Greg, Greg and I started out
*  One week apart from each other
*  Great egg
*  He's a fucking awesome human being
*  He's awesome
*  This is like 89
*  Before Greg was Greg
*  Before he was Emmy award winner
*  All that bullshit
*  He's still the same dude
*  He still goes hard
*  He still goes hard
*  I try to get him to move here
*  He's got a life
*  What does that mean?
*  I had a life too
*  He has a golf course right next to him
*  Shut the fuck up, there's golf courses out here
*  That aren't filled with liberals
*  Give one to Mark
*  Mark's over there
*  I got my whiskey here
*  You still have the same one
*  You gotta eagle his hair
*  He takes that must whiskey and pours water into it
*  Mark has the pour water in it
*  But you guys haven't had any whiskey
*  Hold on, can I say this?
*  I have a lot
*  I saw Joe drink three different glasses
*  Joe saw me drink five
*  There's no way I'm driving
*  to anywhere tonight
*  I have to go on to the end of all you fucking imbeciles
*  Can I say this?
*  Joe's got to go to the improv tonight
*  And I took mushrooms
*  This is the 11th time
*  Joe, give me one second
*  I will let Adam Carolla keep the number one podcast in the world
*  Get his book of world
*  They have a comedy festival in town
*  And Joe is doing his own festival
*  Three days in a row
*  At his club
*  It's a flex
*  Hold on
*  It's a flex
*  Let me get one timeout
*  Jihad
*  Shut up
*  This is the 11th one
*  So far, we've all died
*  The one person
*  Who has always never died
*  What do you mean died?
*  No, listen, we've got to keep him right where he is
*  Joe died
*  We've all died
*  We all need our certain place
*  But listen
*  We need our certain place in the world
*  Leave him alone

*  How's babies barf?
*  Ari's a big expert
*  We never show you barfing like a baby?
*  How's babies barf?
*  You got a baby barf
*  How much do you think it would cost
*  to get someone to drink
*  a fucking whiskey bottle
*  filled with your piss?
*  A bottle, not a whiskey shot
*  If you had that dude from Opie and Anthony
*  Baby Bird
*  No, the dude
*  No, no, no
*  Pat Duffy
*  The Baby Bird
*  Pat from Munaki
*  They drink god
*  Pat from Munaki is the guy who

*  Imagine, how much money would you have
*  dick into your Patreon
*  account
*  Well you gotta hand it to Ari cause you're old
*  and you're hanging in there
*  You could have retired by now
*  I'm ten years older than him
*  I know, but he's a
*  He's going well
*  His career's been a goddamn train wreck
*  I have $87 for a big job
*  I became like
*  And you work out currently
*  regularly
*  He's a mess
*  Chopped cheese all day for a fucking week
*  But Ari's capable of firing up
*  He and him went out to the bar last night
*  When we had that
*  Sober October Fitness Challenge
*  He was the only guy I worried about
*  Really?
*  Cause he's a psycho
*  Also I will do the thing where I'm like
*  Guys, guys, let's not try
*  Secretly I'll try until they discover
*  You know what I almost did?
*  But I had inquiries out
*  Getting Michelle Wolf to wear my strap
*  I know
*  When you said that
*  We wanted everyone
*  And Michelle to regret it was like
*  100% I'll be quiet forever for that
*  But when you said that I was like
*  Michelle's gonna die
*  I'm gonna take Michelle to hell
*  That's how deep you go
*  I'm gonna take everybody to hell
*  Michelle rules
*  I'll take you all to hell
*  It's just that one fucking hunting trip
*  Where you worked out for 18 hours a day
*  For 4 straight days
*  No, it was the one day that I watched John Wick
*  50 times in a row
*  And I literally did 7 hours of cardio
*  On an elliptical and set off my fire alarm
*  I set off my fire alarm
*  With my body steam
*  Can I say what a motivator
*  Spite is that no one's taking advantage of?
*  Spite as a motivator
*  To hurt your friends
*  To work out, to read, to whatever
*  It's so there
*  It wasn't even that
*  You wanted to beat Bert
*  No, you think that was what it was
*  But it was like I was feeding that wolf
*  He is
*  He is athletic
*  He's athletic if you look at like division 3
*  Yeah, he's athletic
*  Gauntlet throne
*  I was like letting the wolf out of the cage
*  Now what does the wife think?
*  She didn't like it
*  She wasn't going to say
*  She didn't want me to do it next year
*  I met Rogan's boyfriend
*  He's not happy when Rogan gets in the cage
*  It's not when I get in the cage
*  It's like unlock it
*  That was the problem
*  You're like the Hulk, I'm always this
*  The problem is I was like oh I forgot this was in there
*  And then we were doing that
*  Fitness thing
*  I was like I'm going to kill everybody
*  Because everyone would think it would be GSP who unlocks it
*  Let's kickbox together
*  Who is this shit alcoholic who fucking gets you the wildest
*  Well he was just saying he was going to win
*  I'm like I'm going to kill you
*  You're going to die
*  I'm going to drag you
*  To like where I'm about to die
*  And you're not going to live
*  I'm going to make it
*  Let's see what you can do
*  If you can get close I'm going to go further
*  I'm like I'm going to leave in a little
*  Dude you're a freak
*  Electrolyze all tables
*  I was eating nothing but rib eyes
*  We need to protect our parks challenge
*  Or we just drink
*  We just like don't care and eat burgers
*  That's way healthier
*  I don't like that part of me
*  Really?
*  I don't like it
*  I cannot lose
*  It's not a competitive thing, it's murderous
*  It's way different than competitive
*  It's Joe's idea
*  It goes way further
*  It's basically like bombing Gaza
*  You will not win this
*  I was saying to a friend of mine today
*  What Israel is doing in Gaza
*  Is like what a 5th grader
*  Would do if he said
*  If you were the president of the world
*  How would you stop all wars
*  So many fuck me
*  I'll fuck you up
*  50,000 times more
*  I'm going to bomb hospitals
*  Nurseries
*  Mosques
*  Why are they bombing Gaza?
*  I don't give a fuck
*  I don't vote
*  You're not going to get caught in this
*  I don't think you are
*  I agree
*  I pay my size America
*  I'm not over there
*  The reason why there's human beings still
*  In 2024
*  Is because somewhere along the line
*  Someone decided that the only way to do this
*  Is to go full
*  Bhagavad Gita
*  I am become death destroyer of worlds
*  I will drop nuclear
*  Bombs
*  That's what fucking Oppenheimer said
*  I will drop nuclear bombs
*  I will show you
*  What I'm capable of
*  America

*  Look at the mask wearers
*  Well we all knew that the trans community was going to
*  Butt up against the lady boy community
*  It's a different thing
*  It's a different thing
*  Lady boys and trans are not the same thing
*  They're similar
*  Unfortunately when I was in Thailand I was with my whole family
*  Oh I would have paid a visit to those boys
*  I would have given them the business
*  I could look watch a little kickboxing
*  Keep moving
*  Fish eat eating your fucking calces off your feet

*  How about we just do it Ari Shafir Sees the World
*  100%
*  Let's do it
*  Now
*  Just trust me
*  I got good instincts
*  Joe has
*  If you were going to trust anyone when it comes to
*  Maybe a podcast being successful
*  Joe Rogan is a decent
*  Joe what if they run podcasts you've done this
*  I've got good instincts
*  Ari Shafir gave me by the way the worst advice I've ever had
*  Other than my wife
*  Other than my wife
*  One time my wife
*  My kids were going to Disneyland
*  My wife was like you don't have to do a podcast
*  I'm like but I do I have to
*  Thank God you didn't listen to me
*  I was like I have to
*  I told people I was going to do it
*  But Ari was like you got to edit that
*  Got to be under an hour
*  It makes no sense
*  Who would listen more than an hour
*  Joe you're retarded
*  It's stupid
*  But this is what I said
*  You have to listen
*  The most important thing is just do whatever the fuck you want to do
*  Joe I had not considered that
*  And now the people listening to this show
*  Have made it this far
*  Now they've
*  A new stratosphere
*  Of us being
*  Ari Shafir
*  Sees the world
*  What is this drummer
*  It's a cover
*  Jamie just consulted with a lawyer
*  Jamie
*  Jamie you just ruined our show
*  It's a cover
*  It doesn't matter it's so good
*  This guy's mustache rules
*  Hey Shane how come McAfee wouldn't do your fucking thing
*  How can he be bitched out about it
*  He didn't want to win the Super Bowl anyway
*  No no no don't ever talk about McAfee that way
*  This fucking McAfee guy
*  Bitched out one dude's chance
*  Everyone else did it
*  That guy who didn't win the Super Bowl didn't do it
*  McAfee got too fired up
*  When he was scoring a touchdown
*  He was genuinely he wasn't thinking about anything
*  That's fair I accept that
*  He got too fired up
*  I accept that
*  All the other bros when they scored
*  They're fired up
*  McAfee's just a white running back dude
*  That's a different type of man
*  If you're a white running back
*  And you score any touchdown ever in the NFL
*  You're like
*  That was wild
*  This guy's good
*  McAfee's on another level
*  I don't know what's going on
*  Joe imagine a football player version of someone
*  Hitting like eight rails and then pocketing
*  Christian McAfee is a white NFL
*  Running back
*  He shouldn't be there
*  He's a white NFL running back
*  It's a position that white guys are incapable of playing
*  What's the problem
*  Generally guys like Christian McAfee
*  Are GMs
*  And he's a running back
*  What does that mean
*  The problem is
*  The initial thing the problem is
*  Normally if I'm friends with a guy in the NFL
*  Like a superstar
*  Sexual icon like Gabriel Davis
*  When he scores a touchdown
*  Watch this
*  This is Shane on MSSP
*  Buffalo Bills
*  Gabe versus Miami
*  Shane's been promoting this
*  Special needs kid
*  I was at that one
*  That was the one he gave me his jersey
*  I looked like a retarded guy in the crowd
*  So Shane's promoting this kid
*  This kid right there
*  Back up, this kid
*  Who's this kid
*  I just keep sending Gabe that celebration
*  I'm like Gabe just hit that one
*  He's a weird fat Irish kid
*  Watch, Gabriel
*  That's a hot kid
*  The NFL, the number one to two sports in the world
*  Gabriel hit it
*  In the world
*  What's number one
*  UFC and then this
*  Football
*  Number two or three
*  Formula one is pretty high
*  Top five
*  This is why I say top 20
*  Top ten no matter what sports in the world
*  Cricket's like a billion
*  Soccer's up there
*  Soccer, cricket
*  F1, UFC
*  Football
*  Top ten no matter what
*  Cricket because of Indian
*  People
*  Very popular
*  They drop loads
*  Soccer and cricket
*  Soccer's number one
*  Number one by far
*  China and India don't play soccer
*  Soccer does play soccer, they just don't make the World Cup
*  They do and they pour out and they watch
*  World Cup all day and all night at the fucking
*  Bars, China number one
*  You would go to China, you nasty communist
*  I love it, still available, as long as you're not dissident
*  Head over to China
*  What about the Uyghurs
*  I'm going Dom Lemon on you
*  See the Uyghurs, absolutely
*  Now that we're drinking a little
*  Elon Musk fucking dominated
*  He rules
*  He rules
*  He fucked Dom Lemon up
*  Also he didn't have a contract sign yet
*  Who didn't have a contract sign
*  He had a super truck too
*  Yeah I was going to give him a truck
*  You know what Musk is like, you guys don't understand
*  He doesn't really care
*  Also
*  What Elon said was so apt
*  He said Dom Lemon
*  Was doing CNN off CNN
*  You don't have to do that
*  You're on the internet, have a fucking conversation
*  With a dude, don't just
*  Berate him with questions
*  Allow him to express himself
*  Let's talk
*  Have you thought about
*  The difference between free speech
*  And hate speech
*  Where is the line
*  Do you think about the line, do you think it's more important
*  That people decide what the line is
*  Right
*  He's saying that to him, and Dom Lemon's like
*  I just thought I was going to get you
*  But Dom Lemon never asked it that way
*  He doesn't know what the fuck he's doing
*  It's hilarious, Dom Lemon is talking about
*  Oh it's been so hard for me
*  And Elon said you're
*  Extremely successful
*  He's like yeah, but that was
*  You know
*  Accidentally, against all odds
*  No, it's not against all odds
*  It's because of the current climate
*  That's why you were
*  Successful
*  You're not good at what you do
*  Become great
*  Yeah exactly, and what did he say
*  Become great
*  So what happened?
*  So what happened?
*  Oh
*  Oh yeah
*  What were we talking about?
*  I don't know what we were talking about, but Shane said
*  Beautiful elixir
*  Beautiful elixir of
*  Domination
*  Put on your wooden beads
*  And pray
*  To Mother God
*  Look at that, your girlfriend's hideous
*  Three, two, one, mark, go
*  One, two, one, go
*  One, two, one, ha dum

*  Roserils
*  No one asks who
*  Who are these people
*  What kind of loser
*  What do they love
*  Who are these people
*  And what do they love
*  And what do they care about?
*  And what do they care about?
*  Finish that dude, you didn't even finish it.
*  Mark, you didn't finish it?
*  Mark.
*  Finish that thing.
*  I can't even find time.
*  Oh god.
*  Didgeridoo.
*  Finish that, finish that. Hurry up.
*  Didgeridoo.
*  Didgeridoo sound.
*  Didgeridoo sound.
*  Yesterday.
*  Mark, sometimes you break my heart and it makes me so dang gum sad.
*  Dang gum back to forward gum.
*  I don't want to break the mood down.
*  This is the last beer.
*  Thank god.
*  Another case, this is the last beer.
*  We for sure have more cases.
*  Hey, can I say something?
*  A memory of scraping together $3 each to get a case of beer and everybody drinking it.
*  Back in the day.
*  This is fucking ruled.
*  $20, that'll do. Let's go.
*  You didn't know whether or not you were going to be able to get drunk.
*  You didn't understand what the world was.
*  You didn't understand what all these expectations meant.
*  And all these people that were telling you what to do and what not to do, they were wrong.
*  Not only were they wrong, they were trying to impart their control on you to try to justify their own existence.
*  Man, you remember how fun it was to get drunk when you were a kid?
*  I don't know if we're allowed to say that on here.
*  I remember puking in a cab when I was 15.
*  It's one of my favorite moments. Me and my boys, we would go to Ocean City, Maryland every year.
*  Let's go.
*  I love talking about this, but I gotta pee.
*  O.C.
*  Grab a case while you're out there.
*  And a couple of Ruskies, will ya?
*  Get us a case, bro.
*  Do us a helpin'.
*  O.C., bro. No one understands Delmarva Connection.
*  The Philly Delmarva Connection.
*  Ocean City, Maryland.
*  A 24 pack of Natty Ice was $11.
*  Praise Allah.
*  What'd you do there in Ocean City at the boardwalk?
*  We used to sit on a tree trunk and drink them.
*  It's the best.
*  When you're young, getting fucking hammered, there's nothing better.
*  Now, I don't want anybody under the age of 21 to drink.
*  Don't. But just know that when we drank under 21, it did rule.
*  No one carded.
*  Well, you guys shouldn't do it.
*  When we did it, it ruled.
*  I did not do it. I waited until I was 21 to enjoy Bud Light responsibly.
*  And I've always enjoyed it responsibly.
*  Corporate shame.
*  But I'll tell you what, if I had a daydream, if I imagined what it would be like if I was 15 and shotgunned beers in Ocean City, Maryland.
*  Yeah.
*  God damn.
*  O.C. Rehoboth. Dewey. Scrooey.
*  You go to head over to Scrooey Beach?
*  Delaware?
*  Be-ho-mo.
*  God gave us these beaches.
*  God gave us these.
*  What's the pizza place down there?
*  Grottoes.
*  I get pizza dude!
*  Oh shit.
*  We gotta get a fresh slice of Grottoes.
*  Yes, dude. You got a fresh slice.
*  I got molested at Grottoes.
*  You go say, hey, what's the plan tonight?
*  I'm gonna see Love Jump.
*  Dude, you know what I saw there?
*  Scorpion King. I saw that movie with The Rock.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Me and Jared Dupes. Yo, shout out Jared Dupes. Let's get it.
*  Grottoes pizza.
*  I'm going to Ocean City, Maryland.
*  Oh, Grottoes! I've been to that one.
*  I got fucked in the ass in that bar.
*  Dude, nobody reps the Maryland flag.
*  Maryland flag might be the tightest
*  United States flag.
*  Nobody rocks it. Full hat.
*  All Maryland flag.
*  I want a ski outfit all Maryland flag.
*  That got you?
*  Here, do this one.
*  Give it away for me.
*  Why are you a coward, dude? You'll die.
*  That's why no one will remember your name.
*  Oh, I got the hiccups.
*  America, America, America,
*  America, fuck yeah,
*  we're saving the day, motherfucking me, huh?
*  That dog should be taken away.
*  SBCA, get in here.
*  Rogues is good.
*  Same Rogues.
*  Same Rogues.
*  Now we're drinking a little.
*  I'm going to tell you this.
*  Wait, what happened to the beer?
*  You might be the best, dude.
*  You are the best, dude.
*  Don't fucking, don't make me regret it.
*  Don't make, yeah.
*  Nobody supports stand up like Rogues.
*  I don't know.
*  Paulie Shore is pretty good.
*  Who?
*  Paulie Shore.
*  Nobody supports all stand up like Rogues.
*  Rogues, Rogues, you're the goddamn bro.
*  Who saw that coming?
*  Who saw that coming?
*  Some fucking meathead fucking workout guy
*  supporting stand up more than anybody in the world.
*  Nobody does.
*  Make me normalize, having open mic'ers on,
*  having going, hey, sorry Oliver Stone,
*  I got an open mic'er on, I got to push.
*  I got a Jewish freak who fucks his dog,
*  I got to bring him along.
*  Why did you do this dog this way?
*  Let that dog go.
*  He doesn't fuck his dog, he just loves it.
*  I love it.
*  Yeah, but he loves it too much for a man.
*  Yeah, let it run wild.
*  She's been running wild.
*  Alright, that tail will say different.
*  Curled up tails, sign of anger.
*  Put the dog down, bro.
*  Let it go.
*  Let it go.
*  Don't get the fucking...
*  Shane Gillis from SNL doesn't want me to love you.
*  Shane Gillis from SNL.
*  Blame Lorne Michaels for my lack of affection right now.
*  Blame Lorne Michaels for my lack of affection right now.
*  Sorry buddy.
*  How was Lorne on the SNL night?
*  He was a beast, dude.
*  Was he cool? Was he like, we made it?
*  He was awesome.
*  Me and Sal went, it was a fun night. Me and Sal and Becky.
*  It was so cool, it was so fun.
*  Literally, I called
*  every favor I had to get into the showroom.
*  I was trying so hard.
*  Me and Sal Volcano
*  Volcano came up empty.
*  What do you mean?
*  Called in every favor we got.
*  He called, uh, Collin, Jost.
*  I can't do it.
*  Literally every comic.
*  Every New York comic was like, I want to be there.
*  Kyle was there, Christine was there.
*  I got mine.
*  I said, hey, I'm going to call your manager.
*  He goes, yeah, yeah, just follow up, make sure.
*  Obviously coming to the showroom, she said, can't help you.
*  I said to Becky,
*  I said, make sure Ari's in there.
*  There you go.
*  You weren't in there, you dumbass.
*  In the showroom watching a fucking telecast
*  in a green room with a bunch of fucking dorks.
*  Shane, you made me be a dork.
*  How dare you be nasty like this?
*  Joseph, where are you going?
*  He's going to get more beers. He's going to get more beers!
*  He's got a shit.
*  Anyway, you being there meant,
*  I want you to know, it meant literally nothing to me.
*  I was so pissed you were there.
*  But DeRosa was there, right?
*  DeRosa did not make it.
*  He came to the after party.
*  I told Shane, get DeRosa here.
*  Shane just goes, he's taking pictures on the outside of the after party.
*  He goes, let DeRosa in?
*  What do you want me to do?
*  There's paparazzi.
*  I was like, ugh.
*  Dude, it ruled so hard.
*  We got a picture of us.
*  My niece was pumped that Sal was there.
*  My niece got there and was like,
*  Impractical Jokers is the best show.
*  What was the date?
*  February 24th.
*  Fuck me.
*  Dude, it was fun.
*  The fact that we were happy to be there too.
*  Welcome to the party for once, bro.
*  Wow. A whiskey.
*  You had fucking two whiskeys.
*  Shut up.
*  We rated 21 Savage's dressing room.
*  Seven decks of cards.
*  And a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
*  By the way, no one deserves more credit than 21.
*  That's the bro.
*  What was so impressive about him?
*  That's a sick picture.
*  21...
*  Me, Shane, and Sal in front of it.
*  And Shane just automatically going to cover his nuts.
*  Rightfully so.
*  I was wrong to not do it.
*  To not just fucking dick punch him.
*  No, 21 was like...
*  21 was like...
*  He's 21.
*  The whole time he's like,
*  Yeah, what's up man?
*  Hey, hey.
*  But my niece really wanted a picture with 21.
*  And he was already leaving.
*  He was out of the room.
*  And I was like,
*  Could 21 come back and take a picture with my niece?
*  And he said yes.
*  That's crazy.
*  He came back in.
*  It was wild.
*  21's dressing room.
*  That's funny.
*  Let's have a few more.
*  Guys, another five hours.
*  We can keep going. It's only seven.
*  Show starts right now.
*  The show at the mothership starts right now.
*  I got the fucking hiccups.
*  Do you have a show right now?
*  Allegedly.
*  How does it feel to be a club owner?
*  It's interesting.
*  Some goods and some bad.
*  Some good shots.
*  JMo, how do you feel about that?
*  That's terrible, dude.
*  Shut up. I got most of it.
*  Pros, you got a secret weapon.
*  You can do an hour every night.
*  Cons, you gotta deal with the bullshit.
*  Everything...
*  Everything...
*  Not legally? For real?
*  Bud Light, let it go.
*  We're good.
*  That's all I had left.
*  Everything on earth comes with pros and cons.
*  Why'd you dump all these?
*  Everything that exists comes with pros and cons.
*  The pros outweigh the cons.
*  Open a comedy club.
*  If you have the money, do it.
*  If you can do it, if you're me, do it.
*  That's how I feel.
*  If anybody's gonna do it, I gotta do it.
*  It's like the obligation.
*  You get put in this weird spot where you have
*  resources that most people never have.
*  You have to do it, if you care.
*  If you really wanna fucking...
*  If you really give a fuck about what you're talking about,
*  you gotta do it.
*  Everything's great.
*  The fucking setup is great.
*  The way it was established is great.
*  The fact that it's stress-free, relatively, is great.
*  The fact that comics have embraced it.
*  Shane's moved here.
*  You two bitches.
*  Brought all the Philadelphia dogs down.
*  Gardog.
*  O'Connor dog.
*  Road dog.
*  O'Connor pope.
*  Why are you playing around with these other places?
*  We should get a condo.
*  Let's fucking live here.
*  Mark, let's share it.
*  Don't wait.
*  Don't wait till it's too bad.
*  Get your own spot.
*  Don't wait till the housing crisis happens here in Austin.
*  Don't wait till the housing crisis happens here in Austin.
*  Let that collapse.
*  It's already happened.
*  It's already happened.
*  Wait till McKeever gets down here.
*  All the bros are down here.
*  Everyone's down here already.
*  The fucking group we have right now
*  is insane.
*  From Kill Tony
*  to all the people that came from Kill Tony.
*  It is cool when you go like
*  hey I'm here on a weekend.
*  Who can feature?
*  McCusker,
*  Paziski, Rogan,
*  Segura,
*  Cristina,
*  Dunk.
*  Come down and open for me.
*  Everybody.
*  It's what we wanted.
*  We're only a year in.
*  We're only a year in.
*  No, no, no.
*  Norman, one more.
*  I'm still Burbank.
*  One year doing stand up comedy the right way.
*  Holding the line.
*  Great job.
*  Just fucking funny.
*  Everybody what the line is.
*  It's not just holding the line.
*  It's like paying people the right way.
*  This is one thing I'm proud of.
*  It's Small Room.
*  I did the first set ever.
*  In Little Boy.
*  You did. Yes you did.
*  100%.
*  I'll tell you what.
*  Boy oh boy.
*  Did I bomb.
*  Not true.
*  I bombed.
*  I'm humble Shane.
*  Joe introduced it.
*  Joe was on the mic like hey everybody.
*  He introduced the show.
*  I got on stage.
*  Everybody in the show was just
*  Chappelle's.
*  No, no, no, no, no.
*  I fucking suck.
*  All this is inaccurate.
*  Shut the fuck up.
*  First of all.
*  Literally no one knew
*  what the show was going to be.
*  I said special
*  intimate show.
*  11.30pm in the little room.
*  Sells out immediately.
*  Shane Gillis goes on stage.
*  Does 15 minutes.
*  They have no idea Dave's going up.
*  He killed. He's so full of shit.
*  What was that?
*  The first guy ever on stage.
*  Professionally in that room. Shane.
*  Second guy Chappelle.
*  I brought him on.
*  Just to say hi.
*  You coward. I saw that.
*  No, no, no.
*  That's his.
*  No, no. He's right.
*  Shane's right.
*  J's right.
*  Mark didn't do it.
*  I'm going to piss.
*  You can piss on him later.
*  Norman.
*  Norman. You coward.
*  You'll never live this down.
*  Internet attack.
*  Internet destroy him.
*  He yelled free Palestine in the hallway.
*  Did you guys hear that?
*  No, but I support it.
*  It supports it regardless.
*  Free Palestine.
*  Oh, oh.
*  I will say it's hard.
*  It's hard to analyze any Shane Gillis story.
*  Because his rise is so fucking quick.
*  Three months later you're like,
*  it was a different time.
*  He was slightly worse.
*  He was slightly lower than he is now.
*  No, no.
*  That one was, I would do that today.
*  No problem.
*  What? First show at the Little One.
*  Oh yeah, it was amazing.
*  That was an honor.
*  And then Chappelle goes on stage after.
*  They have no idea Chappelle's going up.
*  Wow.
*  So I just say, all I said on Twitter, intimate show.
*  That's it.
*  So Shane goes up and then Chappelle goes up.
*  And it's insane.
*  It's insane.
*  You got to see it from my perspective.
*  I'm the DJ, Mike.
*  Which is crazy.
*  Just having Joe Rogan be like, hey everybody.
*  Coming up.
*  I said welcome to the first ever show.
*  In the small room.
*  Little boy at the Comedy Mother Show.
*  What's up?
*  How's everybody doing?
*  You guys ready to do this?
*  Ladies and gentlemen, one of our favorite comedians.
*  Shane Gillis.
*  Some guy you haven't heard of.
*  I had to get down and go,
*  My bad.
*  So this is one year ago.
*  That's how much your world has changed in one year.
*  It's so crazy.
*  The rise is so nonstop that you can't analyze it.
*  Any story that happens a week after it happens.
*  It doesn't mean the same thing.
*  Dude, you've gone off so fast.
*  I would do that tonight.
*  What?
*  That show.
*  You might have to.
*  We're about to go.
*  Here's the one thing.
*  Norman never gets wrecked on this.
*  He's wrecked.
*  No.
*  He's wrecked for Norman.
*  I know.
*  I don't think he is though.
*  I've seen him wrecked.
*  All three of us have been destroyed on Protect Our Parks.
*  But he knows he's got to come with the quips.
*  When were you destroyed though?
*  You can only go.
*  When was I destroyed?
*  Yeah.
*  Right now.
*  I legitimately know.
*  You've been more.
*  When were you destroyed though?
*  When were you drunk more?
*  He's been destroyed.
*  706.
*  We have to end this.
*  Norman bong one and then we'll end.
*  I yacked.
*  Norman bonged you?
*  The best way to fix that is
*  freedom bong.
*  Bong that and we'll end it.
*  America.
*  Please bong that and we'll end it.
*  God damn he's going to pee again.
*  Don't be a communist.
*  Norman.
*  What are you doing?
*  Don't get his dick on camera.
*  America.
*  Wait what'd I miss?
*  You didn't miss anything Mark.
*  Norman's got self protection in his sinks.
*  What about the whiskey?
*  He's had two.
*  Shut up.
*  I like how he distorts things.
*  What'd I miss?
*  This guy's pulling his dick out.
*  It's filling whiskey bottles.
*  That's a full bottle of piss.
*  He's not even halfway done.
*  Before we end it.
*  Norman please bong that.
*  Alright well.
*  We should have a
*  party.
*  Some words of wisdom.
*  Thank you Joe.
*  Gentlemen.
*  We are
*  retarded.
*  We are here.
*  We are here for comedy.
*  We are here for comedy.
*  We hold the line.
*  We hold the line.
*  We hold the line right here.
*  All that free speech shit.
*  This is Scotland.
*  Come on Scotland.
*  Step up like the JRE.
*  I'm learning.
*  Under.
*  He's got what's got.
*  We hold the line.
*  Scotland.
*  Scotland.
*  Underneath that.
*  Teach me.
*  We hold the line.
*  And now over.
*  Good luck.
*  Good luck.
*  He's doing everything he can to not bong that beer.
*  Oh good boy.
*  Good boy.
*  Bong the beer.
*  Oh man.
*  Give me a briskey.
*  He did throw up.
*  He's the first of us to throw up.
*  Today.
*  This is the first time he ever.
*  Shout out to Lone Star.
*  As Shane.
*  Lone Star.
*  America.
*  America.
*  America.
*  Chug that boy.
*  Do it for the troops.
*  This is it.
*  Do it for the troops.
*  Do you hate the troops?
*  Norman.
*  Did you just take asthma medication?
*  Oh my god.
*  America.
*  Three. Two. One.
*  Fuck yeah.
*  Go. Go. Go. Go.
*  Go. Go. Go.
*  Go. Go. Go.
*  Go. Go. Go.
*  You gotta finish it.
*  This is wild.
*  Ladies and gentlemen, Protect Our Parks 11.
*  That was definitely a good one.
*  14.
*  It might be 80.
*  Time is relative.
*  Oh man. We started this at 2.30.
*  It's in the books.
*  Holy shit.
*  The show's already started.
*  Alright let's go.
*  Darren Croson's on stage right now.
*  Goodnight America.
*  The rest of the world that wished they were America.
*  Goodnight.
*  Uplift.
*  China.
*  China.
*  Russia.
*  Kuif.
*  I said China and Russia. You can be us.
*  All of us.
*  Together.
*  One world. United.
*  United.
