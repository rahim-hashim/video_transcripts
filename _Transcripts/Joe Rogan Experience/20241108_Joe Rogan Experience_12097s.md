# Joe Rogan Experience #2226 - Theo Von
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [November 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfSjQyFd7aU)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day!
*  These are like conversation condoms, aren't they?
*  Yeah, a little bit. Well, it's like a safe room. It locks out the world.
*  Yeah.
*  Conversation only exists inside your ears, you know? Locks you in. I think it locks you in. That's what I like about it.
*  Yeah, it's almost like a football player kind of putting on their helmet.
*  Right. Ready to go. Ready to go.
*  Like, we're ready for this, yeah.
*  Yo, how fun was election night at the mothership?
*  It was baffling, man. I mean, I'll tell you, it was crazy.
*  That was so much fun. We had such a good time. That green room was so positive.
*  My favorite part, at one point they were playing that song, you talk about a revolution.
*  People were dancing, people were smoking weed. There was a baby, I think there was a baby smoking weed.
*  There was everybody, it was like people were like, it was crazy, dude.
*  Adam and Eve were in there. There was just a lot going on.
*  It felt like America's brighter. That's what it felt like.
*  We were moving towards this insane world where we're being controlled by liars.
*  We're just being gas lit left and right. We saw it all over the media.
*  We saw it all over the news. Things that were right in front of your face, they're trying to deny.
*  There's just so much craziness. And then all of a sudden, the world spoke.
*  Did you see the map of the actual country? Like how many places actually voted red?
*  Oh, no. I don't know if I saw that or not.
*  It's just a few cities. Even California was mostly red. That's what's crazy.
*  We had, I don't know if I saw that. I'm trying to think of what I saw.
*  There's a, there's a new...
*  Oh, Tony was nervous, remember?
*  Tony better be fucking nervous.
*  Dude, I kept just going up to him and going, feliz navidad.
*  To fucking get his vibes.
*  Look at that. Oh, wow.
*  This is the one I saw Jamie also in this, do you?
*  It's got music to it.
*  This is like when I got that hair surgery.
*  I'm talking about they played music in the background.
*  No, but it looks like that pattern.
*  Let me see that again.
*  Yeah, it looks a lot like that, like a transplant.
*  Yeah, my micrographs.
*  Yeah, that's what it looks like, man.
*  So what I sent you, Jamie, it just shows like the entire country.
*  That's right.
*  Look at that.
*  That's interesting.
*  That's crazy.
*  There's no blue states, just blue cities.
*  Well, then why do you think that the, why do you think the cities and states are so much different then?
*  Well, cities are always going to be blue.
*  It's normal.
*  There's a lot of factors.
*  One of them is you have massive populations of people, right?
*  And you, when you have massive populations of people, a lot of times it's based around universities.
*  Like Los Angeles is slightly different because Los Angeles has universities, but really it's like more around Hollywood, which is equally delusional.
*  But most big cities are flavored by a university.
*  Like Austin is flavored by the University of Texas.
*  Yeah.
*  It's why Austin is progressive.
*  Austin is, for people that don't know outside of Texas, Austin is one of the most progressive cities.
*  Like if you look at, we voted in Austin, the city of Austin, voted more for Kamala Harris than the city of Los Angeles did.
*  Oh, wow. Really?
*  A higher percentage of Democrats voted for Kamala Harris than even Los Angeles.
*  Well, I think a lot, it seems like a lot, like a lot of Democrats, I don't know like a ton about politics, but it seems like a lot of Democrats, like it's,
*  I understand a lot of the voting because it's hopeful voting. It's like wishful thinking.
*  Well, they're feeding off of narratives. Like you're a good person if you believe this.
*  But the consequences are what they're ignoring. The pretending that the economy is in a great place.
*  That's crazy. Talk to anybody who's broke. Talk to anybody who's struggling to pay for bills and groceries.
*  Talk to anybody who's trying to buy a car. The economy is bananas right now. It's sketchy, very sketchy.
*  And a lot of it is- People are robbing each other on Facebook Marketplace.
*  A lot of his recovering from COVID, I'm sure. I mean there's probably a lot of blowback from that.
*  I mean they shut the whole fucking country down, which is just so nuts.
*  That was insane, man. I think that's one of the like, but yeah, I mean yeah, people are robbing each other on Facebook Marketplace.
*  My buddy was going to buy a couple walkie-talkies off a guy, right? Gets fucking mugged, right?
*  Really? Yeah. He's going to buy a couple of-
*  So he meets the guy to go get the walkie-talkies and the guy mugs him?
*  That's like the seventh story I've heard, but it's like, you know, people are doing crime, you know, people are resorting to crime.
*  And that's when it's not good, I feel like. Well, not just that. When people are resorting to crime.
*  One of the things this administration did that I think is terrible, and this is a progressive liberal thing,
*  is that you have these DAs, these George Soros funded DAs that just let people out for violent crime.
*  And get the no cash bail thing. And when there's no repercussions for crime, guess what? Crime goes way the fuck up.
*  Oh yeah, if I'm a criminal and they're like, hey, it's crime time or whatever, I'm going to fucking put on my cleats or whatever.
*  I'm going to get out there. You know you're going to go to jail and you're just going to get released.
*  Yeah. It's like catch and release. It's almost like the fishing rules or whatever.
*  Like if you go trout fishing in the lake?
*  I mean a little bit. You're a fly fisherman. You used to be a cop, now you're a fly fisherman with barbless hooks.
*  You just have a pair of Nikes on the hook? Yeah, you just put them out there.
*  Yeah, those fishermen, they use barbless hooks and then they let the fish go.
*  I went fly fishing recently. Yeah? Yeah, man. Did you have a good time?
*  Yeah, you know what I did? I thought it was like, let me think about what I thought it was like.
*  It's the more sophisticated way to go fishing. Yes, it was like, excuse me fish.
*  Yes, gentle casts. Yes. It was like, hey. It also requires a lot more skill.
*  Well, it requires more patience. For sure. You can't like, if you have a kid or whatever, you can't do it.
*  Like if you're just fishing on the bank, you can have your kid and you can be sitting there smoking or whatever your kid likes to do.
*  But if you're in that, you have to constantly be moving it. It's very kind of like, it's kind of homoerotic almost.
*  It's like, hey fish or whatever. Oh, it's flailing. It's gentle. I think so.
*  Yeah, you've seen those guys. It's like, hey fish, I'm over here. I'm over here, boys.
*  The least sophisticated form of fishing is like a bobber with a worm on it. Yeah. That's the least.
*  You throw it out there. But that's some of the most fun fishing because that bobber starts moving.
*  You're like, oh shit. Yeah. Oh shit. I think we got one. Oh shit. It's like Jaws all of a sudden. Fishing is so exciting.
*  Yeah, my grandma used to take us fishing, dude. And she was like a malignant fisherman or whatever.
*  Degenerate? Yeah, like very. What do you mean by malignant? She was like a staunch fisherman.
*  Staunch. Like we're fishing. Oh, aggressive. You better not fucking not fish.
*  Really? She was like, kind of had that kind of behavior. Yeah, she was very, you better fucking fish, white boy.
*  Whoa. Aggressive. Yes, very aggressive. About fishing for little kids.
*  Yeah. And we have to be quiet and look straight out and wait for the bobber. But she was really, she loved to fish.
*  Did she love to eat fish? Yep. She liked to skin them and grill them and everything. Yeah. Yeah. It was cool.
*  Mostly catfish, bullheads. We used to fish up in like Spoon River up in like Illinois. Do you guys use like chicken liver for? Yeah. Yeah.

*  We would get out there. We'd have a little thermos full of chicken liver.
*  Yeah, chicken liver works.
*  My grandfather would say anything and she'd fucking look at him. He wouldn't talk for a month after.
*  She was the fisherman.
*  She was.
*  The fisherwoman.
*  Yeah, she was. She loved to fish. I think she liked. She liked catching her own meals.
*  Even, you know, she didn't like to hunt, but she liked to fish.
*  What's that fucking dude's name? The chubby dude that dressed up like the devil and everybody got mad is a singer.
*  Sam. What's that?
*  Sam Smith.
*  Sam Smith. Yeah. He said he wanted to be a fisher them.
*  Oh, God.
*  Not a fisherman, a fisher her, a fisher she. A fisher them.
*  Yeah, that's wild.
*  The they them thing is that's the best evidence you need that people are out of their fucking minds.
*  You can't be plural. You fucking idiot.
*  Well, the only thing I think it's like it's almost if you're being plural, you're I don't understand it.
*  I like if you're being plural, are you being like there's more of me kind of like that's what I understand.
*  Is it like an ego trip like that? You know, like that's what I don't understand about the.
*  It's just a way to be unique and it's a way to be in a marginalized community if you're just a regular person.
*  So like if you're a regular white person, you're at the lower end of the social hierarchy amongst woke people.
*  But if you're queer or non-binary, now you're in a protected group.
*  My buddy's queer, actually.
*  Nice. What does he have to do to be queer?
*  Nothing. He's cool. He's just he doesn't. Yeah, he didn't like send you an email update or whatever.
*  He's just did he update his Twitter pronouns? No, he's just like a just decides he's queer.
*  Yeah, he's like a secret. Not secret. He's like.
*  All right. He's just like a or I don't know what they call it.
*  I got to look at the chart or whatever. What is queer these days?
*  Because when I was a kid, queer was gay. If someone was queer, they're gay.
*  Or if you got punched in the head, then you're on queer street.
*  It was like everything was confusing. Queer was confusing. OK.
*  And then queer became gay somewhere along the line.
*  But now I think queer is whatever you want it to be. Yeah.
*  You could be gay, bi, straight. And then you could be pansexual.
*  What is that? Exactly. That's the way Brady is. He's pansexual? He came out.
*  He came out as pansexual. I don't know what that means.
*  I can barely handle whatever I am, dude. To be real honest, bro. It's all so new.
*  Whatever I am, bro, it keeps jerking off at night and being afraid to talk to women.
*  So whatever that one is, that's what I am. You're theosexual.
*  It's getting kind of heavy, man. You're theosexual.
*  Why are you afraid to talk to the women? No, I don't know.
*  You know, I think I get afraid to like I just I've always I always got afraid to approach approach women.
*  You know? Yeah. But why? You're a handsome fellow. You're funny. You're successful.
*  I don't know. I think something I just. Childhood shit?
*  Yeah, probably. There's something like, you know, just yeah, like I just I would just be so fucking nervous, buddy.
*  You know, when I when I was a kid, I would be so nervous.
*  I would. Yeah, I would be so.
*  Which is interesting that you got into standup comedy, which makes people really fucking nervous.
*  Well, I think I was familiar with being nervous. So that didn't affect me.
*  Oh, interesting, because you're nervous all the time.
*  Like, fuck it. I'll just go be nervous in front of all these people.
*  Oh, the audience is the when you're on stage, the audience is just a woman.
*  Oh, like you're just trying to get them to like you. You're just trying to get.
*  Yeah, you're like, how do we get this to work out?
*  You know, I get you to like me more. Who do I have to be?
*  I was the other night was crazy. Sorry, I cut you off. No, no, go ahead.
*  I got nothing, man. The other night was great.
*  This week's been crazy. It's just been a crazy week. Yeah.
*  You know, it's been a crazy week, man.
*  It was interesting because the beginning of the night, no one knew what was going to happen.
*  So you're watching the first results roll in and there's like this weird thing.
*  And then Trump gets way ahead, but you're like, you don't want to like get too hopeful.
*  Like, how far ahead is he's ahead by 100 points? That seems like a lot.
*  Yeah. And you're like, what is it? And some channels are like.
*  And then every channel is kind of different. Yeah.
*  They had different numbers. I was getting a different number off my Apple News Update
*  than I was getting off of CNN. And then I was texting people like Tulsi and JD Vance.
*  I was getting a different apparently.
*  Elon created an app and he knew who won four hours before the results.
*  So as the results were coming in before four hours before they called it, Dana White told me,
*  I was like, I'm leaving. It's over. Donald won.
*  He just fucking he just fucking somehow or another.
*  I'm going to go back into my pod and evaporate.
*  I don't know what he's getting, where he's pulling his data from.
*  But he had like the most accurate data in terms of the rural states hadn't put the results in yet.
*  But yet Trump was ahead in these states.
*  Combo is never going to win those states. So tabulated that and put it all together.
*  I don't know how he did it. Yeah. Dana. I don't even I haven't talked to Elon about this.
*  I don't know like the Dana translation. But Dana said he had an app and he was like showing him.
*  He's like, it's over. He fucking left. Dude just left. It's over.
*  John Jones won. He just fucking left.
*  Dude. Yeah. I mean, the whole thing's crazy.
*  I mean, I'm so happy for my biggest thing was I was so happy for Bobby Kennedy, man.
*  Because he's the only person that I super know like as a human, you know, he's been a buddy of mine for years.
*  And I've just known that he's a like I trust him like you.
*  It's almost like if you have people that you know and that are good people, it's like, yeah, I have to trust my own instincts at some point and know I know him.
*  You know, he's a he's a somebody I would vouch for.
*  Right. You know, he's a good guy and he's been helpful to me like in in moments where I have I have struggled as a person.
*  And just been inspirational to me.
*  You know, it's like I know him, you know, like a friend.
*  And so so that's I think like that was something I was like super excited about just to see where everybody was like, screw this guy, you know, and to see him have a arc where it's like because all he ever cared about to me.
*  And I don't know. This is just my opinions, dude.
*  I mean, some people, everybody has their own opinions and I'm an idiot.
*  But but he he always cared about like the rivers and the environment, you know, and then he started to care about the environment inside of our bodies.
*  Right. So for me, that all makes sense.
*  Right. And so like, you know where it all happened from.
*  Right. I was super like that was I was super excited about, you know, how he made the transition to being worried about pharmaceutical drugs.
*  He would give these speeches and he he litigated a bunch of lawsuits against corporations that were polluting rivers.
*  They cleaned up these river. He was an environmental attorney and they were also talking about the effects of mercury, mercury poisoning in the soil and water.
*  And these women kept coming to these things that he was doing and saying, you need to investigate mercury and vaccines.
*  And, you know, he thought like that is like which most people think you hear vaccine like the last thing I want to be labeled is a vaccine skeptic.
*  Jesus Christ. A vaccine denier.
*  That's like we talked about this yesterday, but it's like Holocaust deniers, number one.
*  But vaccine denier and election denier are like right under there.
*  Yeah. And he started looking into it, particularly the MMR vaccines and the correlation between the uptick of all these autoimmune issues,
*  autism spectrum disorders, all these different things that coincided directly with the increase in the vaccine schedule for kids.
*  And so then he starts doing research on it. And the more he does research on it, the more it gets uncovered that there's this gigantic machine that's protecting all this because there's so much money that's being generated.
*  And most of it has to do with during the Reagan administration.
*  They they gave them immunity to prosecution so they couldn't there were no longer liable for whatever side effects the vaccines.
*  Yeah, that's that's pretty wild.
*  Yeah. And then, of course, these motherfuckers started giving little kids little babies that were just born hep B vaccines.
*  Like, what are you doing? Like, that's a you get that from needles and sex.
*  Yeah. Unless it's Pam Anderson's baby, dude.
*  I wouldn't know if I don't even know if she has any kids or not.
*  And I love Tommy Lee. So I shouldn't have.
*  Well, you fucked up.
*  It's a joke. What are you going to do? It's a fucking joke.
*  Yeah, sorry. Everything's OK.
*  I feel the same way about Bobby. I don't know him as well as I know Tulsi, though.
*  Tulsi is a good friend of mine. I love her. She's great. She's awesome person.
*  She's like a legitimate awesome person.
*  You know, that lady, she served as a congresswoman for eight years and the whole time she was like she was against this divide of right versus left.
*  She was always trying to be cool with everybody.
*  She served overseas. She was deployed overseas in a military medical unit, man.
*  So she was helping people that got blown up by the war twice.
*  That's where she got that crazy white streak in her hair.
*  Really? Yeah. That all came from the stress of being overseas, working in a medical unit.
*  Wow. Yeah. Yeah. I guess.
*  Can stress be that compartmentalized inside of you?
*  And it comes out like that. Your body's you can't imagine.
*  You know, I was just talking to my friend Bruce about this last night.
*  He was a cop in Austin. We were talking about the amount of death that most police officers see and the stress that has on you.
*  And what he was telling me is you take like a cop that has like 20 years in the job.
*  They what they see is probably 10 X what the average soldier who's deployed sees because you're seeing murder all the time.
*  You're seeing car accidents all the time, suicide all the time, domestic violence all the time.
*  You're pulling people over. You never know if you're going to get shot.
*  He goes, most of these guys are fucked up because they just constantly seeing this stuff constantly.
*  Oh, yeah. I'd be at home out here.
*  Somebody open a jar of Pringles and I'd fucking pull on them.
*  You know, yeah.
*  You hear that top? Yeah.
*  Yeah. What's going on?
*  Dude, we had a police officer on a few years ago or about a year ago.
*  Can you look this up? Jamie's a kid. Ask him to look something up.
*  Yeah, sure. OK.
*  It's a police officer.
*  How long ago?
*  Yes. This guy retired police officer Sergeant Brad White.
*  This guy was super unique. He lived in Los Angeles.
*  But he told this story. He he was he didn't have any political thoughts.
*  He just told stories of what it was like being a police officer.
*  And he told the story of his first day on the job.
*  They're chasing a guy. The guy runs in the traffic, gets hit by a vehicle and killed. Right.
*  So even as it's just a human being like you're you're just doing a job,
*  but then you're like trying to compartmentalize or or how do you know what effect did I have on this?
*  What are my you know, like he told this story of a mother had called and said that her son was was thinking about committing suicide.
*  Right. The mother meets him in the yard. He shows up.
*  He's he's a police officer. It's in outside of Los Angeles, I think in Whittier Police Department.
*  I could be wrong. He shows up. The mom meets him outside.
*  They see the son comes into the doorway. Right.
*  It's like a glass door with another door behind it kind of takes his own life. Right.
*  Right. Kills himself right in front of them. So now he's standing there with the mom.
*  Now he has to go. He has to go. He has to console the mother, then go inside of the home.
*  He walks inside. The door won't open because the man's body is there. Right.
*  It's he's having trouble getting it open. Even just that moment, he gets it open.
*  Something falls off of the ceiling down the back of his shirt.
*  And it's part of the guy, his brain matter. He had shot himself on the scene.
*  So I know that's graphic and stuff. But and then for the next three or four hours, he has to take care of this scene with this little feeling between his bat wings or whatever.
*  What is that? Bulletproof vest? No, inside of your body. Shoulder blades. Yeah. It's brain matter. Yeah.
*  And it's just like that's just a regular guy. You know, he might not even have finished college or something.
*  You know, it's like so just the baffling amount of stuff that police go through. Anyway, I was trying to just like those are stories that stuck with me when I when I spoke with that guy.
*  It was like unbelievable. It's just conveniently ignored by most people who will never be police officers.
*  And then that was one of the more offensive things about the George Floyd thing. All this defund the police shit where people rose up and were saying defund the police.
*  I mean, defund the police and Kamala Harris was one of them. She was out there tweeting defund the police.
*  And because of that crime just ramped up in certain communities and so many people wanted the police back.
*  But then it's you know, it's a long process to try to and to this day, the most of these cops don't have good morale.
*  They still have this this feeling of defund the police was just a couple of years ago. Yeah. It's hard to get people to be cops now.
*  They don't want that fucking job. And why would they? It's a fucking hard job.
*  Yeah. And they don't even I think the highlight like they usually they used to play like softball in our area against like the fire department.
*  That was like the highlight of it. You know, it was like having like competition, you know, but I don't even like if you defund them, they're not even super funded.
*  You don't ever see a cop with like a boat or you know what I'm saying? Like you don't a ball or cop.
*  Yeah. You think about how hard that job is like hard job should pay more.
*  Yeah, dude. You know, like what is the I think if you paid them too much, so then they just quit like I got enough.
*  I'm out. Yeah. I don't know. Because like what's harder being a rapper or being a cop? It's fucking way harder being a cop.
*  Oh, yeah. I think yeah. Because rappers get paid way more. That's true.
*  Cops just I think a lot of cops will start making albums.
*  But there really should be some there should be a great producer that goes on a ride along with a police officer.
*  This is going to happen much and makes a dope track with a cop. Right.
*  And you could make a dope you'd have so much great visuals. Right. And the proceeds go towards supporting the police department.
*  Yeah. Like the cop could like be saying shit from behind the wheel and you sample that sample that and turn them into songs.
*  We got them in pursuit and for codes, different codes.
*  Fifty one fifty. Now, when someone's crazy. Oh, yeah.
*  That's crazy. Right there. That's 50. I think 44. Is this cop rap?
*  What is this Grammy nominated rapper Sacramento police officer records new deployment recruitment video.
*  Pull him up, man. Well, no.
*  I looked. I just figured there could have already been one.
*  What's that? Fifty one. What do you have to do to be a Grammy nominated Grammy nominated doesn't impress me like Grammy winning.
*  That impressed me. Grammy nominated to my Grammy nominated you.
*  Yeah. My Grammy will nominate anybody. She liked traveling Wilburys.
*  She I mean, I didn't. I mean, if my grandfather showed up and said, hey, they're good.
*  I respect that a little bit more, but that's just me. You know, Lainey Wilson. I love she's great.
*  Red Clay Stray, Stephen Wilson, Jr. Red Clay Stray's are great. Good, huh?
*  Yeah. There's good music out now. It's a good time for music because like you could find things so easily, you know, you don't have to wait for the radio.
*  You just find stuff. People send you stuff like in the green room all the time.
*  Someone will play something like, oh, what is this? Shazam it like, oh, shit. It's nice.
*  That Shazam thing, that feature is so huge. Yeah. You know, on Google Pixel phones, there's an option to just have it on.
*  All the time. So anytime a song is playing, you look down on your phone or tell you what song's playing.
*  I didn't know it. They still do that. I think that's still a feature.
*  I think it's only on the Google Pixel. Um, what was I thinking? I feel all over the place today.
*  You ever feel like that? Oh, yeah. Like you open your life. I haven't. Yeah, I didn't sleep well. Two days in a row.
*  I didn't sleep the night of the election. I could not sleep. I got home.
*  I was wired. Did you jerk off or not? No, no, I just sat in front of the TV.
*  I was watching Professional Pool, sitting in front of the TV. I called Dave Smith.
*  Me and Dave Smith talked on the phone at like 3 30 in the morning. And then I finally went to bed and my wife woke up.
*  She's like, what happened? Who won? I was like Trump won in a landslide. You're like the Spurs.
*  And then she was up. I'm like, it was a landslide. Like it was a crazy landslide.
*  It was the red wave that everybody thought was going to happen in 2022.
*  Hey, Jamie, I'm hearing more and more about what we talked about yesterday about the amount of people that voted for Biden in 2020 versus the amount of people that voted for anybody in 2016 and for anybody in 2024 that they're still saying it was a giant jump.
*  That's that's what I see, too. A lot of people think it's bullshit.
*  There's a lot of people that are getting super suspicious about the 2020 numbers because Biden got more votes than anybody by like 20 million.
*  It's really crazy. If you look at the chart. Well, did. Yeah.
*  Did they say that the most people they'd ever seen at voting stations were this year? Yeah.
*  That's what I don't know what the visual report is for this year.
*  But then I guess is the most consequential election I think I've ever felt. For sure. For sure.
*  The way people felt about it, too. The people on the left thought they were convinced that Hitler was coming.
*  They're convinced that some right wing authoritarian is going to come down and take away all your rights.
*  And well, that's a me. That's a lot. That's the media does that 100 percent.
*  But 100 percent not what he was saying, not what he did for four years in office.
*  It's all the media and we're all victim of it a little bit because you won't defend him or support him if you hear all these things about him, because then you're you got to defend the fact that no, he didn't really do that.
*  He's not really a felon. There were only misdemeanors.
*  Texas voter turnout falls in 2024 election despite record registration numbers.
*  This is just Texas, right? Sixty one percent cast ballots near six percent drop from the 2020 presidential race.
*  But the difference in the numbers nationwide is what I'm interested in, because the nationwide numbers were pretty they're pretty consistent, like through the entire like if you look at 2012, it's consistent with 2016, which is also consistent with 2024.
*  The anomaly is 2020. In 2020, everything goes way up, way up.
*  Maybe because people were sitting home and so bored in the city.
*  It's that much to do, you think? Could be. Could be because it was during covid.
*  Could be they a lot of people weren't working, so they did have the opportunity to vote.
*  Voting should be a national holiday. I agree. I don't understand.
*  It's crazy that you give some people a complication like imagine you have a shithead boss.
*  Like I got to vote. Why did you vote early?
*  I was working for you, piece of shit. Let me go. Let me go vote.
*  Yeah, I mean, they give Christopher Columbus a holiday, dude.
*  The Lieutenant Dan of the fourteen hundreds. That dude gets a fucking holiday.
*  Yeah, why don't you go read what that guy did?
*  Let's get rid of Christopher Columbus. They trained to indigenous people's day like the indigenous people like, thanks.
*  After you wiped out 90 percent of us, thanks for giving us a day.
*  How about we keep that day? That's fine.
*  But how about we have an election national election holiday? We could do it one more holiday.
*  Celebrate it. It's a great day. People can rejoice. And then I got out.
*  Yep. It would take a lot of stress off people, too. It's like today's also a day of celebration.
*  It's not this day that I have to sneak away from work and be sneaky or whatever.
*  You should have a car. It should be a paid holiday.
*  You should expect to have to pay your employees on the day that election comes because everybody should be able to go vote.
*  That's what it should be. We should make sure we talk to Trump about it.
*  Making a nationally mandated holiday. I don't have his number. I don't know.
*  I mean, there's a guy in his department. I have his number. We could hook it up. I know some people.
*  Um, yeah, dude, it was just what I mean, just like what a crazy week. Yeah, very crazy.
*  Well, you were one of the first guys to have them on the podcast. Did you have any hesitancy having them on at all?
*  Um, my brother, actually, my brother's my brother's a lot smarter than me.
*  And he said, Hey, man, I just want you to think that there could be some reflection from people if you have him on.
*  Right. Like you could people, some people could be upset about it. Right. You know, and I thought about that a little bit.
*  And I was like, well, I don't really like, I like, I don't know. You know, like I have political thoughts and beliefs and stuff like that.
*  And it's like, it's hard to find a group that really embodies them.
*  And if anything, right now, for me, it seems like I don't even feel like these new parties are the same as the old parties.
*  They're not. It doesn't seem like this isn't Democrats and Republicans. There's something else.
*  There's something else. Transmorphin right now. And so I thought like, I thought, well, I think I'm, I just want to be able to have a chance to talk to this guy.
*  You know, and the main thing for me was like, like you talked about Dana White earlier.
*  He's really, you know, I know that you guys work together and he, you know, I knew that Trump's brother suffered from addiction.
*  I knew that. Right. I heard that or something. And I looked into it and it's like, okay, he lost his brother. His brother died of addiction.
*  So I was like, well, that's interesting to me. You know, and I wish that people, I wonder if there's more to Donald Trump.
*  Like, is there more of a way to talk with him about something that means, you know, try to get an emotional well, like more of an emotional well to him that then it seems like that's in the public.
*  Well, there was a thing that was going on for a while where you were platforming people. This was the idea.
*  Like if you had on a guy like Trump, you were platforming this bad person. This was this thing.
*  Yeah, I didn't think about that at all.
*  But it's a, it's, it's an authoritarian way to regulate conversations that let you know more about people.
*  And it's stupid because people don't want to have a nuanced perspective on anybody.
*  Look, I'm sure this is one of the reasons why I wanted to talk to Kamala Harris. I'm like, I bet there's a person in there. I bet I can get to that person. Yeah, I wanted to find that person.
*  I don't want to hear all the speeches. I don't want to hear. I was raised middle class. I don't hear any of that shit. She's a roller skater. You know that? No, I would love to find out. Yeah, I would love to talk to her about all kinds of shit.
*  I would. I literally said like because there was a few restrictions of things that didn't want to talk about.
*  But I said, I don't give a fuck. I go get her in here. Like whatever you want to talk about. And they want to know if I edit. Like there's not going to be any editing. There's no editing. Yeah, we're not going to edit. But yeah, that's the same thing they asked us. Is there an edit? You know, I just wanted to talk.
*  I just like I feel like you give someone a couple of hours and you start talking about anything. I'm gonna see the pattern of the way you think. I'm going to see the way you process ideas. I'm going to see whether or not you're calculated or whether you're just free. Yeah.
*  Yeah. Are you comfortable with you? Or do you are you projecting things like she's got 80 different accents? How do you decide which one to pull out? Yeah. She busts out different accents depending on who she's talking to. Yeah, they should have made a bunch of Chinese folks. I would have loved her that accident. I want to see what I do that too, though. I like to meet people where they're at. Oh, if I see somebody else, you know, I'll be like, what's happening, my friend? You know, I like to meet people where they are. You know, yeah, she did.
*  Yeah, she did one with Latinos. We should talk with a Latino accent like this is wild, but she's a chameleon. But if you want to be a successful politician, that's probably a good trait. I agree. You know, it's like a comedian that's always on the kind of get annoying. But if you want to be a comedian, that's probably a good trait. Want to be a politician, you should probably be able to melt into your environment and sort of meld yourself with whatever these people want you to be. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe not. Maybe it's just like the I always feel.
*  Like the environment of debates, the environment of interviews on television, the environment of anything you're doing in front of an audience. It's so fake. It's such a weird way to talk that you don't get a sense of who the person is. So like when I got to see Trump on your podcast and you were talking about to a cocaine, then it makes like an owl.
*  Oh, God.
*  It was hilarious. It was hilarious. But it was like you got a chance to see that guy as a person trying to figure out like who is this psycho I'm sitting here talking to.
*  I remember that shit. I fucking make a nest in my living room. Dude, boy, you fuck it. I'll scoot over the neighbors and steal some twine in my beak. Oh, there's nothing worse than being locked out of your place on cocaine, man.
*  I can only imagine. You talking to him like as a person is like almost more valuable than any other kind of speeches he does. Because when he's in front of everybody talking, we're going to make America amazing. Those are great speeches.
*  But you don't like she had an amazing speech when I was like she could win was when she had that one speech about Donald Trump, like scared to debate her. But he says all these things. But you know what? What I always heard? If you want to say something, say it to my face. And the whole place went crazy. And she was laughing.
*  I didn't see that. Oh, so good. It was her best speech, for sure. And it was right when they decided that she was going to run for president. Maybe that is what got people involved.
*  Biden stepped down and she had one banger of a speech. She looked young and energetic and like it really made you feel like she's going to be a she's hot. Yeah, she's younger. She was a smoke show. She's still all right. She got that thing on her. I bet. So this
*  You know what I'm saying? You know you're saying that's why it's so crazy because a lot of brothers love her too. Everybody seems to love her. Look at the brothers like it. She got that thing on her. That's all I'm saying. You know, yeah, what you're saying. But like that one speech was almost enough for her to win. And if she just didn't talk other than speeches, but they would have done they needed to do a better job of the speeches because every speech was the same. And the problem with that is we were talking about this like the internet. And I think that's the biggest problem.
*  And the problem with that is we were talking about this like the internet. You get to see that speech over and over going online like and then people make compilations of speech and write in the same thing. But it's like if someone goes to see your act, you know, they don't understand like acts like to develop a bit. It takes months and months and months to really like put it together where it's like rock solid. And you're going to do it the same way or slightly different every night. And if someone comes to see you and goes, Theo so full of shit, man, he told us the other day that it was just the other day. Yeah.
*  Meanwhile, he said it three weeks later. It wasn't just the other day. It was three fucking weeks ago, dude. You're just you're repeating the same shit.
*  Yeah, you got too many leap years. White boy. Yeah, like that. Exactly. So that's what they feel about like a presidential candidate that's telling the same speech over and over. Well, hey, you're not supposed to go see all those speeches. But yeah, you know, what the thing is, you're not following the grateful dead here.
*  Trump has a lot, though. Trump has a lot that are repetitive. He does, but not in the same order. It's like going to see a Grateful Dead show. It's like it's all over the place. You know, he's when Trump gets out there, he just does tugging.
*  Did you see he accepted he had this long winded speech about the rocket. That was a rocket. I'm like, you just won the president. Yeah, edit that down. You get that. That could be two minutes. Beautiful. I was I was worried about that in the very beginning of the podcast before we got cooking when he was talking about Lincoln's bedroom. I was like, oh, boy. Like, where's this going? I went I've been to Lincoln's bedroom. How was it?
*  It was okay. I think you can bring it up. Actually, it's in Springfield, Illinois. Oh, it is. No, he was talking about the one that's in the White House. Oh, no, I've been to just his child before he got elected to his childhood home. Oh, wow. It's really interesting. He's keep his notes in his hat. Oh, that was a good move. Pretty cool. Big ass hats back that head wallet baby had that's a good move. Yeah, move. It's like credit cards behind your phone. I think except if you lose your phone, you lose everything. We ain't losing that big ass hat.
*  Crazy man. You see like how many dudes wore like fancy hats back in the day. That shit just went away. Imagine if you were a kid and you're growing up in a hat family. You're like, well, our family makes hats, bro. I'm balling forever. I'm going to take over this business. And then no hats. If you watch. There's a great outside boxing match in Reno, Nevada, between Jackson and the Red Sox. And then you're like, oh, I'm going to take over this business. And then you're like, oh, I'm going to take over this business. And then you're like, oh, I'm going to take over this business. And then you're like, oh, I'm going to take over this business. And then you're like, oh, I'm going to take over this business. And then you're like, oh, I'm going to take over this business. And then you're like, oh, I'm going to take over this business. And then you're like
*  I'm going to take over this business. And then you're like, oh, I'm going to take over this business. And then you're like, oh, I'm going to take over this business. And then you're like, oh, I'm going to take over this business. And then you're like, oh, I'm going to take over this business. And then you're like, oh, I'm going to take over this business. And then you're like, oh, I'm going to take over this business. And then you're like, oh, I'm going to take over this business. And then you're like, oh, I'm going to take over this business. And then you're like, oh, I'm going to take over this business. And then you're like, oh, I'm going to take over this business. And then you're like, oh, I'm going to take over this business. And then you're like, oh, I'm going to take over this business. And then you're like, oh,
*  I like this stuff like it. I like the business and I like it better than just giving it away and saying stuff, but good luck seeing everything from money out there.
*  Now let's look at that other hat spotify Grandpa and Grandma's house.
*  Everyone is wearing a hat.
*  And every man has a fucking hat on Yong.
*  They all look they all have hats.
*  Look, they off fancy hats.
*  Look at all these guys are taking off their hats, waving their hats.
*  Men left the house with a fucking hat on.
*  Look at this. Wow.
*  You're gonna see this these are like regular men walking on the streets everybody had fancy hats on and a nice button-up shirt
*  The suit jacket
*  That's a Jim Jeffries right there. Oh those guys are good, dude. James. That's Jack. That's John L. Sullivan. No way
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, they got from an uh
*  That's the guy from Monopoly. He was right there. He was a bare-knuckle boxer
*  Back in the dizzy so and he was still famous back then wow look at him putting it all together
*  That's so cool and that cool this so they built this outdoor stadium to watch Jack Johnson beat the fuck out of Jim Jeffries
*  Oh, that's how it goes Jim Jeffries is trying to make a comeback. He was a little bit older
*  Back then brow boxing would go until someone died. Yeah, they would have I mean, what's the most rounds they had back then?
*  They were crazy. It was like 80 rounds or something like what's the longest old-school boxing match ever Jamie? I?
*  Think they had some insane amount of rounds
*  That's a good question. Yes, the greatest number of rounds was
*  276 in a four hour and 30 minute fight when Jack Jones beat Patsy Tunney in
*  Cheshire in 1825 holy fuck dude and
*  We introduced in 1867 each round of a fight would last until someone was knocked down
*  Bro 276 rounds is so crazy. Oh, that's when you get all your CTE in an IV bag
*  Is get your your CTE just hot pumped into your fucking brain
*  I'm just joking
*  Oh my god at New Orleans. That's where it was in 18
*  Well, he lived to 94 he lived to 1867
*  Oh, these are the when they die because 1893 it lasted 110 rounds. Oh my god
*  Seven hours and 19 minutes. It was declared a no contest later changed to a draw
*  Dude, most people couldn't go that long without even looking at their phone, dude
*  I
*  Mean to take a shit you're in the middle of a 200 round fight you have to take a shit
*  They should have a diaper round. We have to fight and shit at the same time. I
*  Would bet it affect your punching power if you just waddle around
*  Dude, I don't think there's a way you can shit and punch at the same time. Very hard. Look that up
*  Very hard
*  Cuz yeah, think about it. Yeah
*  I
*  Need to tighten all that up
*  You know throw a good punch like your ass cheeks tighten because you kind of use your legs as you thrust forward
*  You really can't shit and punch and not effectively
*  Code bro, you gotta lose that round. Yeah, so I guess they probably just pissed themselves
*  I know guys who shit themselves in the UFC
*  Multiple guys yet breaks my heart believe Tim. Sylvia shit himself in a fight once
*  Who else someone came out there Michael Chiesa
*  looked over at me once while I was doing commentary and
*  I think he got call and it was perhaps one of those situations where the fight before ended quicker
*  So he didn't get as much warm-up time as he wanted. Yeah, and then all sudden he's running out there and he looked at me
*  He goes dude, I'm about to shit my pants. I go really goes. Yeah, I'm about to shit my pants
*  And he won he went out there and won first round submission
*  Cuz he had to just he had to yeah, dude
*  Yeah, dude, there's not so this is the fight
*  Oh, is this another guy who's pants five fighters who pooped their shorts?
*  Yeah, it happens dude this guy shit himself a little bit, dude
*  I would shit myself if I had to go in there. Yeah, that's crazy. I'm Sylvia definitely shit himself Randleman shit himself
*  Yeah, it happens man. Look you're getting oh, yeah liver pounded on you're getting need in the guts
*  I don't have the one that oh I got in a car accident once and it happened you shit yourself. Mm-hmm
*  I didn't want to just I didn't have a choice. It just happened it wanted to she shit her pants to Justine Kitsch
*  No
*  I bet dudes would pay a lot of money for that that on onlyfans
*  You sell them shitty drawers and that's Mark Goddard right there call timeout brother
*  Imagine if you're like face down if someone's putting you in a rear-naked choke and they didn't clean the mats that good and the person
*  Before shit all over the place you get pink eye while you're getting your ass kicked
*  oh
*  God that makes me scared. Yeah, that's a scary job. That's the scariest job you think yeah
*  I went to that fight with you or no. I went to that fight member me and Joey Diaz went which one in New York. Oh
*  It was oh I was thinking your fighters. Well, I went saw the James J. Braddock statue before it was in New Jersey
*  before Dustin and um
*  That last fight that he had. Mm-hmm. No the one before the last fight
*  Justin Gaethje that was in after that
*  It was in New Jersey. Okay, that's yeah Ben was in Denny. Yeah. Yeah
*  Yeah, no, no. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He beat up Ben was sent to me knocked him out
*  That was after he lost his long I was in
*  Which one was in Jersey Islam? He didn't be he didn't beat him Islam in Jersey, right?
*  Right, so he fought Ben was in Denny then he gets a title shot against Islam
*  Yeah, I went with Joey we stand I went to the arm James J. Braddock statue before
*  Mmm, it was awesome dude. His arms a monster. He's so good. Yeah, it was crazy and Joey was like what do it dude? He was
*  This is all love dude, he's a fucking tremendous
*  He's one of a kind and his book is great, too
*  If you ever read his book, but um, he's sitting there. He'd been eating he'd been eating mushrooms
*  And once he even started eating a little you could see Aaron Rodgers start to look over, you know
*  He was getting curious, you know, he's like what it was happening, you know, that's by the sixth quarter or whatever
*  I don't know how many how the fights go but it's like by the sixth quarter. He's just rubbing on his thighs, right?
*  He goes who's winning dog
*  Joey used to shovel snow for James J. Braddock
*  That's crazy one of my favorite things that I ever learned about him that's crazy. Can you imagine that that is crazy?
*  What else
*  I'm gonna see him in a couple weeks. He's coming out here. Joey is gonna start staying out here for months at a time
*  Yeah, he wants to get a place downtown in the club meet you
*  I'm gonna come back and look in about a week and a half time. He comes like I gotta come out here dog
*  Like we'll make it easy for you
*  You tell me when you want to come you come we'll fly you out put you up whatever you want
*  I'll get your real estate lady. Let's get the party started and I'm trying to bring back the church of what's happening now
*  Because him and Lisa yet they were together when they were at the club together and I'm like, come on
*  Let's get the band back together you guys together. We're fucking amazing
*  It was nothing like that show kept people alive that show Joey Diaz's show was one of the most ridiculous silly
*  Preposterous shows it was so ridiculous and then he went to New Jersey and here's the problem with me Joey in New Jersey
*  He loves New Jersey loves New Jersey people he needs comedians and you
*  Forget that until you're not with them and then you're like, oh this ain't no fun
*  He is talking to plumbers or whoever's got a decent attitude or whatever, you know decent stuff nice
*  I like talking to all kinds of people
*  Yeah, obviously
*  But I need comedians in my life like I need vitamins like I need a certain amount of sunlight to get some vitamin D
*  I need I need comedians
*  It's too like that night that we had in that green room watching the elections how many jokes were crack how many fucking times?
*  We rag on tone. Oh, dude. We talked Tony off the ledge. We did it
*  Tony's like got statistics 26% more Puerto Ricans voted for Trump
*  So he had the Puerto Rican app
*  Open on his whoop bracelet. I'm like they have that what is that?
*  He was like how many plantains have sold tonight? He was fucking losing his mind. They tried to label him as a speaker
*  He said he was a speaker a speaker
*  That was at the Trump rally
*  He said the Puerto Rico was a pile of garbage
*  These are human beings
*  Was that Adam right?
*  Obama
*  Those are the Trump rally he was talking about Puerto Rico as a pile of garbage
*  Dude, the simple fact that Obama's talking about Tony
*  Bro Obama's doing a Tony Hinchcliffe bit
*  There's a video of us at the mothership going we played it yesterday
*  but I want to play it again Jamie play the video it's on my Instagram of
*  Tony is on stage in the main room by the way Tony goes on stage. It's like Richard Pryor just showed up. Yeah
*  They were going nuts. He murdered. He has 35 minutes on oh, yeah, he's on stage
*  At the same time same time
*  Yeah
*  We're definitely in a simulation like so this guy was on Fox talking about Tony on one TV while Tony was on
*  stage on the TV monitor
*  That's on
*  bully
*  We did it
*  He was so nervous because here's what was gonna happen if he lost
*  You know, so the way these news organizations work they have outlines for stories if Kamala wins
*  they have outs outlines for stories if Trump wins if if Trump lost they were gonna blame it on Tony
*  They had stories where they're gonna blame it on that joke and they were gonna say that that joke turned the tides and made people
*  realize the Trump organizations filled with Nazis and racists and
*  And they were gonna blame Tony and Tony would have been fucked because then the Trump supporters would have thought that too, right?
*  So it was like both sides would have disliked Tony
*  Absolutely, absolutely. He would had to go to Puerto Rico or no Costa Rica. Maybe
*  Mexico Mexico's in Mexico and Puerto Ricans don't really
*  Know they don't even they don't get along that was in fighting
*  There's always been a giant rivalry between Mexicans and Puerto Ricans and a lot of really. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah, man for sure
*  I didn't know that. Well, you know, there's no prouder group of
*  Boxers I think in the history of earth and Mexican boxers
*  Yeah, Mexican boxers are known for a specific style
*  Like if someone says you fight like a Mexican dude, that's a huge compliment
*  Yeah, Mexicans like Julio Cesar Chavez, you know fucking Canelo Alvarez Oscar de la Hoya
*  You mean go down the line, you know Morales
*  Fuck man, there's so many Manuel Marquez. Yeah so many man
*  Yeah, they got just so many punches in one punch
*  well
*  they just is a there's a culture of boxing there that goes back so far and it's so you know and with boxing it's always
*  people that are poor that want to way out and
*  One of the best ways out if you're a poor young man punch your way out fight
*  You can you can make millions like Canelo like Julio Cesar Chavez like
*  So it's like the history of people rising through boxing
*  But there's a similar history in Puerto Rico Puerto Rico has a history a great history of boxing too
*  Really? There was always a rivalry between Mexico and Puerto Rico
*  I could see that because you're both Latino cultures and you want to be the best, you know
*  Oh, yeah, I'm trying to think if I've ever been to a boxing
*  Match or not. You should go see Jake Paul versus Mike Tyson might be the last boxing match ever. I don't know if I want to see it
*  Do you want to see it if Mike Tyson wins? I
*  Remember watching Mike Tyson verse Roy Jones jr. Yeah, and it was like two guys like in beating each other up in baby diapers or whatever
*  It was like bring it up. They were wearing like big diapers or whatever. They were wearing cups
*  There's a protector that boxers wear that's different than the protector that MMA fighters wear
*  So the protector that boxers wears is foam that covers like the front of your hips and things too
*  Maybe I'm not thinking about it. Maybe I'm thinking about something else then
*  But it just this thing again hugging this is what I believe I believe
*  Really truly to my core that they made an agreement where Mike Tyson was only gonna hit him to the body full blast
*  It looked like every time he hit him to the head. He was kind of pulling back
*  That's it. It just didn't seem like this didn't seem like a real fight
*  Right. It seemed like a fight to the body though
*  Mike was hitting him to the body really hard and I think he hurt Roy a bunch of times really hard to the body
*  But you know both of these men are 50 Roy in his day
*  I maintain to this day was the greatest boxer I've ever seen Wow Roy Jones in his prime was a freak
*  Like I mean a freak where he wouldn't even throw jabs. He would throw a lead left hook
*  He would favor that over a jab, but it was as fast as a jab and people couldn't understand it
*  Yeah, you've never been in a ring with someone that fast
*  You look at Roy Jones highlight reel of chaos. You ever watched like Roy Jones and he's his prime. Oh, they were execution, son
*  It was like Mike Tyson in his prime but a different thing in fact in a Nas song Nas
*  Says the the new Mike Tyson's Roy Jones. Wow Roy Jones was just executing people
*  He was so much faster than anybody his timing was so good. He was a sniper. Oh my god
*  He was just so skillful. Who would you rather knock you unconscious? You think if you had to pick a good fighter?
*  Oh, I don't know
*  Maybe Roy would just put it out quick just pop you on the chin and you've Roy or Connor though
*  Both of them will knock you out quick we think yeah
*  But then this is this one fight with Roy Jones with Vinny pazienza
*  It was the only fight in copy box history where the opponent didn't land a single punch Wow a single punch
*  This was like when Roy was trying to get the referee to stop the fight before that Roy
*  Signaled to the referee stopped the fight and the referee said no and then Roy goes like this. He's like looking at Vinny
*  Sorry, I gotta do this. I never even seen this lights it up, bro. He was so good in his prime
*  But like all fighters they stay past their prime and people really only remember them for when they lost
*  Yeah, you know Roy in his prime was just something completely special
*  Yeah, Alan Iverson vibe you went to watch him just to see how long guys would last
*  That's what you would you would watch to see what he would do to guys
*  I did a fishing rodeo with him once did you really yeah, he's a big fisherman
*  He dropped his hands put him behind his back and knocked the guy out
*  Like lured the guy in and hit him with a one straight right hand and dropped him
*  It was one he would just like that's why and raised it
*  I can't even get a fucking medium jacket off of my body
*  That's what was my
*  So good he was so good. Oh and everybody that went in there brother right there
*  There's a thing that happens when a guy's gonna fight like that. You would see it with Anderson. So bill Cartwright. Who's he fighting?
*  Cartwright who's he fighting?
*  Some dude is in real trouble. They should stop this fight already
*  That dude did not need to take those other two punches
*  Dude he was so fast
*  Yeah, dude Tony was Tony was
*  When I walked in I didn't see him in my son is fucking grilling him like there he is I'm like who's an island now
*  That's what I said
*  He's fucking sitting there
*  Who's an island now did you really say that to him?
*  Yeah
*  And here's the best thing about Tony though. He laughs like Tony is for the joke, right?
*  Oh, yeah, like even if he's like going through it. He respects the joke and like always
*  There's many layers to that whole thing. It's like you Tony is who he is
*  And you you almost you respect that to the core. It wasn't the best timing probably not right?
*  Was there a lot of supervision over him is what he said
*  Probably not but that's also organized that meeting was it's disorganized, but it's also real so it's like
*  There's two ways to look at it. It's like
*  It's yes. It's like nobody proofread it
*  Let me clear something there because we did say that they went over his material. They didn't they did not go over his material
*  They did someone suggest that he take one joke out
*  So he took this one joke out and he had he's like, oh what do I put in its place?
*  He decided to go with the Puerto Rico joke
*  We did it
*  Yeah, but he's just so silly, but he's the good but he laughs at himself. Oh totally but also he's
*  It's weird cuz it's like do you want things to be tailored or you not want him to be tailored, you know?
*  Yeah, it's like you could have you could have a group that goes through every every single joke and says no to everything
*  Right, and then you get nothing
*  You get you know what I'm saying kind of it's like how many layers of um
*  like when you drain spaghetti or whatever I'm talking about like how many layers of
*  spaghetti
*  Don't know it's been a long year I know what you're saying
*  But I think when you get to a certain level of your career you got to say no to things that are outside of comedy
*  Yeah, if you're just coming up and someone says you want to go speak in front of the president go out there make a mark
*  Soldier give it your best
*  But if you're Tony Hinchcliffe and you just did the Tom Brady roast kill Tony's the number one comedy podcast in the world
*  I mean you have millions and millions of downloads every week. Don't do that
*  It's just too comedy. You're really good
*  I just want to try and tell people if you saw those same jokes on stage. He kills fucking crushes
*  It's just the worst environment ever for it lights are bright. It's in the day. Yeah, no one knows a comedian
*  He goes up cold. No one goes on after him
*  There's like his big ass paws after him the whole thing was like organized terribly. Yeah, terribly
*  Oh, it's complete disorganization. It was like there was the Trump speech, which is the big thing
*  They what do we do with all the extra time like let anybody talk who wants to talk?
*  This guy owns a fucking sandwich shop. Let him come up there
*  Yeah, look, it's my friend Giovanni. Thank you
*  Anybody in there they were letting people that were saying wild stuff, too
*  Oh, they were letting anybody in there and it didn't seem like they vetted a lot of the speeches some of the speeches like what?
*  We had 40 minutes of ASMR in there
*  They were fucking letting people do anything whenever you get an organization with us the Republicans or the Democrats
*  You've got a kind of like appease everybody and you got
*  Psychos and moderate people and they're all together under this one banner of this one
*  Have you ever been off sports team? He just always like one dude on the team. That's a fucking psychopath, right?
*  Oh, yeah, dude. Don't cause any fights like leave everybody alone. Let's go. Come on. We had a brother
*  He was slashed everybody's tires, but then here's the thing we were giving him a ride home. So it's like well now we're all
*  But that's who he was you had to respect him he was a power forward, you know, yeah
*  Well, sometimes they're not making the best decisions people don't man a lot people don't man. I am football players, bro
*  You get hit in the head a lot. You're gonna make some sketchy ass decisions
*  Nick Bosa got brave and shared his uh political thoughts the other night. You see that no I didn't
*  well just crazy how like on on mainstream stuff if you
*  Share anything one way it's okay, but you share something another way. It's not okay, right?
*  Like if you nobody got angry at people they made fun of people for supporting Kamala Harris like we've made fun of
*  Dave Bautista like because it looked just so silly like this
*  Performative commercial where it's really important to vote for Kamala Bautista walls
*  So the minute is he minute over less the guy from Guardians of the Galaxy? Okay, you know, I'm talking about Big Jack, dude
*  He's trying to get movies man. He's wearing pearls to like red carpet events. I know what you're doing
*  You're trying to get those movies. You got a lot. You're an artist. You're sensitive
*  You're on the right side put him in the he wants to be a lead in a movie
*  Then fucking turn on your camera at a house and make something dude, I'm telling you it's the right move
*  What he's doing is the right move even if he's faking it you mean for Hollywood you mean?
*  Yeah, yeah, wear the beads where the where pearls that softens you up a little bit lose some weight loss a bunch of weight
*  Talk shit about Trump. He's allowed to be like a tough guy talking shit about Trump
*  Do you ever see that Jimmy Kimmel sketch they did we called Trump a whiny bitch and you ever seen it?
*  Or Jimmy Kimmel called Donald Trump no no no no no no no Bautista they bought he stood in you never saw it
*  Find it cuz it's kind of funny. Is he the intercontinental champion?
*  I don't even I have a big time wrestler was a giant dude like fucking built like a superhero
*  And then he went did Guardians of the Galaxy. Oh, yeah, we're Chris Pratt. Yeah, he's a big giant wrestler
*  Yes, now I know you're talking about but he wants to be a movie star. So he's losing some weight
*  He's a good actor too, man. He was good in that
*  What was that movie the glass
*  Glass onion yeah, that was a great movie. He was really good in that
*  Fronticle what I've seen is just like it if you're a big giant dude and your big muscle-bound giant dude
*  And you want to do like serious roles like you kind of got to lose some weight
*  You know you got a and you kind of got to like support Kamala Harris
*  You kind of got to like wear pearls you kind of got to like soften your stance. You know you got to kind of like
*  Be performative that you're the guy that they would want to pick because that's like part of the battle like here
*  Let me get this. Oh, that's him. Yeah, those Eddie Bravo
*  He's not
*  He wears more makeup than Dolly Parton
*  Baby the guy's afraid of birds
*  Trump had his daddy pay a doctor say his will feet hurt so he could dodge the draft
*  Good like a garbage bag full of buttermilk
*  He sells imaginary baseball cards pretending to be a cowboy fireman guys barely strong enough to hold an umbrella
*  Well, he's working out and where is this at Jocko's gym
*  That's pretty funny he's got jugs big ones
*  Don't pardon the cheetah golf it creeps around beauty pageant dressing rooms
*  You know that little dance he does. Yeah, he's a pervert dude who isn't a pervert
*  He's moody pouts he throws tantrums no
*  He acts like a five-year-old behind the wheel of a truck
*  He bends over for food
*  This cat here on social media
*  Being girl the guy needs help walking downhill
*  Almost there grandma
*  This November let's stop kidding ourselves
*  afraid I don't watch this kind of stuff
*  Punches
*  Mostly he's terrified that real red-blooded American men will find out that he's a weak tubby toddler
*  Wow
*  That closing line is pretty tough. That's not bad. It called me a bitch
*  It's like you know what he's doing. Yeah, try to become a movie star. It's good move, but the Hollywood liberals
*  100% love that well Hollywood's just crazy to me, dude. I just don't understand it like it seems like they hate white men
*  Well
*  some people
*  That work in Hollywood. I'm sure don't like white men, but that's the thing about woke culture
*  It's like there's a hierarchy of the
*  Injustices that you have faced but it's like white men have even if it's not you which is where it gets prejudiced
*  Because it was not you the white men over history have caused the most grief they've caused the most trouble
*  They've been responsible for the most injustices in this country at least you know slavery
*  redline laws
*  Let's all just pin the tail on the honky-donky right in America slaves were exclusively
*  Under the white people right in other countries. They're owned by all kinds of people. This is where it gets
*  That's what we got to do then well people don't understand is there's more slaves today than there have ever been no
*  More slaves today than there were before
*  1865 when slavery was abolished in America you're lying nope there's more slaves in Libya
*  When we took down Libya and the rebels killed Gaddafi on television do you ever see that?
*  I didn't know it's one of the most terrifying channel was it on
*  C-SPAN
*  Libya became for a while became like a failed state and at one point in time there were slave auctions in
*  Libya that you could watch on YouTube, okay?
*  How crazy is that like look Google the actual numbers oh my god
*  Yeah, that's real statistic so and this is also one of the things that people are terrified about with this border deal
*  Okay, because one of the things about the border. It's not as simple as
*  People coming over and they want a better life of course, but it's also people being exploited and
*  There's tens of thousands of kids that are missing who knows if they've been smuggled into child child trafficking
*  There's who knows how many people have been okay hold on a second says estimates range from out 38 to
*  49 point six million people are
*  Slaves today the number of enslaved difficult people is difficult to determine
*  Estimates range from 38 to 49 million what uh-huh?
*  Yeah, oh my god I
*  Didn't have any clue. Well you have to include people that can't leave even if they're not like in cages
*  People that are trapped right like Gaza people you mean well you know I would talk about people that work in coal mines or
*  Cobalt mines in the Congo they're essentially slaves
*  I mean they give them the minimal amount of food and water they work in horrific conditions
*  And they live in complete abject poverty, but they're treated better than the people in Gaza though
*  perhaps
*  Well, they're all getting poisoned. They're all getting poisoned pulling that cobalt out of the ground yeah, but still they're getting lunch I bet
*  I
*  Would imagine either way yeah, you could find other spots that suck worse
*  Yeah, the point is like those people you could kind of consider slaves
*  And then there's real slavery you know this friend of mine was telling me about
*  This place that was built in Jamaica or the Bahamas. I think it was the Bahamas and
*  They brought in
*  Chinese workers in like this giant ship and he said they they had this patch of land
*  They put up a fence around the land and all the Chinese workers lived on that land and the Chinese workers built this resort there
*  And they worked non-stop 24 hours a day. They built the whole thing in 18 months
*  They would just have shift after shift and once it was completed
*  They took all the workers put them back in the boat put them right back to China, so
*  What was that was that was that slaves that slavery it would mean it seems like slaves
*  Like it seems like unless they paid those people an exorbitant amount of money
*  I don't know I mean
*  I don't know what the arrangement was they put a fence around the area they brought people in a giant ship and
*  Then they put them back on the ship and shipped them back to China like yeah a sleet fire fest remember fire fest or whatever
*  Yeah, what the fuck was that?
*  Dude trying to make money right, but still as you got carted over there. Yeah, nothing to eat nowhere to sleep
*  Definitely different than slavery, but still it's like yeah
*  It's like it's funny you think just cuz things happen a long time ago that it's not slavery today, right?
*  Well, I wouldn't say that fire festival is yes slavery. I agree. Did you see prop six in California?
*  What is that that's on the screen prop six prohibits slavery and involuntary servitude, and it did not pass
*  What what wait a minute what in California
*  proposed amendment to California's Constitution would bar slavery in any form and repeal a current provision allowing
*  Involuntary servitude as a punishment for crime because a lot of them gay producers trying to crank out them twinks homie
*  That's why bro keeping my slaves. Yeah, bro. They fly every now and then how would you every now and then a frickin some twink fucking?
*  Clambers out of an air vent. Oh here it is. It's forced labor in prisons
*  Yeah, okay people that are working prisons and just like they have to fight the wildfires and stuff interesting
*  So they want them to have to work Wow. They just don't want to pay
*  Yeah, that's California, but that is what happened, right?
*  That was what the Jim Crow laws were all about man
*  Like what one of the things about slavery is slavery didn't end boom now. Let's get black people jobs
*  No slavery ended and then there was this long
*  Period where black men would get arrested for anything and everything
*  yeah, and then they'd be forced to work and
*  They had work camps and so you were still the same thing
*  You could just get caught and you'd be a slave you get a bad cop decides you're speeding whatever it is
*  You're a slave. Yeah, and they did that a car and you're like you're speeding. Yeah, you know you're looking at people bad
*  You're verbally intimidating people whatever the fuck it is people like you see with the
*  When someone they someone wants to target you for something you pissed off the wrong people
*  They fucking come after you with the law and they can get you if they just decide that you shouldn't be free
*  And we're just gonna with there's an industry around slave labor, which there is. There's also an industry now
*  Around keeping people in prison, right? Cuz the prisons are private
*  So it's a private corporation owns this building where you lock people up for money
*  You get paid for them being there so you gets paid the private prison there's contracts with the state
*  Like it's like a summer camp or something. I don't know who gives the contracts but
*  No
*  Prisons are owned by corporations. Okay, so prisons own corporations. So no no no no no no no prison is owned by a corporation
*  So it's a business. Okay, so they lobby to make sure that laws stay on the books one of them is marijuana
*  So the prison guard lobby
*  They were they were trying to make sure that marijuana stays illegal so that more people stay in prison
*  Because the more people in prison the more jobs they have the more hours they have the better benefits
*  They'll have and the prison wants as many people in jail as possible. That is how they make money Wow
*  Yeah, who makes the money? It's not the government. No well in some jails, but there's private prisons
*  Like what are the percentage of private prisons? Well? No, I know we've looked this up, but I forget the number are they nicer?
*  I don't think so what about the Excalibur in Las Vegas that place is a fucking private
*  Our circus circus is going down ultimate circus circus is like how is this place legal?
*  Dude that was the end of 2022 8% of the total state and federal prison population in the United States was in private prison
*  Yep, which is about
*  90,000 873 people this makes private prisons a relatively small part of the correction system
*  Which is mostly public which by the way is even crazier
*  How about the fact that 90,000 people in jail is a small percentage?
*  We have more people in jail than any other country. Do you know that yeah, and we need a few more in there, too
*  I think
*  Beyond us, bro
*  Freedom is a some people can't handle freedom freedom ain't free freedom ain't free man. What are you eating over there?
*  Need a hit of something man. Huh, that's ends or so breakers you scared of it. You want a vape on you?

*  Lord, yeah, I can't leave you alone out there and to land. I gotta get a dose in my
*  Oh my god. Oh
*  Fuck I just think I saw who won the Heisman. Oh
*  My god
*  Bro, that shit made something happen to me. Those are so strong Wow. Oh
*  I'm gonna join woman sports
*  That was
*  If every time you did this and you left here and you felt
*  Like you couldn't remember things. Well, would you still do it?
*  Do that? Yeah. Yeah, I would lose like a little bit of memory like where's my keys?
*  Nothing serious like you remember your name, you know still remember your phone number, but you like
*  What's my keys to do a little bit of a drug? It's a little hit. Oh, yeah
*  Yeah, I mean one of my eyes just shut down. Yeah
*  And I like it like how far can we go there's something about doing something it's like I
*  Think when you have addiction you want to do something that harms you, you know, you know what it is
*  Yeah, you want to fucking cuz it's control. It's like I want to control how I feel. So even if how I feel isn't great
*  The there's a weird
*  Juxtaposition where it's like if I have control over it then that's
*  It's almost like you're the devil that's trying to kill you, you know make any sense
*  So if you have control like so you have anxiety and you're worried about things and so in order to
*  Kind of mitigate that you do a little bit of damage to yourself. So you have control over the damage
*  Yeah, there's something about having control about how you feel. So even if you feel damaged you still did it to yourself. There's like I
*  Don't know man. I'm doing the worst job. No, I know what you're saying
*  The self-destructive tendencies yes a big part of addiction, you know, yes self-destructive it's like
*  just
*  Things are feel so hectic right now. At least if I damage myself then I'm the one doing it
*  I'm not just letting the world do it right there's in in the moment. You don't see that that doesn't have any value
*  Afterward you're like shit that was dumb. But in the moment that feels like at least I'm taking control of the situation
*  I think sometimes you spend too much time alone
*  Me personally. Yeah, I think that's probably true. Yeah, I think knowing you and being your friend for many years now
*  Um, I think when you struggle is when you buy yourself too much
*  Yeah, because when you're with everybody else everybody loves you we all have fun together
*  I've said it before and I said it I'll say it again. We need that
*  Especially us especially comedians
*  We need to be around people that are just like us like you don't have to worry
*  We could just talk shit and laugh and have fun. There's no like wondering where we stand with each other
*  It's always fun. You need a home base man
*  Yeah, you know and you were you were doing better when you were at the Comedy Store all the time because you're around us all the
*  Time we're all around each other
*  We were all we knew there was a place we can go or we could find like-minded people and have a laugh
*  You know, yeah on a regular basis
*  Which is like we're so fortunate most people don't have a place
*  Where they can go where they're guaranteed to see people that they love and you're gonna have a good time and kiss be silly with
*  Each other and then you're watching all these sets. Everybody's going on stage with that energy. And so there's all this fun killing in the air
*  Yeah, I mean mothership is fun, man
*  I
*  Wouldn't want to look for a place. I just haven't had the time
*  Let me ask you this year's been the craziest year, you know, it's just been a crazy year
*  And so it's like well, it's good to be crazy because you're busy and you're doing great stuff
*  Yes, it's fun. I guess it's killing it. It's been scary. You know, it's been fun
*  You know, I appreciate the couple times, you know, you've messaged me after a couple episodes and said hey, man
*  That was you I like that or something. I really appreciate I want to let you know that I really appreciate that
*  Oh, well, I appreciate what you're doing. I'm very very proud of you
*  I'd love to see how much you've worked at it and how your podcast just keeps growing in the ranks. It's really good, man
*  It's very authentic. It's a perfect podcast in that it's really you you you know how to be you you real authentic
*  Even if you're talking to Trump you're being you you're talking about to a cocaine with former President Trump
*  I know new newly elected President Trump. So it's like I just want to have a voice, you know
*  I always just wanted to have a voice ever and I even I just wanted I don't know you want to be able to express yourself
*  Yes. Yeah, I just wanted things to be fair and I just want to express I just like yeah
*  There was always this feeling inside of me like I don't have a I can't speak up for myself
*  You know and so like I think and even if I'm just listening to somebody but letting them speak
*  It's like there's still like something that you know, it means it's like I can't explain it
*  But it's like um, it's so it's like I don't know it means something to me
*  Yeah, I think these kind of conversations are very good for you like conversations that you're having conversations that I'm having
*  I think they're good for you. You get to you get a chance to communicate with people that are, you know
*  really interesting unique people that have
*  Live completely different lives than you. I got Brian Cox on the other day explaining the universe to me fucking
*  I couldn't I was like a kid in a candy store. It's like it's so exciting to get this guy's it's like
*  Super intelligent person who's also a really good communicator could break down the fabric of the universe for you
*  What we know about it being like when does anybody ever get that opportunity to sit down and talk to someone I have three hours
*  Yeah, man
*  Did I had a lady who had been driving cats across the country for two years in a fucking tour bus, right?
*  And they perform and they do music
*  Right and bro, I'm not talking to you it was one of the most fascinating things I've ever heard in my life
*  Oh, yeah, cuz her commitment to it. Mm-hmm
*  She got her CDL so she could drive the fucking bus because it was so expensive
*  What's the CDL commercial driver's license? Oh, and she goes around doing a feline shows from around the whole country
*  And she's been doing it for 15
*  Whoever hey grab him by the pussy probably that guy, you know that crazy cat ladies that there's a reason for that
*  It's the same reason that like it's a cat parasite
*  Toxoplasmosis she was saying it's a it's a medical ailment makes you a man. No makes you aggressive
*  Yeah, I bet a lot like that's that term cat lady crazy cat lady. That's a real thing. That lady's got a parasite
*  She's got a brain parasite
*  Toxoplasmosis you can't tell them that I bet I could test them. Oh, you get a cheek swab. Hold that lady down
*  Give me a cheek swab. I guarantee you that lady's got it. Oh that lady
*  What do you I used to live with a dude, bro?
*  I used to live with this dude, right and I ended up doing fucking a lot of drugs or something whatever and I fucking
*  Cut a window into my closet dude, and it was to the neighbor's apartment. I thought it went outside
*  I got kicked out. Oh my god before that I live with this dude and he would get really
*  You're that lady in the apartment next door and you hear a saw
*  Her her her her
*  So it's got no hole in your fucking apartment
*  Yeah, man, I just that's the crazy thing about apartments, right? What's the thing about cocaine?
*  Been up for fucking
*  42 hours
*  You want to hear something crazy Trump at the day of the election Dana White told me he'd been up for 72 hours
*  unbelievable I
*  Go how's that possible? He goes dude. He's a freak. It's so weird. Well. Yeah, I'll say some things here's things that like
*  Whatever you think about
*  There's things that the guy is as resilient
*  No one could go through all that shit when the Justice Department started to fuck him over
*  That's when a lot of people were like, you know what?
*  the judge the only thing we should be able to believe in in this country is at least the
*  Justice system and if they're fucking him over right and then he got shot at a couple of times, dude
*  He's he's a quarter of 50 cent. Yeah, you know what I'm saying. He's like
*  So it's like out what else does it you know at a certain point you just like I got a bet on this dog
*  Yeah, you know, even if it's like you don't even like
*  It's like this motherfucker
*  This dude you got a bet on that dog at it if not, it's just bizarre, you know
*  I mean the guy gets up and says fight fight fight after you got shot in the ear. He's not freaking out
*  He's oh my god. I got shot. Give me out of here. They're shooting. He looks no stop stop fight. Yeah fight
*  Dude, I stubbed my toe. I called my assistant a faggot
*  So yeah
*  There's something special about that guy
*  You know and if you're lying about him and I know you're lying about him
*  Why am I supposed to trust you that you're lying for a good reason?
*  Right if you keep repeating these same hoaxes they keep repeating Obama was repeating at one of his speeches
*  He said about those white supremacists the very fine men on both sides. That's not true. Yeah, it's not true
*  Well, why I don't understand why?
*  Left-leaning leap media, which is mostly Jewish are calling people white supremacists, dude
*  Yeah, it's on our staff wing media is mostly Jewish I mean according to my Jewish friends, you know
*  But why do they hate white guys, it's just woke things man. It's just virtue woke bullshit
*  It's like the let's understand it. Well because the the hierarchies is have experienced a polar shift
*  Okay, so here's what it is if you go back to the 1960s
*  The kind of racism that people faced like before the race riots and all that was horrific
*  Because it's just a hundred years removed from slavery ending and the echoes of that. Oh, it's still in our genes
*  Yes, but the echoes of that were much more much more prevalent then and so
*  Black people were heavily discriminated against gay people were heavily discriminated against
*  People recognize that that's wrong young people go to universities. They get taught that it's wrong
*  They recognize the sins of the past and then they overcorrect and by over correcting now you favor
*  People that you think have been previously marginalized so you give people like to Vivek calls it the tyranny of the oppressed
*  So the oppressed the previously oppressed now have a social hierarchy a stand
*  They're higher level if you're a black trans woman you get to say the things first at the meeting
*  You know, let the black trans woman talk
*  There's a hierarchy in all woke culture, right?
*  And if you are a white male who's heterosexual you have to be non-binary because otherwise you can't get in you got it
*  You got to be a they them because then now okay now you're marginalized like all you
*  That's the lowest level of entry is
*  Non-binary straight man you just say you're non-binary and they'll again you just say I just don't feel like a man or one me
*  Why you fuck chicks? You're uh, you know what you're doing you little chameleon? Yeah, you're just
*  Care-bearer or whatever you're sneaking around but there's
*  Hierarchies and gay people because gay people have been previously oppressed gay people weren't even allowed even in
*  2013 up to then
*  Hillary Clinton and Obama
*  Both said that marriage should be between a man and a woman
*  We have to realize that this was like 11 fucking years ago
*  That was their political talking points marriage should be between a man and woman
*  So now kids realize how stupid that is
*  Young kids generally have a much better sense of the errors of the past
*  Yeah, then we do unless we're paying attention as we get older. We pay more attention to what's going on before but now kids
*  Immediately are aware of how fucked up
*  Colonial society has been how they've conquered North America killed the indigenous people
*  So they this they want to like re correct things
*  Oh, yeah, if I was ever in office, dude, the Native Americans are getting a lot of shit back immediately, dude
*  Well, they're you know, huh?
*  Yeah, but did they want casinos? I wanted I wanted to have back whatever they want
*  Well, they're getting back. They're getting the rivers back. They're getting the lakes back. They were taking it from each other to do
*  No, I agree everybody I have Native Americans were like everybody's just like whistling and just shaking hands, but they were fighting
*  Yeah, a hundred percent, but you'd have to figure out like who owned it like at that time
*  Yeah
*  And give it back to them and then you would have to let all those other people try to kill them and get it back
*  Because if you want to go back to the old ways, that's the old ways
*  You want to go back to when the Comanche ran Texas like okay, good luck
*  But you know what the Comanche's favorite thing was doing?
*  Raiding other tribes. They loved that they were gangbangers. Yeah, they were gangbangers
*  They would show up in other tribes and slaughter people and that they wouldn't just slaughter people
*  They would torture them they would cut their arms and legs off throw them on a pile of fire
*  Nobody ever surrendered ever because they knew that there was no leniency. You're gonna be tortured and killed
*  Oh, she had a fight to the death 100% fight
*  Not being able to surrender because you had no choice but to fight to the death
*  That's the concept of a surrender was completely alien to Native Americans
*  They fought to the fucking death and they fought each other to the death and there was battles between all of them and they
*  Conquered and they made alliances and you know, especially Little Bighorn
*  They all got together and fucked up Custer
*  But there's so many different tribes that conquered so many different and you'd have to go back to when right you like when well
*  You got it because you killed all these people. Let's go back to the Algonquin's. Let's give it to the fucking Apaches
*  Let's get like you'd have to figure it out man. Like this was yeah, this was a
*  Tickle a dream catcher to get the truth. This was really like in some ways other than the violence
*  It was like a utopian existence
*  It was these people followed the buffalo around ate every part of it
*  Used their skins to make their houses
*  Traveled on horseback following them around they didn't even make art dude. The the Comanche didn't make art
*  They didn't make any why they were just warriors just warriors eating meat
*  All they did was eat buffalo and kill everybody else
*  So if you so so is it weird that we feel bad about that? Like is that a trap?
*  Like that's what I'm wondering. Does that make does that question make sense? Well, that was the way they lived
*  You know, I mean is that better than drone bombs in Yemen, you know when we sit here comfortably in this fucking Austin warehouse
*  Is it better? Is that better? No, the whole thing is fucked. It's fucked that Gaza's going on
*  It's fucked that they're using these these poor Ukrainians like fucking meat for the Russian war machine the whole thing's crazy
*  It's all bad. But the crazy that was going on back then was a one-on-one crazy
*  It's a different kind of crazy
*  It was like there was an understanding that if you saw somebody and they had horses or they had these that you're gonna go kill
*  Them and take that thing from them
*  And if you knew that there was a camp and the camp was over the top of the ridge
*  And they would be in bed at night you would come in the middle of night and slaughter
*  Oh, yes, and they did that to each other. They did that to each other
*  So it was a horrific way of existing because sometimes there's this there's this vision that you um
*  Romanicize that culture right? I do that a lot. I romanticize things that I don't know about right? Mm-hmm
*  Because there just seems like something like oh, that's romantic or something, you know
*  These were this was a culture of war it was fucking hide-and-go-seek for real
*  It was culture of warriors like this whole country was filled with no matter nomadic warriors
*  Yeah, and most of them got killed by fucking smallpox
*  That's what's the crazy most of them have got killed by the flu and all sorts of diseases that came over with the Europeans
*  How gay must that have felt dude your fucking warrior, right?
*  I
*  Go to the training depot to drop off some fucking skins some dude sneezes on you and that's a wrap
*  Training all day dude
*  Some guy just fucking doesn't wash his feet for half an afternoon
*  I just came here off a boat stinky bitches breathing shit shit air and drinking shit water
*  You know like imagine the hygiene on those boats Oh Columbus's ship the first burning man, dude
*  That place was a dumb dude. I heard the penta didn't even have any chicks on it
*  It's like there's an example Columbus is an example. Could you had done it?
*  I mean probably if you live back then that would have been a thing to do because you would have been bored
*  But you're in them
*  It's early morning to you would want to try you would want to try to see what it looks like to go across the ocean
*  If you're a young man and you just needed something in your life and you knew the dudes did it and you just eat beef jerky
*  For three months and you make it across the ocean and when you get to the other side is there's gold everywhere
*  They didn't even know where they were. Yeah, but if you read the accounts
*  There was a priest that traveled with them some sort of religious man that traveled with them
*  Oh, yeah, like a detailed diary of their the horrific things that Columbus's men did they bashed babies on the rocks?
*  They
*  Yeah, they told certain men why they had to give they had to give them their weight in gold and if they did they would chop
*  Dude's arms off in front of everybody
*  They enslaved these people and use them for their gold because these people had no use for gold
*  They didn't know how valuable gold was when they got to the Americans exactly exactly. Yeah
*  People they just slaughtered people. They just slaughtered people dude. There's horrific
*  Depictions of what Columbus's people did we romanticize I romanticize nature so much and it's really vulgar isn't it?
*  Well, it's just humans have always done this to each other and for all of human history
*  The strong groups of men with weapons invade people that aren't prepared and they take all their stuff and they conquer them
*  I mean, it's always happened. It's it's the the most common thing if you go back and look at history
*  There's a bunch of common things. There's
*  An increase in the complexity of architecture and the design of the cities. There's machines. There's all these different things
*  Improve but along the way the consistent thing is war
*  It's constantly happening from the beginning of time as early as we know tribes or battling other tribes
*  And back then when there wasn't that many people wasn't that many resources and you were competing to see whose genes spread
*  It's just natural he developed tools and weapons and then that's ingrained in our fucking DNA
*  So here we are in 2024 with iPhone 16 and Starlink and we're still locked into this tribal war
*  mindset because that's how humans evolved right and
*  That's the scariest thing about being alive today is that we're so advanced
*  We're so much more civilized than any other point in human history and yet
*  Same amount of people if not more are dying senselessly all the time, right?
*  Like we're civilized on the outside, but there's a part of us that is will always be uncivilized
*  Yeah, well the part of it is war right and other parts of the world are not as calm as us
*  You know, there's parts of the world that are very fucking dangerous. Yeah, they're the
*  You know, this place is the world where you can't go without getting robbed or shot. Yeah, first of all
*  If it's that bad Memphis is bad dude, it's where Elvis came from, huh?
*  any left changed
*  Where's Graceland actually Gracie, you know, it's crazy about Graceland
*  It's in Memphis and it's cool you go out they let you in the backyard after to smoke and Elvis is great
*  He's right there. You could smoke right in front of Elvis. You could smoke 17 centimeters from Elvis's grave or 80 centimeters
*  That movie that Elvis movie was so good which one are the ones I'm girlfriend where Tom Hanks plays the Colonel
*  Do you see that one? Oh, yeah with that dude was his name Austin Colonel. What's the winter's name that played Elvis?
*  Austin Butler is really good. Yeah, he fucking he nailed it. He was really good. You really believed that he was Elvis
*  What a crazy story. Yeah
*  Elvis was the first guy to get way too famous the first guy that was just
*  Way too famous. Yeah, like there was no one that famous before Elvis. No, there wasn't it
*  Well, yeah, there was Jesus probably who else maybe Jesus Constantine Jesus got his reps
*  Like he got his after was appreciation after he was gone. Yeah, you know sort of like Kurt Cobain
*  Yeah, kind of it's a good point, huh?
*  People love Kurt Cobain while he was alive, but I think they really appreciated him after he's dead
*  There's certain guys. What do you think you what?
*  What do you?
*  What are you gonna do what are you gonna do when you die?
*  We'll see about that, huh? Well, we'll see about that. That's what's interesting
*  Imagine if you really do go to heaven and st
*  Peter really is there with a book you're like this is
*  Crazy first thing you're thinking is this dude's gay as fuck. I think that robe
*  Some news has a checklist or whatever. It's like the most trying to get in a hide or whatever
*  You're the most enlightened being ever but you walk around with a robe on
*  Robes are stupid. I never want to wear a robe
*  Haven't wore a robe when if I have to go to like a massage place
*  You go to wear a robe before you take the robe off. I'm like, okay
*  You're gonna see me in my underwear in five minutes. So why don't we just do it now this flirting?
*  God be wearing a robe with a rope tie bro. Don't you know about pants?
*  You get yourself a pair of origin stretchy jeans, they're great man, they look like jeans, but they feel like fucking sweatpants God
*  Why you wearing a robe you think God's got that thing on him? What do you probably got a hog you think he created the universe?
*  Yeah, oh my god, but it's time that you would want it
*  Oh, but I bet if you would want it if you saw it, you'd want it
*  I wouldn't tell I wouldn't go up to it imagine. It just has a magical attraction
*  You're like, you're not even gay but everybody's gay for God
*  Hey, look, I'll tell you this I might walk up to it, but I put sunglasses on first dude
*  If God's real he made gay people anybody's yeah gays a choice. I think gay is a choice for some people
*  Let me be real clear about this. I think there's some people that are open-minded and say I'll try being gay for a while
*  It's not me. Maybe it's you Greg Fitzsimmons said he almost tried it and he panicked in the last minute ran away
*  Yeah, I would thought he had to be open-minded to do it
*  I feel like I feel like it's like a late night activity stuff doesn't happen at nine in the past one
*  Yeah past 1 a.m. I like to get to bed at a decent hour. My point is God made gay people
*  Yeah, so it's clear if God made everything he made people that are gay the craziest religious
*  Answer like Ben Shapiro gave me this answer. Mm-hmm
*  He said he thinks you should ignore don't do it because it's a sin just like you want to murder people
*  But you don't murder him like bro. How much do you want to murder people?
*  Because gay people want to fuck every day
*  Yeah, like you know who wants if you want to murder people every day check yourself in
*  That's that's a crazy comparison like the gay thing is literally your sexual expression
*  Like you're attracted to other guys. So like if you're not attracted to other guys
*  You think are you sure God wrote that down?
*  Like are you a 100% positive that God really thinks that's a bad idea?
*  But yet he made people that have that urge right? It wouldn't be it wouldn't be fair if he did that
*  It wouldn't be right, right?
*  I think the craziest thing is I think if you the first gay dude must have been like what's going on
*  You know like he's sitting there with his wife or whatever and his buddy comes over to like
*  You know to just look around or whatever cuz they know that much stuff back then and his buddy comes over just to like look
*  Around or tell him about it like an animal he saw or something. He just starts thinking man. I'm gonna fucking I bet
*  I'm gonna get this little rabbit. I bet it existed from the jump
*  Little rabbit. What do you think is a gay dude?
*  Get that little rabbit
*  I think gay guys have been here from the very beginning
*  Snort that little fuck you know why because I think human beings a little dirt oyster
*  What do you think if you're the if the thoughts have to come in here it something puts the thoughts in you
*  I think it starts in the thoughts. I don't think it starts in the DNA
*  Well it might start in the DNA too there was I think see if you find this I think was University of Rome
*  They proposed a theory that there was a variation of the X chromosome
*  That existed in women that are very promiscuous and that these very promiscuous women had a disproportionate
*  Amount of gay sons. Oh my god
*  Yeah
*  So the idea is that these women are just so they're so dick-hungry that it literally passes on through their genes
*  Where was it was it in road? It wasn't in Rhode Island was it no, but that's could happen in Rhode Island
*  Providence would be a good place for that. That's isn't there like a gay Mecca. That's yeah. Yeah
*  Provincetown I think yeah Jeff
*  Party there Jeff from this comedy store. I think Provincetown is Massachusetts, but there's I know what you're talking about
*  There's a thing in Rhode Island, then there's Fire Island in New York
*  But I think their thought was that the same gene that made women like really promiscuous
*  They wanted a bunch of different sexual partners. Mm-hmm this same that it might be actually a gene thing
*  Hmm. See the gene thing is weird man, because Brett Weinstein explained this to me
*  He said do you know the difference between a beautiful woman and a woman who's hot and I said no
*  I go what's the difference?
*  He was like a beautiful woman is a woman that you would want to have a long-term relationship and raise children with yeah
*  And then a hot woman like woman is wearing like very skimpy clothes and very like looks like she's right like really made
*  Up very the idea that that's attractive is that you could potentially spread your genes quickly
*  Without having any consequences
*  So the this person right right you wouldn't have to have a relationship with that person
*  But it would give you an opportunity to spread your genes like as primate just spray and stray kind of thing
*  Like Monsanto or whatever fertility the amount of children they have I think or something
*  I thought it was I thought it was the promiscuous women. I think
*  Does it say that there says that I hope that one of this is their interpretation. This is uh
*  Yeah, that's around the time gay gene survived evolution as it is carried by mothers who have more children, right?
*  But guess what if you have more kids it means you like dick. I
*  Think they were talking about
*  Miscuity though
*  However a study published by the Journal of sexual medicine found a correlation between gay men and the mothers
*  Their mothers and maternal aunts who are prone to have significantly more children compared to the maternal relatives of straight men. I
*  Think we need more gay men in some of these areas. Hold on a second. Doesn't that make sense though?
*  That would make sense like in terms of like natural selection because if you're someone who's like over
*  Having kids too many kids you have like ten children. All right, I would see how nature be like, you know
*  What we don't need to spread these genes as much. Let's make a couple of these gay
*  Right nature is like let's even things out right? Yeah. Oh, I think sense nature wants people to balance
*  Yes, that was balance
*  Yeah
*  And if someone has ten kids and everybody else has ten kids that could get out of hand real quick
*  So I can see how if you have a lot of kids nature be like, you know
*  Let me do this. What was that? Where was that study done from?
*  University of Rome
*  University of Padova in Italy, okay
*  And just as there's people that's gay there's people that are non-sexual at all really 100% which is stay out of the get
*  Stay out of the fight. You don't belong to 2a2 plus a
*  Yeah, whatever that is. So what is it? It's QBD. What is it?
*  LGBT LG B T Q 2a I
*  Plus a is asexual stay out of it. Yeah stay out of this. Yeah your fight
*  Yeah, they got it some people
*  It's not your fight. Yeah, you're just like
*  You don't even have sex with anybody
*  Yeah, what if you're just jerking off at your house? Are you in that or what?
*  Like what is that? Who are those people right? That's lonely sexual. Yeah an L. I think they're gonna put robots in there
*  You see that you see that robot cutting hay the other day
*  I did not pull that up if you don't mind with a scythe like the reader like a Reaper. Yeah, it was a
*  Little bit of like a not a slave bot or whatever
*  We're talking about robot bodyguards that in the future you'll have robot bodyguards. You can go anywhere you want
*  That'd be cool. But then like the second you start you got a run
*  They're gonna be like, all right, and then they'll run it's gonna take half a second half a second kills everything
*  I bet they just pick you up and they run with you. Wow, just carry you
*  There we go ideas not real that's not real
*  Jamie you're a party pooper
*  Super real you see that pod where they're killing me. That is so real. Yeah, that's real. Go back 100% that's coming
*  Okay, sure. But yeah, I
*  Mean all these folks that are coming over here for jobs
*  There's a lot of those jobs they're gonna be taken by like unskilled labor jobs are all gonna be robots
*  So but don't you think at a certain point that we shouldn't have that like at a certain point should an AI it does it?
*  If it doesn't help us be human that is from home. We should stop it. That's how I feel like oh, yeah
*  Yeah
*  But you're there now. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, they should stop the long time ago if you want humans to survive
*  Just stopped it a long time ago. Yeah, if you want the human race as it is now you want this to stay
*  It's that doesn't make sense because you're making something way better
*  You're 100% gonna make something and you're gonna give it autonomy and you're gonna give it sentience and it's gonna be infinitely smarter than us
*  It's not gonna be restricted by any biological needs. It's not gonna be greedy. It's not gonna be mean
*  It's not gonna be malicious, but it might decide we're useless
*  They might decide that it definitely doesn't need us polluting the ocean
*  Fucking up the fucking rivers and risky. Yeah nuclear waste. It's gonna be like, what are you doing? You morons? Why are you idiots?
*  Cracking atoms stay out of that. Well, you don't even know what you're doing
*  Here's here's free porn and a fucking VR mask just
*  You give you free food have a blast. Yeah, you stop breeding. Well, they're population will just drop off a cliff
*  They just I saw um
*  they um
*  Were we talking about a second ago robots, yeah
*  They're killing the airport you want another yeah, I'll take another one man. I need another soda or something
*  You got anything on you in here we got coffee wants to get on the kill cliff if you got one
*  Want some coffee you might as that coffee? Yeah
*  Yeah, it's a clean mug. It is warm coffee. I came out of the dishwasher
*  Why do you poured it with one hand trapped underneath that arm?
*  Challenging myself as
*  Restability that was all wrist you didn't move your arm at all, dude. You were all wrist on that. Yeah
*  It's hard to do man, thank you that's what the wrist is the weakest link you ever do right? Yeah curls
*  I'm shocked at how weak bitch ass my wrist. Oh, it's amazing. Well, it's amazing whenever you take like
*  Jiu-jitsu classes how the first thing you start to learn is control the wrist. Oh, it's crazy changes everything
*  Especially guys with big hands. Yeah, grab like a guy with a basketball player style hands
*  There's this dude named semi shilt. He used to fight in the UFC semi semi shilt
*  He was seven feet tall. Oh wow, and the problem was semi is if you got on top of him
*  He just grabs your wrists. You can't get your hands free
*  Yeah fucking baseball mitts for hands just wrapped his hands around you that's semi shilt Wow
*  He was K1 Grand Prix winner. I'm like he looks like Zach Brian a little seven foot tall. He was a beast dude
*  fought in MMA to
*  Wasn't wasn't a good grappler
*  Unfortunately, that was kind of his downfall but had a nasty front kick to the body. Yeah, he fought Peter
*  He fought everybody man. Sammy was good and he was real tall and real good at like utilizing that height Wow
*  It would seem like I would be scared to be that tall in MMA cuz you'd there be more of you to be attacked by
*  Sort of but you're way further away
*  You know like the whole thing is distance where you could effectively strike them and they can't strike you
*  Yeah
*  Like a guy built like John Jones has the perfect fighters frame because he's still very strong
*  He has a lot of muscle, but he's also long and lean
*  So he's not relatively bunk bulky compared to his weight because he's long and stretched out
*  Yeah
*  So he can hit you from here and you can only hit him from here
*  This just this amount of distance is so huge if you have a distance of like that much between where a guy can hit
*  you and you can't hit him you have to cross that and
*  You're so vulnerable while crossing that and if a guy's a good counter striker and he's active and he's long
*  They're so so hard to get in on so a guy like John that that's always gonna be an advantage
*  And then with John if you do get it on that's no picnic because he's an elite grappler
*  So he's gonna strangle you he's gonna throw you to the ground
*  So like you have your fucked you're in this fuck zone on the outside is kicking this shit out of your knees
*  John's on the nastiest like side kicking people's knees. Yeah. Yeah most dangerous guy
*  Very dangerous people say that he's Dana White's favorite fighter. Is that the truth?
*  Do you think or is it just Dana White says he's the greatest of all time, right? Which a lot of people say
*  Yeah, I don't I go back and forth on what I think the greatest of all time means
*  But if you want to that's a good question
*  If you want to say like who dominated his division longer than anybody who beat everybody that was ever any good in his division
*  And who never lost that's John Jones
*  The only time you could say he had a controversial decision was the Dominic Reyes fight. It was Dominic Reyes was coming up
*  He was in his prime. It was a really good fight a really close fight
*  But John won what I think was a split decision and then he had a split decision with a Tiago Silva
*  Tiago Santos, but Tiago Santos
*  He blew out both of Tiago's knees Tiago needed knee surgery on both of his knees after that fight
*  I think that was a split decision. That's the bottom line is John won all those fights and then you know
*  He wins the heavyweight title too. It's it's tough to argue. He's not the greatest of all time. Yeah, I
*  Say, you know if you had to only pick one I would pick John
*  But I don't like only picking one because there's a bunch of reasons why other guys are in this elite class of being considered as possibly
*  The greatest of all time
*  I always say Mighty Mouse
*  Because Mighty Mouse would do things where you like what the fuck did he just do he when he fought Ray Borg
*  He tossed him in the air and caught him in a fucking armbar on the way down. Oh god. You ever see that?
*  No, I never seen that. It's one of the craziest things
*  I've ever seen a guy do inside the cage
*  He threw this dude through the air and caught a flying armbar in the air fuck
*  It's so fast like when it turned to me. It's like when I just think watch this throws him
*  Bro, wow, dude, bro, bro. If that dude ain't good at gift-wrapping you got the wrong guy
*  I'm crazy that is what look how crazy this is in the middle of the air
*  He switches to an armbar on an elite fighter in a world championship fight. That's like a stunt
*  That's like a stunt move if you saw that in a movie be like shut the fuck up. Nobody can do that, right?
*  He did it in an MMA championship fight where he was dominating the fight
*  Yeah, it's crazy how many of those guys would be like or like Hollywood stuntman, you know
*  And then you got a you also got a like if you just look on record
*  This is where it gets crazy if you just look on record of accomplishments against champions. Mm-hmm
*  You kind of have to put Alex Pereira already in the conversation of potential greatest of all time
*  Which is so crazy. He's one of only three two division champions, right?
*  He is how many how many have been to do you have Connor you have DC you have Alex I think that's it didn't to per
*  No, no, I think that's it
*  Amanda doing this that doesn't really count because 45 it does count but 45 is kind of a non-existent weight class
*  He doesn't exist. He's a hunter. She was fighting girls that could have fought 35
*  It's it's real but like 45 is the most one 45 for women is the most shallow division in MMA
*  So yes, you would say Amanda too. So it's a small percentage of people that have achieved that and he achieved it in record time
*  He's knocked out so many fucking champions knocked out Jamal
*  He'll not beat the shit out of Yuri Prohasco knocked him out in the second. That was crazy bro
*  hunted him bro
*  That guy's unbelievable watching him. He's a fucking monster dude. He's a monster. He's a force
*  What he did to Khalil roundtree was a clinic Khalil's amazing
*  Amazing to do that to a guy like Khalil like that was a clinic in like elite world-class
*  MMA and at first the first two rounds you're like, what is this? Like what's going on Khalil's in it?
*  They're both in it. But then you start to see that
*  Purr is hunting. It's like this hunting. Yeah, the pressure never ends. Yeah, and you're like, oh my god
*  it's like literally watching one of those snake like a snake when they're just kind of like
*  Like did you see that snake that ate that deer is like a 77 pound deer or whatever?
*  You did course I see all that shit just
*  Bring that up bring that big dog
*  I'm glad he says snake because that's kind of how Pereira moves
*  He moves like a snake like he pulls back and then he strikes forward he pulls back
*  He's a master at just getting right outside of your shots and then his shots are coming in right behind him and he operates at
*  His own speed. He's almost like Alvin Camaro is a football player that does that he operates at his it's a speed
*  You've never seen it looks normal, but it's different
*  Well, it varies a lot to like sometimes he moves fast and sometimes he moves slow. It's very hypnotic. Yes, it's hypnotic
*  It's also unique. He's got a unique frame
*  So he kind of looks he moves different on design
*  Like he doesn't switch his hips when he throws kicks so you don't see him come until it's too late, right?
*  So he's standing in front of you only kicks. There's no movement of his shoulders
*  He's just throwing these kicks out and they land and they're not as hard as if he put his whole body into it
*  But it's hard enough where you're like, oh no
*  And you get hit with a couple of those three four or five of those all of a sudden you're like
*  I can't walk anymore and now he's hunting you and he's hunting you
*  Yeah, I would put him already in the car
*  I don't think he's better than John Jones greatest of all time
*  But I already put him in the conversation as a potential grace of all-time nominee. Oh, he's fucking he's right there
*  He's the male Katniss Everdeen. He's only been in MMA for a few years a hunter and he's only been in the UFC for a few
*  Yeah, it's crazy
*  couple of MMA fights other than the UFC and then the UFC for this run at the top of the division just
*  Smashing everyone to obliterate. So then you got Khabib undefeated. Oh, yeah
*  You know, what is it? What is it? The greatest to do? Oh George Sam here another two division champion
*  That's right. George won at 85 as well. That's what I almost forgot George
*  Yeah, so George one of the greatest of all times for sure. Yeah, I saw that conversation
*  I got to see him in in Canada Anderson in his prime
*  Anderson his prime is in that conversation
*  You got to look at him like in there in the moment whenever there's a moment a time period
*  Like this amount of years to that amount of years. Well, it's all agreed that this is the prime forget about when they should have retired
*  Let that go. Yeah, just talk about them what they're at their best. Who is the best? That's a good point
*  Yeah
*  Because everybody that's doing great you want to stay as long as you can it would be weird if you didn't probably can't judge them
*  By how they were when they should have gotten out because it's just a foolish endeavor
*  They shouldn't have been fighting a killer at 20 at 42 years old, you know natural and it's timing too
*  Yeah, there's but there's just a lot when fighters fight late into their career. You got a kind of
*  You got a kind of a race that when you think about their ultimate expression
*  Yeah, I feel like their prime is their ultimate. It's everything they could do. They did everything right?
*  They crossed every T. They measured all their food
*  They fucking did the cryo chamber and they did saunas every day and got massages and were sparring and doing strength and conditioning
*  Drills and they were going over moves their coaches. They had a battle plan
*  Everything so those guys you can only do that for so long
*  There's that's like a nine year at the best when you're at the so you gotta look like in that when like fador in pride
*  You got to look in that window. Don't look at fador now and you know
*  Guys are knocking him out and it's just not the same. He's an old guy
*  He's been beaten up a bunch of times still a bad motherfucker, but it's not not that dude
*  Who's running pride in the early 2000s, right?
*  It's not fair. Yeah, you got to look at them when they're in BJ Penn at his best
*  Yeah, the BJ Penn for a few years I say is as good as I know you talk about him a lot
*  I've heard you speak about dude just had us in this when he was in his prime
*  It was just a matter of was BJ gonna get him in the first round
*  Was he gonna get him in the second round BJ was?
*  hyper aggressive and just
*  Unbelievably talent. I wasn't watching back then and dexterity dude. He had crazy dexterity. He's the governor of Maui, isn't here?
*  No, no, no, no, he was running for the governor of Hawaii. Did he win? No, he didn't win. Oh
*  No, I went to Maui not too long ago maybe four months ago Maui's awesome
*  Yeah, it's all but we went to the place where the hurricane where the fires were. It blew my mind man
*  It's still nothing right? It was unbelievable. Yeah, it was it was just like
*  it was unbelievable to see what it occurred, you know, and just like
*  It's crazy how quickly we just as like
*  How we move past certain tragedies, you know, like we don't mean to it's just the news cycle does and
*  You know, we get kind of addicted to the news cycle and so then it's kind of hard, you know
*  But it was I'll tell you one thing what the way the administration handled that I think
*  Put a bad taste in a lot of people's mouth while at the same time they're sending all that money to Ukraine
*  I think that was a big problem with the the Biden administration
*  When they did that I think you can't do that. You can't while you're sending all this money
*  Overseas ignore the people that are here because then it's like why do you why are you deciding in this manner?
*  That you don't want to help people that were hit with one of the biggest wildfire tragedies ever
*  Why are you why are you deciding to give them?
*  $700 like especially in one of the most beautiful places that our country has to even exist
*  It's like only that but you're not protecting them from potential land grabs, right?
*  Cuz one of the things that's going on with this is like they got to do
*  Insurance and they go through insurance and this and that but meanwhile these people are still paying mortgages
*  So like what happens and it's hard to figure out there Joe because a lot of people they live as like second and third generations
*  All living in the same home, right?
*  And they've also a lot of you know, how how Hawaii is they like they'll like take little pieces of land
*  It's like, you know people will build like something small and just live in somebody else's yard that kind of thing. It's very like
*  You know, well, there's only so much land but the problem is the land where that fire hit was very valuable
*  Oh, yeah, it's like this perfect like like that slope head and looking down at the ocean
*  What I would be fearful of and if I was someone that was working in the government that want to protect people from being victimized
*  I would say hey, let's make sure that this land doesn't get snatched up
*  Let's make sure that these people get their land back
*  That'd be the first thing I would say if they all want to sell out to a resort and they make a decision on their own
*  You know, that's one thing but if if they get hit with a wildfire and then all of a sudden it takes forever for them to rebuild
*  They don't have the finances to rebuild. Maybe there's a struggle with insurance. Who knows who knows?
*  Maybe didn't pay your insurance that month who knows and now all of a sudden this land gets snatched up and you're like, whoa
*  Yeah, because if they just like one of the things that the governor was talking about was like
*  Turning it into a park or something like that. What did he say acquiring it for the state?
*  What was his exact term that he said, but he said it like right after the tragedy. It was like dude
*  This not the time to say it. It's not the time to ever say it
*  It's not the time to ever say you're gonna take people's land and and turn it into a park
*  Well, they as they just got hit by a fire
*  So now you used to live in this amazing place with a killer view not anymore
*  Yeah, now the government's gonna take your land why because you got in a tragedy what?
*  Yeah, I got double fucked you got double fucked. You don't even get to keep the land. You can't even rebuild there
*  No, not anymore. There was a tragedy here. Like wait a minute
*  Well that I think that's a weird thing when you don't feel like as a person that your government is gonna support you
*  I think that's but that's probably like a feeling why that sounds like the opposite
*  It's like your government's trying to rob you right?
*  Like did you find it find the quote that he said?
*  I got it
*  We got to read the quote because the quote is like it made so many Hawaiians so pissed off
*  I'm Tulsi was so pissed off BJ was pissed off. Yeah, everybody was like, this is crazy
*  Like how can you say that right after a tragedy like this? Yeah, I remember I went there
*  I just walked up to the fire department that was like up the hill from there
*  Oh, man, and I just walked up and I was like, hey, I would like to is there any way that I could go see
*  What happened?
*  When I was looking for it this says that it's the video is shortened and it makes the comments
*  Distorted it distorts Hawaii governor's comments about the state buying land in Lahaina
*  So what are the actual what did he actually say though?
*  I'm already thinking about ways for the state to acquire that land
*  So that we could put it into workforce housing to put it back to families or to make it open spaces in
*  Perpetuity as a memorial to people who are lost
*  We want this to be something that we remember after the pain passes as a magic place and Lahaina will rebuild
*  The tragedy right now is the loss of life. The buildings can be rebuilt over time. Even the banyan tree may survive
*  But we don't want this to become a clear space where then yes people from overseas come and decide they're going to take it
*  The state will take it and preserve it first
*  Hmm
*  So maybe some of their goal maybe some of their goal is to preserve it on a second. Hold on a second. Say that again
*  Scroll back
*  This is interesting. We don't want this to become a clear space where then yes people from overseas
*  Come and decide they're going to take it. The state will take it and preserve it first
*  I think what they're probably worried about then is the banks grabbing it. So
*  Them saying that the state could take the land might be to prevent the banks from grabbing it by selling it and putting something there
*  But it still seems like overreach if you're living in the fucking place where the state's gonna take the land
*  Well, it'd be very scary as just a regular person like yeah, so I'm gonna lose
*  So I'm either gonna lose my right bland from to here or to here, right?
*  Like where am I going now? What am I doing?
*  You know and you don't hear anything about it
*  Yeah, you don't we looked it up once there was a time where the government accidentally over sent money to Ukraine
*  They sent them six billion dollars. They shouldn't have sent. Yeah, so we looked up
*  How much would it have cost to rebuild every house in Maui from the fires? It's five billion
*  So the extra money that they accidentally they could have Ukraine they could have sent there and rebuilt every house and had a billion dollars
*  left over
*  But but we give you seven hundred dollars
*  Unreal that's disgusting. That's disgusting
*  Like if you want us to pretend that we're all on the same team
*  You got to treat us all like we're on the same team
*  You can't like we throwing all this money into Ukraine and then there's places in America that suck and you're not doing anything to
*  Help these folks like you know, that's just yeah and people people say like well your tax dollars don't affect it
*  But at a certain point it's not even about that. It's just like do you not?
*  Like if I'm an American and I'm contributing to this business by being an American and being part of the system
*  Does the system not care about me, you know, but I guess everybody thinks about that in different ways
*  So well, I think whenever you have a system. I'm out of my mind system
*  You know systems a bunch of people and so when you have a bunch of people an enormous amount of people
*  It's too many people to think about as individuals you think about it as numbers and that's that's what the
*  That's like the sort of sociopath version of a government they just think of you as a number
*  Yeah
*  But when people start to lose their perp like if you start to lose your sense of being an American these starts
*  That's a that's big for a lot of people right like so then it's a sense of purpose, right?
*  One of the senses of purpose is I feel like that we get or like having a job having a family or somebody that loves you
*  Or that you love or having being a part of a country, right?
*  Being a part of a fabric of a society
*  And when those things start to erode some of those things and if you don't have any other ones to back it up then people get really rogue
*  You know, well they get rogue especially if they've been told by the mainstream media forever that if one side wins you're going to be in a right-wing
*  Fascist dictatorship. Yeah, that's just fucking pissing me off. I don't understand that. That should be a crime. It should be it
*  Well, it's the very least it's like slanderous like that's not it's not true. You can't back that up
*  That's not true. It's not true. It's not true. It's not true. It's not true
*  Like that's not it's not true. You can't back that up. That's not true
*  Like you're saying something that we have evidence of four years of him being a president and not doing that and what does fascist mean?
*  Let's look up the actual definition, but there's a bunch of different versions of it
*  It's usually connected to a right-wing authoritarian ideology and a the power of the state over people
*  And it gets twisted around a lot because it's also you could also say it's fascist to impose impose certain ideas on people
*  Demand certain speech which is which would make a lot of left-wing people fascist as well far right authoritarian and utilitarian
*  Ultra-national ultra-nationalist political ideology and movement characterized by a dictatorial leader centralized autocracy militarism
*  Forcible suppression of opposition belief in natural social hierarchy subordination of individual interests for the perceived good of the nation or race
*  And strong regimentation of society and economy opposed to an art anarchism democracy pluralism egalitarianism liberalism socialism and Marxism
*  Fascism is placed on the far right wing within the traditional left right wing spectrum
*  Who's doing all that?
*  No one is so it's like it's a bullshit term that you're throwing on a guy who has a different political philosophy than you
*  Put it back up again, please
*  It's like there's real fascists in the world. There's real there's really dangerous people that guy's not he's he's got a big ego
*  He says ridiculous things
*  Who are you talking about?
*  Trump it doesn't behave like a guy that you think of in a traditional sense of being the president
*  But no he just seems like just a older guy who kind of has like likes being Donald Trump
*  I think he loves me and Donald Trump, but I think he's got some good ideas that a lot of businessmen agree with
*  Well, I think you need a businessman to do this. It's not a it's not a we don't live in a like this like
*  Care bear world anymore ours our politics. It's become a dirty fucking business
*  Yeah, so you I think you want a businessman in there like I don't care if somebody like somebody's attitude
*  Can the guy do business then that's who I because it's not it's not it's all business now like we've been it's been sold out
*  It's like I don't feel like it's this I don't know. Does that make any sense, dude? Sorry, dude. I'm fucking having a day man
*  Don't apologize. I know what you're saying. I know what you're saying. Yeah, it is business, but like you want to shrewd business, man
*  I don't need Mary Poppins in there, right?
*  I don't need somebody to tell me everything's okay. I need just like I need somebody to make our fucking food safe
*  I need somebody to make our streets safe, right?
*  And that's all I really need like right
*  I feel like if I'm paying taxes
*  Then those are the things that I should expect that my FDA and that my police department
*  Which I'm paying for are gonna be able to
*  Make sure that I can raise a family and raise them healthily and make it home from work to see my children
*  I feel like I don't have any children yet
*  But I already feel you know, that's what I feel like people want I don't care about anything else
*  Yeah, I think most people feel the same way. They just want to be safe and happy
*  RFK jr. Tweeted something see if you can find that
*  Well, Adam McKay had a great great tweet did but our RFK treated like a message to
*  What is it the RFK one yeah, yeah
*  What's the matter bro, let's have in the worst day today, I got it right here if you want to sorry being a downer
*  No, you're not being a downer, but you keep wasn't it this yeah, I'm sorry, man
*  Look at that FDA's war on public health is about to end this includes its aggressive aggressive suppression of psychedelics peptides stem cells raw milk
*  hyperbaric therapies chelating compounds ivermectin
*  Hydroxychloroquine vitamins clean foods sunshine exercise
*  Nutraceuticals and anything else that advances human health and can't be patented by pharma if you work for the FDA and are a part
*  Of this corrupt system. I have two messages for you. Number one preserve your records and number two pack your bags
*  That's that's crazy about trump-winning that's what's crazy
*  Yeah, that's the thing I like and then you got people like Tulsi
*  That's you know that's that's the type of person you want congresswoman
*  Yeah for eight years like impeccable character, and then you've got the vague who's a genius you got JD Vance
*  He's fucking brilliant as well. Oh, he's great. So you have a bunch of good people with him this go-around
*  Well, yeah, it's like we gotta like get people off each other's necks man. You know that's what we got to do
*  We got to get people to like stop attacking each other. It's so crazy
*  Well, I thought a sense of like even after the election was over at that felt like people everything just felt kind of calm
*  Yeah, well, it's a team thing dude. It's like your team lost
*  It really is it's these people that are super addicted to politics. They're like people who don't fall sports
*  Yeah, never played any games. Then this is the the way they compete they compete for the most important thing
*  Like who gets to dictate the the tone of the country right right?
*  I've never expected politics to have any effect on my life
*  You know even when I was a kid I didn't you know my mom told us don't ever depend on the government for anything
*  You know it's like you just you have to do it. You just have to figure it out
*  You know yeah like they used to have some rich dude or whatever like like our street
*  It would like cut between like the highway and like this other road where people would go and so
*  They had a guy who was like a veterinarian or whatever and he would go down our street
*  he would stop and throw out like
*  These like and he was a
*  Veterinarian and he would throw out like animal carcasses into our ditch and shit, right?
*  So we... Jesus Christ like dead cats and shit?
*  Yeah dead animals, you know different animals nothing really
*  I would say medium-sized, you know, probably 32 waist and lower, right?
*  He would throw those bitches out into the huck and I guess just get rid of them and our neighborhood was like the poor
*  Neighborhood so it's like who gives a fuck about these people, right?
*  What an asshole
*  Totally, but we call them on the street
*  Just throw them on the streets throw them in the ditch
*  But we call the police and they'd be like, yeah, well help and they would never come, you know
*  And my mom was like don't ever I remember telling us do not ever expect the government to fucking help you do anything
*  You have to do shit yourself, you know
*  Also cops don't want to take dead animals and fucking pick it up and put in a bag
*  Like that's not what they signed up for. Yeah, I don't know and then they're not busy
*  Let's see what kind of animal is this
*  Yeah
*  Veterinary and he would just throw those bitches and sometimes we it would be you know after they died or whatever like
*  after they like
*  You know after the bones got blanced or whatever by the Sun we would fucking throw, you know do like games or shit
*  But nothing what you know throw each other you fucking do you guys throwing bones at each other?
*  Fuck is six rib cages there. Yeah
*  Welcome to Haiti, dude
*  Get sick a lot got immunized by the all the bacteria and finding dead animals
*  Yeah, we had a good time but nothing like that snake
*  I had in that ditch bring that thing back up there how many fucking kids that get helicopter parented get allergic to more shit
*  Because they don't get exposed to things they're not crawling around
*  Playing in dirt and shit all that stuff's probably got to be good for your body
*  Right when you're little kids, especially playing in dirt playing outside
*  Oh, yeah, if you're just sheltered or whatever yeah, just for your biome. It's got to be good for you
*  Yeah, I'm trying to think of what was in our biome or whatever
*  You know I gotta ask my mom I guess
*  Yeah, that snake was crazy. That's the crazy thing to me man. I've seen a snake eat something like that
*  Do you know how many snakes there are in the Everglades?
*  There's more
*  More pythons in the Everglades, I would guess 150. Oh, no, that's even lower bet. I would bet 200,000 500
*  That's just a rough estimation that could be off by a factor of who fucking knows they don't really know
*  It's dense dense dense dense jungle. Yeah, and the guy you're asking is probably like here's probably fine
*  This dude in here python cowboy he goes and hunts for him
*  He's got a dog and the dog will find the nests
*  He's pulling these giant ass pythons out of nest that dogs been sexually assaulted I bet I'll say that dude that dog's a psychopath
*  Yeah, going after something that could easily swallow it
*  Yeah, that's a 77 pound deer you see that yeah, I think is a damn sixth grader dude. They'd alligators
*  That's great. This is the crazy thing because of the introduction of pythons into the Everglades
*  90% of all the mammals are missing
*  There's no mammals anymore. Oh, they ate them all they ate them all this 90% are missing
*  How long does it how long does it take a snake to eat something that big?
*  Well, the thing is the number of snakes like it's the perfect environment for those animals
*  Like it's like they just dropped off in paradise. Nothing eats them. There's no crocodiles snakes. Yeah, they're living
*  Yeah, so some alligators must eat some of them. But how long does it take a snake to eat something? Look at this
*  2012 study found that
*  Populations of raccoon had declined 99.3%
*  Apostles 98.9% and bobcats
*  87.5% since 1997 marsh rabbits cottontail rabbits and foxes
*  Effectively disappeared over that time. Got it. So they've essentially
*  Eradicated all the rabbits and the foxes, but how long does it like I mean, it's unbelievable
*  But how long that's Satan working as well and how long does it take?
*  How long does it take a snake to digest like how long does it take once it gets that deer?
*  Right question. I wonder I know that like is it days or is it like weeks?
*  Let's guess okay, um a full deer
*  One week. I say one week. Oh, that's pretty good guess. I was like antlers and shit and yeah
*  Wish I guess that do you think they swallowed antlers? Do they go to for the bucks and swallow antlers?
*  Well, I've been imagine swallowing you feel like such an asshole when the antler was going down you'd be like, oh my god
*  I can't believe I swallowed the antler. That's gonna take forever to break down
*  He's gonna be rolling around with antlers inside your chest
*  Everywhere you go. Oh
*  Revenge of that no comfortable way to sleep. What do they do with the antlers man? Well, they must die
*  I'm sure they just get to that point and the rest of the body's D is D
*  Well, the antler is just bone but it's so pokey like look at it I would bet three weeks
*  Nature gives them
*  weapons for a few months
*  This is what what happens with a deer like and when they stop breeding these fall off every year
*  So these you find them on the ground. They call me heads. You can only defend yourself while you're breeding
*  Exactly and it's offensive as much as it's defensive they run at each other and clash you see him fighting it happens all the time
*  It's pretty fucking cool. They go after each other and just fuck each other up and yeah, they'll see him sometimes hooked together
*  Yeah, I mean nature's danger and make nature is really blow really
*  Unbelievable. What's the that's the number one person in the world?
*  I saw a horrible video of these two deer that got locked together
*  So they're clashing antlers they got locked together and one of them got eaten by a coyote
*  So one was still alive connected to this body couldn't get away while the other one got torn apart by a coyote
*  And it was just dumb luck that the coyotes picked him versus that because neither one of them can get away
*  The coyotes recognized they were locked into each other and just picked one and went after him just gutted him
*  That's like we're in a threesome, but nobody wants to touch you know
*  He's trying to eat one with antlers and got got fucked up. Oh god. Oh it cut his own body open bales on it
*  Oh, it split his body wide open. Oh my god. Oh look at his mouth. He's got the antlers stuck through his fucking jaw I
*  Would hate some I hate it when people always slid off of it Wow
*  I hate it when people take a long time to eat you know went right through them
*  But don't you hate that they're like when you're eating and somebody um
*  You're done eating and they're still eating that doesn't bother me at all
*  Yeah, why it doesn't bother me even a little bit really no yeah like you're at a restaurant
*  They're done right they're done. You have to fucking you're done, and they're right still just yeah
*  We'll just talk to them. Yeah, but then you cut you feel like you have to pretend like you're still like scraping your bowl or whatever
*  You know
*  No, you're thinking too much. I think it's crazy to sit there watch somebody eat. That's for you
*  Why
*  Dude, they're eating yeah, but you were eating with them, too. Yeah, but you're done. So what now?
*  You're just gonna fucking look. I'm just gonna look at him like how is it tell me about each bite
*  Yeah, I just I feel like if somebody's already if I don't like I don't like when people eat real slow
*  Okay, makes me nervous. Well. You should just like be real clear about that before you go out with someone like let's eat
*  Like we can eat together, but I got this thing like when I'm done you're done
*  Imagine if you like super reasonable boyfriend in every other way, but you just had this rule when I'm done eating no one needs
*  And she's like well. This is bullshit like I know it sounds crazy. I can't kick it. It's I have a tick
*  Have a psychological problem
*  I can't just sit there so when I'm done eating you have to be done, and I don't eat fast
*  I don't eat fast, but I'm warning you when that fucking bell rings
*  Bone epitimes up dude that would be the weirdest thing that you're obsessed with
*  You have to you have to end at the exact same time last bite that kind of shit
*  Yeah, I just that would make me I just yeah that kind of stuff some little things kind of make me uncomfortable dude
*  but that uh
*  What else is I thinking about?
*  Pythons yeah pythons whales or whatever big animals dude
*  it's crazy like how they have all those Airbnb's now where it's like you can stay in like a
*  Like a hollowed out whale carcass out here on the party
*  Like Airbnb's bring up some Airbnb's
*  They've gotten weird. It's like welcome to this. It's like oh, it's like welcome to this two-story whale carcass down here at
*  Punta Verde Mexico they make up it's like
*  Punta saw every month there's a new punta in Mexico you're like what the fuck are we doing?
*  We named a city every time is like welcome to fucking punta pescado
*  Mexico you want to stay in this two-bedroom?
*  The giant potato what is that what did they call it?
*  Okay, ten weirdest Airbnb listings let you sleep in a shoe an elephant and a flying saucer. Yeah
*  Let's go to the flying saucer. Oh
*  That's yours dude, bro if I wasn't married out of the stupidest house my house would be one of two things
*  I'd either have it built into the side of a hill like the hobbit. Oh
*  That we kind of dope or I would go full spaceship. Yeah
*  Yeah, house where a 16 year old boy would see it be like dude
*  Yeah, yeah, just appear to the child in you like kid rocks vibe
*  Totally rocks, but kid rocks White House. I maintain is the coolest celebrity house. I've ever been it's one of one man

*  I'll just show up at your house
*  And you look sad in front of your wife too you're like and you're tying it down think think think
*  Think think think and then you realize and you're just sleeping in a little cloth house. Yeah in the woods
*  Hey, buddy
*  Yeah, there's an Airbnb tent. That's nice. That's probably in Austin. You can fucking this tent bro. Fuck. Yeah
*  You ever did a lot of fucking outdoors or what was your life like fuck? It's the way to go. I ain't scared of mosquitoes
*  I'm an outdoor fucker whenever possible. Did you ever do any when you were young?
*  Yeah, he stuck away in the woods me and this one girl. We were fooling around the woods
*  We never got to the actual sex part. We got close. We got eight alive by mosquitoes
*  We tried to get naked outside and so like literally our whole body so it's covered in mosquito bites. It was horrific
*  We all near a stream or was it more landlocked area near a river? Yeah. Yeah, it's near the Charles River my guy
*  Yeah, kids would just go into the woods, you know that we'd always find kids drinking in the woods
*  Yeah, you know like we lived in an area
*  I lived in Newton Massachusetts when I was in high school and Newton is it's a great town like a really cool area and
*  Where I lived which is called Upper Falls
*  There was all these like woods and trees and shit and the river was right across the street from my house and
*  It was like it was always these wild kids like playing Billy Squire on a boom box and smoking cigarettes
*  It was like the outsiders
*  It was really interesting and then one kid would get a car like oh shit. Bobby's got a car
*  Oh, it was the best dude
*  Bobby's driving us around Rockford five skates in the trunk just coming down the street dude to this day one of my favorite cars
*  I have a 1970 Chevelle and I got it. Yeah. Yeah. Oh bring it up
*  I would like to see when I was but when I was a kid
*  Yeah before I had a car my friend picked me up in his buddy's car
*  I didn't know the other dude. I met him like from school or something like that, but I didn't know him and
*  He picked me up in this
*  1970 Chevelle it was black with white stripes and it was perfect and I remember I saw it I was like
*  How does he own this?
*  How can you own this? Yeah, that's how I felt I go sitting in the back seat of the car was like this is
*  This car is so crazy that you could own this car and I remember he ran out of gas but coasted
*  Right into the gas station and stopped the car in front. It was like the coolest thing
*  I'd ever seen the old man. I like the guy owned that car somehow as a 16 year old boy
*  I was looking at this car going how how did you do this? How did you do this?
*  Let's see it
*  No, that's that's a different car Jamie. That's my
*  1970 Barracuda that's a beautiful thing this 70 Chevelle is on anywhere, but it's it's a just a good Google black 70 Chevelle
*  SS white stripes
*  Do this. That's it. There's nothing like that's it
*  There's on the wrong video
*  There's nothing like running out of gas and coast into the fucking pump mine looks almost exactly like that
*  But that's exactly like this kids looked when he picked me up and I got a ride in his car
*  I was like this that's a 69. That's another amazing car, but that one up the upper one in the middle
*  That's why that's my actual car. That's my car. Oh wow. Yeah, dude
*  I love that thing
*  That's my favorite I think at all of them
*  I love it so much
*  It just because it brings me back to that moment when I was a 16 year old kid and this guy had this car
*  I was like, how do you have this car? How is this even possible that you have this car? Yeah
*  Oh
*  That was great
*  Dude if a crate if an older if an older kid picked you up when you were a kid and he had a car
*  That was like yeah
*  Getting into like somebody who had a car his car when you couldn't even have a car with the craziest feeling as you couldn't believe it
*  Yeah, you were like the things that we completely take for granted like your buddy picks you up and give you a ride like hey
*  What's up? How's it going on? It's normal for you now like I'm just sitting in my friend's car. But back then it was like whoa
*  Whoa
*  How do what do you yeah a play something cool on the radio everything meant something?
*  I remember my friend Mike was taking flying lessons when I was in high school and
*  I went up in an airplane with him when I was 14
*  He were both 14 and he was taking flight lessons when I was
*  Fuck I'm letting this 14 year old kid flying around with him in a plane and an instructor
*  Yeah, but back then like you would just you just do so thrilled just to get out of your fucking house
*  You'd hop in your buddy's backseat like where are we going? Yeah? I don't know man. We're gonna go to Bobby's house
*  All right, you're listening songs on the radio. You couldn't believe you were in a car
*  Yeah, and it mattered like if your hand was out the window the window was down if the window was up how you were operating
*  If the seatbelt was on if your arms were over this yes, you want to look cool one hand in the steering wheel
*  One hand in the steering wheel one hand out the window and you thought everybody you drove past looked at you sup kids
*  Yeah, yeah, what's up kid just looking for some
*  I remember this one dude
*  When I was in high school, there's this one dude who was like
*  He I think he was a couple of years older than us and he graduated
*  But he was dating a girl that still went to the high school and he had an eye rock Z
*  Marrow with the teetops or no
*  Have the teetops and this dude pulled in for the high school and everybody like couldn't believe it
*  He was like the coolest guy alive look at him in his eye rock Z picking up the girl that none of us can
*  We
*  Yeah, God, I fucking remember that shit dude, I remember my brother one time fucking I got more the story
*  Sorry going that dude who had that eye rock ran over a guy accidentally and
*  Dragged them through the city for miles
*  Just tried to like get the body out from under his car a couple times, but couldn't do it, but just kept driving
*  So driving around this eye rock Z with a person stuck under the car
*  driving from miles I
*  Hate that kind of say you ever had like a bag stuck under your car or whatever. Yes, that's different
*  Yeah
*  We drive over someone maybe pull over hey
*  Maybe pull over but I don't pull enough. What do you do at that point?
*  There's like guys that you hear about from high school
*  It's like you feel like you're in a Stephen King book like yeah by me or something like that, you know
*  Oh totally everything felt like kind of had a Stephen King vibes back then, you know
*  Well, just people just disappeared back then and there was no phones and there was no internet and you barely remembered
*  People if you didn't see him for a month. Yeah, like you didn't even have a picture
*  I have like five pictures of my friends from high school, you know
*  And mostly cuz my friend Jimmy sends them to me, but it's like you don't remember
*  You don't remember what anybody looked like you don't remember anything but now
*  Too much now, you know everything but back then it's like you would hear about this
*  Like one of your one of the guys you went to high school with you got in trouble and like oh no
*  No, he's in jail. Whoa
*  He's in jail, yeah, whoa, I remember I met this one dude who just got out of jail
*  Yeah, it was friends of my friend the first guy I ever met that was in jail. Mm-hmm
*  He had just the weirdest vibe though. I had a buddy of mine who actually I was a training partner mine who was one guy
*  He was like this one way and then he went to jail on a drug charge and he came out like three years later
*  Yeah, it was a totally different person. Oh, wow. He was super jacked
*  I don't know if they were he was doing steroids or what but he was like really jacked and fucking aggressive and super dangerous
*  And he was telling me these stories about jail and about all the the fights that he had gotten into in jail
*  And he got in like almost like a fight to the death with a mop stick in this guy
*  He was telling me these horrific fights and it had just changed him
*  And I mean I'd never experienced something like that before where I knew a guy before he went to prison
*  And then I knew him after prison and he was just a completely different person and fucking very dangerous to spar with
*  Like very dangerous. Yeah, we try to kill you we would have we would have wars like they weren't really sparring matches
*  There were fights people were yeah, some people got dangerous, dude
*  Especially if they got on the drugs or got on the gear, you know, this guy this guy I think was both
*  I think he was on he was on gear and I think he was doing coke because I know he was selling he was selling coke
*  I know he's getting coke for girls and stuff like that. He wound up dying, but here's here's where it gets really crazy
*  While I knew this guy like while he was training at the same gym as me
*  He got arrested and questioned in this murder where this guy who was an informant
*  They I think he was an informant they they found him where he had been repeatedly injected with cocaine
*  To keep him alive while they were breaking his bones
*  So from him blacking out from the pain
*  They were injecting him with cocaine to keep him awake and conscious while they were breaking his bones with a hammer
*  I think then they I think they cut his hands in his head off too and
*  He got
*  Some I know he got implicated or at least questioned about that. I was like, yeah
*  Imagine even be in the other room all that's going on. Yeah, you know even trying to watch a show or what I like are just like here
*  Like keep it down
*  Can't you guys insulate your torture house
*  It's fucking up the rest of the neighborhood. Yeah, I mean what the fuck dude. I would never be able to torture somebody
*  I don't think I would be able I'm trying to think of the things I could do to somebody
*  You might be able to do if something someone did something to your loved ones
*  I think yeah be surprised with like a mother would do if she caught some person doing something to one of her children
*  Yeah, you know and a father too, huh?
*  Oh, yeah
*  But I mean even mothers who you wouldn't think of as being like violent and do you think that's a choice they make or you?
*  Think it's something that's just inside it's inside of you and you there's a choice too, but it's inside of you
*  You're like we have instincts to protect our kids, you know, and you could get crazy violent
*  Yeah, and normal regular people can get crazy violent to protect their children
*  Well, it also seemed like there's a lot of cases now where people are
*  Deceasing their own children
*  Killing their own children. Yeah, there's always been that man
*  There's always been evil people, but it's just crazy. You know have children. Yeah, man
*  There's people that poison their kids. There's this this is evil people out there and in every you know stretch of the world
*  You're gonna get a certain percentage of our population that just doesn't come out, right?
*  You know and that's normal. It's like everything there's always a percentage that's just not right. Yeah
*  There's a well whatever that struggle that the human race is involved in is if you wanted to break it down and I just
*  Philosophically, it's essentially a struggle between good and evil always it's always a struggle between good and evil
*  Yeah
*  And you're always going to have a certain amount of evil that you have to overcome and I think that amount of evil that you
*  Overcome should be small
*  But I think it it enforces this idea to do good and that good conquers evil if everybody works together
*  Cooperatively, but you need something if you don't have resistance
*  It feels like people what the way we're designed to constantly try to innovate and make better things and improve upon society improve upon our own lives
*  We're always like trying for progress, right? I think that's all sort of tied in to
*  competition and
*  Competition needs a foe you need an antagonist and a protagonist you need resistance
*  Yeah, I think the unfortunate thing is that there is evil in the world the fortunate thing
*  Fortunate thing is that evil makes you appreciate love and it motivates people to stop evil
*  Yeah, and it motivates people to limit evil
*  You know like the calls for law and order in this country like during the the riots remember when everybody was like we need
*  Oh, yeah order we need law and order
*  You can't have just people breaking into things and stealing everything in law and order like that that kind of stuff
*  It's like that that's that that's good versus evil
*  It's evil to just smash windows and steal things in the name of some guy that you don't know who died unjustly
*  That's crazy. You're just using this as an opportunity
*  There's a fuck everyone and you can't have people just running around saying fuck everyone and lighting things on fire
*  You can't have that. Yes, you just you can't have that so like when you encounter
*  These different things it makes you appreciate not having those things
*  So it motivates you one of the things that got people excited about
*  Trump being in office is that he wanted to get away from all this defund the police shit
*  He wanted to get the country back to law and order he wants us to increase
*  Manufacturing increase all the things that make people feel good about the future all give you purpose. Yeah, and
*  They didn't feel that way about the message that we're healing they were hearing from the other side
*  They felt like it was gonna be more of the same shit and more of the same shit doesn't get anything done
*  We still keep getting involved in these wars that we don't want to be involved in
*  Yeah, shut it down shut down everything. It doesn't have to do with us. I feel like for a while
*  It's like there's just a lot of stuff that we haven't even healed from in this country, you know
*  Yeah, that's the biggest thing
*  I think there's a lot of things that we haven't healed from that we should try to address as a group
*  you know and that could be like
*  you know everything from
*  Native American times slavery times opioid epidemic. There's tons of things
*  I feel like that it's like and I don't know how you do that
*  I mean, I know time has a lot to do with it, but it's like I just don't know if
*  Sending our resources elsewhere is the most important thing right now when it's like we could I
*  Try at least Trump thinks he can help these overseas conflicts
*  I don't know if he can but the point is like something has to be done
*  Yeah, can't just keep throwing money at war and ignoring ourselves. That seems crazy
*  And if you're saying we're not ignoring ourselves
*  Well, we're not spending the money and the resources that we need to fix all the problems that we have
*  yeah, it's like even if you look at like
*  Um
*  You know recently alert. Sorry recently. I learned that like the number one cause of medical debt is insurance
*  is
*  Medical debt is the number one cause of bankruptcy in
*  America right is it really yeah crazy
*  It's crazy that there's just a laundering system that goes on. It's a money laundering. Well
*  Having hospitals and insurance companies. Yeah, there's definitely you mean you've talked to Brigham Bueller from waste well
*  Explained yes, what there the other day? He's the man. I went to Koo. Yeah, and I went there, dude
*  I've been trying to get well while I'm here trying to get get well. It's been tough. Well. We're just talking about
*  Medical debt yeah, he'll explain it real well
*  It's like it's a you know it's kind of a fucked up system
*  But it just makes sense that that would be the number one reason why people would go bankrupt because you're out of work
*  Cuz you got a medical issue, then you have medical bills if you don't have insurance you're really fucked you don't insurance like whoo
*  But it's just a scam like the prices for our drugs are so much more than other countries just things that it's like our
*  Government doesn't want to make better deals because there's this middleman. That's making a lot of money off of it. You know there's that
*  You know I don't know there's definitely a lot of influence with a lot of money
*  I don't know also companies that we need you know Pfizer makes good stuff makes
*  I mean these companies make really beneficial drugs, too
*  Yeah
*  But it's just the problem with all these fucking people is
*  They just want to make more money constantly and if they get you taking more pills than you need they will that's how they sell
*  They want to sell pills they can come up with a reason. Are you anxious? I am a little hey
*  Here you go and next thing you know you're dependent. Yeah, it's like you have two legs
*  You ever been on a bicycle like the things are just crazy. You know you eat itch
*  Yeah, you ever had oatmeal raisin cookies. You're like well fucking this is me. I think we
*  We can't let them advertise that's true gonna buy the drugs
*  But the advertising thing is crazy because it affects the media too
*  it affects what people are allowed to investigate it affects what the
*  The news is because the news is not gonna give you everything
*  They're gonna conveniently ignore things that would affect their their partnerships. Yeah, if you have a yeah, it's all advertising
*  Yeah, what do we say was again amount of billions of dollars they spend every year on advertising pharmaceutical drug companies
*  Did you um were you
*  Were you nervous about endorsing Trump or now I
*  usually try to stay out of it yeah, but I felt like I was getting urged to by Dana and
*  Every there's quite a few people. I didn't think it makes a difference
*  I kind of already stated what I thought about the way things were going and that some radical change need to take place. Yeah
*  In my opinion I just I'm not buying like, you know more talking about before with the way the country feels
*  Like the way the country felt when Biden was in office was shaky
*  Because regardless of what you thought about his policies what you did in place
*  It was real clear something was wrong with him and they were lying to us
*  Oh, yeah, but that so that alone makes the whole country feel uneasy, right?
*  Even if you think that the administration is moving certain policies and certain things are moving in the right direction
*  The economy is moving in the right general direction
*  Even if you agree to those things when you have a guy that's at the front that's obviously
*  Some in some way compromised or something going on so I'm going on that they don't want to admit
*  and everybody knows it and he drifts off and he says things don't make sense and
*  Something's wrong
*  So everybody feels uncomfortable even if everything's going well, right because for good or for bad
*  That person that's in that office kind of sets a tone for the country and the tone for the last four years was
*  confusion
*  So regardless of their policies the tone that's being established whenever he talks or whenever she does interviews or she talks is a confusing
*  Talk there's word salad and then you know
*  There's like these moments where it seems like she does doesn't know how to wrap up a sentence
*  Which can just be nerves it could just be nerves talking for a large groups of people doesn't mean she's not brilliant
*  It doesn't it really doesn't some people she was new and kind of thrown into it
*  But some people clam up when they have to do those things, but then there's the argument
*  That's the job though. You have to be able to do that because you're gonna have to be able to talk to
*  Putin and you know
*  Presidents of these different countries and leaders throughout the world you got to be able to handle pressure
*  So that's kind of part of it to cut a part of it, too
*  Is you got to be able to handle pressure?
*  But the thing that people worry about Trump is that he's so antagonistic
*  You know and that then that's the tone of the country and the tone of the country is not like
*  The the tone of the Obama administration. I always felt was the best because he was measured never attacked anybody was very
*  Articulate and smooth
*  There was not a lot of ums and ah like some people they Trump throws too many extra words in but it's just his flavor
*  His flavor is he rambles he goes all over the place. I got you look at his hair. What is wrong with my hair
*  He makes fun. He's like doing stand-up up there Obama was the smoothest and Clinton Clinton was pretty fucking smooth, too
*  Let's see, maybe Clinton and Obama. Those are the goats
*  So like when you get a person for good or for bad that's smooth and talks like a
*  Professional like an actual president it makes everybody like he's got this this guy's a real professional
*  President like look at him. Yeah with Trump you're like I hate Taylor Swift like no
*  Don't say that yeah, you know the wrong button today, but he tweeted out that
*  That lady that he allegedly slept with was uh, you call her horse face. Why is the president?
*  I
*  He's so crazy to do it's fine unreal
*  But for a lot of like super sensitive people and progressive people that's why they want to believe that he's Hitler right?
*  I want to believe they look at these things and then they they don't look at it as like a flavor in the soup like look
*  It's all pepper. No, it's not all pepper like peppers a part of it. Yeah, he probably shouldn't tweet
*  I hate Taylor Swift, but whatever yeah
*  What's important is like what is he gonna do in terms of fix all these problems that everybody agrees are real problems?
*  Yeah, and can he do it and he can he keep all these people in his staff RFK jr. I don't know
*  I don't know if he could do it
*  but if you can at least we have hope if
*  RFK really does the things that we think he wants to do and starts to kind of clean up some of the corrupt
*  I didn't it'd be exciting
*  It'd be good for people if we stop putting ingredients and foods that are illegal in Canada because they're dangerous
*  How about we stop doing that here? Yeah seems like a logical thing. It's not like Froot Loops in Canada sell that less
*  Yeah, it's probably equal sales and people would get unaddicted quick. You're really just getting people addicted to things
*  You don't even understand how about we prosecute that fucking Sackler family that fucking killed hundreds of thousands of people in our country
*  How about that? How about that? Yeah, how about that? Well you saw the whole thing where they were trying to buy immunity, huh?
*  They were trying to buy immunity
*  They were gonna have like a settlement where they give X amount of billions of dollars
*  But then they were immune to prosecution, but ain't that what they did though?
*  But I think what happened was they put a pause on that after the Netflix documentary came out Wow
*  And that was we talked about it once but I don't know where it's at now
*  But that family they made billions of dollars by getting people hooked on opium on fucking this family is mass
*  Murderers if they anybody with the last name they should I don't give I kick that gene pool out of our fucking country
*  Those people are fucking murderers, dude
*  I think a lot of people still haven't gotten over that shit and do you know that was the same family that was involved in?
*  Yeah, I do know that mother's little helper that was Valium that's was ladies in the fucking
*  Lizards get those motherfuckers out of here, and that's one thing that was one of the reasons why I was like supportive of a it's like
*  you know like
*  I just believe he has a soft spot for that type of thing and I hope that it'll get I
*  Don't know if he can do anything because lobbies are so big now wasn't someone in his family an addict
*  Yeah, his mother suffered from addiction, right?
*  But um, he's just seen it, you know sure that the sacra family was involved in the valium thing
*  I don't want to have to edit that out
*  If I called them a piece of shit about one thing, but hey, we weren't a piece of shit about that other thing
*  I think they were though. I just that's like even thinking about it, bro. It makes me so angry, you know
*  family member
*  Yeah, Arthur Sackler member the sacra family was a major figure in the promotion of valium through direct marketing to physicians in the 1960s
*  Yeah, that is it. So same family. Yeah
*  Evil evil evil. It's literally evil like it's just destroying lives. It's the devil. It's the devil. It's a drug dealer
*  It's one of the worst drug dealers because you're sneaking around with doctors
*  Yeah, you're sneaking around under the you know, this this guise of authority
*  well, one of the problems is that the say if you work for a
*  politician right in in in
*  DC right they can only pay you so much money by law
*  Right to work with them and be like help put their bills together
*  Right. So at a certain point the lobbyists can pay more to those same people who've been writing bills
*  For the congressmen and for the senators, so they then go to work as lobbyists. That's one of the biggest problems
*  right
*  So a lot of it is that we have a cap on certain salaries, right and that we also have a law that a lot
*  We also don't have a law that stops people once you work for one side that you can't work for the other right, right?
*  That's the thing with the FDA and pharmaceutical drug companies. I'm not saying that there's I don't know the answer
*  I'm just saying that that's one of the thing that's one of the reasons why that happened
*  It's a conflict of interest right for sure and it's it's just nobody regulated it nobody they allowed it to happen
*  It should be if you were working for the FDA should never be able to leave and go to a pharmaceutical drug company
*  We then make incredible amounts of money
*  That seems like a conflict of interest like you would be willing to do if you had had
*  Conversations with these people and they'd say listen you nice to us in a couple years
*  Golden parachute you want a yacht I think you need a yacht and next you know
*  You're you're a millionaire like which is bizarre that you can do that
*  It's just as bizarre as the whole insider trading in Congress
*  You know that a bill is gonna get passed you know this bill is gonna affect a stock you gamble high on that stock
*  the bill gets passed and you make a lot of money that
*  Seems illegal that seems illegal. Yes cheatin that seems crazy
*  But there's a lot of those things man and this the system was set up by people and people are flawed right that's a good point
*  Yeah, it's like nothing. No one's gonna do anything perfectly. I don't know well. It's not just that
*  accountability and
*  transparency in terms of like what's actually going on is
*  Way different now because our access to information is way different now like anybody can just sort of Google
*  budgets and Google this and you find out that and you find out things about the Pentagon and that about this like
*  There's just it's you have to look in the New York Times anymore right you know you don't have to wait for the news to
*  Come on at five now you get it whenever you want it
*  And that's sort of changed everything with what you can get away with and not get away with so for the longest time even though
*  There's rules and the Constitution set up in the Bill of Rights
*  There's been people that have had a lot of power
*  For a long time without a bunch of people looking at them and now more people are looking at them than ever before
*  And then you get this guy like Trump comes in like FBI the crooked
*  Wow
*  You go to war with the CIA is like that drunk uncle dude, but what about Baron Trump dude?
*  No, there's no credit like whatever you think about this election. I the whole thing to me is fascinating first of all
*  because
*  Dana White made so much stuff happen. Oh, yeah, right. I mean a white made the Trump thing happen for sure
*  He was a little he was trying to get me to have Trump on in like 2017
*  You would hear rumors of that in the distance, right he would call me up you call me up Joe
*  Listen the president wants to do your podcast. I go you mean Trump
*  You know and back then I was like, I don't want to be a part of this is too many people were angry too many people
*  Pissed off. I was like, I don't need to and I didn't pay attention to it enough. I didn't pay attention to
*  the way they were
*  Misrepresenting things that he had said enough. Yeah, I didn't really I my wake-up call was when they went after me when CNN went after me
*  I was like, yeah, this is crazy. I'm taking veterinary drugs bitch. Yeah, what the fuck are you talking about?
*  This is the dump also why are you upset that I got better quick?
*  Like what is this about like that? I took veterinary drugs and got better quick and why in the article?
*  Hey, well when you herald it say hey, this could be a possibility, you know, it's like not only that
*  There's no way they didn't know that it was for human those people are it's all a sick
*  but when I saw that and that was so minor in comparison the way they've come out to Trump because they come out to Trump with
*  lawsuits and all kinds of crazy shit and
*  I don't think he's a perfect person
*  I know he's fun and I think he's a very competitive guy
*  Which is why he likes playing golf so much and why he wouldn't quit until he became the president again
*  And he pulled it off
*  Yeah
*  And the best thing that I've heard from people on the left is it's not the result that we wanted but we hope the
*  Country can come together and I think we should all have that mentality. Yeah this idea that we're all separate
*  We're on team USA and I think we should just like all publicly state. Nobody gives a fuck where you're from
*  What you do you're on team USA. We're all in this shit together. That's it. Oh, yeah, that's it
*  Let's forget about all this identity politics nonsense and all like what's that gonna happen? You think?
*  If we can put that thought out there instead of everyone's racist everyone's a Nazi every yeah
*  That ain't helping nobody you're just pushing people further and further away the people that used to identify as left
*  They've been forced to these sort of center-right positions just to maintain normalcy
*  Yeah
*  When you're giving puberty blockers to kids and you're opening up gender-affirming care clinics and treating kids like shut the fuck up
*  You're not on the right side you think you're on the right side because you think you're being compassionate
*  What you're doing is crazy to most people and we don't want it and we think you might be like in a cult like you
*  it's a giant cult of leftists that think crazy things and
*  They're allowing all sorts of bizarre things to happen in society like the no cash bail thing like things you think are good
*  You know structural racism is why there's so many people in prison, right? Yeah
*  But you just let people out who shoot people right you can't just have people robbing people and right back out on the street
*  You can't have that you can't have that you'll have a full deterioration of society and no one will thrive and you'll be under
*  Chaos you'll be like living in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro in just a decade
*  Yeah, just keep this trend going you're gonna fall apart
*  And it's these idealistic utopian people that want these things to happen these people that believe that Marxism has never been effectively done
*  But it can be done that but you know that there's there's a version of all of these different communist philosophies
*  Yeah, you can imply there's socialism that could work right?
*  There's a version of it that can work and make it more equitable for everybody
*  But the end of that is always one thing it's
*  Totalitarian control over what you say and do because as soon as you want to redistribute funds
*  As soon as you want to tell people they can't have things anymore, then you're gonna have to take it from them
*  Yeah, well I think like to me everything kind of started to feel like this privatized communism, right?
*  Like yeah, once the post office didn't work. I was like the government's fucked, dude
*  I was like these bastards can't even get a package to fucking Toledo in two days, dude
*  You know like but it really did though is that there's like UPS now, right?
*  But it but you go in there dude. It's like a Western. They're serving liquor at the counter like it's
*  It's gone downhill they have liquor I mean they don't
*  You can probably score a gram up there at the cat like it's got it's gone the other doors there's no hinges on it's gotten
*  Dude, it's the Wild West over there post office. You go into bro every post office all of them are bad bro it
*  75% of the post offices are it's gotten but I just use that as an example of like a
*  Governor it just like started to fall apart right the last time I saw a post office was the last election
*  Last time I went to a post office well yeah last election when I mailed in my California ballot yeah, and how many
*  Apparently how many?
*  And at that time was there a saloon at what isn't that like at least cause for concern that leap in numbers yeah?
*  What is it now Jamie? Do we know what the official numbers are now?
*  Really, I don't know why as an updated more
*  California's they're digging in their heels. They don't want to make the election real
*  I don't think either one of these parties is what the people say like Democrat
*  They're not the same parties it was 15 years ago most people are waking up to that
*  That's why if you look at the map of California new going on look at the map of California red and blue from
*  2016 and then look at it from or rather 2020 and then 2024
*  There's a giant difference a giant difference a giant difference in the amount of counties that went red
*  Yeah, it's just the big population centers are always gonna be blue
*  They're in the trance if you're in San Francisco
*  And if you're in Los Angeles you're in the trance like 70% of those people are in the trance
*  There's this let they also believe things that mean something to them, so they're not like because
*  Right like socially they're connected to all these ideas. You know and socially they're all like hyper liberal
*  They're socially locked into like this mindset. It doesn't allow questioning
*  Narratives doesn't allow questioning these ideas so like the idea of questioning science was like there's no way you're where science denier
*  Yeah, I could be a science time you couldn't even say like hey
*  Are you sure that these companies who have been lying their entire careers?
*  They've been fucking hit with these giant criminal penalties for lying. We know they lie
*  You sure they're telling you the truth about this drug when they haven't
*  Injected giant swaths of the population with it before but they're gonna do it now
*  Yeah, and they promise it's gonna work yeah, and then they're lying about the promises
*  They're lying about whether it stops transmission they never even tested for that
*  They're lying from whether or not it stops you from being infected. They didn't test for that either
*  Well the same people that own this own the publication company. It's just starting to be so obvious. It's like I don't know
*  I'm gonna just money man. It's just money right at what point does money
*  Because if you think over the fact of somebody's peace of mind in health and wellness like that's the thing
*  I don't understand because they've used their money wisely to connect it to an ideology
*  So this is what it is if you're a vaccine skeptic or a vaccine denier even if it's not even really a vaccine
*  I mean you're calling it a vaccine
*  But that's kind of a sneaky move because it doesn't really work like a regular vaccine does it works completely novel
*  it's a completely new thing and
*  if you can connect that with the people that's the
*  The logical
*  Educated people that are reasonable and convince them that you can't look at it sideways you can never examine it
*  You can never question it you never question whether or not it's even necessary
*  You just have to go with it
*  You can't question whether or not these other therapeutics that all these doctors have these anecdotal stories about people recovering from these
*  Antivirals and trying them you can't you got to reject that because that was crazy because you have that emergency use authorization thing
*  That wasn't cool, man. I never took it and guess what doing great, you know?
*  Yeah, I'm depressed suffering different depression. Yeah, you had a lot of issues and back pain today
*  But you are suffering a lot because still
*  Not hanging around with us come hang out here man. Come move. I know this year's been busy, man
*  I want to know if you lived in town
*  You'd be hanging out all the time. I know better you'd feel better. You need a little community
*  I know you dude you get weird when you buy yourself too long you get weird
*  Oh, and I spent a lot of time by myself, you know
*  You call the check to see if people still like you did I do that yeah fuck
*  That's most of my childhood did I really do that
*  Yeah, I believe that about what are you talking about?
*  Want to make sure we're cool. No, I believe that I'm like, of course we're cool. Like what are you talking about?
*  What happened? Nothing just we ain't talked for a while
*  Wow, did I really do? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I believe you 100%
*  Yeah, it was a weird conversation
*  Fuck that's a story my life dude, I'm people to make sure we're okay. Yeah, but I know you man
*  So when you call me, I'm like, oh three. Oh just need some love, you know, you're out there in the woods by yourself
*  Can't be alone man. Well, I think part of me I wanted to do I've always just wanted I wanted to do like my own thing
*  you know, but then you start to realize that there's a
*  That you yeah, you're doing it by yourself and I think that goes for like whether it's work relationships or
*  Personal relationships too, you know, I think it's just like it's been the same
*  Psychology for me, you know, like I'm the crap. I'll think it's got me thought about this
*  I'll think to myself. I want to be in a relationship, but I want to do it on my own
*  But it's that's how there's something it just like you can marry yourself people do that. Oh, I would hate that dude
*  I'm always just chasing myself kind of jerk me off. I
*  Would
*  Would be a real problem
*  Yeah, yeah, man. There's I uh, I do miss I do like want to be around a group more this year's has been so
*  It's like doing that by yourself, but you are doing it by yourself, right?
*  So you're doing your podcast by yourself you're doing it you stand up by yourself
*  The thing about like a club is you're doing it by yourself while everybody else is also doing it by themselves
*  Right to your round the same, but you're hanging out. You're having fun. You're you're charging up your love batteries
*  Yeah, that's what it is. Oh the other night even just being there be able to laugh with Tony and like like
*  Ron white was right there. You got Brian Simpson
*  You got Kurt Metzger everybody just watching and dancing and figuring things out
*  Yeah, and then then the fucking every now and then the Kurt will corner you with them conspiracies, bro
*  Did he ever get you did he get you?
*  Yeah, bro. He drowned me. He took me in a rabbit hole. We was a listener, dude. I don't
*  Water river he helped me under bro
*  Fucking I don't I go Kurt. I don't remember the original
*  Conspiracy theory that led us to this mind control study that I should have known about
*  You don't know about that
*  Giant dudes he's like looming over you
*  Conspiracy is fucking crazy eyebrows. He's like you don't know about the Vanna white conspiracy. You don't know what's behind the ease
*  You don't know what's behind the ease
*  Here's the thing dude until he's a little bit Jimmy door. He's one of a kind Jimmy door. It's cool
*  I never got to know as a man. I got I got to see him for years
*  But I've always been like kind of admirable about him. He's a great dude. He's a great dude
*  But before he started working for Jimmy he didn't really have a lot of conspiracies in his head
*  You know, it was like he got sort of exposed to all that worker for Jimmy and doing that show and he was like
*  Oh my god, this whole fucking thing is rigged
*  And then he just get rabbit hole after rabbit hole after rabbit hole after rabbit hole
*  That dude will send you a text and if you send him a text back
*  He will send you a chain of thoughts doctrine. Yeah, like a scroll
*  Like a scroll like I want to save them I want to save them
*  Because like that would be a cool almost like a book to publish. Oh, I think text with Kurt people would love that, too. I
*  Love how passionate he is about stuff
*  He's a smart dude, man. Yeah, he's very very very smart dude. It was fun
*  Yeah, that was just fun to see who else was there just like
*  Brian Simpson Asana mod a son was there
*  There is the best dude cuz you tell any joke if it's good or not you can look at Derek and if he's laughing
*  It's good. He's just like a great green room hang. Yes, there's
*  He he'll let you know on his face immediately. He's the to me. He's the be all in all of something's funny
*  It's a great person. It's like just a nice guy to be around. That's it. That's like the beautiful funny
*  He is very funny. This is a beautiful thing about the club is that there's so many nice people
*  Yeah, it just like I said, he charges up your love batteries. What's we all need in this world?
*  We all need a little more love a little more fun, and I'm just hoping that
*  Trump doesn't start attacking people. That's what I'm hoping
*  I'm hoping that he just and I know people around him want him to do that just concentrate on the positives
*  Yeah, concentrate on the positives
*  You got four years to do all sorts of things that could really benefit people and then you will be remembered as that guy
*  Well, I just want people to tell us what's really going on if they can't really do anything because the lobbyists are controlling everything
*  I wish somebody would just tell us that well
*  I think if anybody's gonna it's him especially now and especially with access to podcasts, right?
*  So if he decides to do your podcast two months after he's in office and you have questions like that
*  All of a sudden Trump could probably tell you whatever it's not top secret. He could probably tell you
*  He said he's gonna release the JFK files. We're gonna find out a lot of this
*  We're gonna find a lot of things
*  We're gonna find out whether or not he's gonna really keep RFK jr. As a part of his organization or whether he's gonna get pressure
*  from pharmaceutical drug companies or
*  Whoever he loses him dude, he's good. That's not cool. It's not cool
*  So there's that and then there's is he gonna release the JFK files?
*  Because he was told that it shouldn't release them that it's he said some of the people were still alive
*  Which doesn't totally make sense because that was
*  1963 so most likely most of those people would be dead of old age. Yeah, you know, but
*  What does it mean though when someone says that that means that someone from the government could be implicated in the murder of the former
*  of the president
*  So if that's true, then would it be that they're worried that it would erode
*  All confidence in the intelligence agencies or are they worried that deeper investigations would take place and then people start saying well
*  What happened with Martin Luther King?
*  You know because there was one that Mike Baker who's a former CIA guy was saying that one like he
*  Investigated for a show. He goes that one doesn't make any sense. That guy just started getting money
*  He was a loser his whole life. All of a sudden he had money in the nowhere. No, the guy killed them. Oh
*  Who was it James Earl Reeves James Earl, Ray, maybe James Earl, Ray James, alright, so that guy
*  Mike Baker broke it down for us. I don't remember exactly but essentially what he's saying is that guy was a drifter
*  It was a loser, you know in and out of jail that kind of a guy and then all of a sudden he has access to money
*  He's staying in a nice place. He has a gun and like what's going on?
*  Like he thinks that they set him up to kill Martin Luther King and that someone financed that which is most likely that makes sense
*  Well back then you could kind of kill somebody and it was um
*  Easier, you know think about like the Wild West right like they if you killed somebody they drew a picture of you, right?
*  Wanted I ever do shave your mustache
*  You could become
*  You can't put on glasses
*  Where'd he go?
*  He killed my whole family. Where's our guys got glasses? I can't be him
*  But you could literally
*  Go across the bucket behind a boulder shave come back to the town get a job as a sheriff and look for yourself
*  years
*  Bro imagine how gross it must have been to come to some like fucking weird a bottle back then weird brothel town
*  Oh saloon, and you just smell like shit
*  You've been riding on the back of a horse for three days and you just wander into this weird fire lit community
*  Oh, did you know James Earl Ray escaped prison before he supposedly killed or not?
*  Worked out but oh really yeah, you were saying
*  Get a disguise. He changed. He got like a nose job. Oh boy, but he also got a driver's license made it to Mexico
*  Oh, he's in prison. He's working at Kroger's Wow
*  Establish himself as a pornographic film director
*  Using mail order equipment who has after a quarter of an eight ball who hasn't
*  like a fucking psychopath
*  Yes, I think I considered emigrating to Rhodesia now Zimbabwe where a predominantly white minority regime had
*  unilateral
*  Unilaterally assumed independence from the United Kingdom in 1965
*  Wow
*  Those job yeah, and then went to Atlanta and then very quickly
*  Started to pop it off. Yeah decided to do what he did. Yeah, it's tough man
*  I down there is just fucking ruins everybody those drive people nuts. Yeah, especially we got that cat parasite
*  You know then they're all moving around your head like
*  Have you seen uh that show from on Amazon Prime I haven't pretty good. Yeah, you know what I'm watching though on Netflix
*  What is it three body problem? Yeah, I haven't seen it. I've been hearing people say it's really good
*  It's by the people who made Game of Thrones. Oh really it's really good
*  I'm wait totally unique like I don't want to tell you much about it. It's a science fiction, but it's totally unique
*  You watch it you're gonna go oh shit the first thing like what is going on here? Yeah, but after a while like oh shit
*  I'm on episode 4 now
*  Fuck dude, and there's not gonna be a season 2 for like three years. Yeah, that's how they do some of that shit
*  Well like stranger things those motherfuckers are making a movie every week, you know, right they're making a one-hour movie every week
*  Which is like so much better than a movie
*  You know a Game of Thrones is better than any movie that's ever existed
*  I'm saying it's so good and it's just one episode leads into the next one into the next one. Oh shit
*  I can't believe she did that. Oh fuck. He's dead now. Oh shit
*  Oh
*  Fucking they killed the king in the very first episode on real alert and they handicapped that kid out the gate member right out the gate
*  Fuck usually it's second season for you get a handicapped kid and so that's what blew my mind
*  It was fucking his sister and you know anybody and no
*  But back then there weren't any rules were there I
*  Think you're never supposed to be fucking your sister. I think that
*  That's like back to caveman times
*  Right, I'm sure there's something in most people that feels like hey, that's not right. Let's shut it down. Let's go outside instead
*  Well, that's like people always thought about that with rural communities
*  You know what the people say this a lot. I mean, I'm from obviously Louisiana people say all you know
*  They're always like, hey, you see, you know
*  Yeah, yeah, and the thing what happened was people didn't live close to each other. So if you you're not gonna travel
*  You're only gonna travel so far
*  To you advocating for fucking sisters fuck no, I'm not what are you saying? It seems like that's what you're doing
*  No, I'm saying this is what happened back then
*  People aren't gonna try people aren't gonna get a train ticket to come
*  You know, they're gonna people are only gonna have sex within a certain distance of their right, right? That's why it happened, right?
*  You know, it's like if a guy it's like no one there, right? There's nobody there. So they had to fuck their sister
*  They didn't have to but at a certain point they got
*  Lost and ended up back at right by the house
*  It's cool, I'm just trying to tell you how it works out like, you know, well that's how it certainly works out in the mammal kingdom
*  Yeah, give you have puppies the boy puppy will fuck his sister. Yeah hundred percent. He doesn't even think twice
*  He'll try to fuck you to try to fuck your leg. They don't even know what they're doing
*  Oh, yeah, did I stayed in my buddy Brad's house one night, right?
*  We're dead asleep right and they let a bunch of puppies loose do those things that fucking gang banging you
*  I don't have a fucking ounce of milk on me. Those things are fucking sucking me off
*  We don't think that about people right the second it's crazy how it goes from animals to people man. Yeah, we're animals
*  We're animals. Do you think there's a certain purpose for us?
*  Like we there's a magical purpose for us or do you think we are just an anomaly?
*  Well, I think even if there's not this is a magical time
*  It's an interesting time and especially for people like us. They get to talk to so many fascinating people
*  I mean we have a really cool job not just as comics but also as doing podcasts
*  You know and you've I think you've got a great education doing that, you know a great like you're you see more introspective
*  You're more curious about things than you know, I remember before you're like, I think it did the same thing to me really
*  Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I must feel like I know why I wish I didn't know more stuff. Sometimes I miss knowing nothing, right?
*  Yeah, it makes sense to you for sure. I know I have my brain is filled with shit that I don't need
*  Oh, yeah, you're a library, dude
*  But you know the the thing more like a red box for you. We're in that one movie
*  I've been doing a lot longer. That's all it is
*  It's just no it's the amount I do to its numbers, but you're a you have a you are you are a library
*  You know, there's a certain types of people that could make it through certain things and you wouldn't want to educate a child on this library
*  This is not there's not a library. You'd love everybody to have access to no, it's 16 and older
*  I think there's a lot of stuff in my head. I was like god. I wish I didn't know that about people, you know, oh
*  That's interesting. You don't think about the side effects of somebody being able to have like a memory that records so much
*  Well, it's just you always concentrate on the worst possible aspects of people and so if you know so many
*  Acts and things that people have done that have been horrific
*  You're always like the back your head always has but maybe that could happen, you know
*  Like so it always sits there. It always sits there if you're a completely
*  You grow up Amish or some shit you like completely removed from society
*  You never see any violence
*  And then all sudden you have to go to a bar like downtown Detroit on a Saturday night you see fist fights and people throwing
*  Glasses at each other like you'd be like what the fuck is this? I'm not ready for this. I'm not prepared for this, you know
*  Right, but if you but if you have but if you know that exists and it's always a possibility
*  So if you see it too much, even if you don't see it in real life, the worst thing is seeing in real life
*  That's what we were talking earlier about cops
*  Yeah cops are seeing it every day in real life
*  So you just get like super accustomed to seeing people dead
*  Super accustomed to seeing people get injured. Yeah, it's crazy how therapists make like 150 bucks and it's crazy
*  How therapists make like $150 an hour, right? Right, but cops who are basically therapists that also have to shoot it
*  Make 40 bucks an hour. I know like
*  You think about that and nobody wants that job
*  It is crazy, but if you paid them like heroes
*  I feel like that they would more more fucking gladiators would show up and do it
*  Yeah, and they would have a real force out there, you know
*  And you would fall asleep at night knowing that severe warriors were taking care of your fucking community
*  Yes, you think that's possible or not. People don't want to know that we need that
*  They don't want to kind of believe that you need like masculine dangerous men to protect you
*  But that's always been the case and if you're just looking
*  Realistically about violence and crime in the world it exists
*  It's there's no utopian spot. So violence and crime exists
*  There's only one way you can shield the nonviolent people who aren't committing crimes from the criminals and that's dangerous men
*  You need dangerous armed men who are trained and are capable. That's what you need
*  It doesn't mean they should be running everything. It means you need
*  100% protection from dangerous people then here's the number one thing that nobody addresses
*  You got to figure out why are so many people coming out of these same communities year after year after year after year being dangerous
*  Where no one's doing shit about it. No one's trying to fix it. No one's trying to enhance it
*  No, there's no one's trying to like
*  Recognize like do you know much?
*  Income we're losing because these people don't grow up to become productive members of society
*  Much damage it's causing if they go on to commit violent crimes and if whatever drug dealing any anything that can come out of that
*  And do you know how much of a burden it is on the taxpayer to sort of put them through the criminal system?
*  And how much of that could be?
*  Completely removed if that person grows up and becomes a productive member of society and instead starts contributing to society and it's a success story
*  The that's not impossible to do but there's been no effort. No like
*  Engineering large-scale national effort to completely
*  Eliminate these horrible spots in this country and not like make everything the same and perfect. That's not possible
*  but there's a level of poverty that exists in this country that's
*  Unmanageable you should never be that poor if you're a part of a community
*  Takes care of everybody
*  There's no reason why you have a hundred seventy five billion dollars to ship to Ukraine
*  But you don't have any money to make sure that no one exists below a certain level
*  Fucked when that kind of shit happens. They shouldn't be helping these other countries. I don't know why we send money to Israel Ukraine
*  I just don't understand why we there's just people suffering here, you know
*  There's people that have been taken advantage of in our own country and it's like you don't want to be selfish
*  But if you don't take care if you don't know your inventory, then your business is gonna fail, right?
*  That's a that is that is a law if you don't take stock of your own inventory your business will fail and we don't have
*  Stock of our own inventory and we don't have a healthy inventory, you know, it's like it's just like I don't understand how it's so
*  The weird thing is I start thinking is that a radical idea?
*  It didn't used to be a radical idea, but it became a radical idea when
*  People started floating about the idea that capitalism is evil all capitalism is bad
*  There's all these people that have these utopian notions of how we should run our society
*  Well, maybe it could be true at a certain point. I think it's going to probably have to be true at a certain point because of AI
*  I think we're gonna get to some weird point where
*  Money seems like it's just ones and zeros
*  It's just numbers and it's a bottleneck
*  The bottleneck of information right because you can't have access to all the information if you have access to all the money
*  Then where's the money go? Yeah, that's crazy
*  But if we get to this point where we evolve past the state we're at now where you can't trust people to not steal your
*  Money where you can't trust people to not lie where you can't trust people to not manipulate things and try for their own benefit
*  If human beings can eventually get to a place like that
*  Then I could see a time in our evolved future where we don't need money or when
*  Everybody has the same amount where instead of having this desire to
*  Constantly acquire goods and constantly acquire status and and
*  Like prestige in the community have the bigger house the bigger if that completely goes away and human beings really are one hive mind
*  I could see where we could equally share resources. Yeah, but we're that's like
*  Either a cyborg or a million years in the future
*  I'm talking about like where we get past all of our primitive cave people
*  Instincts and DNA that I think fucks with everything. It is the cause of almost all of our problems is who we are innately
*  It's just our programming is fucked. Yeah, there's our programming is the same
*  Well, you know this there's there's some variations that have cured over time
*  But reasonably similar I should say to people that live 10,000 years ago
*  Uh-huh
*  so if you took a person from
*  10,000 years ago and you you put them in a
*  T-shirt like this and sat them in the movie theater, you wouldn't be able to tell it would just like like us. No, yeah
*  Yeah, so really you think 100%? Yeah
*  I mean they might have been smaller that cuz they didn't give us get as much food, but a little like a small person
*  Yeah, we wouldn't know you wouldn't know they would look just like us
*  So if you just put them in a suit and tie and sat them down that guy would be like what the fuck?
*  Yeah, and that's basically us
*  So that person if you get a person lives 10,000 years ago the amount of barbaric
*  Incidents that guy's probably seen by the time becomes an adult the amount of people he's probably seen slaughtered with swords and
*  Spears and seeing people lit on fire
*  That's all inside of us still right all that programming of like everybody's the enemy and you got to protect the fields and protect
*  that is all a part of our programming and as
*  Technology increases and as we become more interconnected
*  That's gonna be one of the biggest problems that we face is
*  Abandoning these bizarre primate characteristics that we still hold on to mm-hmm cuz they're in our DNA
*  And they're not managed well like people need to manage them to suppress them and some people
*  Yeah, we try to pretend on exist. Yeah, we try to pretend on exist. Sorry I stepped on you
*  No, no, I'm interrupting you a lot man. I'm sorry. You're awesome. What are you doing? Stop doing that?
*  Piece of it like let's wrap it up. We've been doing this for three have we really at least
*  Yeah, it's almost not almost five. Oh, man. I love you. I know I'm always trying to get you to move here
*  But it's cuz I think you'd be happier here and selfishly I want no. Oh, thank you, dude. I appreciate it
*  No, I want to be around this year's just been it's just been uh
*  It's been like every time I'm not doing a podcast. I have to like I'm traveling for work
*  Or it's like it's been a busy time. Hey if we open up another mothership, do you think Nashville would be a good spot?
*  Yeah
*  Is there enough would be be fucking with zany's or you think it would help it?
*  No, I think it would be good because I think there's enough people there where you could do it
*  Do you have enough comics in Nashville?
*  How many comics are in Nashville?
*  There's some I have like a base, you know like that want to perform all the time, right? I'll do some recon for you
*  We're thinking we're thinking to go in other spots. Yeah. Yeah
*  Well, that would be cool man
*  Cuz at least I know the area could be you know thought about going to the most woke place in Brooklyn setting up shop
*  the
*  Mother you get I
*  Bet it would thrive though. Well, we can find out there's only one way to do it, dude
*  Wow, man, I can't believe it's so crazy that I was there to watch the list like the elect
*  Just like what a night and was like it was really fun time to watch the election at the club in the green room
*  We're all hopping back and forth off stage like who's winning. I know it was fun, man. It was so crazy
*  Drinking diet coke having a good time
*  The Yvonne I love you to death. You're one of my favorite people. I appreciate you very much. I love you too, man
*  Thanks for being inspiring and thanks for um, yes
*  Sometimes you would like I would do a podcast episode you would just say you would reach out and say hey, man
*  Uh, I like that episode and it just meant a lot. I just want to let you know that it's what it does
*  You're you do a great job, man. I really love your show
*  I think you got some great interviews and you got a great you got a nice way of being yourself
*  You know when you're talking to anybody and that's what I think people really like they like to see conversations or people are just being
*  Themselves and the fact that you could do that with Trump. That's fun. It's inspiring. So it's it's nice to see man
*  I really really love it. Well, thanks. Thanks, man. Yeah, I think it means a lot to people when somebody they admire like a
*  Says something nice to them, you know, it's just nature, you know, yeah, we like it I appreciate it man. Thanks for having me dude
