# Joe Rogan Experience #1473 - Tom Papa
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [May 13, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EToUmoEYGuU)
*  Okay, so what were you just saying Jamie?
*  We have LA's stay at home order will likely remain in place for the next three months
*  unless there is a quote dramatic change to the virus and tools at hand officials say.
*  How are people supposed to feed themselves?
*  Like really, realistically, how do they expect this to work?
*  You go out to work and then you skitter back home.
*  That's not what they're saying.
*  That's not what stay at home means.
*  Stay at home means you don't go to work.
*  Yeah, but at the same time they're opening up businesses.
*  They're opening up very few businesses and you have to get curbside for retail.
*  I heard our governor in the state of California say that 70% of businesses are open now.
*  Well, if that's the case, even if that was the case, let's say 30% of people are out
*  of work.
*  That's catastrophic.
*  Yeah, it's a lot.
*  And I don't think it's true.
*  I don't think 70% of the places are open.
*  That's what he said.
*  70% of businesses.
*  Even if they're open, they're not open at 100% capacity.
*  Or they're probably working from home, like offices, he's probably counting offices.
*  And those people are still working and getting paid, but they're doing it from home.
*  So this is just LA.
*  LA County.
*  Just LA, yeah.
*  So that means like Comedy Store has no chance.
*  Yeah, I believe it's for the county.
*  Yeah, so it's the biggest county.
*  This is the same fuckup who thought it would be a good idea to have people rat on people
*  for money.
*  Technically, this was not coming from the mayor.
*  This is coming from a health, someone in the health department talking at a supervisor
*  meeting or something.
*  So it was a suggestion.
*  It wasn't a, not an official order, but it's coming.
*  So it's not an official order.
*  Not an official order.
*  But LA is the densest county in America.
*  How about that?
*  Is it really?
*  Yeah.
*  More than New York?
*  As a county.
*  Hmm.
*  That seems odd, doesn't it?
*  It does seem odd.
*  Seems like a lot of people.
*  New York City is denser.
*  Yeah.
*  New York City is, the thing about New York City that makes it great is that everybody
*  sort of mingles together.
*  Everybody gets on the subway together.
*  Everybody walks together on the streets.
*  It's also the reason why everybody's getting sick together.
*  Yeah.
*  But I saw an interesting thing that the highest, this guy wrote an editorial about the reasons
*  for New York and he lives in New York and he said Staten Island had the highest number.
*  This was written before, I think Brooklyn has now edged it.
*  But at the time, that Staten Island was the highest and it was the least densely populated.
*  And Manhattan, which is the most densely populated, had the fewer number of cases.
*  Really?
*  Mm-hmm.
*  I wonder if that is similar to what they're finding with people that work together or
*  in prisons in particular.
*  They're finding that there was this one prison that did a study on 98% of the people were
*  asymptomatic.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  98%?
*  Yeah, 98%.
*  Jeez.
*  It's nuts.
*  Yeah.
*  That's weird.
*  So I was bringing it up with a friend of mine and I was like, do you think this is because
*  my friend Kyle Kalinske and he was like, I think it's because their immune systems are
*  strong because they're just interacting with each other constantly.
*  And I was like, oh, that kind of makes sense because I was thinking if you're in prison,
*  you're probably stressed out and you're getting bad food.
*  Yeah.
*  And horrible sleep.
*  And yet your immune system is strong.
*  Right.
*  Because you're just being bombarded all the time.
*  Yeah.
*  You're being bombarded all the time by stinky, dirty people.
*  Where you live in an isolated, fancy place with purified air.
*  Right.
*  You're in a wonderful community in Brentwood.
*  You don't see your neighbors ever.
*  You don't go anywhere.
*  You're very fragile.
*  Yeah.
*  You go to the store, you come home.
*  And now our immune systems are, I would imagine, this is just pure speculation, but I would
*  imagine that your immune system is like all the other systems of your body, that when
*  it gets tested, it gets stronger.
*  Right?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  So your immune system right now is being put into a state of atrophy because it's not being
*  exposed to anything new.
*  It's in a lounge chair.
*  It's just chilling.
*  It's got sunglasses.
*  It's got glasses on.
*  It hasn't worked in years.
*  It's got soft legs that cramp up when it goes upstairs.
*  And all of a sudden it gets called to go to work and it's just like, dude, what?
*  Wouldn't you imagine that's the case?
*  It seems like it.
*  Yeah.
*  It seems like it.
*  Yeah.
*  I would kind of imagine we're setting ourselves up to get really sick if something comes down
*  the pipe.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, that was what was very strange in the beginning of all this, when people were saying
*  that people just spout out, you can't do anything for your immune system.
*  You can't make it stronger.
*  That's nonsense.
*  And it was like, really?
*  Who was saying that?
*  Just online.
*  I did a thing with, really, just like people spouting off.
*  Yeah.
*  It's crazy because online it's written.
*  And when you're seeing things written, you're like, wow, this must make sense.
*  It's written.
*  I know.
*  It's got 150,000 likes.
*  This has got to be real.
*  I know.
*  It's just Bob said it.
*  It's just a matter of a guy walking down the street.
*  It's the same thing.
*  I don't understand how we could take three more months off.
*  I really don't.
*  Well, it depends what they mean.
*  I mean, when you hear the governor talk, he's moving it along and he's in these phases
*  and pushing it through.
*  I don't think it's going to be, as I'm stammering because of the realization of it, I don't
*  think it's going to be like what it was in April and May.
*  Why not?
*  In July.
*  Because I want to go outside.
*  I think so, too.
*  LA County breaches beaches reopen May 13th.
*  Yes, but you can't hang out on your lounge.
*  You can't hang out on your towel.
*  You've got to go in.
*  Please make that larger.
*  Please go back to where it was.
*  You can do water sports.
*  No lying or sitting on the sand.
*  Right.
*  Canopies, coolers, or picnicking.
*  Right.
*  You can be active.
*  You can go swim.
*  Parking lots are closed.
*  So where do they expect you to park?
*  They don't want you to go.
*  Individual family activities and exercise only.
*  Yeah, so you can go down, you can swim, you can ride the waves and then get out of the
*  ocean and get back in your car and get home.
*  Look at this, no picnicking.
*  You can't picnic.
*  No biking.
*  No biking.
*  No, why can't you bike?
*  I have to say.
*  No volleyball?
*  You see that round circle with the slash through it with the giant canopies?
*  Those should be banned all year.
*  Have you ever been next to one of those on the beach?
*  Oh, those are disgusting.
*  Oh my god.
*  Why are you allowed to set up camp?
*  Building a house.
*  Yeah, you're basically saying this is my area of the sand.
*  Yeah.
*  Blocking everyone's view.
*  Yeah, you can get a fucking towel.
*  That's what you can get.
*  You get a towel and that's it.
*  That's how it's always been.
*  I know.
*  These people come down there, they've got coolers and tables higher than this.
*  You see they have fences now?
*  People are setting up beach fences.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  They're selling beach fences.
*  You set it up.
*  You stick it in the sand and you mark off your area.
*  Oh my god.
*  Social distancing.
*  We're creating dorks.
*  This is all before social distancing.
*  These are just people making camps there and bringing 25 people.
*  Oh, I hate it.
*  So, reopen tomorrow is what they're saying.
*  Yeah, baby.
*  Well, that's good.
*  That's a start.
*  I think we need to move in the other direction.
*  I think we need to quarantine people that are at risk.
*  That's what I think, really.
*  And then let people make their own choices.
*  The idea that these hospitals are going to be overwhelmed is not true.
*  It's not correct.
*  Luckily, we're very fortunate.
*  And the idea that we're going to run out of ventilators, that's not true either.
*  Right.
*  And then also, that doctor that worked with Michael Yeoh was telling you this before we
*  started.
*  The doctor said that if he put him on a ventilator, he would die because his body would stop
*  trying to breathe and it would just sort of give up.
*  And this is what Michael Yeoh's doctor told him and he survived.
*  And then we're finding out that a lot of people they put on ventilators don't make it.
*  And I wonder if what he's saying applies to those people.
*  Right.
*  Was he his a special case?
*  Why they didn't want him on the ventilator?
*  No, his doctor is just a wise guy.
*  He's just smart and just figured it out.
*  I mean, it's a weird thing to think, you know, what if we hadn't done all of these measures?
*  Would the hospitals have been...
*  Because the hospitals for a beat were crazy.
*  Depends on where you are.
*  Yeah.
*  Like if you weren't in Queens, it was insane.
*  Yeah, this place is where it's horrible.
*  So like if we hadn't done these things, what would have the result have been?
*  It's a good question.
*  You know, I mean, would we have achieved herd immunity?
*  Or would we have achieved it quicker?
*  Because herd immunity is like 60% of the people that have been infected.
*  Then the virus sort of dies off.
*  Right.
*  You know, when you look at the Spanish flu, when you look at the history of that,
*  and you know, the places that did something fared much better than the places that didn't.
*  The end result was, you know, all these people died.
*  It goes through the same amount of time, but just you have a lot more fatalities, you know?
*  And it's always been this kind of calculation, like, you know, people are doing the math.
*  I feel like people are doing the math and they're saying,
*  okay, X amount will die, but we've got to get back to work and get these people to work.
*  And they're trying to figure out that equation.
*  Is the suffering of the people that are probably going to survive even if they get it,
*  is that suffering going to be greater than the suffering for families who lose people, right?
*  So that's that balancing act.
*  And you can see where people are coming out on it.
*  Certain places are like, no, it's just time to go.
*  And yeah, there'll be casualties, but we'll deal.
*  And other people are saying, save lives at all cost.
*  Well, if we say save lives at all cost, we should all stop driving.
*  I don't want to do that too.
*  But you know what I'm saying?
*  Yeah, no, I know what you're saying.
*  Yeah, right.
*  There's things at a risk.
*  This is one of those things that's a uniquely human problem because there's no real answer for it.
*  Because most human problems are like, whoa, hmm.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  No, right.
*  You kind of, we're all isolated on this one thing.
*  Yep.
*  And then you stop thinking, well, we live at risk all day long.
*  Yeah.
*  You know.
*  Well, not only do we live at risk all day long, but we make decisions that could put ourselves at risk
*  and we're allowed to make those decisions.
*  But with this, you're not allowed to make those decisions.
*  And the idea is, well, because you put others at risk.
*  Okay.
*  But who and why and do you know, when do we decide?
*  Like, how long can we go on with this?
*  If we don't have any new tools in July, what is going to be the difference between July and now?
*  Well, that's what Fauci is saying about the fall.
*  He's saying that, you know, there's going to be a resurgence of it in the fall.
*  You're going to have more because it's the flu season.
*  People are going to, and you need to be prepared with testing and stuff to deal with this in the right way
*  or else you're back to what we were dealing with in April and May.
*  And that you've got to be, you got to learn from it and be prepared.
*  It's the testing, the testing, the testing.
*  Yeah. It just seems, you know, Elon just opened up his factory in California, the Tesla factory,
*  and said, come arrest me.
*  Right.
*  Basically saying what you're doing is a violation of civil liberties.
*  You're telling people that they're not allowed to go to work
*  and that this is, we've become a fascist state.
*  See how that goes.
*  Yeah. I kind of feel like they're seeing, like they know that they'll save lives this way.
*  But they, I mean, look, if you're the, if you're the governor, right?
*  What do you do?
*  What do you do?
*  I mean, you want to, you want people to be safe,
*  but you also are looking at the books every day and realizing that your state is in need of a trillion dollars to survive.
*  Like it would be.
*  If, I mean, if that's it, it might be a lot more than that.
*  Yeah.
*  Like, you know.
*  That's just based on what we know is active and the businesses that are open right now.
*  Right.
*  A friend of mine was saying how many people are unemployed right now and they don't even know it.
*  Yeah.
*  Their business is just never going to make it.
*  Right.
*  And then also there's going to be less people with money.
*  So there's going to be less spending.
*  So these economies are going to need some sort of a resurgence.
*  So if you're the governor, you're not out there just to control people and take away their civil liberties
*  because you're screwing yourself on the other end, you know,
*  with people being broke and the economy falling apart.
*  So you're in this, in this spot.
*  I do not envy it.
*  It's also when you start telling people what to do,
*  it's very difficult to stop.
*  Once you have the ability to tell people what to do,
*  it's very difficult to just turn that off and go,
*  go ahead, go back to normal, do whatever you want to do now.
*  Right, right.
*  Which is what we used to do just four months ago, right?
*  Do whatever you want to do.
*  Yeah.
*  But now all of a sudden,
*  do you see that goofy fucking list that they put out of all the stuff you can and can't do?
*  No.
*  It's even goofier than the list that we saw about the beaches.
*  Oh, really?
*  It's fucking preposterous.
*  It's really long list that California put out of things you're allowed to do outside.
*  You can meditate, you can do soft martial arts,
*  you can watch the sunrise or the sunset.
*  I mean, it's so asinine.
*  It's just so, you're getting people, in this case,
*  you're getting people that have no business telling people what to do.
*  And all of a sudden they've been assigned this ability to tell people
*  what they're allowed to do and not to do.
*  Right.
*  And so they make this gigantic stupid fucking list.
*  And it's really offensive.
*  It is a weird thing.
*  It's fucking dumb.
*  And Crenshaw put something up on his Instagram,
*  see if you can find it,
*  where he shows what you can and can't do in this one particular list
*  and how preposterous it is.
*  There's a bunch of lists that different states are putting up
*  and different states have different approaches.
*  One thing that I do like about the fact that we are the United States of America
*  is that different states do have different approaches
*  and we get to watch how that experiment plays out.
*  It is an experiment, isn't it?
*  I'm just like, so how's Georgia?
*  Every day I sit down, like what's going on down there?
*  Permitted.
*  Walking, running, exercising, surfing, fishing, no chairs.
*  Oh.
*  Prohibited.
*  Sunbathing, sitting in chairs, group sports, groups of people, swimming.
*  And here's what he says,
*  for your daily dose of things that are stupid, here you go.
*  How many geniuses sat around and deliberated over these particulars?
*  Okay, they can fish, but we don't want them getting any sun while they fish
*  and no chairs because we are saving lives.
*  High fives all around.
*  He's so right.
*  I guess this is New Jersey.
*  OCNJ, that's New Jersey, right?
*  Yeah, Ocean County, New Jersey.
*  Yeah.
*  Fuck off.
*  Yeah.
*  Fuck off with that group.
*  So what do you think?
*  At this point, let's just let it rip.
*  I don't think it'll let it rip.
*  I think education is imperative.
*  I think, first of all,
*  there has to be some education on how to strengthen your immune system.
*  There are experts that understand that.
*  I mean, I'm having Dr. Ron DePatrick on tomorrow to talk about this.
*  I think it's very important to talk about supplementation,
*  to talk about hermetic effects of heat shock proteins, cold shock proteins,
*  what we can do as far as mitigating the stresses that you get
*  from not having enough sleep, meditation,
*  all sorts of different things that we need to teach people
*  how to strengthen your immune system, how to keep your body healthy.
*  I'm with you 100%.
*  I'm doing all that stuff, learning about it as I go through life
*  and I meditate, I take vitamins, I exercise.
*  You eat a lot of bread.
*  I eat a lot of bread.
*  This bread is so much better.
*  I bet it's good.
*  Better than the last one?
*  It might be the best ones I've ever made.
*  Shut the fuck up.
*  How is it possible?
*  I swear to God.
*  The last one was perfection.
*  I'm home.
*  I just keep getting better.
*  How do you get better at bread?
*  You get better.
*  There's so many things that go into it every day.
*  I don't understand how you get better at bread.
*  I'm telling you.
*  We'll wait till you see it.
*  I'm glad you're around, man.
*  I'm eating bread right now.
*  You're agreeing, but?
*  All that stuff is great, but that list you just said about
*  heat proteins, that is so much more complicated than
*  no chairs at the beach, dummy.
*  Yes, it is.
*  Honestly, when you talk to people just out there shopping,
*  doing stuff, going to the beach,
*  the guy who's setting up his tent with his poles
*  and he's got his thing, that guy's not going to know shit about...
*  I got my beach fence.
*  Don't spit in my area.
*  He's not going to know anything about his immune system
*  or any of the proteins.
*  But don't...
*  You can, with the herd, you've got to tell them,
*  no, dummy, fish, no chair.
*  Why can't you fucking sit down and fish?
*  I mean...
*  That's so crazy.
*  Like when you cast out to the surf and you have bait,
*  you sit down, you put your fucking pole in a pole holder,
*  so it's standing there, and you sit back and you watch your line.
*  Because there's going to be some jackass who's going to...
*  They're going to come up and say, sir, they said no chairs.
*  I got my pole, I'm fishing.
*  We're all fishing, right, honey?
*  We all got a pole.
*  Fishing but no chairs.
*  Chairs are dangerous.
*  If you stay put, it could come get you.
*  It's preposterous.
*  It is preposterous.
*  But the other part of the United States of America,
*  and then we all get to make our own rules and see this experiment,
*  is like the information flow is so confusing.
*  It's been so...
*  I mean, from the first time we heard about it in January,
*  there's this thing...
*  I have been looking at my phone every day going,
*  is that true?
*  Is this right?
*  Is this true?
*  Is that...
*  Wait.
*  I read it on Twitter.
*  No masks, now a mask, now not a mask.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Even Fauci.
*  I posted something from 60 Minutes yesterday.
*  I read that.
*  I saw that.
*  Fauci was saying you don't need to wear a mask.
*  This was like two months ago.
*  That was early, right?
*  That was early.
*  Fucking March is not that early, man.
*  I know, but that's when they were saying no mask
*  because they didn't have masks.
*  Is that why?
*  I think so.
*  Well, maybe.
*  But he was saying you don't...
*  He's specifically, you don't need a mask.
*  Yeah.
*  But look, there's people out there wearing masks
*  while they're driving in their cars.
*  It's confusing.
*  That's why I put it up.
*  You fuck.
*  Because I see these fucking dorks.
*  I know.
*  I'm like, come on, man.
*  Who's in your car blowing germs in your face?
*  I know, by yourself.
*  And by the way, those things are not going to keep
*  the air from coming in your mouth.
*  No.
*  And it's in the air.
*  If it's in the air, it's going to get in your mouth.
*  It's going to keep you from spitting it out, maybe,
*  and getting it on somebody.
*  Maybe it'll stem the flow a little bit.
*  And yeah, if you're out in public,
*  particularly if you're going around a lot of people
*  and you think you might have something with a mask.
*  I'm in the supermarket wearing my mask, wearing this.
*  Just pull this up on my thing.
*  You're a bandit.
*  I go with the bandit.
*  All of a sudden, everyone's a bandit.
*  Everyone's a bandit.
*  Everyone's robbing a bank.
*  I can't wait for the first time someone robs something
*  and they've all got their mask on.
*  I'm sure it's already happened.
*  I'm sure it's already happened.
*  Everyone's robbing a bank.
*  Everyone's robbing a bank.
*  Everyone's robbing a bank.
*  I'm in there with this stupid-ass mask.
*  It's hot.
*  It fogs up my glasses.
*  I'm itchy.
*  My eyes are running.
*  I'm trying not to touch my face with all this stuff.
*  This is not helping me.
*  No.
*  Yeah, well, that was the thing Fauci said in the video,
*  that when you wear a mask,
*  people start messing with their face.
*  Yes.
*  I'm not a bandit.
*  I'm a bandit.
*  I'm a bandit.

*  I like the width.
*  I like both.
*  I like the width.
*  The benefits will be the same with or without.
*  Yeah, sure.
*  Yeah.
*  It's great stuff.
*  That's really good.
*  It's tasty.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a small amount of CBD.
*  That's 25 milligrams.
*  But I'm addicted to these things.
*  I drink them all the time.
*  All right.
*  I'm on it.
*  I also take CBD.
*  I use-
*  I drop.
*  I had those for a while.
*  Yeah.
*  CBD, MD.
*  I get that stuff.
*  And I put the tincture.
*  Yeah.
*  They help me sleep.
*  That's great.
*  It's great for people with arthritis and stiff joints and things along those lines.
*  Right.
*  You know?
*  So that's what I wanted.
*  That's what I want to get people into.
*  Get people healthy.
*  Recognizing like, hey, here's a time where you can understand that it's important to
*  have a healthy body.
*  And this is why.
*  Because you look at who this is hitting, the people that are dying.
*  Yeah.
*  We went over it yesterday.
*  Significant increase in likelihood of death when you're older.
*  Older or obese or diabetic?
*  Yes.
*  New York, that's the number one thing.
*  Oh, is it really?
*  Yeah.
*  They were saying the number one thing that led to mortality.
*  Wow.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  You see, like, I know.
*  Imagine being fat as fuck and you're like, god damn, I wish I had a little warning.
*  I'd like to get healthy, but all of a sudden-
*  I know.
*  Out of nowhere?
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  Out of nowhere, I can kill you.
*  Before, it just was tough going upstairs.
*  I just had to buy bigger pants.
*  I just felt shitty about myself when I looked in the mirror.
*  Yeah.
*  I just avoided mirrors.
*  I was just being threatened.
*  Yeah, literally.
*  Yeah, literally.
*  I know.
*  People are dying.
*  I know.
*  You got to be strong.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, it's just terrible for the people that lost people.
*  It's terrible for people who die.
*  I'm with you on all this stuff, but I just do not think this is the way to handle it.
*  I think quarantining the people that are at risk is a far better option, far smarter
*  option.
*  Yeah.
*  Better testing.
*  If you have older people in your family, they stay in their place.
*  You don't go see them until we get the vaccine or get through it.
*  There aren't numbers.
*  If we're just going by the science and you're going by the hard numbers, the majority of
*  the workforce could probably go out and work.
*  The majority.
*  The vast majority.
*  Yeah.
*  There should be some sort of a waiver for people who can't or don't want to or have
*  anxiety about it.
*  Yeah, okay.
*  But I think most people want to go back to work.
*  I know.
*  I mean, I've been offered to go do shows in a club in a couple weeks.
*  Addison Improv's opened back up.
*  Apparently, they're opening back up this weekend.
*  Texas doesn't give a fuck.
*  I love it.
*  Would you perform?
*  Would you go to a club?
*  Yes.
*  I would book it.
*  Yeah.
*  I want to do it.
*  I don't know what I'm going to do, man.
*  I mean, if July is legit, if that's really when we go back, that's too many months.
*  It's a lot of months.
*  Too many months to not do stand-up.
*  I know.
*  I start feeling a little weird.
*  Well, also, your stand-up's going to suck.
*  You were talking about how your cardiovascular system goes down.
*  Yeah.
*  How about your stand-up system?
*  I know.
*  We'll get that back quick, though.
*  We will.
*  Yeah.
*  But, man.
*  If you get there on Wednesday, by Friday, you'll have your system back.
*  Yeah, you'll be good.
*  You'll be good to go.
*  Maybe.
*  Your voice will be sore.
*  My god, my throat is out of breath.
*  You won't be thinking right.
*  Yeah, your throat will be out of shape.
*  It's really true.
*  It is true.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  But it looks like if you want, there's going to be clubs.
*  I mean, you'll have to fly to them.
*  You'll have to go to Texas.
*  You'll have to fly to them.
*  You've got to go to Addison.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I heard there's some other clubs around the country that are going to start opening up
*  as well.
*  How was the thing on the weekend?
*  Your thing.
*  Oh, the UFC?
*  Yeah.
*  It was interesting.
*  Yeah.
*  Very weird.
*  Was it weird?
*  Very weird.
*  Huge arena.
*  No one in it.
*  No one in it.
*  15,000-seat arena.
*  Maybe 10 people in the audience.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  And it was all people that worked for the UFC.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  Like us, the three commentators, sound people, a few other folks, judges.
*  Like rehearsal.
*  Because there was the judges and then the doctors and state officials, medical officials,
*  athletic commission people.
*  Okay.
*  And then they just come out and fight and you just hear them breathing and stuff?
*  Oh my God.
*  Well, first of all, the main event was spectacular.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  It was an incredible fight.
*  And it was a fucking war.
*  But it was a war where unlike any other war, there's no crowd.
*  And you're hearing everything.
*  You're hearing every smack of the flesh, every deep breath.
*  You hear them breathing in the nostrils with broken noses.
*  You can hear the fluid as they're breathing in because their nose is broken and blood's
*  pouring out of it.
*  It was crazy.
*  It was crazy.
*  Jeez.
*  They should just play music over it or something.
*  No.
*  Play crowd music.
*  No.
*  No, that was part of the thing.
*  Was it cool?
*  Was it cool?
*  It sounds kind of like...
*  Yeah.
*  I didn't hate it.
*  Yeah.
*  I was very fortunate.
*  Very fortunate to be there, one of the few people to be there live while this is going
*  on.
*  That's how I felt.
*  Yeah, of the whole world.
*  Yeah.
*  While it was happening, I was like, wow, I'm so lucky I get to be here.
*  That's how I felt.
*  Even if I have to fly to fucking Florida to do it.
*  It was odd.
*  It was all odd.
*  That is weird.
*  What was it like going through the... getting off the plane, taking the car to the thing?
*  It was all weird.
*  Weird.
*  The driver's got a mouth covering on.
*  Right.
*  He was pretty cool about it.
*  And I went to a restaurant.
*  You did?
*  Yeah.
*  I ate at a Morton steakhouse.
*  All open.
*  Yep.
*  Sat down.
*  Normalist.
*  The waiter had a mask on.
*  They made him wear masks.
*  Me and Eddie Bravo sat down, had steak, had a glass of wine.
*  Geez.
*  People at the next tables?
*  There was one or two other couples.
*  There was an older couple.
*  Not that we were a couple.
*  Excuse me.
*  There was one older couple and one younger couple.
*  And then there was maybe a couple other people at the bar.
*  So it was fairly empty.
*  But also it was like four o'clock in the afternoon.
*  Oh, okay.
*  Are they limiting how many people can come in?
*  Yeah, I think in a lot of places.
*  My friend Nick, he owns a Gaetano's restaurant in Vegas.
*  He showed me a diagram of what they're allowed to do.
*  They used a ruler to measure out the floor.
*  And they put six feet in between tables.
*  Kind of like every other table, they put a black tablecloth over it so you couldn't
*  use that table.
*  So people were separated.
*  But I mean, how much of this is science?
*  How much of this is nonsense?
*  Yeah, I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  Nobody knows.
*  I feel like every conversation we have about all of it, it always ends up with, who knows?
*  Because if you've got all these tables blocked off, you've got a black tablecloth on, you
*  can't use that.
*  What if someone's coughing over there?
*  Are you cool eating your spaghetti?
*  Well, this guy's coughing 12 feet away from you.
*  Who knows what's going on in the kitchen?
*  Who knows what the busboy putting their utensils out?
*  Right, who knows?
*  But maybe I keep thinking as we're going around town, doing our thing, and being cautious
*  with take out all the, like, maybe we're playing the odds.
*  Maybe the odds are more in our favor if we can kind of cut down on some of the dumb stuff.
*  Maybe our immune system is going to turn into a pile of goo.
*  A mushy, bitch ass immune system that can't handle anything.
*  Oh man, I really thought I had it.
*  I was so upset that I didn't.
*  I know.
*  Everybody thought that.
*  I think I had a sniffle back in January.
*  Yeah, I know it.
*  I was in Seattle.
*  I was on the airplane.
*  I came home.
*  I felt like shit.
*  Gary G, I'm immune.
*  I gotta be immune.
*  Everybody said that.
*  Tim Dillon was fucking convinced.
*  Dude, I was so sick.
*  I was sicker than I've ever been in December.
*  I'm telling you, I got it.
*  Nothing.
*  Nothing.
*  And then I told my wife and she's like, none of those tests are working anyway.
*  That's not true.
*  It's like, you gotta believe in the testing.
*  I've been swabbed.
*  I saw you get the swab.
*  That did not look fun.
*  Yeah, I got it.
*  You were rocked.
*  Yeah, it just tickles.
*  It's like, ugh.
*  You were messed up for like 15 minutes.
*  You were kind of like, oof.
*  No.
*  You looked weird.
*  No.
*  Yeah.
*  You're exaggerating.
*  Yes, you are.
*  You were playing pool.
*  You were like, hmm.
*  This felt weird.
*  No, I told you.
*  I was like, I'm gonna beat you for 15 minutes, but it's not that bad.
*  I wasn't acting weird.
*  If it wasn't for the pandemic, I would have had to hold you as you cried.
*  I was weeping on the inside.
*  That makes you feel better.
*  I had it done again on Sunday, though, and it was way easier.
*  I think my right nostril is less sensitive to my left nostril, if that makes any sense.
*  Well, she said as she was going in, I'm basically touching your brain.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, but they did it again on my right nostril on Sunday and it was nothing.
*  Interesting.
*  It's weird.
*  I really think I have a sensitive nostril.
*  Oh, that's weird.
*  Well, it's been broken.
*  Right.
*  Fucking nose is useless.
*  How many times?
*  Oh, who knows?
*  Broke it first when I was five.
*  Fell down the flight of stairs when I was five.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  Geez.
*  I've had broken noses ever since then.
*  Like, no bullshit.
*  Seriously.
*  I've never broken my nose.
*  Ever?
*  Not once.
*  We can fix that.
*  Jamie can headbutt you.
*  We can film and make great TikTok videos.
*  That'd be great.
*  We'll go viral.
*  Well, have you broken anything?
*  The only thing I broke was my nose.
*  I broke my nose.
*  I broke my nose.
*  I broke my nose.
*  I broke my nose.
*  The only thing I broke was I broke a collarbone, a rib once when I was surfing and learning
*  to surf and it went right into my gut.
*  And then I broke the top of my foot, one of the bones on the top of my foot.
*  Those are weird, right?
*  Because you can't do shit about them.
*  You can't do anything.
*  Yeah, I broke that before too.
*  Except stop you from playing.
*  You just walk fucked up for a month and a half.
*  It's true.
*  Did you break your collarbone or just a rib?
*  Just a rib.
*  Oh.
*  Just a rib.
*  Yeah, I know a dude who had a fake collarbone.
*  He had a steel plate because his collarbone was so shattered in a motorcycle accident
*  that they had to replace it.
*  So he had like a steel plate in place of his collarbone.
*  That's weird.
*  It hurt like hell when it got cold out.
*  Oh really?
*  Yeah, because it's a metal piece in your fucking shoulder.
*  That's not good.
*  Collarbone is a weird one.
*  It is a strange one.
*  You know what's weird?
*  I've never seen anybody break it in all the years I've seen fights.
*  Wow, that's interesting because it's pretty delicate.
*  I would think so.
*  I remember someone saying that.
*  Like, if I was over in a fight, I would just punch someone in the collarbone.
*  I'm like, mm.
*  Yeah, I don't think that's going to work.
*  I love how everybody walks around just with their one move in their head.
*  And when that goes south, the look of panic in their face when it doesn't work.
*  Right.
*  I'll just grab them by the balls and pull.
*  Dude, I woke up this morning and I spent the first hour of my day watching Russian slap
*  fighting videos.
*  Of course you did.
*  It might be the dumbest thing that's going on today.
*  Slap fighting?
*  Yeah, they just stand in front.
*  You know what it is?
*  No.
*  Oh, is that when the two guys, it looks like they're going to arm wrestle?
*  They just stand in front of each other and they let each other slap each other in the
*  face.
*  And first of all, whoever goes first has such a monster advantage.
*  Yeah, of course.
*  Because they KO each other all the time.
*  These huge guys.
*  And they swing from the hip and the other guy doesn't even move.
*  And they open palm strike each other in the face.
*  I spent an hour today.
*  Is this new or was this like an old Russian tradition?
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know how long it's been around for.
*  I think the first time I watched it was like about a year or two ago, maybe.
*  I don't remember.
*  But it was this morning.
*  It was the fucking...
*  The slap you right in the head.
*  It was the thing de jure.
*  It's funny.
*  What makes you when you wake up think, you know, I'm going to look up, like when you
*  first pick up your device.
*  Because I remember there was this one video of a bunch of people standing around and this
*  guy slapped this guy and KO'd him.
*  And all the people that were standing around were like, wah!
*  And they thought it was cool.
*  I was like, that might be the only time where people think it's cool to be right next to
*  someone who got violent brain trauma.
*  Yeah.
*  And I was trying to find that video because it was such a strange video.
*  Right.
*  Because there was...
*  I don't remember if there's a table or not.
*  That's weird.
*  People were standing around and they were laughing and smiling while this guy went unconscious.
*  And I was like, that's so odd.
*  Right.
*  The tribal.
*  Do they not know that this is really bad?
*  Some terrible things just happened to this guy.
*  They think it's funny they're laughing.
*  Yeah.
*  No idea.
*  But it's almost like it's not real because it's slapping.
*  It's not a punch.
*  Like if he kicked him in the head and the same thing happened.
*  He goes unconscious and falls back.
*  People are like, oh my God.
*  Oh my God.
*  They'd be freaked out.
*  They slap each other and everyone's like, ha ha.
*  Like what the fuck is that?
*  No sitting on the beach.
*  Yeah.
*  The people you're talking to.
*  Yeah.
*  It was one of those weird things.
*  I'm like, how did this become okay?
*  Yeah.
*  Where you just...
*  Full brain trauma.
*  It's so crazy.
*  I mean you can see their head snap.
*  You see their head wiggle and the brain sloshing around inside their noggin.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, it's like in any fight, right?
*  If you're watching a fight.
*  What is this one here, Jamie?
*  Oh, here goes one.
*  This guy's 6'7 on the left.
*  He's a former MMA fighter from Brazil it says.
*  Oh my God.
*  This is all Russia?
*  They put powder in their hands too.
*  Oh my goodness.
*  He didn't even move.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh my goodness.
*  They put a lot of fucking force in that too.
*  He is a rock.
*  Look at the size of his neck though.
*  This guy's pow...
*  Why do they powder up their hands?
*  To show the mark.
*  Take the sweat off?
*  Look at this.
*  Here we go.
*  They're mic'd up too.
*  Here we go.
*  Oh my goodness.
*  Oh, my goodness.
*  Oh, he took it.
*  Why do they...
*  It's so stupid.
*  I don't understand why they're looking at the powder.
*  I don't understand why they're doing it.
*  He's right.
*  He slid his ear down.
*  Hold on a second.
*  Back that up.
*  There's rules.
*  Hold on.
*  He is right.
*  He slid his ear down.
*  He slid his ear down.
*  It was a foul.
*  It was a foul.
*  He slid his...
*  Oh, because you can't mess with the guy's ear.
*  What?
*  He probably moved his head down when he was in mid swing.
*  When I was a young slapper, one of the techniques would be get his ear and bring it down towards
*  the chin.
*  Oh, they have rules.
*  Okay, let me see the rules here.
*  Oh, it's...
*  One more time.
*  They're not barbarians.
*  He's going to smack him again.
*  Oh, my goodness.
*  Oh, he...
*  They're also doing this in a prison, by the way.
*  Oh, of course they are.
*  He looks fucked up there.
*  Oh, the audience...
*  He's spitting a tooth out.
*  Is he?
*  He looks like he's spitting something out.
*  Oh, he got rocked.
*  Oh, do you need a doctor?
*  Doctor?
*  Oh, I'm sorry.
*  Oh, do you need a doctor?
*  Do you need a doctor, he asked him.
*  That's okay.
*  How do you ask someone?
*  And they shake hands.
*  Now we're cool.
*  Shake hands.
*  Let's see if he's got powdered sugar all over his face.
*  And now he's coming in for another hit.
*  This is...
*  Oh, God.
*  This is without being to stay at home.
*  This is how bored they are.
*  Look at the swing.
*  He's a big dude.
*  Mm-hmm.
*  Here it comes.
*  One, two...
*  Oh, my goodness.
*  He got him in the ear.
*  Is that all right?
*  Ow!
*  What are the rules?
*  The guy's holding the guy.
*  He's holding the guy.
*  He's holding the guy.
*  He's holding the guy.
*  The guy's holding onto the desk for dear life.
*  What are the rules?
*  Is that legal?
*  Look at my...
*  There's no rules.
*  This is a 30-minute video.
*  It's 30 minutes.
*  It was strong.
*  He punched him really good.
*  He punched him really good.
*  This is like the translation.
*  These are the people you're going to explain.
*  They're getting points for successful hits.
*  Oh, come on.
*  Really?
*  I said one versus two earlier.
*  No, I just think they're just doing this until one guy drops.
*  This little chubby.
*  And I'm betting on the black eye.
*  He's taking these so much better.
*  The other guy seems like he's...
*  Oh my God.
*  Ow!
*  There's so much force to that.
*  Oh my God.
*  This is so crazy.
*  It was good.
*  It was a good hit.
*  It was good.
*  He smacked you in the face.
*  I love the...
*  And they're shaking hands.
*  I like it, bro.
*  I like it.
*  I like what you did to me there.
*  Oh, look at the side of that guy's face.
*  Look, he's sweating.
*  He's purple.
*  He's sweating.
*  He knows he's going out.
*  Look at him gripping the table.
*  Look at him gripping the table.
*  Watch this.
*  He knows it's like a truck about to hit him in the head.
*  This is the rap right here.
*  He ain't going to make this.
*  He's holding on for dear life.
*  He's holding on for dear life.
*  He's still there.
*  Barely.
*  Thumbs up.
*  He's fine.
*  Yes, okay.
*  I closed my eyes.
*  I closed my eyes.
*  Fuck you, man.
*  You scared the shot out of me.
*  What?
*  Scared the shot out?
*  That might be a bad translation.
*  No, it's perfect.
*  That's how you said it.
*  It's three-three.
*  That means there are three hits in each side.
*  Oh my goodness.
*  They're like holding him up.
*  So you take three shots the same place.
*  Have you ever been slapped in the face before?
*  Not like that.
*  Oh my God.
*  I'm sorry.
*  I'm sorry.
*  I'm sorry.
*  I'm sorry.
*  I'm sorry.
*  Not like that.
*  Oh my God.
*  It's horrible.
*  This keeps going for a while.
*  How long?
*  Oh my God.
*  At least 10 minutes.
*  This is a 30-minute video.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh my God.
*  Someone's going out.
*  Keep going.
*  Scooch that up.
*  His flight lesson.
*  Yeah, that's where I was trying to get to the end.
*  I think that was it.
*  That's it?
*  Yeah.
*  I don't think anyone went out.
*  They gave up?
*  Wow.
*  Both of them.
*  It was great fight.
*  It was great fight.
*  And look how you slapped me.
*  I slapped you.
*  You slapped me.
*  I slapped you.
*  We slapped very good.
*  Good Lord.
*  Hold it.
*  What does it say?
*  I can't betray MMA.
*  Oh, I'm so happy to take part in this show.
*  Interesting format, but I can't betray MMA.
*  I am such a successful sportsman and I know how to fight right.
*  Thank you so much for invitation.
*  It was an honor to fight against such a legend.
*  He is your champ.
*  I would love to come back.
*  So apparently-
*  He flew in.
*  He flew in to smack the Russian guy and the Russian guy smacked him back.
*  And he earned respect.
*  Respect.
*  There are so many of these videos, man.
*  You could do this all day.
*  You could just watch guys slap each other all day.
*  Do they get knocked out a lot?
*  Oh yeah.
*  And when they do it's spectacular.
*  Put up the one that I put on my Instagram today because that one is a dude who has his
*  eyeballs tattooed.
*  I was trying to see if they got money for that.
*  They got 150,000 ruble prize.
*  Oh, that's like $30.
*  $2,000.
*  I want to see.
*  Put up the one from my Instagram today.
*  There's one enormous guy and another guy looks like he might have lifted weights once in
*  high school.
*  Once.
*  It's such a mismatch.
*  Whoever sanctioned this is a real asshole because they got this kid.
*  That's the same guy.
*  Yeah, back it up.
*  Back it up.
*  Oh yeah, the same dude.
*  I can't.
*  Okay, just play it again because watch it.
*  Watch this guy.
*  He has no force.
*  Look at this.
*  Yeah.
*  Nothing.
*  It's a drive-by.
*  Nothing.
*  So this guy apparently is the champ.
*  So he bitch slapped the champ.
*  They let him get the first slap.
*  And that was like a little lady slap.
*  But watch what homeboy does to him.
*  This is horrific.
*  This is horrific.
*  First of all, look how little that guy is.
*  He's so little.
*  Look at his neck.
*  Why does he look so weird?
*  Because he's got tattoos everywhere and his eyeballs are tattooed.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Look at his eyeball.
*  That guy doesn't remember anything about childhood now.
*  All that stuff's been erased.
*  Oh my God.
*  He's like an etch and sketch that you shake.
*  You want to clear the screen?
*  One more time.
*  Watch this again.
*  Nothing.
*  Little slap.
*  He slapped me.
*  I barely noticed slap.
*  Now watch the fucking thunderous boom.
*  These guys know how to do it too.
*  That guy hit it.
*  Yeah, he really does.
*  He hit it with the fingers.
*  He weighs like 500 pounds.
*  He's enormous.
*  He slapped him with the fingers where the other guy is going to use the palm of his
*  hand.
*  He's going to really catch him.
*  Oh God.
*  This kid.
*  Boom.
*  It looks like his head came off.
*  Yeah, it looks like he's shot.
*  It looks like he's been shot.
*  When his hat falls off, it's like his head just exploded.
*  Oh, teeth are coming out.
*  This is...
*  Oh, good Lord.
*  Imagine that guy.
*  First of all, that guy looks like he's never even punched someone.
*  The way he did it was so...
*  He looks like a skater kid.
*  He's a sad guy.
*  That's why he's got all those fucked up tattoos on his face and everything.
*  He's probably emotionally disturbed.
*  They talked him into it.
*  My friend, you could be great slap fighter of all time.
*  You could be the one.
*  Did you see that Street Fight video going around the last two days?
*  Good Lord.
*  Now.
*  No, what you should see is my friend Robin Black's takedown of it.
*  Put up Robin Black's from his Instagram because he had some great lines in it.
*  This is fucking two dudes who look like they're all methed out.
*  They get in a street fight.
*  Here, play it.
*  Give me some volume on this.
*  Robin Black one minute breakdown.
*  Neighborhood karate.
*  Shortness Steve versus Street Steve.
*  Shortness skip kick.
*  Tappa tappa blocked.
*  Big big big five punch combination with a round kick chaser.
*  Now for the street elegance.
*  Watch this.
*  What the fuck?
*  Modified spinning crescent kick to a bevy of punches including the gin fizz uppercut that
*  stuns shirtless Steve and now pink liver damage for the win.
*  Assumed the after school show to constance versus the street Steve tournament karate
*  special and unfocused entry brings Stephen to range for the street surge and the acid
*  reflux special.
*  More knuckles plus a converse kick.
*  Now behold the spin full rotation of the body.
*  He'll look over his shoulder, find the target and fire off a spinning hook kick.
*  But years of meth and inactivity will bind the hips.
*  Another angle.
*  OK.
*  This two angles.
*  Oh, he thinks I'm still strong and Steve guy gets kicked to the face.
*  He's like, oh, and now the finisher.
*  No, wait, false start.
*  Let's line this bastard up.
*  Last call for liver delivery.
*  Bink.
*  That's right.
*  We're living in a world of total documentation.
*  We've got the overhead.
*  How crazy is that?
*  The street fight has two angles.
*  But I love years of meth and inactivity.
*  Because Robin Black, my friend who did this video, who did the narration, he does real
*  breakdowns of actual fights.
*  He's a martial arts expert.
*  He knows what he's doing.
*  Yeah.
*  So the fact that he does this occasionally, he does it for everything.
*  He'll do it for like bugs fighting.
*  He does it for all kinds of shit.
*  But also do it for like world class fights.
*  He does them for Bellator.
*  Oh my God.
*  It's hilarious.
*  Years of inactivity and meth will bind the hips.
*  I was going to say he did the murder hornet and praying mantis and he did do it.
*  Did he?
*  Oh, put it on.
*  I haven't seen it.
*  I haven't seen it.
*  These murder hornets are bad news.
*  Praying mantises fuck up everything.
*  We're lucky they're little.
*  They would kill us all.
*  It's going to beat the murder hornet?
*  Oh yeah, for sure.
*  What?
*  Praying mantises beat up everything.
*  Really?
*  They kill rats.
*  Kung Fu Mantis versus Murder Hornet.
*  Look how quickly.
*  Whoa.
*  Kung Fu Mantis will dominate by exploiting the structural truth of Murder Hornet's anatomical
*  shape.
*  The connective path of Hornet's head, thorax, and abdomen create a curve with directional
*  limitations for movement.
*  By gripping the outer curve, Kung Fu Mantis stays beyond and behind stinging distance.
*  Reach as he might, Murder Hornet simply cannot inject his venom into Kung Fu Mantis.
*  So make no mistake, he's fighting for his life.
*  The mantis has him.
*  Wow.
*  His resistance can create little new wobbles.
*  Free his head, but Mantis adjusts his grip, slicing with his tibial spines to regain
*  his positional preeminence.
*  Whoa.
*  My friends, this is not for the faint of heart.
*  In nature, the flesh and tissues of one feeds the body of another.
*  Kung Fu Mantis is dining on Murder Hornet, leaving him alive.
*  Mantis eats in a quest to simply continue his existence, and Murder Hornet continues
*  to thrash to preserve his.
*  Oh my god.
*  Even as his sentience leaves him, his instincts of self-preservation are powerful.
*  A mighty reach with his weapon and a search for leverage or texture wherever it may exist.
*  He's going right through the head.
*  He's just eating his head.
*  His head.
*  From the back.
*  Forward.
*  Crazy.
*  Eyeball first.
*  He's ate his whole head.
*  Meanwhile, the bee's still alive.
*  It's eating like a corn on the cob.
*  Like an apple.
*  Jeez.
*  Oh my god.
*  But the instincts to survive remain, and as his body dissembles, perhaps we see the beauty
*  here.
*  We see the end of the world.
*  We see the beauty here.
*  We see the elegant nature of life on earth.
*  We feel the mighty grip of existence.
*  I don't know if I feel good that Murder Hornets can get schooled or that Prey Mantises exist.
*  I love both things.
*  I love it.
*  We need to just make more Mantises and release them on these fucking pussy ass Murder Hornets.
*  Yeah.
*  Holy cow.
*  Dude, Prey Mantises are god damn terrifying.
*  They get everything.
*  They get everything.
*  You ever see them get hummingbirds?
*  He didn't even think for a second.
*  He just got it.
*  Yeah.
*  He's like, bitch, what?
*  Yeah.
*  It was one move.
*  They have so much leverage in those claws.
*  Those weird fucking shaped things.
*  Those weird shaped things are just designed to hold shit so they can cut it in half.
*  And eat its head.
*  Bro.
*  It eats hummingbirds.
*  They eat hummingbirds.
*  Holy shit.
*  Here, watch this.
*  So this hummingbird doesn't know what that is.
*  It just sings, oh, I'm bigger than you and I'm just hanging out.
*  And this thing's on the bird feeder, but I'm sure it's nothing.
*  Nothing to worry about.
*  And watch how it moves.
*  Watch how quick it is.
*  The Prey Mantises.
*  Arms cocked.
*  But the movement.
*  Watch this.
*  Booyah!
*  Oh.
*  It got a hummingbird by its head.
*  It doesn't give a fuck.
*  They're so strong.
*  Oh my god.
*  Prey Mantises are so strong.
*  His back legs are just hanging on the bird feeder and his front is eating a bird.
*  Yeah.
*  And just drop down with it.
*  Now, here's the thing.
*  If you had arms, like proportionate arms, like look how small the arms are.
*  Wow.
*  And how you would imagine, like, god, they can't be strong.
*  They have to be weak.
*  They're levers.
*  They're levers and also they're insect levers with an exoskeleton.
*  And they have preposterous amounts of strength relative to their size.
*  Geez.
*  Like, have you ever seen ants carry things off?
*  Yeah.
*  Like, it's ridiculous.
*  Yeah, it's crazy.
*  They're so much stronger proportionately than we are.
*  And we are so lucky.
*  Do you remember Starship Troopers?
*  Look at this, guys.
*  Let's see.
*  Oh, my god.
*  Lucky.
*  Do you remember Starship Troopers?
*  Look at this, guys.
*  Let's get involved.
*  This guy meddles.
*  Yeah, the guy saved the hummingbird's life.
*  Fuck.
*  The little points of contact for its little legs to be holding on to that.
*  Crazy.
*  Plus the bird's trying to fly away and it's like, you're staying here.
*  Yeah, it's like, no bitch.
*  Good lord.
*  It's crazy.
*  They're so strong.
*  That is insanity.
*  You don't realize how strong they are until you see, we have this thing in our head where
*  we see something and we think of ourselves and we think of like size.
*  Oh, that's probably weaker than the other thing that's its size.
*  Bigger.
*  We would compare ourselves.
*  But have you ever been around a chimpanzee?
*  Have you ever had a touch of chimp?
*  No.
*  A baby?
*  No.
*  On news radio once we had a baby chimp and it had diapers.
*  It was like two years old.
*  And it was there for some scene that we wind up not even using.
*  But I played with this chimp.
*  And so I'm holding him and it's really heavy.
*  I feel like this little thing.
*  But it feels like it's made out of wood.
*  Like it's so dense.
*  And that's where I had it in my head.
*  And then it was hitting me in the back.
*  And I was like, oh my god, you know, was playing with me.
*  But I was like, this is so strong.
*  And this is a baby, a little baby.
*  But it gives you this understanding like, oh, I have a distorted idea of what it is.
*  Because I think it's like me but little.
*  What strong is.
*  But it's not.
*  It's a totally different kind of thing.
*  It's like the density of its tissue.
*  It's made of monkey parts.
*  It's made of preposterously strong material.
*  Geez, Louise.
*  And that ain't shit compared to a praying mantis.
*  If a praying mantis was the size of a chimp, the chimp would be fucked.
*  That's what's weird about them.
*  We're lucky they're little.
*  Yeah.
*  Do you remember Starship Troopers?
*  Yeah.
*  They were like giant praying mantises that killed everybody.
*  Wait, what?
*  Remember the bugs?
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Those giant bugs that came out of the ground.
*  They basically were like a giant praying mantis or a beetle or some shit.
*  What were the bugs like?
*  I don't remember what they looked like.
*  I just remember them being giant.
*  Yeah, look at that.
*  Bro, it literally is a giant mantis.
*  Yeah, he's got levers.
*  Oh, so different kinds of bugs.
*  Yeah, they're like beetles.
*  They had all kinds.
*  I'm afraid this was a movie in the 90s or something, right?
*  Yeah, 97.
*  Yeah.
*  Whatever happened to that dude who was the head guy?
*  Casper Vendium.
*  He's maybe one of the most handsome people that ever walked to face the earth.
*  He's so perfect.
*  What happened to him?
*  He's beautiful.
*  Yeah, look at him.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  I remember that dude.
*  That's him now, even now today at age 51.
*  Starship Troopers 2017.
*  There was a Starship Troopers 2017?
*  Look at how many there are.
*  There was Starship Troopers 3?
*  There's a lot of them, I think.
*  What?
*  Come on.
*  How is that possible?
*  And he was in all of them.
*  What?
*  Yeah.
*  Show me a video from Starship Troopers 2017.
*  I need to see that.
*  Is there a video?
*  Traitor of Mars.
*  Dun dun dun.
*  Go to videos.
*  Oh, here we go.
*  Oh, boy.
*  It's in Mars.
*  Oh, no.
*  It's a cartoon.
*  Oh, it's fake.
*  You fake fucks.
*  Oh, is it a video game?
*  No, I don't think so.
*  I think it's just a CGI.
*  It was earlier CGI.
*  Oh, it's just a CGI movie.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, wow.
*  Oh, the whole movie.
*  Oh, it's like the beginning of a video game.
*  Isn't it crazy that a CGI movie now is actually cheaper than doing a movie with CGI?
*  You can do the whole thing in CGI now?
*  Yeah.
*  That's how they're making movies right now, because you can't go into production.
*  Oh, that's going to be the death of all actors.
*  Yeah.
*  How many actors are losing their fucking minds now?
*  They're so fragile as it is.
*  Oh, it's got to be weird.
*  Imagine if you were dating a crazy actress, and she was hot, but you stuck around, but
*  even though you knew she was a mess, now the quarantine, there's no auditions, she's just
*  gone crazy.
*  All her real hair colors are gone.
*  Oh, my God.
*  Hey, thanks for signing my book, Joe.
*  I didn't sign your book, bitch.
*  No, but you put a quote on the back.
*  Oh, that's right, I did.
*  And it comes out today, right?
*  It comes out today.
*  You just segueed into book sales, did you?
*  I did.
*  I did.
*  What is it called?
*  It means a lot.
*  It means a lot that you did this.
*  Oh, please, I love you.
*  It says, you're doing great.
*  Yep, you're doing great, and other reasons to stay alive.
*  Everybody's not doing great.
*  Yeah, you are.
*  It's just relative.
*  Some people are doing great.
*  Some people are doing great.
*  Some people are doing great.
*  Some people are doing great.
*  Some people are doing great.
*  I had no idea how relevant it was going to be when I wrote it.
*  I'm in lofty company here on the book.
*  Patton Oswalt, Matt Damon, and Whitney Cummings.
*  Yeah.
*  You have some powerful friends.
*  All good people.
*  Dude, this is a real long book.
*  How long did it take you to write this, bitch?
*  A year and a half.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, about that.
*  How many pages?
*  About 300.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah, you're doing great, and other reasons to stay alive.
*  I had to do the audio book.
*  I had to sneak in during quarantine.
*  How'd you sneak in?
*  It was like the first week, and I had to drive to a secret location and go in and read the
*  book.
*  And I had my Apple Watch on.
*  Did you do it illegally?
*  I guess technically.
*  You had an Apple Watch on?
*  Yes.
*  What happened then?
*  It alerted me when I got there.
*  That what?
*  That I should be staying home.
*  What?
*  Cut the shit.
*  What did it say?
*  It said, reminder, stay at home order.
*  Everybody stay.
*  So your watch is kind of ratting you out.
*  Uh huh.
*  Yeah.
*  Time to switch to Samsung.
*  I know.
*  As soon as I got there, because I felt weird going anyway, but I had to get the audio book
*  done.
*  It was just going to be me and the producer with a mask on.
*  And I got to the spot and I was driving and it was like, you know, the first couple of
*  days, so it was really quiet out there.
*  I'm just cruising along and park in the parking lot, go into the thing and bling on my watch.
*  Reminder, stay at home order.
*  If you were in your car, your Tesla would have argued with it.
*  Shut up, we're trying to make America great.
*  We challenge you.
*  You're infringing on my civil liberties.
*  Let me out.
*  I don't like that.
*  But it was weird going because I was reading the book.
*  You know, you have to read your whole book in like two days.
*  Sorry to go back.
*  And there were parts of the book that were like so on point of what's going on.
*  Like I talk about this thing about animals coming to attack us, like I always run into
*  animals that are attacking me.
*  And then I get the whole last part is I don't want to start talking about germs, E. coli,
*  Ebola, all these germs we haven't heard of yet coming for us that we don't have antibiotics
*  for, like stuff like that.
*  I do this whole run on cruise ships.
*  You're never going to get me on one of those cruise ships.
*  They're filled with disease and I'm reading the book in pandemic.
*  Yeah.
*  That's crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Tim Dillon was here a couple weeks ago and had an epic rant on cruise ships.
*  Oh, really?
*  We found out while he was here that it costs $25 a week to be on one of those cruise ships.
*  What does that mean?
*  It costs $25 a week.
*  For someone to be on?
*  Isn't that what it was?
*  It was like $100 for a four day cruise.
*  It's like $25 a day.
*  Normally it's like a thousand or two thousand or something crazy.
*  That's right.
*  It was like $100.
*  It was more than a four day cruise.
*  It was like five to seven.
*  It's like Mexico or wherever it was.
*  So okay, we broke it down to how many dollars it was a day.
*  So it's like...
*  I'm confused though.
*  Less than, it was less than $20 a day.
*  What the cost of what you do?
*  To be on a cruise ship.
*  It's better than being homeless.
*  We're like how many homeless people just go on a cruise ship because it's all you can
*  eat.
*  You could really get fat.
*  You could go crazy and get fat.
*  Because apparently, I bet, if I had to guess, I've never been on a cruise ship.
*  But I think that the way they make their money is the booze, right?
*  Yeah, I'm sure.
*  So they trick you into going.
*  Oh, you have to pay for the booze.
*  I think so.
*  I don't think they can give you free booze.
*  I don't know.
*  You probably get like one drink for free.
*  Yeah.
*  And then you're just on...
*  Oh.
*  Once you start going on a bend, you just rack up that credit card.
*  Oh my god.
*  They're disgusting without a pandemic.
*  I've never been on one.
*  I've never had a desire to be on one.
*  My kids wanted to go on one.
*  There's a Disney cruise.
*  I'm like, fuck off.
*  You don't know shit.
*  You're six.
*  We're not going on a goddamn Disney cruise.
*  I go to Disneyland and you can leave when you want.
*  If you're going on a cruise and you're stuck in the middle of the ocean with a bunch of
*  wackos.
*  You ever hear that comedian that came on the boat after the last entertainer molested somebody,
*  sexually assaulted someone up on deck so they wouldn't let the performers up on deck?
*  What?
*  A entertainer, some other comic or somebody got a little handsy.
*  They was locked down.
*  So this guy shows up.
*  I forget who it was.
*  A comedian shows up on the boat and he's told you can't go above deck.
*  You've got to stay down in the quarters with the crew.
*  So he has to stay in his room, in his quarters, and his room opened up and the stage door
*  was across the hallway.
*  So he was just sitting down there for days.
*  Then they came, knocked on the door, time to perform.
*  He walks out onto stage in front of a thousand people.
*  Good night everybody, it's over.
*  He goes back into his hole like a hamster, like a rodeo.
*  Oh my God.
*  What comic was that?
*  I forget who it was.
*  I forget who it was.
*  Oh my God, that's awful.
*  Oh, so brutal.
*  I would never, ever, ever, couldn't do it.
*  The only person I know who enjoys those is Alonzo.
*  But Alonzo Boden does jazz cruises.
*  Yes, I know.
*  It's different.
*  It's totally, and he hangs out with the musicians.
*  Yes, he loves jazz.
*  He loves it.
*  So for him, it's like, you know, like if you went on a baking cruise, if you went on a
*  bread cruise, it's all just the best bread makers in the world.
*  I would do that.
*  Would you?
*  I probably would.
*  How many great bread makers are there?
*  Could you fill up a cruise ship?
*  You couldn't, but you could fill it up with the people who want to learn.
*  You could definitely could do that.
*  Right.
*  So it could be like baking lessons and then just the bakers.
*  Yeah.
*  My Instagram, my social media has just been bread tutorials since the pandemic.
*  Really?
*  A hundred, all my whole feed is people, because I just, before it happened, this is a plug
*  for my YouTube.
*  I put all my videos on YouTube showing people how to bake bread because from doing this
*  show everybody was like, considers me this bread maker.
*  You're the bread guy.
*  Yeah.
*  So I put up this, I just put up these tutorials of how to make it.
*  And then the pandemic hit and people couldn't get yeast.
*  So they just started flooding to my YouTube and sending pictures.
*  Now every day I get pictures.
*  Thanks, Tom.
*  Here's my first effort.
*  People like one on one, like, why do you come out flat?
*  And I feel like I should answer them.
*  So I changed my whole podcast.
*  My whole podcast now is Breaking Bread with Tom.
*  I talked to you about this.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  You got to come on it.
*  I would love to.
*  I used, Segura was the first one.
*  Was he?
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, that's awesome.
*  And it just, it just went up.
*  So are you filming at the All Things Comedy Place?
*  We're going to.
*  Where are you filming at now?
*  Well, right now we, Tom and I did it remotely.
*  We had cameras on both of us.
*  So Tom was in.
*  That's for shit.
*  You need to get together.
*  I know.
*  Tom.
*  I don't think, I think it was a scheduling thing.
*  Yeah.
*  Maybe it's Tom.
*  I would have done it.
*  I just got tested by you.
*  Yes.
*  Thank God.
*  Yeah.
*  So, and Alonzo had also.
*  So Alonzo and I did one.
*  That's going to come out next week.
*  And I'm just going to create a set, you know, remember the, remember Billy Crystal on Saturday,
*  Saturday Night Live, the You Look Marvelous guy.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And he's just in like that Italian booth, like at Musso and Frank's.
*  Oh yeah.
*  That's my, that's going to be my set.
*  I'm just going to, because it's breaking bread.
*  It's just sitting like an old Italian restaurant.
*  Yeah.
*  And I, when we sit with food and wine.
*  Yeah.
*  Look at that.
*  It's going to be like.
*  You look marvelous.
*  I think I'm going to do it like that.
*  I forgot how fun that was, that You Look Marvelous thing.
*  It was so good.
*  He was so funny.
*  That was like when I was a child.
*  Yes.
*  We were kids.
*  Remember when he had Howard Cosell on?
*  In the eighties, 81 maybe.
*  Oh wow.
*  Was it really?
*  I think so.
*  He had Howard Cosell is like a great one.
*  I just love that set and that I love that.
*  85.
*  85.
*  So that's the year I graduated high school.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Right before me.
*  17 years old.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Little baby.
*  You look marvelous.
*  You look marvelous.
*  Billy Crystal.
*  He was a handsome little fellow when he was young.
*  He was.
*  Look at that face.
*  He really was.
*  Really talented.
*  Remember that movie he did about the really depressing comedian, Mr. Saturday Night?
*  Mr. Sunch.
*  Mr. Ogey.
*  Yeah.
*  I hated it.
*  I remember I went to see it.
*  I was on the road and I went to see it during the daytime before the show by myself.
*  I remember leaving going, this is not how comedians are.
*  Like what the fuck are you hanging out with Billy?
*  Jesus Christ.
*  Most of my friends are comedians.
*  This is the thing.
*  That was the movie.
*  Yeah.
*  There's a thing about comedians that people always want to think that we're depressed
*  and angry in real life.
*  Yes.
*  That's not true.
*  Very dark people.
*  But isn't that a weird stereotype?
*  It is weird.
*  Think about all the people that we know.
*  Yeah.
*  Think about like Segura and Alonzo.
*  Okay, you and I, if we were talking with no camera, we would talk just like this.
*  No different.
*  We would be talking shit.
*  We would be laughing.
*  Absolutely no different.
*  We're not brooding.
*  I'm not a brooding guy.
*  No.
*  And I know there are a few, but I think they're the minority.
*  I think so too.
*  I'm thinking about the guys that I hang with in New York, like Colin and Norton and Robert
*  Kelly and those guys.
*  And they're a little darker.
*  But I would say what people think is that everyone's brooding and dark.
*  But they're the most joyful people.
*  And I hang with them.
*  It's nothing but laughs.
*  Yes.
*  They're complicated though.
*  Yeah, well Norton's very complicated.
*  Comedians are complicated.
*  Yeah.
*  Right?
*  They're busy heads.
*  And Norton also spent a long time on the Opie and Anthony show, which was the whole thing
*  about that show was being a wreck.
*  That was the hook.
*  It was talking shit.
*  It was a shit talking fest.
*  People said the most preposterous things just to get a reaction.
*  And then there's something about those days where, especially like the early 2000s and
*  the late 90s, I guess, people said the most awful things to make other comics laugh.
*  And if you took that stuff out of context, that's a gross thing that people do, that
*  little gotcha thing where people like to take things that someone said on one of those shows
*  out of context.
*  I'm sure Norton has said a bunch of horrific things that he wished he never said.
*  But he said them so that when you or I or Patrice or Bill Burr or whoever the fuck or
*  Anthony, we would all be laughing.
*  But it's not because he means it.
*  No.
*  It's a real grossness to that sort of going after people for old ridiculous things they
*  said on radio shows.
*  Especially comedians.
*  Especially, especially that kind of culture.
*  Like you're saying, the whole thing was it was like a roast every night and like a classic
*  roast every night, which is these are the hardest.
*  These are the funniest people on the planet.
*  The only thing that's going to make them laugh is surprise.
*  The only way to surprise them is to say something no one would say.
*  Exactly.
*  No one.
*  You got to go super hard.
*  Yeah.
*  To surprise Patrice O'Neill with something comedically.
*  Yeah.
*  You got to reach deep.
*  You want to shock Norton?
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  Exactly.
*  Good Lord.
*  And the other offensive part of that gotcha kind of thing, which I don't think these guys
*  have had to, I don't think they've come after them so much.
*  But anyway, I think when you hung with them, when you were there, it was love.
*  It was just pure love.
*  These guys cared about each other so deeply and would say the most horrible, you would
*  say something to Rich Voss that was like, oh my God, what are you doing?
*  He was the guy that was always the nail.
*  Some people were the hammer.
*  Voss was almost always the nail.
*  But he relished it.
*  Because he's, I mean, talk about a naturally funny human being.
*  He is so quick.
*  So quick, so naturally funny, and also takes a joke as good as anybody that's ever lived.
*  Takes it right on the chin like those slap fighting guys.
*  And I don't know friends that loved each other more than Norton to Voss to Colin to Robert.
*  No.
*  That was a special time, the Opie and Anthony days.
*  It was really special.
*  Yeah.
*  It definitely dipped into stuff.
*  If you just rolled into that show out of context in your car when it was on terrestrial radio,
*  I'm sure it must have spun people's heads around.
*  Some people came in as guests and didn't understand it.
*  I was there for a few of those.
*  It was horrendous for them.
*  I remember watching these sort of sitcom-y actors who didn't know it was coming.
*  And they would, hey!
*  On their press tour.
*  Especially once they had gotten over to SiriusXM.
*  And it was just like fucking no-holes barred.
*  Language, everything.
*  And then there were people that would come on who were surprisingly cool.
*  Like Dr. Phil or Jerry Springer would come on.
*  So cool, roll with the punches kind of guys.
*  I'm really good friends with Dr. Phil's son.
*  Oh yeah?
*  Dr. Phil is great.
*  Oh yeah?
*  I would have never imagined.
*  He is the easiest going, nicest guy.
*  I had him on the podcast.
*  He's fucking great.
*  Yeah, that's the vibe.
*  I was on the show with him in the later years.
*  And yeah, he seemed like a very cool guy.
*  He's a lot of fun.
*  What did he catch with the beginning of the corona stuff?
*  They were saying that he was one of the guys that they were saying isn't a scientist.
*  And he had made some comments.
*  What did he say?
*  I don't know.
*  Maybe he was about that on the side of this isn't a...
*  We shouldn't be overreacting.
*  I think is the gist of it.
*  Well, he's a psychologist, right?
*  Yeah, which is probably the mental health maybe of what the lockdown would cause, something
*  like that.
*  I think if you want to look at things from a psychologist perspective, I want to talk
*  to a psychologist about the mindset of people that panic in pandemics.
*  Because this is, I mean, when it comes to pandemics, this is a fairly mild one.
*  I hate to say that to anybody that lost loved ones or anybody that's currently sick.
*  It's not to be insensitive about that, but the reality of the past, when you look at
*  the Black Plague or the Spanish Flu or any of the horrendous ones that people went through
*  before, this one's fairly mild in comparison.
*  If unchecked, would this be as dangerous as the Spanish Flu?
*  No.
*  Look at the number of people that are asymptomatic.
*  This is unchecked.
*  Like 78% of the people that contact this are asymptomatic.
*  That's one of the shocking stats that I see on Katie Cork's Instagram.
*  She puts just this fact sheet up every day.
*  It's really just useful, just numbers.
*  The shocking number is the number of people who beat it, who had it, were hospitalized,
*  and are fine from it.
*  Were not even hospitalized.
*  It's a huge number.
*  I have eight friends that have got it.
*  The only one that was hospitalized was Michael Yeo.
*  Michael Yeo got it pretty bad.
*  I think he beat himself up.
*  I think his body was beaten down.
*  I think it's a wake-up call to us.
*  One of the things that I'm noticing from not traveling is I feel so much better.
*  Dude, I can't tell you, I've been thinking, I can't believe what I was doing for the last
*  20 years.
*  I can.
*  No.
*  Hardcore, up at 4 a.m., on the plane, flying in, connecting, getting on stage, pounding
*  out two hours of material, get up 4 o'clock the next day, next city, boom, boom, for 20
*  years.
*  Yup, doing radio.
*  Can't.
*  I'm starting to think about, I used to ride a motorcycle.
*  When you're in it and riding the bike all the time, it makes perfect sense, it's safe,
*  it seems like you're manageable.
*  You stay off that bike for two years, you're like, I'm never getting on a bike again.
*  That's the most insane.
*  What the fuck was wrong with me?
*  What was wrong with me?
*  I'm starting to think that with travel for stand-up.
*  I'm like, was I insane?
*  I mean, I will go back to it.
*  I'm kind of thinking it a little too.
*  I've actually talked to a couple of my friends about this.
*  I might do a residency in LA.
*  Wow, smart.
*  Like, get a theater.
*  Yeah.
*  Get a theater, like a 500-seat theater, and just bang out weekends there.
*  Yeah.
*  Might not be a bad idea.
*  That's a good idea.
*  It's a really good idea.
*  I mean, Seinfeld did that at the Beacon.
*  He would just do like two weekends a month.
*  Yeah.
*  You can do it.
*  Oh, please, with the amount of people that live in this area?
*  Yeah.
*  And people fly in.
*  Look, we get that at the Comedy Store all the time.
*  I run into people all the time at the Comedy Store.
*  Oh, we flew in from Australia.
*  We flew in from Ireland.
*  Yeah.
*  People, they fly in from all over the world because they know that the Comedy Store is
*  there.
*  And you can go there on a Tuesday night and see some insane lineups.
*  Insane.
*  And this is, I mean, that's the one thing about our economy locally that's really devastating
*  is tourists.
*  I didn't realize how, I always think just show business here.
*  It's tourism.
*  The people that come here, every single, millions of people every year.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  I know.
*  Then you could have a residency.
*  You don't have to bang it.
*  And I'm also thinking tour a little more.
*  I mean, I'm talking out of my ass because when people call and give me an offer, I go.
*  But I think like if I could tour like a band and be like, I'm going out in the fall.
*  I'm going September through Thanksgiving.
*  That's my tour.
*  And then I'm home.
*  Have you ramped up touring over the last few years at all?
*  Yeah.
*  When did you start ramping it up?
*  I would say the last five years, the last five years when I started selling bigger places
*  and starting to do theaters.
*  Started getting that cheddar, baby.
*  Yeah.
*  It was like, you know, you fight your whole life to be able to play a theater.
*  Once that started happening, I was just, yeah.
*  I remember the first time I ever sold out of theater.
*  It was the craziest feeling ever.
*  Yeah.
*  I remember pulling it to the parking lot.
*  This is not even a comedy club.
*  This is a theater.
*  Like there's bands come here.
*  It's a real shit.
*  Yeah.
*  You see the people on the walls.
*  Yeah.
*  And then you see all these people that don't work with comedy clubs like, you know, the
*  security people and the sound guy and like, hey, what's up, man?
*  How you doing?
*  Dan, Joe, nice to meet you.
*  Blah, blah, blah.
*  Do you need anything?
*  Nope.
*  Nope.
*  Just a stool.
*  Yeah.
*  Cool.
*  They're so happy.
*  They're so used to people coming in with real demands.
*  Yeah.
*  And you're used to being treated like shit for years.
*  And they're all there to see you.
*  Yeah.
*  It's weird.
*  The theaters are weird.
*  It makes it a show.
*  It's like a real show.
*  Yeah.
*  It feels the most surreal arenas.
*  That's the most surreal.
*  Yeah.
*  I can't imagine.
*  You should come with me in one.
*  I would love to.
*  If we ever get allowed to do it again.
*  Oh, I'm sure we could do one in Florida this weekend if we wanted to.
*  Well, you can in Kansas City.
*  You can?
*  Yeah.
*  Missouri's allowing concerts.
*  Concerts?
*  Right now.
*  Really?
*  Let's go.
*  And are they going?
*  Are people buying tickets?
*  I have no idea.
*  But apparently Missouri just passed a thing.
*  I saw it on, I saw it through a trusted source, Lil Duvall's Instagram page.
*  That's a trusted source for sure.
*  But yeah.
*  Wow.
*  It said that Missouri's allowing concerts.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, it's all going to come back.
*  It is going to come back.
*  Hopefully.
*  But you got to wonder how many people like you or I who are looking at our life now going,
*  okay, well, what am I doing?
*  Am I going to keep doing this and beat myself up?
*  Because I just did it Saturday, right?
*  I flew to Florida Saturday and then I flew back home first flight Sunday morning.
*  So I was, you know, I was back home at like 10 a.m. on Sunday, but then I got an IV bag.
*  I got a vitamin bag of IV.
*  Yeah.
*  And I got another COVID test.
*  I said, just give me a test.
*  I know everyone was tested at the UFC.
*  They were very stringent with the testing.
*  You have to have a wristband to get there.
*  I go, but just fucking hit me with another test.
*  Not that bad.
*  Yeah.
*  But I was thinking before the IV bag, because the IV bag made me feel pretty good.
*  I was like, what am I doing?
*  Like, am I going to keep doing this?
*  Like, why am I going to keep doing this?
*  Yeah.
*  You know, like what's.
*  Well, because we love performing and you love and people want to see you.
*  And it's what we do.
*  Fly to LA, bitch.
*  I'm going to be in the theater.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  I still do some.
*  I'm still going to go.
*  I know I'm going to go, but I don't know.
*  And it sounds so the only reason I hesitate is because my kids are a little older.
*  And I mean, I didn't have the freedom to do it early when they were little.
*  I'm saying like I should have stayed home when they were little, but that's when I
*  was coming up and, you know, had to go.
*  And I do love it.
*  I have to say when you're in the rhythm of it's only again, it's the motorcycle.
*  It's the distance of it that makes it seem crazy.
*  When I was in the middle of it, it was just what I did.
*  You can do it Ron White style if you had your own Tom Papa jet.
*  You tell you say what he does.
*  He's got his own jet.
*  Ron White's got a jet.
*  There was that great scene.
*  I think I've mentioned this on the show when the Ray Charles movie with Jamie Foxx.
*  I didn't see that.
*  When he re- Yeah.
*  Maybe I didn't.
*  I forgot.
*  And when he re-does his contract, he puts a jet in it as part of the contract because
*  something about the phrasing was somewhat conveying that because the travel is going
*  to kill you.
*  That's the thing that kills you.
*  Hmm.
*  Yeah.
*  Is the travel on your own jet going to kill you less?
*  Oh yeah.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Ask Ron.
*  You're cutting down days.
*  When I would tour with Seinfeld, I would be home after doing a gig in Atlanta.
*  I would be home in New York earlier than the guys doing sets at The Cellar and coming home.
*  Because you'd fly that night.
*  Fly that night.
*  Right.
*  You're home.
*  You're home.
*  Sleep in your own bed.
*  Yes.
*  It's a home.
*  Now you're not staying in the hotel.
*  You're not having shitty sleep.
*  You're not going.
*  Yes.
*  Of course you're going to live longer.
*  Right.
*  But, you know, it's so fun to go though.
*  It's so great.
*  I love, I do, I'm in my yard and I, you know, there's not that many planes going to Burbank
*  now which is...
*  Almost none.
*  Almost none.
*  Like several a day kind of thing.
*  And they like, a little burst at night and a little weird.
*  But when I hear them and I look up and I see the bottom of Alaska Air, it looks like a
*  whale's belly.
*  I'm like, oh, where they going?
*  I'll be with you guys soon.
*  How did the airline survive this?
*  How are they going to make it?
*  Well they got a lot of dough.
*  I don't know how you...
*  Did they?
*  Yeah, they did.
*  How much do they have?
*  I don't know.
*  They got a...
*  The government helped them.
*  Oh.
*  But I don't know...
*  Where's the government getting that money?
*  They just make it.
*  Well, why didn't they make it to fix the fucking impoverished neighborhoods?
*  Why didn't they fix all that?
*  They're not important.
*  They've been in quarantine.
*  That's not...
*  We're talking about...
*  Poor people?
*  No.
*  I don't know how you get back to operating an airline.
*  Right.
*  An airport.
*  How do we get back to...
*  Six feet apart at TSA.
*  How is that going to happen?
*  The line's going to be up to San Francisco.
*  It's going to be insane.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh my God.
*  I didn't even think of that.
*  Yeah.
*  Like when they're at full capacity.
*  How do you get through security?
*  When is it going to happen?
*  Are you going to have to go six hours before your flight to get through?
*  When can it happen?
*  I don't know.
*  That part.
*  That's...
*  When can you do that again?
*  Like that.
*  Either vaccine or it ravaged the population, I guess.
*  Future air travel.
*  Four hour process.
*  Self-check-in.
*  Disinfection.
*  Immunity passes.
*  Oh, fuck off.
*  Look at those outfits people are wearing.
*  Four hour process.
*  Four hour process.
*  What?
*  Come on.
*  Four hours?
*  Once airports' borders open again, people are able to fly freely.
*  Is there really a process already in play as airports of all sizes around the world
*  ready strategies to ensure healthy air travel?
*  How much are you ready to change your flying habits?
*  Oh my God.
*  It's going to be terrible.
*  I could get a little bit less because this also then and then says this might cause less
*  people to then fly, which brings the lines down a little bit.
*  Right.
*  But that's going to fuck everybody up because there's going to be less flights available.
*  Oh yeah.
*  There already are.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Right now.
*  But this is in the middle of the quarantine.
*  Once the quarantine is lifted.
*  When can you fly to Bose in Montana?
*  You know what I mean?
*  Yeah.
*  How am I going to fuck you?
*  No, exactly.
*  It's going to be, you know, travel is going to be someone.
*  My sister sent me an article of some guy was like had to take a flight for work and everyone
*  was saying, oh, I'm so jealous.
*  You're getting a flight for work and it's going to be empty and it's going to be great.
*  And he said it was horrible because people were tense and nervous on flights before.
*  And like putting their things in the overhead and, you know, trying to get ahead of you
*  in line.
*  And now people's nerves are so it was like they didn't want to be near other people.
*  They once saw everyone else's like a contagion and it was just like, get away from me.
*  And it was very, the nervous energy of the experience was a real drag.
*  My friend Lex, he flew from Boston to do the show.
*  He was the only person on the plane.
*  It's a private plane just for him.
*  Whole plane.
*  He had a mask on.
*  One guy.
*  He said the stewardesses didn't even talk to him.
*  Right.
*  There was no water, no nothing.
*  You don't get shit.
*  They don't even make contact.
*  They just stay the fuck away from you.
*  Now listen, if it means that fewer people are going to be flying and we can go back
*  to flying like it's in the 80s, that wouldn't be such a bad thing.
*  Yeah, but if you want to travel to places, you have to have a viable, the airline has
*  to have a reason to schedule a flight.
*  But don't you think it was traveling?
*  But don't you think it was a little maxed out by the, before things got like every flight?
*  When I started my career, there were empty seats on planes.
*  There were, it wasn't a mad rush of humanity.
*  I mean, it's so-
*  Are you prepared to pay more for plane tickets?
*  Yes.
*  I used to have a joke in my act where because of the crowd and stuff and people say the
*  airlines are expensive.
*  People say it's too expensive to fly.
*  I say not expensive enough.
*  Let's keep it to business travel and the family of six, vacation locally.
*  Time to ramp up.
*  I hope you're doing great, sells a lot and you can get one of them Ron White jets.
*  Oh man, I hope so.
*  Tell you what, that's how I travel, son.
*  He's got fucking smoking cigars, drinking tequila, just flying around.
*  Getting on a bus, doing it.
*  When I flew with Chappelle, he smokes on planes, smokes cigarettes.
*  Of course.
*  I'm like, this is outrageous.
*  He doesn't even ask if the people around him are okay with it.
*  He just sparks up.
*  God, it's like his thing.
*  Well you can smoke on a private jet, I guess.
*  I guess.
*  I guess.
*  You must have to have some sort of an agreement with the pilots.
*  Yeah, that can't be.
*  Because they have, like you're in a fucking tube flying around.
*  It's like that air is going to get to everybody.
*  There's only one guy that can do that.
*  How much filtration is in that airplane?
*  Yeah.
*  Well, that's what they keep putting out, reports.
*  I keep getting notes from the airlines.
*  Do you get those in your email?
*  I don't read them.
*  The little videos and stuff from the owner of United.
*  Hi, we're in the mask.
*  Yeah, we're all disinfecting and all our air is 98% fresh and all this kind of stuff.
*  Rotten tomatoes.
*  Our air is only 30%.
*  Yeah, but no, it's going to be, I do feel like it's recalibrating how you look at everything.
*  But once it all gets opened up and you're like having an opportunity to go to all these
*  places, you probably go back to what we were doing.
*  When I was in Florida, I was walking down the hallway of my hotel and some guy in his
*  room was coughing.
*  Yeah.
*  And I fucking panicked.
*  I panicked.
*  Yeah.
*  I was like, oh no, I walked faster.
*  Quickly get through the hallway.
*  I remember thinking like, wow, is this how I'm going to be from now on?
*  I hear a cough and I'm going to freak out.
*  I know.
*  Something that didn't mean jack shit.
*  I know.
*  Three months ago.
*  Now I was like, yeah, uh-oh.
*  It's a coffin.
*  And it's going through the vent and it's coming into my room.
*  Little particles are in the air.
*  My last gig was in Pennsylvania and it was the Keswick Theater just north of Philadelphia.
*  And it was all just starting, it was like March 7th.
*  So it was all starting to really stop.
*  And I get on the flight and I'm like wondering, like, is this going to be my last gig for
*  a while?
*  And I was really kind of bummed out about it.
*  And then Paula Poundstone came on the plane and I know Paula from Wait, Wait, Don't Tell
*  Me and she's just great, you know, and she comes on and she's just like, we're fucked.
*  I go, really?
*  Oh yeah.
*  And then she goes to sit in the back and she has an asthmatic condition.
*  Oh no.
*  The whole flight, she's just coughing in the back.
*  Like a violent heavy cough at periods.
*  And she comes up to go to the bathroom at some point and she's like, I'm real popular today.
*  She was just freaking the entire plane out.
*  Oh my God.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh my God.
*  I know.
*  Oh my God.
*  She's so damn funny.
*  Has she ever been on?
*  No.
*  She's got asthma?
*  Yeah, she has some asthma thing, yeah.
*  That would make it really terrifying.
*  Yeah, she can get it.
*  Right.
*  That kind of thing.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  God, is she funny though.
*  So dry and just a road warrior.
*  Talk about travel.
*  She just pounded out for years, years.
*  She was really popular at one point in time.
*  What happened?
*  Really popular.
*  She had the drinking thing.
*  She had a little kerfuffle.
*  She had some thing with people said stuff about her as a mom and stuff and it was all
*  cleared up and it took a little bit of a hit.
*  And then she came back and she just went on the road and just kept going and she was cleared
*  of everything.
*  There was no problems and she just took every gig she could take and just played it, played
*  it, played it.
*  And she's been on Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me for 30 years straight.
*  And she's just...
*  What is Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me?
*  It's a podcast?
*  That's the NPR show.
*  It's Peter Segal and it's like a news quiz and it's just they have three comedians on.
*  I do it with Alonzo a lot.
*  It's a podcast though, right?
*  Is that what it is?
*  No, it's an NPR radio show and a podcast.
*  But it was a radio show first.
*  And then it runs as a podcast.
*  And it's all current events.
*  It's all like stuff that's happening in the week.
*  And Paula is known as just...
*  Her crowd work is like her real...
*  She's so in the moment, off the cuff, brilliant.
*  Probably one of the best of all time.
*  And so in that format for the show, she's just a killer.
*  So she did that for 30 years and it came and she's still...
*  Her audience is a little older, but she's super...
*  She sells out all these places.
*  She does not have to do radio for tickets.
*  She has a real, real strong base.
*  Yeah, there's so many people that made a living on the road and kind of counted on it.
*  I feel like their bills every month were kind of high.
*  And now they're in this situation where they're like, holy shit, when can I work?
*  Yeah, no kidding.
*  No kidding.
*  I mean, that's the thing.
*  In entertainment, even when there were recessions, entertainment always did okay.
*  Right, not this one.
*  There was a thing in The Sopranos where one of the characters says, in a recession, entertainment
*  and our thing, we're okay.
*  And they were recession proof, but this one, live performance, holy shit.
*  Well, Live Nation almost went under.
*  Oh really?
*  Yeah, Live Nation got a giant chunk bought out by the Saudi Empire.
*  Did you hear about that?
*  Yeah.
*  What do you mean?
*  Everybody was like, what the fuck?
*  They bought a sizable chunk of Live Nation, you know, because it's an open...
*  It's a public company.
*  So they were hurting.
*  See, you can find that article.
*  So now they control...
*  Saudi Arabia purchases $500 million stake in Live Nation.
*  Because that $500 million was probably worth a couple billion before this?
*  Oh, I don't know.
*  Is that what that means?
*  I mean, what is it worth now?
*  I mean, this is what's...
*  I mean, they're really taking a chance.
*  5.7% stake in Live...
*  Wow, how much is Live Nation worth?
*  Yeah, billions.
*  5.7%?
*  Yeah.
*  500 million gets you 5%.
*  Right.
*  Saudi Public Investment Fund disclosed the stake, compromising 12,337,569 shares in a
*  filing with the Security Exchange Commission on Monday.
*  They're taking a big chance too, though, because when is that going to be happening again?
*  In Missouri this weekend.
*  Just Missouri, though.
*  Maybe Texas.
*  Yeah.
*  It'll come back.
*  I mean, it'll be back, but can you sustain the downside of it long enough?
*  Wait a minute.
*  Hold on a second.
*  The plan dictated...
*  What is this?
*  Missouri Governor Mike Parson unveiled a stake reopening plan April 27th and included a note
*  that live concerts can resume starting Monday, May 4th.
*  Woo!
*  Billboard reports Missouri is the first state in the U.S. to reopen live events amid the
*  coronavirus pandemic.
*  The plan dictates that seating shall be spaced out according to social distancing requirements,
*  which is a bullshit nonsensical requirement.
*  You're all stuck together in a room screaming.
*  And that concertgoers must remain at least six feet apart.
*  Well, that won't happen when people are peeing.
*  The mayors of Missouri major cities, St. Louis, Springfield, and Kansas City have revealed
*  that live concerts and large gatherings will not return as the city's stay-home orders
*  will remain intact.
*  The mayor is overriding the governor?
*  Yes.
*  It says we will continue to be guided by data, not dates.
*  St. Louis Mayor Leda Crouson.
*  Sounds like a liberal.
*  So now we can't do concerts in St. Louis either.
*  Yeah, so it looks like it's not going to happen in St. Louis.
*  It'll be a bit.
*  Maybe Kansas City.
*  Maybe they'll let you go there.
*  Yeah.
*  Somewhere.
*  Someone's going to do it.
*  Yeah.
*  Who's going to be the first concert?
*  Pew!
*  The idea of staying six feet apart, like how many seats do you have to give up?
*  Like we're about six feet apart.
*  How many seats is between you and me?
*  Three?
*  Maybe three?
*  One, two, three.
*  Yeah, four.
*  Four?
*  So you'd have four seats, so you'd have one quarter if you're lucky.
*  Yeah.
*  Fuck that.
*  Yeah.
*  That's so crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  Everyone else spaced out.
*  The economics of that doesn't really work.
*  What if you're on a date?
*  Oh yeah.
*  Can you, if you take your lady friend, can they sit next to each other?
*  Stay at home.
*  What?
*  You do that trick with the popcorn.
*  Well, here's the other thing.
*  What about the people behind you?
*  You cut the hole in the bottom of the popcorn, put your junk in it, then she goes for the
*  popcorn.
*  The diner, Mickey Rourke scene.
*  What about the people behind you?
*  Where the fuck are they going to go?
*  Are we going to have to stagger people?
*  They're not right behind you.
*  They're over here behind you.
*  Oh, fuck off.
*  Because then they're going to be too close to the people that are close to you.
*  Yeah.
*  That won't work.
*  Broadway just said they're not opening until Labor Day.
*  Well, thank God I don't like Broadway.
*  And their audience is all 65 plus.
*  I'm not in a musical.
*  Yeah, those are people that really should be terrified.
*  Even when they open.
*  When they say they're going to open?
*  Labor Day.
*  Labor Day.
*  September.
*  Whoa.
*  Yeah.
*  Originally said June.
*  Now it's basically Labor Day.
*  I don't buy that.
*  Labor Day?
*  I'm supposed to do Madison Square Garden October 3rd.
*  Ooh.
*  Ooh.
*  Yeah.
*  New York City Marathon.
*  How's that going to happen?
*  November.
*  I don't know.
*  How's that going to happen?
*  Isn't it amazing how the months seem so close now?
*  Oh, yeah.
*  When you're doing the math of like, will I be able to go out?
*  We're sitting here in May and all of a sudden October looks like it's next week.
*  Well, November 1st, I'm at the forum, the Great Western Forum out here.
*  Oh, wow.
*  Oh, would that be sweet?
*  When I think about the dates.
*  I don't even know if I could do that.
*  Imagine if you were though.
*  Imagine if you make it.
*  Imagine if something happens between now and then where you're able to go do the garden.
*  Wouldn't that be great?
*  Weekend shows at the Houston Improv.
*  Brian Callan's already there.
*  Thursday, May 28th.
*  I did it the month.
*  They have a show booked right now.
*  What?
*  Yeah.
*  Well, my shows are still on sale in San Francisco right now.
*  Look at this motherfucker.
*  Alan Adams steps in Saturday, May 16th.
*  I salute you, Alan, and your wonderful mustache.
*  All the Texas Improvs it looks like are doing stuff this week.
*  Good for them.
*  Different rules everywhere.
*  Fucking yeah.
*  Yeah, I don't think there's anything wrong with that.
*  I don't, you know, if everyone acts cool and if they do some precautions, clean the place,
*  and it's going to be young people.
*  No, it'll be half the, say it seats 400, maybe they'll have 150.
*  I don't know if that's what they're doing there though.
*  They might just be sitting down.
*  I don't think so.
*  Texas is buck wild, bro.
*  You can bring a gun.
*  I like that Callan's going.
*  Hey, I might move to Texas.
*  Callan and I and Shob have actually talked about this.
*  Getting a ranch together?
*  Well, if, here's the thing.
*  If California continues to be this restrictive, I don't know if this is a good place to live.
*  First of all, it's extremely expensive.
*  The taxes here are ridiculous.
*  And if they really say that we can't do stand up until 2022 or some shit like that, I might
*  jet.
*  I'm not kidding.
*  I'm not kidding.
*  This is silly.
*  I don't need to be here.
*  The only reason why I'm here is that I'm close to people like you.
*  A lot of my friends live here, the store's here, but if they won't let us do the store,
*  but we could do stand up other places, why would we stay here?
*  Where in Texas though?
*  I don't know, man.
*  Austin, I like Austin a lot.
*  I like Dallas a lot.
*  I like Houston, but I don't know if I would live in Houston.
*  I would definitely live in...
*  It's very humid there.
*  Yeah.
*  The summer's a motherfucker.
*  God, brutal.
*  Dallas is great.
*  Trying to read through this.
*  I think they're starting with 25% of listed occupancy.
*  Where?
*  At the improv?
*  Yeah.
*  They're going to do it smart.
*  Is that what it says?
*  It says they're not doing it to make money.
*  They're doing it for the audiences.
*  It says it's not a money making opportunity.
*  Tell that to Brian Callan.
*  Brian and Chobb are going to demand their money.
*  The other thing is they make most of their money off of alcohol.
*  And if people have to wear masks, how's that work?
*  Should we call Callan right now?
*  Everyone's got a sippy straw.
*  Let's call Callan right now.
*  Can I get an update?
*  Yeah, find out what's going on since he's the one who's actually doing it.
*  It says operating at 25% will not be a money making exercise nor will be 50% when that
*  point is reached.
*  So they're not there yet.
*  I've got to...
*  I'm supposed to do Portland.
*  What's up, bud?
*  Hey, buddy, you're on the air, so don't say anything crazy.
*  Okay.
*  When are you doing the improv in Houston?
*  I'm doing the improv in Houston.
*  Me and Brennan Chobb.
*  You're a savage.
*  I want Brennan to come with me the 29th, the 30th, and the 31st.
*  How many people are allowed to be in the audience?
*  I think it's 200 so far.
*  Whoa.
*  That's because that's all they could sell?
*  How many... 200 people in the crowd.
*  What is the normal capacity?
*  Yeah, I believe that's the number.
*  That's Texas.
*  Now, I just read in the New York Times, or I mean, I'm sorry, Brennan Chobb has called
*  me and said that the shutdown in Los Angeles is being considered till July?
*  Yes.
*  Yeah, that's what he said.
*  So normally the Houston improv seats 450 people, it says.
*  So they'll allow 200 people?
*  Is that what it is?
*  That's correct.
*  Right.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah, LA is July.
*  How crazy is that?
*  Well, how do we fight that?
*  I mean, who is deciding that?
*  Some health official based on what data?
*  Yeah.
*  And what's going to be different in July?
*  Well, nothing's going to be different, but also is this about getting absentee voting
*  in for the seats in Congress?
*  What's going on?
*  I don't understand.
*  What?
*  Why would you think it would be about that?
*  Is there a...
*  I talked to a Republican strategist.
*  There's an article about homelessness and I wanted to speak to the scholar and the person
*  who knows the person is a Republican strategist.
*  I'll find out the information.
*  She was correlating it to that.
*  Now, maybe because she's a Republican strategist, I don't have any evidence on this.
*  But absentee ballots in this state, I guess, favor Democrats, incumbent Democrats for a
*  number of reasons.
*  I'm not an expert on this, but that's what I heard and I'm wondering if there's anything
*  to that.
*  That doesn't make any sense because this state is basically blue anyway.
*  I mean, that seems like a ridiculous thing to sink the economy for something you already
*  have winning.
*  But I thought there were two seats in Congress that were off the graph.
*  God, it can't be that.
*  Can't be that.
*  They can't blow up the whole economy just for that.
*  I think it's probably more of a liability thing.
*  They're worried about if they make a decision and somehow it gets connected to a larger
*  amount of deaths.
*  These people get paid while this is all going on.
*  They are not the people that own the small businesses.
*  They're not...
*  Oh, I know.
*  Oh, I know.
*  This is what happens when politicians are protecting and doing this for our, quote,
*  unquote, our own good.
*  Can Brian hear me?
*  I don't have any...
*  We live in this country where my government doesn't represent me.
*  I have no recourse here.
*  Where are we moving?
*  Where are we moving?
*  I don't know.
*  You want to go to Texas?
*  I like Texas.
*  I got to sit here like a cow chewing grass while Gavin Newsom has decided for my own
*  good to shut down the entire state and the economy.
*  I'm sorry to say this also, but from what I have read, and again, I may be wrong, but
*  this is primarily a disease that is fatal to...
*  The mean average, I think, is 80 or is it 81?
*  Yes.
*  We actually talked about it on the podcast that the average age that people die from
*  this disease is older than the average age people die.
*  Okay, so we've shut down everything.
*  Instead of having a targeted quarantine or a smarter way to do this, I just have to do
*  like a cow chewing grass.
*  I have to listen to whatever my politician tells me.
*  I thought it was May 15th.
*  Now it's July?
*  Yeah, no, I agree with you.
*  I agree with you in that way.
*  I think it's LA County is actually July.
*  The governor still has May 15th and that they're moving forward with stages.
*  So the next stage will be gyms and they're going to have certain disinfection salons,
*  things like that.
*  They're going to have to have certain rules in place, hand sanitizer, things along those
*  lines.
*  I'm just still so confused by this.
*  I think they should quarantine people that are higher at risk and quarantine people if
*  they choose to be quarantined because they're still scared of it.
*  That's what I think.
*  Can you ask them to see if I can open for them?
*  That's what I think too, but it's called freedom and that would be called personal responsibility
*  and all that stuff.
*  We're not dealing with that.
*  I don't know what Eric Garcetti is doing.
*  I just don't get it.
*  I don't understand the logic behind it.
*  I don't get it either, but Tom Poppa wants to open for you.
*  He's here right now.
*  He wants to open for you in May.
*  Tom, I'll throw you up for 10 minutes.
*  We'll get you moving around and see how you do.
*  Thanks.
*  All right?
*  But obviously you've got to take my workshop first, but we'll go from there.
*  I'll call you.
*  It's not comedy.
*  It's mostly physical.
*  We get you stretching.
*  We get you moving around in a circle.
*  Your workshop.
*  I'll call you after I'm out of here.
*  I love you, buddy.
*  Bye.
*  Wow.
*  So there you go.
*  So it's basically a little bit less than half capacity.
*  Yeah, well I have an offer.
*  I'm going to go ahead and get you a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little
*  bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little
*  I have an offer to go do it in two weeks and then May May Houston improv which Salt Lake
*  City Oh wise guys.
*  Yeah.
*  I love it there.
*  I know.
*  Take it.
*  How many people in the audience?
*  150 fill it up and let's test that immunity.
*  Come on pussies.
*  I love my Portland.
*  My Portland show is like a two weeks after that.
*  I would live in Utah in I like Utah.
*  You know what?
*  Great state.
*  Beautiful.
*  People are scared of Mormons.
*  It's true.
*  They're all scared.
*  Oh my God.
*  You go there.
*  You have to join the cult.
*  Oh, they're so nice.
*  The whole city so clean.
*  They're the best cult members in the world.
*  I love it.
*  But a lot of people are not cult members that live in Utah.
*  Yeah.
*  There's a lot of non Mormons that live there and they're the nicest folks.
*  So nice.
*  And it's it's I think the most beautiful state.
*  It's so diverse.
*  It's a very beautiful state.
*  God, it's gorgeous.
*  Mountains and the Canyonlands and preach.
*  Preach Tom Papa.
*  Oh, I love it there.
*  Could you live there?
*  I could live anywhere.
*  Anywhere.
*  Well, Wise Guys is a great club to work out of too.
*  If like you needed like a local club to practice.
*  Yeah.
*  You could do Wise Guys.
*  It's a good spot.
*  It's the most underrated club in the country, I think.
*  Yeah.
*  No, it's great.
*  It's really great.
*  So good.
*  Like everybody knows how great ComedyWorks in Denver is.
*  Everybody knows how great Zanies in Nashville is.
*  Most people don't, you know, we sleep on the short list of great clubs.
*  Wise Guys in Salt Lake City is right up there.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, man.
*  Do you think kids will be back in school in September?
*  I don't know, but if they're not, it's going to be a mess.
*  My kids are, they're mocking their teachers with the fucking computer on mute.
*  I know.
*  Look, dude, my middle daughter, my 12 year old, she's a savage.
*  She's ruthless.
*  She's a little predator.
*  And she just like put them on mute.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Is that what you want to do?
*  It's like, oh, you're so smart.
*  How did you learn?
*  Did you learn through a computer?
*  She thinks it's hilarious.
*  They wake up right before they go to school.
*  I know.
*  Okay.
*  School starts at eight.
*  They wake up at 7 56.
*  They pee.
*  They drink some water and they fucking sit in front of their computer.
*  My kids are up all night long too.
*  I don't even, I don't have no idea when they go to bed.
*  It's like two, I get up to pee in the middle of the night.
*  I still hear movies being played.
*  My daughter is just sitting on her computer eating breakfast in bed.
*  They're in bed.
*  I know.
*  And the teachers could not be less enthusiastic.
*  It's horrible.
*  They're so phoning it in.
*  One of my daughters, my nine year old, the fucking teacher is always late.
*  She gets mad at them if they tune into the Zoom thing late.
*  But she'll be there 15 minutes late just sluggishly talking to them about their studies.
*  And it's so boring.
*  It sounds so boring.
*  I know.
*  It's so boring.
*  I sat with her and just to walk, I go, let me be a fly on the wall and watch this nonsense.
*  It's like it's regular school is deadening, right?
*  It's like, it numbs you.
*  It's so frustrating.
*  Or it was for me.
*  Me too.
*  And I think their school is better than my school.
*  But the Zoom shit is like 75% more annoying than regular school.
*  It doesn't work.
*  My friend's son stayed at school in Chicago.
*  And it was like, you know, I could do classes from home or, you know, it's all going to
*  be online for the end of the year.
*  So I could come home to LA or I could stay there and do anything.
*  Let me just stay there and be with my friends at least when we're off.
*  But he's a good student and he loves going to class.
*  He said it just doesn't compare.
*  You come out of class and you'd be like, I missed that part.
*  And you go sit with your buddy and have coffee and figure out the stuff that you missed and
*  the whole other part of the experience is not just about them spitting information into
*  your brain in this two dimensional space.
*  We're turning people into robots.
*  It's really brutal.
*  You know, this is the thing that I talked about and I was just joking around.
*  But if you just sat down and broke it down this way, if you were an artificial intelligence,
*  right, and you were trying to trick people into submitting to become some sort of a symbiotic
*  creation where you get people to join the matrix, how would you get them to do that?
*  Well, one good way to start out is make it so they don't want to go anywhere near each
*  other, right?
*  Separate themselves, make them be accustomed to doing everything online virtually.
*  Yeah.
*  Make them accustomed to being terrified to be around people's physical touch.
*  You can't shake hands.
*  You can't do anything.
*  So who's controlling this matrix?
*  Well, this is the future.
*  The future is eventually we're going to be a part of this.
*  Like Elon was on here talking about some neural link thing they're going to do where one day
*  his literal words were, you're not going to have to talk to communicate.
*  Really?
*  Yes.
*  And I was like, what?
*  Well this is it, right?
*  This is how you get into the matrix.
*  This is how eventually we're going to eventually submit because it's going to be more interesting
*  than the fucking Mad Max wasteland that's left in the world as the temperature rises
*  and the diseases mutate.
*  Fuck!
*  But first of all, we'll be protected by the praying mantis.
*  We need to breed them.
*  The amazing thing that I've been observing during this, we are this living organism.
*  We are more linked than we knew.
*  Everybody seems to be in the same mood at the same time, the same frustrations, the
*  same sadness, the same joys.
*  People are craving being with each other.
*  We are this organism that while we're individuals, we're also part of this bigger hive that feeds
*  off of each other in profound ways.
*  And I don't care what you come up with.
*  We want to see and squeeze and be around and be face to face and touch each other.
*  And there is that, that thing is not, it's like asking fish not to swim.
*  We are not built for that.
*  You would have to give us a lobotomy for us to do that.
*  Do you see Ready Player One?
*  Yes.
*  Great movie.
*  It was about that.
*  It was about this sort of transition to a virtual world that's more exciting.
*  It's more captivating.
*  It's more...
*  It doesn't have that thing.
*  It doesn't have that physical thing.
*  You can't satisfy that.
*  I don't know if you're right.
*  Look how we're freaking out.
*  Look how people want to be around each other.
*  Right, but this is now.
*  Yeah.
*  Well...
*  As things get better with the virtual world, I think there's a real potential.
*  I think that Ready Player One shit is real.
*  I mean, I think that is going to be the future, whether it's 50 years from now or 150 years
*  from now.
*  There's going to come a time where people can't wait to just plug into this thing and
*  put a helmet on and go into a crazy world where you can skateboard through the fucking
*  stars.
*  Look, I love all that stuff.
*  I invite it.
*  I would love to be a part of it.
*  Yeah, I mean, all that stuff is very exciting and I see how it's plausible, but there is
*  a biological dimension to this that I think is inescapable.
*  You'd have to do something to the human being to break them down to just be satisfied with
*  that.
*  There'd have to be some component that comes over and makes you feel like a hug, hits that
*  party of rain that does that thing.
*  That's what I'm saying.
*  That's what they can do in that.
*  Remember in Ready Player One, they had those haptic feedback suits.
*  The girl touches him and he can feel it all over his body.
*  I don't remember that part.
*  I do.
*  I wonder if that's where it's all going to go to.
*  I mean, if you look at how connected we are now to computers and to phones and to your
*  Tesla and all this electronic shit that we have, it's just a matter of time.
*  This stuff's going to accelerate.
*  It's going to get more entrenched in your life.
*  What's the Elon model?
*  They're creating that for what?
*  First steps is going to be for people that have injuries where paralysis, they're going
*  to be able to make their body function again.
*  And he actually said even better.
*  Your body would function even better than it did before your spinal cord was severed.
*  You're going to be able to see people that have vision issues.
*  They're going to be able to fix that.
*  Brain issues, brain trauma, they're going to be able to fix that.
*  That's what the first applications of it's going to be.
*  And then eventually it's going to lead to higher bandwidth access to information.
*  The way he was saying it, people are going to be much more productive when they're on
*  it.
*  You're going to have it.
*  And it's something you're going to drill a hole in your head and put a fucking cork
*  in there with wires that go into different parts of your brain and fire it up.
*  Will this be done before I'm old?
*  He says like five years.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  So that'd be pretty cool.
*  So the first people that try it will be people that are injured or people that have ailments.
*  Right.
*  What about people whose knees hurt slightly when he goes upstairs?
*  Stop eating bread.
*  That stuff's making...
*  There's no way.
*  Causing inflammation.
*  You can never not eat bread.
*  You just bake it and smell it.
*  I could do that.
*  Just only greens and meat.
*  It's so good to eat though.
*  Especially my bread.
*  It's so delicious.
*  Do you think you could only eat bread once a week?
*  Could have a bread day?
*  I could.
*  What if you found other bread that was really bad for you?
*  If you go to a doctor and the doctor says, Tom, here's what's going on.
*  This is where you could be and this is where you are and this is what's holding you back.
*  All this fucking gluten.
*  You're eating this bread and it's fucking with your joints.
*  It's causing arthritis.
*  It's causing your cartilage to break down.
*  You're going to be crippled when you're older.
*  Or you can just have bread, a little bit of mouth pleasure and some butter.
*  Oh, you can't live without it, can you?
*  In this mythical world that you're talking about, this made up place where bread is bad
*  for you, I guess I could play around.
*  But my bread is good for you.
*  How's it possible?
*  Flour, water, salt and yeast.
*  It's the only thing.
*  It breaks itself down.
*  It's not bad for you.
*  In moderation, it's not bad for you.
*  Please, centuries.
*  All the people that made you and all the DNA that had to carry you before you came out.
*  Do you get heirloom wheat flour?
*  On bread.
*  Do you get heirloom wheat flour?
*  Do you really?
*  Yeah.
*  So where do you get it?
*  From Utah.
*  For real?
*  Oh, so it is better.
*  Utah again.
*  I should just live in Utah.
*  You might have to.
*  Because I know when I was in Italy, the pasta you eat does not make you feel fucked up.
*  No, it doesn't.
*  And then in Maynard, Maynard from Tulle, he was explaining to me that when, you know,
*  because he uses heirloom wheat for his pasta, you know, he owns a couple of restaurants.
*  And he was saying that when human beings started fucking around, particularly in America, with
*  wheat and sort of engineering it for higher yield, they made more complex gluten.
*  There's more gluten in the wheat and it's a higher yield.
*  So like if they have an acre of the old wheat, it would only grow a certain amount of wheat
*  and it's like much more now for an acre of this new wheat.
*  But the problem is our bodies don't know how to digest it properly.
*  Right, right.
*  That's why people develop all these fucking weird gluten intolerance issues.
*  It makes sense.
*  No one had before.
*  Yeah.
*  Also, when you go over here, everyone's so fat.
*  But if you go to Italy where they eat pasta every day, they're not fat.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  And, you know, I've said this a thousand times, but the other stuff that's in our bread that
*  you get from the supermarket is making you sick.
*  It shouldn't be 30 ingredients.
*  There should be four ingredients.
*  Like what other stuff do they put in it?
*  Just preservatives?
*  Preservatives, sugars, different variations of sugar.
*  Dude, I bought some bread from the farmers market.
*  It was stale in a day.
*  I bought some bread from the supermarket.
*  I bought it three weeks ago.
*  I know.
*  I had a sandwich the other day.
*  It was great.
*  I know.
*  It's still good.
*  I know.
*  It's crazy.
*  I know.
*  That's not good.
*  It's not good.
*  Well, they're doing all this great stuff.
*  All these farmers are growing wheat that was grown in the region where they farm throughout
*  centuries.
*  So they're repopulating with the stuff that was indigenous to that region.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  Does that make it better?
*  Yeah, it makes it better because it's natural.
*  It's just real.
*  What are you doing?
*  You going to make me smell it?
*  I'm just going to show it to you.
*  Look.
*  I mean, I've given you a lot of bread.
*  Look at it.
*  Isn't that the best bread I've ever given you?
*  It smells very good.
*  It's really good.
*  When did you bake this?
*  That came out last night.
*  Oh my God.
*  I can't wait to eat it.
*  Let's let it sit there.
*  So beautiful.
*  It's a masterpiece.
*  Look at that.
*  I'm getting better.
*  You are.
*  Now, how do you eat your bread?
*  Do you ever put a little Nutella on it?
*  Do you get crazy?
*  No.
*  You know, I gave Allie Wong a loaf of bread during quarantine.
*  I've been bringing bread to my friends just dropping it off.
*  And her husband put, it looked like a block of Nutella on it.
*  It was like more Nutella than bread.
*  I have a picture I was going to send you of your bread with Nutella on it.
*  My favorite is, my favorite thing, I like doing lots of different stuff with it.
*  But my favorite is cream cheese and sardines with capers.
*  Oh, God damn.
*  I like what you're saying right now.
*  Keep talking.
*  It is so good.
*  Let me get my pants off.
*  Cream cheese and sardines.
*  That sounds fantastic.
*  Oh, it's so good.
*  And some capers on it.
*  Oh my God, dude.
*  Here you go.
*  That's your bread with Nutella.
*  Look at that.
*  I put it on.
*  Oh, that was my bread.
*  Oh, that was, that's on it fat butter actually.
*  That is the on it.
*  It's got hazelnut.
*  It's got chocolate.
*  It's one of the on it.
*  That's actually good.
*  Wow.
*  Good for you, that stuff.
*  Oh, yeah?
*  That's right.
*  I got to get some of that.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, that looks good.
*  Why did I think it was Nutella?
*  That's it before.
*  I got pre and after.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Looks so good there.
*  It does look good.
*  It looks even better.
*  It's really good.
*  What is the, what's in that?
*  Does it say?
*  Does it say in the post?
*  In the post?
*  Jamie, scroll up.
*  On it chocolate hazelnut fat butter.
*  Yeah, baby.
*  Chocolate hazelnut fat butter.
*  That's good for you?
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Chocolate hazelnut fat butter.
*  Yes.
*  Don't be a pussy.
*  There's not one word in that.
*  Chocolate hazelnut fat butter.
*  Yeah.
*  Good stuff.
*  Yeah, on it fat butter is a great way to get healthy fats.
*  I love that stuff.
*  I just scoop it out.
*  Not usually the chocolate stuff, but they're different.
*  We have a bunch of different fat butters.
*  I scoop it out with spoons.
*  Oh, that's good.
*  Because it's healthy calories.
*  You know, if you want a snack and you don't want to feel like a loser, just eat some of
*  that.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  I think back to what you were saying originally, would I be able to stop if they told me?
*  I think, you know, you can't eat carbs all the time and feel good.
*  You can't.
*  And, you know, so you just have to...
*  I can't.
*  I can't.
*  Tony Hinchcliffe can.
*  Oh, yeah?
*  Tony Hinchcliffe weighs 18 pounds and eats pasta all day.
*  He's like a hummingbird.
*  He really is.
*  He just burns it off.
*  Prey Mance is going to rip his head off.
*  When he was on the podcast, he was joking around about it.
*  People would be so angry at me if they saw how I eat.
*  That's funny.
*  Because he's so slim.
*  He's so tiny.
*  He doesn't even have a hint of a gut.
*  No, he doesn't.
*  It's true, too.
*  I've eaten with him after shows.
*  That fucking kid can eat.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  That's annoying.
*  Tony throws down.
*  Oh, that's annoying.
*  That man has an appetite.
*  He's not fucking around.
*  Yeah, it is annoying because he's got a fantastic genetic makeup in terms of, you know, being
*  able to lose weight.
*  Yeah.
*  Or not gain weight, I should say.
*  It's never hard to lose any weight.
*  But on the other hand, he can't gain any weight either.
*  I brought him lifting weights and it's like, I'm going to lose weight.
*  I'm going to lose weight.
*  I'm going to lose weight.
*  I'm going to lose weight.
*  I brought him lifting weights and that's as hilarious as his diet.
*  Okay.
*  Sorry to bring up an old subject which I'm sure you've talked about a ton.
*  But?
*  I've been working out more during quarantine than I have in the last five years.
*  Excellent.
*  What have you been doing?
*  And I've been doing the Peloton for cardio.
*  Cool.
*  I don't want to run around.
*  That's a good move.
*  It's really good.
*  I really love it.
*  I haven't skipped.
*  It's really great.
*  Dumbbells, you know the adjustable, gnarless ones?
*  Sure, yeah, yeah.
*  I've been using those.
*  Great.
*  And doing those weights in the middle.
*  But everything I see online is all kettlebell all the time.
*  And is it that much better?
*  I've never worked out with a kettlebell in my life.
*  Well, you certainly can get a great workout with dumbbells.
*  You can.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  I mean, it feels great.
*  But I can show you how to use a kettlebell and you can get an understanding of why so
*  many people like it after the podcast.
*  They're really versatile.
*  And the fact that you're swinging them, you're using a lot of your whole body, you're using
*  your legs, and you're using your core.
*  When you're balancing them, you're tightening your core, you're using your spine and your
*  shoulders and your arms.
*  I love them.
*  But I've loved them for a long time.
*  It's a great exercise for functional strength.
*  Meaning, when I lift a lot of kettlebells and I do it a lot, I feel like when I do martial
*  arts, I have more strength.
*  I move better.
*  My legs move better.
*  My body moves better.
*  Because you have to use everything.
*  Say if you're doing what Steve Max would call a man maker, I think that's clean press squat.
*  It might have renegade rows in there as well.
*  But the sequences of movements.
*  You do these, you could burn yourself out really quick on these sequences of movements.
*  Right.
*  Because the dumbbells are isolating.
*  They're good.
*  No, you can do cleans and presses and stuff with dumbbells.
*  It's just not the best thing for windmills or for some other kind of exercise that you
*  can do with the kettlebells.
*  Kettlebells are just really, really versatile.
*  But it's hard to get one right now.
*  Everybody sold out when the quarantine hit.
*  On it, we're still sold out.
*  Oh, really?
*  Yeah, we have a big sale that's going on right now on it, but we don't have a sale, like
*  through the whole month.
*  But the kettlebell sale doesn't kick in until the last week of the month because we don't
*  even have them in stock.
*  Wow.
*  We just sold out.
*  We sold out so quick and it's hard to get them right now because a lot of these places
*  that manufacture them are shut down because of the quarantine.
*  So they couldn't restock them for us.
*  I wonder if now that Sporting Good places are open in LA, you could probably get stuff
*  there.
*  Maybe.
*  But where are they getting it from?
*  Yeah.
*  Whatever they had in stock before.
*  All these companies are out.
*  I know Rogue hired another company, State Side, I believe in Rhode Island to start meeting
*  their kettlebells because they were getting a lot of their kettlebells overseas.
*  And, you know, just like fucking everything shutting down, man.
*  Right, right, right.
*  Yeah, they got to open it up.
*  But once you get them, I mean, there's so many great workouts that you could find online.
*  Keith Weber is a great resource.
*  He's a guy that I've talked about.
*  He's been on the podcast before, but he's got this great kettlebell, extreme kettlebell
*  cardio workout that you could just use one 35 pound kettlebell and you get an amazing,
*  amazing workout.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah, that'd be cool.
*  I mean, just to vary it up because it's, you know, we've been doing it for like two
*  months.
*  I want to go somewhere.
*  I want to go to a yoga class.
*  I miss that.
*  Yeah, I know.
*  I miss being in a class with people.
*  I miss jujitsu.
*  Oh, that's got to be driving you crazy.
*  I miss everything.
*  You can't wrestle around.
*  The biggest thing I miss is comedy.
*  Oh, 100%.
*  It's such a weird thing.
*  I think I talked about this with you on the phone that it's not even like, oh, I just
*  miss being up.
*  You slowly start to change.
*  I slowly go inward.
*  I feel like when I'm writing a lot, I get more insulated.
*  I get more to myself.
*  I feel like that just socially when I'm not performing.
*  You mean when you're writing, you're doing great, which is available right now?
*  Yes.
*  Everywhere, wherever books are sold.
*  It'll make you feel good.
*  It'll make you feel good.
*  Yeah, when I'm doing that, no joke, when I'm isolated and I'm in there cranking it out,
*  I get a little different.
*  But then I could go out at night and be out and it resets it.
*  Being in quarantine is like I'm writing the book without having any outlet.
*  Yeah, we miss that clubhouse environment.
*  The comic store is a place where it's like all these comics that travel all over the
*  country will get together and be with our own tribe.
*  Yeah, it's a big part of it.
*  It is a big part of it.
*  Now we're not even supposed to be, I mean, people were at the beginning of this podcast
*  like why are you allowed to do that?
*  They were saying they shouldn't even be allowed to do this.
*  Even if I was testing everybody.
*  I'm like, look.
*  But I think it's also because people are out of work and they're like, why do you get to work?
*  It seems so.
*  Right.
*  Why does anybody get to tell you you can't work?
*  That's what the real question should be.
*  That's the real question.
*  Right.
*  Exactly.
*  I know you got to get people back to work.
*  That's that thing.
*  That balance.
*  And it's like, I think we've gone pretty far that one way.
*  And now you're going to really start hurting people.
*  Utah doesn't give a fuck.
*  They're like, let's go.
*  Well, in controlled ways.
*  But you know, they're not being mindless about it.
*  They're not being irresponsible.
*  They're not saying come out old people.
*  California State University campuses to remain closed through fall semester.
*  You fucks.
*  They're going to make California just a bunch of just veal.
*  We're going to be veal over here.
*  The whole rest of the country is going to be out there.
*  I wonder that herd immunity.
*  I wonder if they're going to charge you like if you go to classes, 500,000 kids, their students online.
*  Online, online, though.
*  Fuck.
*  I wonder if you'll still charge you full tuition and put it online.
*  Of course they will.
*  Of course they will.
*  Fuck off with all this.
*  Fuck off with all this.
*  If I was going to college right now and I found out this was Cal.
*  I would switch.
*  Yeah, like I'm getting out of here.
*  100 percent.
*  My daughter's not going to find out till July to go move and play out of state tuition fees at another school now because yeah, state schools.
*  So that's like right.
*  Yeah.
*  Option for a lot of people.
*  I would move.
*  Oh, that's brutal.
*  Fuck it.
*  Go on, Texas.
*  Wouldn't you?
*  I probably wouldn't be going to college right now.
*  I think my daughter is going to go east coast and she's not going to find out for mental health.
*  I think it's terrible for kids to be sitting in front of a fucking computer all day doing school with no friends around and not being able to mingle and have a good time.
*  That's what my daughters call it.
*  School with no friends.
*  It's awful.
*  Yeah.
*  This might lead to no football for the fall because if these kids can't be on campus then they're not going to be playing the games then.
*  Meanwhile, China, they're all spitting in each other's mouths and lifting weights to get ready to take over.
*  Yeah, that's a good point, Jamie, because then, you know, they don't just play California schools.
*  They play the rest of the country.
*  I was just looking up the Big Ten, which is where Ohio State plays.
*  Yeah.
*  Looking up some stuff.
*  There's a discussion of maybe just having an all in conference schedule so like you don't have to fly.
*  They can just drive buses.
*  Right.
*  I wonder how Vegas is going to handle it because like I said, my friend Nick, his restaurant opened up at half capacity.
*  But I wonder how that I have a show in Vegas that sold out at that Park Theater, whatever the fuck that is.
*  When?
*  The one next to the July.
*  July?
*  First weekend in July.
*  I know you've done outside comedy before.
*  Is that?
*  Terrible.
*  Do you think that's the potential?
*  I don't enjoy it.
*  Like amphitheaters?
*  Yeah, you could.
*  The audience likes it.
*  We don't like it.
*  Yeah, okay.
*  Yeah, it's okay.
*  It's okay.
*  I mean, I did one in Mountain View in San Francisco this past year.
*  I did one in Salt Lake, too.
*  This is not as good.
*  Dave and I did one in Salt Lake.
*  The energy just goes up into the sky.
*  You don't get to really feel it.
*  It's not really that good.
*  It's pretty good up in the sky.
*  Oh, geez.
*  There it goes.
*  I've seen some drive-in things that have popped up in the last couple of weeks.
*  I don't know how successful they've been, but I saw like EDM and then I think a couple
*  comedians have tried to do parking lot comedy or something.
*  Oh, really?
*  Yeah.
*  My wife kept saying that I should do drive-in comedy.
*  She's like, do it before anyone else gets the idea.
*  Yeah.
*  She's like, yeah, you should go do drive-in comedy.
*  Get the fuck out of here.
*  I know.
*  She's like, I'm going to do it.
*  I'm going to do it.
*  I'm going to do it.
*  Yeah.
*  People find out whether or not you really like somebody.
*  Yeah.
*  Tom's not going to have any.
*  No, I'm okay.
*  He's terrified.
*  I'm not terrified.
*  I love it.
*  A little horrified.
*  I have to do two more things after this.
*  What are you going to do?
*  NPR, KPCC.
*  Both those things.
*  Pot would help both of those.
*  It's true.
*  Then I got to drive my car home.
*  Let the car drive itself.
*  It does drive itself.
*  It does drive itself.
*  It does drive itself.
*  It does drive itself.
*  It does drive itself.
*  It does drive itself.
*  It does drive itself.
*  It does drive itself.
*  It does drive itself.
*  It does drive itself.
*  It does drive itself.
*  It does drive itself.
*  It smells so good though.
*  Do you have the, want some?
*  Little?
*  Just a little baby.
*  No.
*  No?
*  Okay.
*  Forget it.
*  The new driving option, the Tesla one that you have to pay for, have you done that?
*  The what?
*  Self-driving thing.
*  This new update that came out that you actually pay for?
*  No.
*  Yeah.
*  I didn't see that.
*  Yeah, there was a new one that came out.
*  You have to pay for it?
*  Mm-hmm.
*  Yeah, like 4,000 bucks.
*  What?
*  Oh, maybe my car isn't equipped for it.
*  What year is your car?
*  It's, what are we, 2020?
*  It's probably 2015.
*  Oh, it's a piece of shit.
*  It probably barely has any batteries.
*  It's got great battery.
*  It dies real quick, right?
*  No.
*  Come on.
*  How fast does it go?
*  Slow as shit.
*  It's faster than I needed to.
*  No.
*  Yes.
*  Impossible.
*  It's a killer.
*  You should have the new one.
*  This is ridiculous.
*  I should have the new one.
*  This is outrageous.
*  You're right.
*  You're right.
*  I should update.
*  But I think I'm probably missing some hardware though.
*  Yeah, I think so.
*  For that.
*  What does it do?
*  I don't know if I haven't tried it yet.
*  Tesla's latest self-driving visualization comes to life in this impressive picture.
*  Oh.
*  Oh, so it shows the cones.
*  That's interesting.
*  Oh.
*  Yeah, because it's, oh, so it'll stop for things that ...
*  Oh, it shows someone with a stop sign.
*  Wow, that's crazy.
*  It shows a stop sign.
*  It reads the stop sign.
*  Will it stop for traffic lights?
*  That's the thing that mine does not do.
*  I don't think it does that yet.
*  Well, then I'm not interested.
*  Then it's a lemon.
*  Tesla's autopilot ... Go back to that.
*  On V9, shows great improvements when it comes to rendering the surroundings on the screen.
*  But I'm often getting these weird bugs when stopped or at low speeds.
*  Play that.
*  Let's see what that does.
*  What's the weird bug?
*  Weird bugs.
*  It's like motorcycles.
*  Oh, people are just moving around like ghosts and shit.
*  There's no one there.
*  Oh, that's weird.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, it's all electronics.
*  Have you heard of any viruses infecting Teslas?
*  No.
*  Maybe I shouldn't have put that out there.
*  Dude.
*  Have you heard?
*  Dude.
*  I mean, I'm sure someone must have thought about it already.
*  Yeah, I'm sure they've been trying to crack in.
*  I'm not the guy who's going to be the first one to think that up.
*  Yeah.
*  No, I think ... Yeah, but there's certain things ... There's certain modes and stuff
*  so that people don't mess with it.
*  A mode like to kind of shut off the computer.
*  Yeah, and there's sentry mode too, right?
*  How many people have caught keying in them?
*  Oh, really?
*  Yeah.
*  It's so weird, man.
*  People look around.
*  No one's around.
*  They scratch the shit out of someone's car.
*  Why would you do that?
*  Because they're angry.
*  It's ridiculous.
*  It's usually people that they don't even know the person.
*  They just decide this is a nice car.
*  They see this sweet Model 3 sitting there and just walk by with keys and scratch the
*  shit out of it.
*  What are they in?
*  So weird.
*  Were they in Warriors, the movie?
*  I think that's why Elon made those cyber trucks bulletproof.
*  It's like, it's got to be a way to fix this.
*  Got to fix it?
*  Yeah.
*  And we're going to do it?
*  Yeah.
*  Make it all out of sheet metal steel.
*  They do have some sort of hacking competition to look for bugs.
*  Oh, God.
*  Oh.
*  A group of hackers won a Tesla Model 3 and a $35,000 prize for hacking into its systems.
*  A Matt Kama and Richard Zhu, I hope I'm saying that right, of a team called Floracitate exposed
*  to vulnerability in the vehicle system during the hacking competition, the hackers targeted
*  the infotainment.
*  That's a weird fake word.
*  Infotainment.
*  Which is it?
*  Is it information or is it entertainment?
*  That's ridiculous.
*  How about media system?
*  Yeah.
*  How about the radio?
*  I don't like that.
*  Infotainment.
*  Infotainment.
*  It's thrown around like a real word.
*  We have plenty of words that cover both of those things.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  No new word needed here.
*  We don't need to make hybrid words.
*  Yeah.
*  It just seems like a weird time.
*  How did we get on the Tesla we were talking about?
*  Talking about your car driving itself if you got high.
*  Oh, if I got high, right?
*  See, my memory's strong, even with the weed.
*  That's rare, though.
*  It's very unreliable.
*  My memory's super unreliable when I'm high.
*  Yeah.
*  Sometimes it's great, though.
*  Sometimes I can pull things out of the deep.
*  Right.
*  Exactly.
*  What's with all these old boxers coming back?
*  What do you mean?
*  Avander Holyfield is coming back now, too.
*  What?
*  Yes.
*  Have you seen the Mike Tyson video?
*  He's like 65.
*  Mike Tyson's coming back.
*  What?
*  Yes.
*  You haven't seen?
*  Dude.
*  No.
*  Okay.
*  Go to Mike Tyson's page for his most recent video on his Instagram.
*  Get ready for this.
*  Oh, really?
*  Get ready for this because he looks fucking sensational.
*  What is he, 55?
*  53.
*  I think he's a year older than I am.
*  I'm 52.
*  But he looks fucking incredible.
*  Really?
*  Terrifying.
*  He was so terrifying.
*  Was there anything more exciting than his fights?
*  There were cultural events.
*  Oh, my God.
*  So exciting.
*  The only concern was that you were going to spend money and you weren't going to get it
*  back.
*  Look at this.
*  You needed volume so you could hear this, too.
*  Whoa.
*  I mean, what in the fuck?
*  Oh, my God.
*  Dude, he looks like old.
*  I'm back.
*  You know what's really funny?
*  Oh, my God.
*  He said on the podcast when he was in here, he said he didn't want to work out again because
*  his ego would get fired up again.
*  And he's actually said that in his post that my ego had been reignited.
*  Does that mean his rage?
*  No.
*  See if you can find it.
*  That his ego would be...
*  Because he's like being Zen and doesn't want to...
*  He gave a statement about it saying that his ego has been reignited.
*  Ah, good for him.
*  Good for us.
*  Yeah, he said something about how the gods of war have brought him out again.
*  It was like really heavy-duty shit.
*  I think it's real recent.
*  See if you can find the quote.
*  But it was like, oh, my God.
*  When you were with him...
*  The gods of war reignited my ego.
*  Oh, my God.
*  And I'm ready to go again.
*  Yeah.
*  He's going to fight.
*  Do you think...
*  How do you think he'd fare against a 28-year-old?
*  I don't know.
*  It depends on the 28-year-old.
*  But I think that you for sure need a guy who's really good at fighting to keep him off you.
*  Yeah.
*  Even if you're in your 20s.
*  Here, Mike Tyson explains his desire to fight again.
*  I feel unstoppable now.
*  The gods of war have reawakened me.
*  And he said something about his ego firing up.
*  See if you can find that quote.
*  That was one of the things that he actually talked about in the podcast.
*  Yeah.
*  The gods of war have awakened me.
*  They've reignited my ego and want me to go to war again.
*  Holy shit.
*  That's so terrifying.
*  That's so terrifying.
*  Here's the thing, man.
*  If they don't drug test him, they don't test him for hormones.
*  Things are way different.
*  What do you mean?
*  Because if he takes hormones...
*  If he's taking testosterone, growth hormone, thyroid hormone, all the things that people
*  do when they take hormone replacement therapy, your body functions way better at a way later
*  age.
*  It's different.
*  It's very different.
*  If we're talking about being a 53-year-old man in 1985, there's no chance.
*  Everybody fell apart.
*  You'd have to be a really, really, really rare person who doesn't take hormones and
*  can perform like a 30-year-old when you're in your 50s.
*  But when you're on hormones, you can kind of do it.
*  There's a few guys that were in the UFC.
*  One of the bigger examples is Vitor Belfort.
*  Vitor Belfort, who's a phenomenal fighter, a real legend.
*  He won the first tournament that I ever worked on.
*  I was at UFC 12 in 1997.
*  He was 19 years old back then.
*  Then when he was in his late 30s, he had a giant resurgence.
*  It was when they made testosterone replacement therapy legal for fighters.
*  There was a bunch of fighters that got on these testosterone replacement therapy exemptions.
*  They're taking testosterone, but they had an old man's brain.
*  But their body moved like a younger man.
*  Basically, they had all of the experience of a lifetime of fighting.
*  But because of the hormones, their body actually performed like someone way younger than them.
*  How much younger, do you think?
*  I don't know. It depends on the body. It depends on what kind of damage you're dealing with.
*  What's wrong with you.
*  Whether or not it can bring you back 10 years or five years.
*  Who knows?
*  But with these fighters, the thing is they were never really out of shape.
*  There's quite a few of them, in fact.
*  I'm not going to name any names.
*  They needed those hormones because they had done steroids.
*  When you do steroids, it shuts down your endocrine system.
*  Your endocrine system doesn't make the proper hormones anymore.
*  It was a real weird conundrum.
*  Everyone kind of knew this, but there was a weird loophole that went on for a few years.
*  It was a real gray area in MMA.
*  Say a fighter could go to the doctor and say,
*  I want to get a blood test and see what my testosterone levels are because I am feeling very tired.
*  They look at it and they test. They go, oh, look at this.
*  Your testosterone levels are low.
*  You could take this hormone and inject it into your body every week.
*  Now you're eligible for testosterone replacement therapy.
*  But the thing is, the whole reason why they needed it in the first place might have been that they were using it illegally.
*  It's a weird thing you're rewarded because the testing wasn't very good.
*  Some of these guys that were a part of this testosterone replacement therapy thing,
*  they were ones that were kind of accused of possibly using performance enhancing drugs in the past.
*  Then they get to use them legally.
*  Vitor, dude, I'm telling you, everyone in the MMA community would talk about TRT Vitor.
*  TRT Vitor was a guy who was in his 30s.
*  He'd been fighting a long fucking time.
*  But all of a sudden he was moving like a demon again and just smashing people.
*  You ever see him fight?
*  No.
*  Do me a favor, pull up Vitor Belfort versus Luke Rockhold because that was one of the perfect examples.
*  And they're fighting, I don't know if it was in Brazil or what, but Vitor had muscles on his teeth when he was weighing in for that fight.
*  It was crazy.
*  And he just blitzkrieged Luke Rockhold.
*  And it was okay to do?
*  It was legal.
*  What he was doing was legal.
*  And then it took a while for everybody to go, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, what the fuck?
*  Hold on a minute.
*  What's going on?
*  We can't do this.
*  And so then the UFC went the whole other way and they brought in USADA,
*  the US Anti-Doping Agency now handles everything and they randomly test fighters in the middle of the night.
*  And people get popped for stuff all the time.
*  Oh really?
*  Yeah, they're really strict, man.
*  Do you think they should be?
*  The first one just got popped for marijuana.
*  They have a pretty liberal range.
*  It's a pretty generous range that you can have.
*  So watch this.
*  First of all, look at Vitor.
*  He's the one in the red.
*  Just fucking shredded.
*  Now watch this wheel kick.
*  Check this out.
*  Set it up.
*  Bang.
*  Dude, fucking Vitor when he was on the TRT was one of the scariest guys to ever live.
*  Up into his tracks.
*  Look at him.
*  Oh my God.
*  Yeah, dudes avoided the fuck out of him.
*  Look at this wheel kick.
*  Oh my God.
*  Dude.
*  It's like a pit bull.
*  Oh my goodness.
*  He looked like a demon.
*  He looked like a demon back then.
*  There's a few of his fights from that era that were just absolutely terrifying.
*  Do you think that it should be that strict against these drugs in the fight?
*  Yes.
*  It should, yeah.
*  Because it's competition.
*  Keep it pure, yeah.
*  Yeah, it's not for your health.
*  I take testosterone replacement.
*  I think for your health it's a good move when you get older.
*  It makes your body work better.
*  But for fighting, there's a weird gray area.
*  When should it be legal?
*  You're going to let people take it after they're 45?
*  My point is, if they don't test Tyson and Holyfield and all these guys for testosterone
*  replacement, we might see some crazy shots.
*  We might see some great fights.
*  Some fun paper.
*  I do not know.
*  Maybe he's not on anything and maybe he's just a special athlete.
*  Lord knows Herschel Walker was.
*  Herschel Walker was a guy who fought in StrikeForce after he played in the NFL and was really
*  successful.
*  It was terrifying.
*  People were avoiding him.
*  People that were lifelong martial artists were like, fuck that guy, because he was a
*  super athlete.
*  Super athlete.
*  Obviously Mike Tyson was a super athlete when he was young.
*  Oh my God.
*  No one when they're 20 usually can move like that.
*  Here he is, 53, moving like a world champ, throwing bombs.
*  Again, it's only on the pads.
*  We don't know what happens if he spars.
*  But still.
*  But you have to surmise.
*  You're like the praying mantis.
*  If he makes the first move, he's going to rip your head off.
*  You have to look at that and go, let's not get crazy.
*  Look how fast he's going.
*  Look how scary he is.
*  That's what makes us think of Mike Tyson when he was in his prime.
*  When he'd come out, no socks.
*  Just those leathers.
*  My favorite ever was the Marvis Frazier fight because it was really like an execution.
*  Marvis Frazier also was a really good fighter and was Joe Frazier's son.
*  You knew what was going to happen.
*  In like 20 seconds.
*  Tyson was just a different thing.
*  He just came into the ring.
*  We had never seen a boxer like him before.
*  Every fight was an execution.
*  It was brutal.
*  No frills, no nothings.
*  No socks most of the time.
*  No socks, no robe most of the time.
*  Sometimes he had a towel around his neck.
*  Sometimes he didn't even have that.
*  He wasn't going to be there long.
*  You would see the look in the guy's eyes when they would see him across the ring.
*  Like, oh my God, what the fuck did I sign up for?
*  So exciting.
*  When you were with him when he was here, do you feel like this is still a menacing physical guy?
*  Or did you feel like...
*  Well, he's real nice.
*  He's a real nice guy.
*  But he still has that...
*  Guys that were tough in their youth, you still feel that thing.
*  Oh yeah, he's terrifying.
*  Who said it passed?
*  What was the UFC fighter that was saying?
*  It's like hanging out with a lion.
*  Was it Kevin Lee?
*  I think it was Kevin Lee.
*  Sounds like something Kevin would say.
*  He goes, it's like you're next to a lion.
*  And he's like, oh yeah, that's Mike Tyson.
*  That way to describe it is the perfect way to describe being around him.
*  You just want him to like you.
*  You want to be nice to him.
*  Be cool, be cool.
*  You can't believe he's here.
*  No, it's like a mythical figure sitting next to you.
*  Dude, he asked me about fighting.
*  What did I ever do?
*  I've never felt more like a fraud in my life.
*  Just tell him about the stupid shit that I've done.
*  I did a little Taekwondo tournament.
*  Had a couple kickboxing fights.
*  I felt like such a bitch.
*  You can feel it.
*  It's the worst.
*  He's like a cultural icon.
*  If you stop and think about it.
*  Like from our generation, to be around him is like, what?
*  Are you a real thing? You're right here?
*  It's like being with Thor or Zeus.
*  Really?
*  It's like, oh, you came out of the sky and you're talking to me now.
*  He was a legend.
*  He's going to fight someone and they don't have a fight scheduled.
*  But also, Evander Holyfield.
*  Go to Evander Holyfield's YouTube.
*  I'm thinking he doesn't look as fast.
*  Nope, he doesn't.
*  But he still looks good.
*  I'm sorry, his Instagram, not his YouTube.
*  His Instagram.
*  He posted a video of him throwing punches.
*  He said, this is me at 60%.
*  Who wants to see 70%?
*  I've been doing this my whole life.
*  It was interesting because as a person who's a giant boxing fan,
*  and I am, I see what Holyfield's doing.
*  What Holyfield's doing is he saw the Mike Tyson thing.
*  He saw Mike Tyson looking amazing.
*  And then that fire just got quick, got turned on,
*  and he's doing it slow and deliberate.
*  So here he is, like running, shadow boxing.
*  And then there's videos of him.
*  He's jumping rope again.
*  Oh, geez.
*  He's in good shape.
*  He was in great shape when he was here.
*  But look at this, shadow boxing.
*  And then there's a video of him.
*  That looks pretty good.
*  Let me go to all the videos.
*  Which one I've been doing the dumbbells?
*  I think it's that...
*  That's not it.
*  The one...
*  Is that it? I think it was before that.
*  I think it was before that.
*  You think that'll be the fight?
*  That's the announcement, but there was another one of him
*  where it said, this is me at 60%.
*  Who wants to see 70%?
*  Geez, look at him in the prime.
*  Nope.
*  What does it say there?
*  See him in his prime?
*  He's hitting the bag.
*  He's doing some other stuff.
*  He was tough.
*  He was amazing. He's one of the greatest heavyweights of all time.
*  Either way, that's okay.
*  But he's basically
*  him going through a workout.
*  Throwing some punches,
*  hitting the bag, throwing some uppercuts.
*  And you're like, wow.
*  What if it's a Tyson-Holyfield fight?
*  Dude, that's the fight.
*  If you were going to make a crazy fight
*  of two 50-year-old guys, that's the fight.
*  People would pay for that for sure.
*  Oh, fuck yeah.
*  Oh, fuck yeah, they would.
*  But here's the thing. Do you just jump right into that?
*  Yes, you do.
*  Do you let Tyson fight a bartender first?
*  Just from a promo standpoint
*  to get everyone excited?
*  Well, there was a guy who's a rugby player
*  who's, I believe he's 7-0
*  in boxing.
*  I think they offered Tyson a fight
*  to fight that guy.
*  I think the thought is, no, he wants to fight a real boxer.
*  Not just a guy who's a hobbyist.
*  Right. Yeah, let him take down
*  some tomato can.
*  I've been training lately too.
*  Oh my goodness, 54-year-old Lennox Lewis.
*  Hey man, imagine
*  if in this day and age
*  the three of them have a fucking fight-off.
*  You know, like a Super Six tournament.
*  Fuck, that would be crazy.
*  Now you're...
*  They can take testosterone, these guys?
*  I don't know. Would that be okay?
*  In the boxing federation?
*  I don't know where they get it done.
*  I don't know who does the testing, what the rules are.
*  It would depend, it would vary
*  on the state athletic commissions.
*  You could always do things on tribal land.
*  They have their own rules.
*  You could always make agreements.
*  Like the fighter can't take more than this or that
*  and you have to be within this level or that level.
*  Because you don't want guys juiced up
*  on some psycho drugs.
*  Because also, if you're not going to drug test at all,
*  there's other stuff that people could take.
*  People take Adderall and fight.
*  Oh yeah, just for focus?
*  Yeah, I've seen people who actually were on Adderall
*  who were told by the athletic commission
*  that they couldn't take the Adderall.
*  They had to get off of it and then they had to
*  wean themselves off and then come back and fight.
*  Geez. Wow.
*  Yeah, there was quite a bit of an issue.
*  Because there's guys who were prescribed it by the doctors.
*  You know, they have ADHD or something.
*  And they're on this Adderall
*  and the athletic commission was like, no sir.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  You know, I did a baseball event.
*  It was the all-star game for softball.
*  You know, the softball game before the all-star game the next day.
*  Celebrity legends thing.
*  And you get to play with all the baseball players.
*  And I hang out with the baseball players
*  and they were all talking about how in the 70s and 80s,
*  they would, when you were pitching,
*  you would put amphetamines in the coffee.
*  Because you wanted everybody to be super alert
*  and be able to see stuff.
*  And you wanted everybody to play your best.
*  You wanted everybody to play your best while you were pitching.
*  They were like, it was just common.
*  People were taking that pills and stuff all the time.
*  And then focus for the batters as well, right?
*  Yeah, so their team would win while you were pitching.
*  Yeah, but not even just...
*  They would see the ball as a big...
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  I've never done them. Me neither.
*  But I know a lot of pool players
*  who really got into amphetamines during gambling events.
*  Because the pool culture is very strange when it comes to gambling.
*  Yeah.
*  And one of the big things is they play
*  until someone quits.
*  Right.
*  It's like, you can win.
*  Like, you can say, okay, we'll do a race to ten.
*  And if you beat me, and if I want to play you a second race
*  and you just bail, you get a bad reputation
*  in the world of gamblers.
*  The idea is, and this is very debatable,
*  some guys don't feel bad about stopping early
*  and some guys do.
*  But the old school hardcore guys
*  would never quit.
*  That's like a scene in The Hustler
*  with Jackie Gleason and Paul Newman.
*  They'd go all night.
*  And then all through the next night.
*  He has a breakdown, he's just all sweaty.
*  And then Fats starts putting himself together.
*  He's like, oh, it was better at the end.
*  He washes his hands.
*  So great.
*  He tightens his tie.
*  He powders his hands up.
*  Like a baby, Fats.
*  And he goes, yeah, he goes,
*  Fats Daddy, let's play some pool.
*  And then Paul Newman's drunk.
*  I mean, it's a classic scene.
*  It's a scene in terms of the culture
*  of hardcore gamblers in pool.
*  And in the 70s and the 80s
*  when gambling was a really big thing
*  with pool players who traveled
*  all across the country.
*  There's all these great road stories.
*  There's one by David McCumber
*  about my friend Tony Anagoni.
*  It's called Playing Off the Rail.
*  And it's all about them just traveling
*  from town to town gambling.
*  But Tony would do it completely naturally.
*  Tony was just a strong-minded,
*  really good pool player who would do it
*  with no drugs.
*  But other guys would take
*  hardcore amphetamines
*  and be up for days.
*  It was famous that guys would have these sessions.
*  You would go home and go to bed.
*  And then you'd call a pool hall at noon
*  like they're still going, like what?
*  And they went all through the night
*  and they played all through the day.
*  So you would go down there after lunch
*  and it would be 3 in the afternoon.
*  And these guys who'd been playing pool from 7pm
*  and still talking shit to each other
*  and they're all just gacked up on speed.
*  My God, until somebody broke.
*  Yeah, there was speed guys
*  and then there was the guys who were the natural guys
*  who would get mad at the speed guys.
*  He needs that shit in his system.
*  He can't fucking play me like a man.
*  Should I take testosterone?
*  Would it make me feel more...
*  You should go to a doctor and find out what your testosterone levels are.
*  You might not have to.
*  When I went for my physical, it wasn't low.
*  Oh, well you're good to go.
*  It's got to be lower than it was when I was 17.
*  I'm sure it is.
*  And there's some strategies to lift it up
*  and one of the best ones is stop eating bread.
*  Sorry.
*  What? God damn it!
*  Some people think that's actually true.
*  Some people think one of the best ways
*  to keep your hormones strong
*  is to have less inflammation in your body.
*  Right.
*  And a carnivore diet,
*  like any diet where you're eating very little carbs,
*  probably will boost it a little bit.
*  It's good for people that have autoimmune issues
*  for some strange reason.
*  When people cut out bread and pasta and sugar
*  and even vegetables,
*  some people with psoriasis, it just goes away.
*  Really?
*  It's weird, man.
*  That's extreme.
*  I did it for a month.
*  It's a weird way to live your life.
*  You get tired of...
*  It does feel great though to...
*  I'm not going to live that way,
*  but when you don't have any of that
*  and just have some of your elk or whatever
*  and vegetables and just eggs the next morning
*  and even just for like two days,
*  you feel different.
*  Really, you feel different.
*  It's like a person who doesn't fly.
*  Yeah.
*  If you're eating healthy food,
*  healthy food is the number one building block
*  for your body.
*  You have to think about it like if you're making your body,
*  like your body is essentially
*  building itself up all the time
*  and regenerating tissue and regenerating cells,
*  right? We all know this.
*  If that's happening, what is it doing it with?
*  What are you providing? What kind of protein?
*  What kind of vitamins?
*  Cool ranch Doritos.
*  Holy cow.
*  We're going to have to build a house with this shit.
*  And it's got to build your body
*  with this horrible foundation.
*  You should almost look at it that way.
*  Yeah, that's a good way to look at it.
*  There's nothing wrong with eating a little bit of bullshit every now and then.
*  Sure.
*  But you're literally using it as fuel
*  to power your body.
*  You want to give it the best fuel possible.
*  Yeah, of course.
*  I know people,
*  like my friend Cam Haynes,
*  he pours water
*  into cereal because he won't use dairy.
*  What about a nut milk?
*  You'd never catch that motherfucker drinking a nut milk.
*  Nice little almond milk.
*  It's too hard.
*  It's too hard.
*  But he pours water into cereal.
*  I'm like, what the fuck? Just don't eat cereal.
*  He wants cereal, he just doesn't want to eat dairy.
*  Some people just look at food as fuel.
*  It's just fuel.
*  That's all it is.
*  And look, if you're living that way, that's fine.
*  Not me, baby.
*  A bottle of wine,
*  some nice bread, some nice cheese.
*  Once in a while,
*  sit outside with your wife and just have a nice little moment.
*  That's not about fuel.
*  That's about something else.
*  It's about living your life.
*  There's enjoyment, there's pleasure in those meals.
*  Yes, 100%.
*  Like pasta,
*  I was talking to Adam Perry Lang
*  about what he calls comfort food.
*  I'm like, yeah, that's a good name for it.
*  That expression that people love to use.
*  Comfort food.
*  That's kind of what's happening.
*  It's like giving you a hug in your mouth.
*  It's a big, cuddly grandma's boob.
*  Some real good mac and cheese.
*  Right in between grandma's big boobs
*  in her house dress.
*  You smell the flour on her apron.
*  Yeah, come on.
*  Oh, whatever you grew up with like that.
*  It could just make you five again.
*  Especially things that are like
*  cheesy stews
*  or
*  just
*  pasta with
*  melted cheese and sauce.
*  Like lasagna.
*  Come on, come on.
*  Lasagna is such a great creation.
*  Oh, it's so good.
*  Whatever wizard figured out
*  how to put together that concoction.
*  Because think of what they're doing. Like, hold on, I got a fucking idea.
*  We're going to get a melt pan.
*  We're doing some pasta on the bottom.
*  I'm going to put a pasta on the bottom. I'm going to put a sauce.
*  I'm going to put a cheese. More pasta.
*  Cheese. Don't forget the meat.
*  Oh, the fucking pork.
*  It's all about the pork.
*  We are going to have three times meat.
*  I stacked it in there like this meat and pasta cheese sandwich.
*  Another layer?
*  Yeah, another layer.
*  And then the tomato sauce.
*  And you know there's no if, ands, or buts.
*  That's not good for you.
*  You don't give a fuck.
*  No one's got nutritious pasta that's like lasagna.
*  There has never been an athlete that was at the podium
*  with a medal around his neck saying
*  I'd like to thank the people that made my lasagna.
*  There's something about it though.
*  Like when you're eating it, you're like
*  I don't give a fuck.
*  This is bad for me. This is so good.
*  I make that on Christmas Eve.
*  Oh, it's such a good thing to make.
*  And it becomes like, you know, because it's a lot of work.
*  You're only doing that a couple times a year.
*  And when you do it, like now the kids
*  all think of Christmas Eve as the
*  time for the lasagna.
*  I mean that's memories.
*  That's love. That's all of that stuff
*  wrapped into one.
*  My grandmother used to make her own pasta.
*  She did everything. Everything was homemade.
*  Oh my god. Yeah, it was crazy.
*  Like I grew up with that.
*  When I was a little kid, I remember when I was over
*  their house, like my grandmother, she had
*  the rolling pin, the flour,
*  and she's making the dough
*  and she's pressing everything and pouring the
*  flour on it and pressing it again.
*  A master. Where was this? Where was she?
*  Jersey. New Jersey.
*  She was reckless, this lady. She would cut
*  a loaf of bread towards her with a giant
*  ass knife.
*  I'm like, your tits, grandma.
*  Your tits are right there. Don't cut
*  yourself. I can't think. She's going to cut
*  herself. Never. She's been doing it every day
*  for her whole life. Yeah, her whole fucking
*  life. Reckless lady.
*  Oh, that's the best. Cut towards your tip
*  with a giant old knife.
*  But you knew when you walked in there you were going to
*  be fed. The only thing they didn't make is bread.
*  We would get bread. My grandfather
*  had two places he would go in the neighborhood
*  that we would go and he would take me on a walk with
*  him to get the bread. It was only a couple blocks away.
*  Amazing. Yeah. Amazing.
*  Wild man. Italian immigrant
*  cooking. That was my grandparents, too.
*  What was amazing, too, is
*  even when they weren't going all out,
*  if they just did something simple, it
*  was the most mind blowing.
*  She used to make the escarole, which is just
*  this leafy. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Tommy, just take this, take a little piece of bread,
*  just have that. And it was like, come on.
*  Yes. Come on. To your knees.
*  Yes.
*  She would make these little twists, these little
*  pasta twists. And it was all
*  fresh pasta. So when you bite
*  into it, it was like it had this chew to it.
*  It was so satisfying.
*  With the homemade tomato sauce.
*  Bro, it all came from my grandfather's tomatoes
*  and he would grow in the backyard. She would do the whole
*  thing from scratch. Boil the tomatoes
*  and make the sauce and add the
*  garlic. The kitchen just, you'd
*  walk in and you'd be like, I'm fucking
*  starving. What is
*  happening in here? I always said as soon as I got out
*  of the car in the driveway,
*  the smell would just
*  carry you into the house. Oh, the tomato
*  sauce. The smell.
*  The garlic. Good for your soul.
*  Good for your soul.
*  I'll never forget that, man. I'll never forget watching
*  her make things. And she wanted
*  to make it for everybody. She wanted
*  everybody to eat her homemade pasta. Oh, she knew
*  she was good at it. Oh, for sure.
*  We would go crazy. She would
*  serve us and she'd just look at us and be like, oh my
*  God, Grandma. Was it a big family?
*  Did you have cousins and stuff? Yeah, yeah. Everybody would come
*  over. Yeah, we would do, you know,
*  before she got sick, she had
*  a stroke. Oh, yeah. It was horrible, man.
*  How old? She wasn't
*  that old and she lived for another 12
*  years. Oh, wow. They thought that
*  she had 48 hours to live. The
*  doctor was like, you know, she's got maybe 72
*  or something. Oh, my God. She's saying goodbye.
*  She's in bad shape.
*  12 years. She had a stroke
*  and people didn't find
*  they didn't know who knew. She fell down
*  outside. You know, she had a
*  hemorrhage
*  and she fell down outside
*  and they didn't find her for like
*  a half hour or something.
*  No one knew that she'd been out there. That's the whole
*  key with stroke is speed. Yeah.
*  That's what they say, right? Speed. But we
*  only learned that like last week.
*  Oh, that's brutal. Yeah, aneurysms are crazy,
*  right? Like you just, everything's fine.
*  And then one day, just boom, things start bleeding.
*  No, I don't like to think of those at all.
*  It's terrifying. God. But you
*  got enough years in where she was cooking
*  when you were up in... Yeah, but it was also, I did,
*  but it was also just
*  for life for me, for a life
*  lesson to see someone who
*  you knew was, you know,
*  always like this larger than
*  life character. My grandmother was,
*  she was really fun. Yeah.
*  She was really weird too. She would wear wigs
*  and shit.
*  She was a strange lady.
*  That's great. But a powerful lady.
*  Yeah. And then to see her confined to
*  a bed for the rest of the time
*  that I saw her. And then when I moved to New York,
*  when I was
*  23 or 24, when I first moved to New York,
*  I stayed with them,
*  because I didn't have any money.
*  And my grandparents lived
*  in this neighborhood that was really
*  deteriorating. Their next door neighbor,
*  like the fucking, the DEA
*  broke down his front door with a battering ram.
*  He was selling crack and shit.
*  Shit. Oh man.
*  The neighborhood got heavy.
*  But to stay with them,
*  while they're in the twilight of their life,
*  and my grandmother was in really
*  bad shape. So she would like moan all the time,
*  make these horrible noises.
*  Oh really? For years?
*  Kind of a thing? Yeah.
*  It lasted a long time, man.
*  But it made me, the lesson was,
*  okay, you have to really
*  savor the moment.
*  Because they can go away.
*  They can go away quick. And also,
*  you gotta take care of your body.
*  Like you have to. And no one from her generation
*  did. They were just trying to survive, man.
*  She was a kid during the depression.
*  So people that were kids during the depression,
*  man, they were scared.
*  Yeah, they didn't eat.
*  No joke. Not like now
*  I'm starving. Like real starving.
*  Yeah. Like terrifying.
*  Terrifying times.
*  And you saw how they treated food
*  that whole generation. Like my grandmother wouldn't throw
*  anything out. There was no waste.
*  Because they always felt like you
*  could, right around the corner, could be another time
*  when you're not gonna have it. Also, you didn't cook anything
*  new. You just ate the leftovers. You had to eat
*  your fucking leftovers before you cooked some new shit.
*  That's right. I know.
*  I always feel wasteful when I think of it.
*  Yeah. Well, that's one thing that hunting
*  does, for sure. Like you feel
*  very differently about things that you don't use.
*  It's not the same.
*  If I don't use
*  a piece of chicken, I don't feel as bad.
*  But if I don't use a piece of elk,
*  I'm like, oh my god, I feel terrible.
*  I'm always erring in the side
*  of cooking too little. Or I make
*  some so I can eat it the next day.
*  But I eat it the next day. I like to eat it
*  with
*  there's a chipotle lime mayonnaise
*  that Primal Kitchen makes.
*  It's like avocado oil
*  mayonnaise. It's got a little bit of kick to it.
*  I eat the elk in the morning with that.
*  The cold elk? Yes.
*  Cold elk with this chipotle lime mayo.
*  Oh, that's good. Oh, it's so good.
*  It's avocado oil. Super good for you.
*  Tastes delicious. That's so good.
*  And it gives you the fats too because
*  that elk's super lean. Yeah.
*  That's so good. That stuff is so good.
*  I mean, I've been living on it all during quarantine.
*  It's crazy, right? So good.
*  So good. I mean, even like when
*  I bought one steak during
*  the time from the supermarket
*  and it
*  just wasn't as good. It's like, I can't
*  even explain why.
*  It's just a different kind of meat. Yeah, it's just
*  You gotta realize, those are warriors.
*  You're eating warriors.
*  I know them.
*  I snuck up on them.
*  This is not a conjecture.
*  This is fact.
*  This isn't from a pen.
*  I was actually there while they were screaming.
*  Right. Yeah. Yeah.
*  You gotta honor that. There's not
*  a connection to it.
*  First of all, it's better for you for sure.
*  Like it feels better for you. Like god damn,
*  this is good. Yeah. And also
*  there's a connection that just doesn't exist with
*  your food in any other way.
*  Even if you grow something, growing something is great.
*  Like I've grown vegetables
*  and fruit and stuff and eaten it. It feels good
*  that you're eating something new. Yeah. Oh, 100%.
*  But when you eat a piece of elk
*  from an animal that you stalked, shot
*  with a bow and arrow, that's off the charts.
*  That connection's off the charts.
*  It's gotta be. Yeah. I mean, cause even
*  just knowing you
*  and knowing that you hunted
*  for it has an effect on
*  my eating it. You know what I mean?
*  I can show you a video of that animal getting shot.
*  You can almost be there
*  when it happened. Yeah.
*  That's different. Yeah, it's heavy. It's different.
*  It's totally different. Well, this is
*  a thing that happened during this quarantine.
*  So many people got interested in hunting.
*  Big shift.
*  Giant shift. Cause people realized
*  oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. This whole
*  food supply chain, this
*  might not be stable. That's right.
*  Like if you can't drive a truck because everybody's
*  got the zombie plague, like how the fuck
*  do I get a hamburger? Yeah. I don't get
*  a hamburger. Lookit, Wendy's is out of hamburgers.
*  You know about that? No.
*  Fucking Wendy's. Really? Fucking Wendy's.
*  They ran out of hamburgers.
*  Yeah, they don't have any beef.
*  Right. So that's not
*  everywhere and they don't want people to fucking panic
*  and they think they can solve all this.
*  And in fact, I think
*  didn't the government step in and say
*  they were going to start buying people's
*  meat and milk
*  to make sure the supply chain
*  doesn't get interrupted because of financial
*  hardship. And they want to make sure
*  these farms don't fucking go under.
*  Right, right. So we're a food, we're not growing anything.
*  We're not, where are we getting
*  our food? So there's a lot of people
*  that started thinking about hunting. A lot.
*  Isn't it funny? Like all that stuff cooking
*  at home. How about guns? The bread baking
*  at home, the hunting,
*  all those things that you had to do
*  for centuries.
*  And then only in this brief moment
*  have you not had to do any of that stuff.
*  You know what I mean? Those food chains like
*  Wendy's, like I mean that's a new thing
*  that it became that easy. And then all the
*  sudden it's back to being
*  worried about where the food comes from.
*  Like that.
*  Wendy says they have plenty of
*  burgers, but they had a small
*  problem at some stores because they
*  deliver fresh beef and they want to keep
*  it fresh. Yeah, they ran out. They ran out.
*  Wow.
*  Crazy. Nobody ever thought that would happen
*  to some Wendy's places.
*  How many stores was it where they ran out of it?
*  Some. It's all of them
*  bitch, stop lying. They ran out of beef.
*  It's really ironic because remember their commercial?
*  Where's the beef?
*  That's literally the thing they put back out.
*  Like where's the beef?
*  They're really good at Twitter. Oh, that's what they said
*  since you've been asking.
*  Well, it's because
*  that's why their burgers are delicious.
*  Like if you have a choice
*  at one o'clock in the morning,
*  that's my spot. Oh yeah? Yeah.
*  If there's nothing else open. Like I know if I go to
*  Wendy's, it's way better than most of those
*  places. I never go there.
*  It's fresh. Eating the
*  elk too,
*  what's interesting is
*  and it might be what they add to it, but like if I go to a
*  steakhouse and have a steak, I can't sleep that night.
*  Like I'm having meat sweats and it's just like
*  in your gut. Yeah, it feels weird.
*  I can eat the same amount of the elk
*  and it's
*  I think I just digest it quicker.
*  I think all that bread bacteria
*  in your stomach, it won't tolerate any
*  incoming troops from
*  other factories. You son of a bitch. You know, because you get the
*  flora. I think, you know how that
*  happens? Like if people that eat a lot of sugar
*  for instance, you eat a lot of candy,
*  your body starts craving that shit and your gut
*  flora wants candy all the time. Oh really?
*  What is that Candida? That's what it's called? That type of
*  it's one of the
*  one of the gut flora's. Right.
*  I have really good gut flora.
*  Not for steak.
*  But yeah, like if I eat a big steak at a steak, but it's
*  also tons of butter and
*  who knows what else you're eating with it.
*  But I think the elk is just lean. I think
*  it's just lean. It's very different. Yeah.
*  It has an energy to it too.
*  Yeah.
*  Deer meat does as well. Deer meat has an energy
*  to it. Yeah.
*  That's what my brother-in-law and sister
*  he in Jersey
*  from hunting. They're just living on that
*  Do you think you could ever hunt?
*  I don't know. I think
*  probably. Yeah. Yeah. You know what you should
*  try? You should try to go to
*  Lanai. Lanai. Yeah. Because
*  there's an animal there called an axis
*  deer that we hunt and it's really
*  delicious. It's also an invasive
*  species. They have way too many
*  of them. They hire snipers to
*  come in and shoot the deer. Right. It's not like
*  anything you've ever seen. Yeah. Okay. Lanai
*  has 3,000 people.
*  Super nice people. Yeah. Really cool place.
*  30,000 deer.
*  Dude. Oh my
*  God. These are just estimates. Might be 20,000.
*  Might be 30,000. They don't know. There's so
*  many, man. So does it even feel like hunting?
*  Yes. Because you, well for me, because I'm
*  doing it with a bow and arrow, it's very difficult.
*  Very difficult. But for
*  a rifle hunter, it's 100%
*  success rate. Right. 100%.
*  But you'll actually be doing good.
*  So the thing is, you can look at
*  it one way. You can say, oh is it even hunting?
*  Well what's your goal? Is your
*  goal for it to be really difficult? Or is
*  your goal to be successful in
*  gathering meat in an ethical way? Right.
*  So if your goal is just to get the meat in an ethical way, it's 100%
*  successful. Right. Because
*  it's 100% a good
*  thing to do because they have to do it anyway.
*  And the food is great for you. Yeah.
*  No, that, look, it's
*  kind of similar to golf
*  in a way. Golf is a really great game.
*  It's really, it's thoughtful.
*  There's bonding with it.
*  It's challenging. It's all that stuff.
*  And then there's a faction of it that's filled
*  with douchebags. Filled with
*  guys who you don't want to talk to.
*  You don't want to be friends with. Who are
*  just big blowhard douchebags.
*  The finance guys. Right. And there's
*  I'm sure in hunting and in everything else,
*  there's that same thing. It's people like what you just described
*  is like, I would do that in a second.
*  And then there's other people that just kind of like
*  abuse it and have like, we're throwing our beer
*  cans into the woods. There's way less of those
*  people than you would imagine. It's way more
*  people that respect it. That's good. But there's
*  also different kinds of hunting.
*  Like there's mountain
*  hunting in like Colorado
*  or Utah or
*  Wyoming or Montana.
*  That's the hardest shit. That's gorgeous though.
*  There's like a special level
*  of hunter that's like a
*  fitness fanatic. Right.
*  Backpacking. Right.
*  That's the top of the food chain
*  world. There's like the bow hunter that
*  lives off his back that goes
*  into public ground and
*  hikes nine, ten, twelve miles
*  in, shoots an elk, carries it out on his back.
*  Literally. Yeah. Takes like eight
*  trips to do. Oh my god. Those are
*  like athletes that get their food
*  from hunting. That's crazy. Yeah, those are
*  exceptional people. Yeah, I never thought of that. Like what
*  happens when you get it out of the woods?
*  See my friend Adam Greentree, he's the guy
*  who shot that buffalo up there.
*  He went to
*  Colorado. It was a, he went
*  to a couple different places. Yeah. Where he was
*  out in the woods for 28
*  days by himself
*  solo. 28 days.
*  28 days until he finally got an elk.
*  And he put it all on his Instagram. And then he
*  had to pack the elk out. But in those
*  28 days he documented everything on
*  his Instagram stories.
*  And one of them he had a fucking encounter
*  with a grizzly bear. So grizzly bear kept
*  bluff charging him. And he had a pistol
*  that had the wrong round in it.
*  So the pistol wasn't even effective. So he's pointing
*  a gun at the grizzly bear. And if you're looking at it
*  you can tell that the gun is jammed.
*  Like the bullet isn't even in the
*  it's not even in the chamber. Oh my god.
*  It has the wrong round. Oh my
*  god. So meanwhile he's pointing this like dummy
*  gun thinking he's gonna stop this bear.
*  And the bear's just running at him. And he
*  didn't even realize it until after
*  this was over that the gun didn't work.
*  He got the gun from somebody else to protect him
*  from bears when he was out there. Oh my god.
*  28 days. That's a long time.
*  But there's videos of the bears like
*  looking at him standing up. Watch this video.
*  Oh that's him?
*  That's it.
*  She comes up to the Thomas.
*  But you see how the gun's jammed? See that hole?
*  Right. See that opening? That's cause
*  the round's not in the chamber.
*  So he's getting this pistol.
*  And she's standing up in the background.
*  See her standing up? While she's gonna drop down.
*  And then you realize, oh my god that's a bear.
*  Look at that. See she drops down.
*  Oh my god. And she kept charging him.
*  Holy cow. She bluff charged
*  him three times.
*  Must have had cubs around or something.
*  Yeah. That's what he thinks. And they just
*  decide that you're a threat and sometimes
*  they follow you around too. Oh my god.
*  Where you sleeping that night?
*  He sleeps in a tent. You know what I mean?
*  You know what else they do? They put these little
*  electric fences around their tents.
*  To protect themselves. Little battery powered fences
*  that gives the bear a little jolt.
*  Yeah. They do that in grizzly country.
*  Wow.
*  Is that new? That sounds new.
*  No. They've been doing it for the last decades.
*  I wonder when they invented that.
*  It's pretty cool though. They stick it in the ground
*  and then they have a big car
*  battery that powers the whole fucking thing.
*  You get up to pee at night.
*  You piss on it. Yikes.
*  Yeah. That's a different
*  kind of connection to your food.
*  He takes it on a whole other level.
*  I don't do that. I'm not good enough to do that.
*  But there's something to all those
*  kind of, it's just being thoughtful about
*  any stage of it. Like your grandmother making the pasta.
*  That thing that she's
*  actually doing it.
*  That action.
*  It changes it. It changes her
*  relation to it. The relation that she has
*  in feeding somebody else. Yeah, for sure.
*  There's something
*  deep about that. Yeah, and there's something cool too
*  about ethnic food that comes from
*  the people that are
*  the actual immigrants themselves.
*  They brought this food over.
*  My grandparents came over here when
*  they were young. It's not like they were actually
*  driving the boat. They were
*  just kids once they got to America.
*  But they carried with them
*  the connection to the immigrants.
*  The ones who actually
*  decided they were going to take
*  their babies and get on a boat
*  and go across the ocean with
*  no job prospects. Not really sure
*  what was going to happen. Never been in the place before.
*  Didn't even have a picture of it probably.
*  Your first trip is I'm moving there.
*  How crazy is that? Yeah, fuck.
*  And you've got kids. So they came over.
*  They were young kids.
*  Both my grandparents. Yeah, mine too. Same
*  thing. Crazy. Same thing. Imagine
*  being you, if
*  you had no job prospects
*  and you had two young children
*  and you go, okay, this is what we're going to do.
*  We're going to put everybody in a boat. Yeah.
*  And then you're going to go to the other side of the planet because I heard there's jobs there.
*  Yeah. No. No kidding.
*  Please.
*  Fuck. How about the people that are just
*  walking with their kids? Just walking.
*  Just going towards something else.
*  I mean the desperation of people
*  to be in that spot.
*  Oh yeah. Well how about people before houses?
*  You still
*  have kids. You still have babies.
*  But you can't even lock them in the house because you haven't invented
*  houses yet.
*  Shit. Yeah.
*  I think we should really stop and think about the hardships
*  that other human beings have faced.
*  No, I know.
*  It makes our hardships seem so
*  trivial. And I think that's part of the problem
*  that people are saying, like, hey, yeah, this isn't
*  great, right? This pandemic
*  is not good for anybody, but
*  I don't know if you guys are handling it
*  the way I would handle it. And I don't know if you should be able
*  to tell me how I can handle it.
*  I don't know if this is
*  logical anymore. Yeah.
*  That we have to accept these hard times.
*  And we have to figure out another way to do
*  other than just standing still and waiting for it to
*  go away. Yeah. Yeah. It's
*  very strange. Because our society is
*  kind of in place standing still.
*  No. And think about how short it's been
*  that we've had to figure it out. I mean, this is
*  March, April, May
*  three months of, like, trying to figure
*  out how real the threat is
*  and what we're going to do with it. I mean, it's
*  Dude, I was driving down the street today and I saw this lady
*  walk across the street with a mask on.
*  And I was like, oh yeah. There's a
*  pandemic going on.
*  You know what I'm saying? I know. For a moment, I got
*  so used to how weird everything is.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. That I forgot. And then I see
*  this lady walking across the street. I was like, oh yeah.
*  Oh yeah. We're in the middle of that.
*  This is happening. Yeah. This is going to
*  be one of those things where we look back.
*  That's the moment where I realize
*  that life doesn't follow a pattern
*  like the movies.
*  Life is just weirdly random.
*  And sometimes you find out
*  the people that are in charge of making the decisions
*  for everybody else are no better at it
*  than you or I.
*  They just have the job of doing it.
*  Making it up as they go along. Right.
*  I know. Can you imagine if it was up to you?
*  No. If you say, hey Tom Papa,
*  you're a funny guy. Why don't you tell us
*  how we should restart the economy?
*  Yeah, right. Exactly.
*  Yeah. And one of your decisions is
*  people are going to be dying on your watch regardless
*  of which way you go. Yeah, we're going to blame you.
*  Yeah. And you're going to be blamed for it.
*  I don't envy them at all.
*  Did you see that lady who got into it with Trump?
*  No. This reporter,
*  first of all, she was asking a question with a mask on
*  which was like, settle down.
*  That's so crazy.
*  Everybody there had to have a mask on. But he didn't have a mask on.
*  And she took it off when she got mad.
*  Oh, she did? Yeah, play it.
*  Play the video. She took it off
*  when she got mad. So this is what happened.
*  She was saying,
*  why are you
*  bragging about
*  how many Americans have been
*  tested and that the United States tests
*  more people than anybody? Right.
*  When 80,000 people
*  have died, like why is this a competition
*  for you? And so he
*  says,
*  he said that you should ask
*  China. He said people are dying everywhere.
*  If you want to
*  ask someone about that, you should ask China.
*  And she says,
*  why did you say that
*  specifically to me? Because she's Asian.
*  Oh.
*  So, and then
*  he goes, thank you, next question to someone else.
*  And then this lady steps in and she
*  was going to, she was like, I
*  have a question. And then she wanted to let her
*  talk. Was going to give her
*  question to that lady. So she asked, again,
*  this is something that reporters are doing now. It's adorable.
*  The president says, next person.
*  And he goes, sir? Yes,
*  you. He goes, I'd like to give my colleague this question.
*  And then they give it back to her.
*  So the reporters are forcing him
*  to ask questions in a really sneaky way.
*  And it seems like, it seems like they're all in on it.
*  So when one of them has
*  some sort of a contentious exchange
*  with the president, the president says, next.
*  So they say, sir? Over here.
*  He goes, you. He goes, I'd like to give this question to my colleague.
*  Oh.
*  It's some crazy keep away game they're playing.
*  And, you know,
*  he goes, and she goes, why are you saying that
*  specifically to me? Because she's Asian.
*  And he goes, I'm not saying it specifically to anybody.
*  I'm just saying. You should ask China.
*  It's kind of crazy. Like, watch this.
*  The U.S. is doing
*  far better than any other country
*  when it comes to testing.
*  Why does that matter?
*  Why is this a global competition to you
*  if everyday Americans are still
*  losing their lives and we're
*  still seeing more cases every day?
*  Well, they're losing their lives
*  everywhere in the world.
*  And maybe that's a question you should ask China.
*  Don't ask me.
*  Ask China that question, okay?
*  When you ask them that question, you may get a very
*  unusual answer. Yes, behind you, please.
*  Yeah.
*  Hold on. Here it goes. Watch when she gets mad.
*  Sir, why are you saying that to me
*  specifically? I'm telling you.
*  I'm not saying it specifically to anybody.
*  I'm saying it to anybody that would ask a nasty question like that.
*  That's not a nasty question. Please go ahead.
*  Why does it matter? Okay.
*  Anybody else? Please. Go ahead.
*  Watch. Please. I have two questions.
*  No, it's okay. We'll go over here. But you pointed to me.
*  I have two questions, Mr. President. Next.
*  Please.
*  I did. And you didn't respond.
*  And now I'm calling on
*  the young lady in the back, please.
*  I just want to let my colleague finish.
*  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much.
*  They know how to do this.
*  They have this little sneaky move.
*  They've done it before. It's pretty interesting.
*  They've come up with
*  ways to deal with
*  to get around the angry substitute teacher.
*  How strange.
*  So strange to see a guy who's the president.
*  Regardless of whether or not you think he's handling anything well.
*  It's so strange to see that.
*  He's supposed to be the media guy.
*  He's supposed to be the guy that's like the savvy television performer guy.
*  To handle that poorly.
*  I don't understand why.
*  It would take so little for him to have...
*  His numbers would be through the roof.
*  But this is what happens.
*  They're playing a game.
*  And they just won that hand.
*  Because the game is
*  talk condescending to you.
*  Why is it a competition to you
*  when all these people are dying?
*  And he said people are dying all over the world.
*  If you want to know why, you should ask China.
*  That's a good answer
*  to a question that's a gotcha question.
*  But then
*  she makes it racial.
*  Because it wasn't necessarily racial.
*  He didn't come in with a hard chuh.
*  He did. China. But he does that.
*  But that's still not racist.
*  So if he was talking to a white man
*  and the white man said that to him
*  and he said you should ask China
*  he would say the same thing.
*  It's just the worst case scenario
*  that that question gets asked
*  by a lady with a mask on
*  who's Asian.
*  And then she gets mad
*  and she takes the mask off.
*  Let motherfuckers know she's not even playing by the rules anymore.
*  Are you racist?
*  It is a beehive of an environment there.
*  It does not handle...
*  I don't know if you're a racist
*  or a bad environment there.
*  I don't know if that's helping anybody.
*  To chastise him.
*  To get him riled up.
*  I don't think it's helping anybody the way he's biting.
*  It's a complete breakdown
*  of what that used to be.
*  It's not what it used to be.
*  It's this weird gotcha competition
*  and him getting pissy.
*  The fact that he stormed off like that.
*  It's a TV show.
*  We're watching a TV show.
*  We're not watching the adult telling us
*  if it's going to be okay.
*  You're so right.
*  During a pandemic, that is the worst time for some shit like that.
*  It's the worst.
*  You just want some consolidation of real information.
*  Just tell me how to feel.
*  Dude, I remember after 9-11,
*  people hated Bush.
*  They thought he was really dumb and he couldn't spell.
*  That was Dan Quayle.
*  But that was his insurance policy, right?
*  Dan Quayle was so boring.
*  People hated Bush going into that.
*  But then after 9-11,
*  there were some speeches that made
*  even people that I knew that were hardcore liberals
*  like, alright, I love this guy.
*  It's a moment when you rally.
*  He really rose to the occasion, too.
*  George Bush, after 9-11,
*  he gave people a sense of comfort.
*  That's right.
*  You see people craving it.
*  We're craving it.
*  That's why when Cuomo and Newsom speak,
*  and they just give you reassuring,
*  very controlled,
*  people gravitate.
*  You're just like, okay, you just want to hear that.
*  Giuliani was the same way after 9-11.
*  It was like, okay, you're making me feel better.
*  That made Giuliani's reputation
*  the way he handled it.
*  100%.
*  Like a leader.
*  100%.
*  You don't pit people against each other in a tragedy.
*  But it's unfortunate that he can't see that.
*  And he keeps getting caught.
*  It's like he's boxing with someone who's piecing him up.
*  These things keep happening.
*  So he keeps having these exchanges
*  where these heated exchanges and words get said.
*  It's bizarre.
*  It's really strange.
*  The last one was the one where he went off the fucking script
*  where he was talking about therapies.
*  Maybe we could get some disinfection.
*  It kills it in a minute.
*  A cleansing.
*  You see the woman next to it.
*  Her eyes coming out of her head.
*  She's taking deep breaths so she doesn't pass out
*  in the middle of it.
*  She was like, holy fuck.
*  So then after that, he responds that
*  he was sarcastic.
*  The reporter's asking me, he said he was sarcastic.
*  He should have said, look, I'm not a doctor.
*  This is just an idea.
*  Because that's really what it was.
*  It was like, I might have done that on a podcast.
*  I'd have to be drunk.
*  You'd have to be out of your mind.
*  I've never seen you smoke that much weed.
*  I could get there if you leave me alone long enough.
*  I'll say something that dumb.
*  I've said the dumbest shit of my life on this podcast.
*  Not that high.
*  But here's the thing, what came out of it, which is really fascinating.
*  There was an actual publicly traded biotech company
*  that came up with an idea
*  to get, when in intubated people,
*  to get an ultraviolet light tube
*  down through that
*  into the lungs.
*  And illuminate.
*  Because using ultraviolet light, you can kill bacteria.
*  You can kill viruses.
*  And that's one of the reasons why they have those things like
*  stereo pens where you go backpacking.
*  You can get some water out of a creek.
*  And you just use this ultraviolet light.
*  It kills everything inside that water.
*  So they actually had this biotech company,
*  publicly traded company,
*  put out this video on how this can be done.
*  Well, their account was banned from Twitter.
*  Oh really? Is it a real company?
*  Yes, it's a real company.
*  And they let them back eventually.
*  But this is how toxic this relationship with the president is.
*  Where the president says something on TV.
*  And then people go,
*  what the fuck did you say?
*  Get light into people?
*  And then this publicly traded biotech company is like,
*  I've already been working on that.
*  And this is the concept. And this is the science behind it.
*  Because UV light kills bacteria.
*  Fuck you, you're banned.
*  They banned them.
*  They banned a biotech company from Twitter.
*  Now they brought them back once it was explained to them.
*  But any other time in history,
*  like say if this was going on 10 years ago,
*  and there was a virus,
*  and the virus is infecting people's respiratory systems,
*  and someone said, while these people are being intubated,
*  we can actually stick a light
*  through the same tube that the ventilator uses,
*  and will illuminate the lungs,
*  and we could actually probably kill a good deal of this bacteria.
*  People are like, oh, medical breakthrough.
*  Right.
*  But you've had a complete disintegration, right?
*  That's the result of a breakdown.
*  And that's what's been so,
*  that's why it doesn't work in communist countries.
*  Like you can't trust the source for your information.
*  That's what we're at in a democracy.
*  No one can trust the source.
*  We're all scrambling, like,
*  does this one know? Does this one know?
*  But it's a direct result of his toxic relationship with the press.
*  Yes.
*  Because people who are with him are so with him,
*  and people who are against him are so against him.
*  And it's almost like people with him,
*  part of the reason why they're with him is because they're so against all these other fucking whiny, bitchy, liberal people that fucking,
*  that size is so annoying,
*  I'm going with Trump, he tells them to fuck off,
*  that's my favorite part.
*  Right, he makes those people angry.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a terrible relationship.
*  It's bad for everybody.
*  At any moment we should be uniting and taking care of each other, it's now.
*  It could make a big difference to us.
*  Huge difference.
*  Because it's like, if someone could get on television,
*  and come up with something that was not just comforting,
*  but actually accurate,
*  and useful.
*  Give us something to do.
*  Tell us what to do.
*  And if we could all act as one for the good of the country,
*  we would come out of this stronger,
*  better, ready to go.
*  Because we always, our whole life,
*  we grew up thinking, we're Americans, we can do anything.
*  We can do it.
*  Just give us a challenge, we can do it.
*  And to now have this breakdown, like, no, it's,
*  we're split apart, and doing separate things.
*  Not only that, it's the only time
*  in people's lives where
*  things are failing, businesses are failing,
*  and they did everything right.
*  They did all the right things.
*  Right, working hard, doing the thing,
*  busting ass.
*  They were smart, they saved their money,
*  they invested, they got a thing going,
*  it's getting going, and we got a successful business.
*  We developed a great relationship in the community,
*  and then shut down for months.
*  No.
*  Rents piling up, no one's getting paid,
*  your mortgage is due, your car payments due,
*  your credit cards are due, you gotta buy food,
*  fuck, and you see how quick
*  that goes away.
*  So when you hear shit like, stay at home until July,
*  fuck you.
*  Fuck you. You can't just say that.
*  No, you can't just say that. Well, I think it's from
*  a healthcare person who's
*  making the suggestion, but I think the
*  right decision is not the right decision.
*  There's other options. I think a better option is
*  quarantining the people that are sick.
*  I don't know if that's possible,
*  because I'm a moron, and I just talk on podcasts.
*  Sounds good to me.
*  But I think it's not even my idea, it's an idea that everybody's had.
*  A lot of people have had.
*  If you're really vulnerable, don't go.
*  If you've got a bad knee, you don't get to ski.
*  It's true.
*  We'll be alright, Joe.
*  We're gonna be okay.
*  We better be, Tom Papa.
*  I know, me too.
*  I can't wait to be walking into the
*  club, seeing you in the back,
*  hearing the crowd out front.
*  All that energy.
*  Looking forward to a lot of things.
*  Me too. Looking forward to a lot of things.
*  I'm looking forward to not feeling bad.
*  Not about me,
*  not at all.
*  About seeing all these stories.
*  I was reading this guy's Twitter page,
*  this Jiu Jitsu guy that I follow,
*  and there's this lady who owns this
*  gym.
*  It's Tom DeBlas.
*  T-O-M-D-E-B-L-A-S-S.
*  He,
*  on his Instagram, he had this
*  photos of this lady crying.
*  Because her gym is going under.
*  And this gym that she's had for ten years.
*  And that they can't survive it.
*  And so you see shit like that, and you're like
*  this is another example. Someone who didn't do
*  anything wrong.
*  And then all their hard work just goes away.
*  This is the lady. It's horrible.
*  It's terrible. It's horrible.
*  I know.
*  She'll rally.
*  She's motivated. If she can build that business, she'll be back.
*  Ironside Fitness Gym.
*  She can do it.
*  She'll go into personal training.
*  Yeah, see at the bottom if you can find that
*  Ironside. What is the
*  Instagram account?
*  It's not? He didn't tag it?
*  Well, I don't know where that is.
*  I think he's a Jersey guy.
*  Fuck, man.
*  Yeah, I know.
*  Just that kind of shit. I know. Let's get out of this already.
*  And then of course the people that lost their lives.
*  That's way worse. Of course.
*  Of course it's way worse. No one's saying it's not.
*  But this is fucking sad too, man.
*  Sad that people build up
*  these incredible communities. They build up
*  this relationship with their customers.
*  And with
*  the people around them. And then it all goes away.
*  Yeah, no, it's brutal.
*  I know, it's hard. From China.
*  China. All because of
*  China. Ask damn it. Just turn down
*  the cha. What bad luck he got that
*  lady was Asian.
*  If she said that,
*  if he was talking to anyone
*  else, and they said that
*  they wouldn't be able to say
*  Why me? Why are you saying that specifically
*  to me? Yeah, yeah.
*  Like if it was a black
*  man asking her that question
*  or asking him that question.
*  Why are you asking China? Why are you
*  saying that specifically to me? She pulls the mask down.
*  Why to me? Oh, no.
*  I know. And also she's
*  like yelling with no mask on
*  now. Like you're violating all
*  the rules. You can't
*  just get mad. Like fuck everybody. You're
*  gonna die. Yeah.
*  God. Spray her.
*  The worst. Virus
*  breath everywhere. Horrible environment.
*  What for him, man? He must be like, I can't win.
*  All I did in my life is win.
*  Win, win, win, win, win. Rappers
*  used to put me in their songs. When he
*  came out and talked about the ratings that he was getting off of these.
*  Oh my god. It was just like, alright, I'm not
*  I can't. He said the ratings were
*  higher than the season final of
*  The Bachelor. Like what the fuck are you talking about?
*  That's when I was like, this is not real.
*  What are you talking about? This can't be real.
*  What are you thinking?
*  This can't be real. Yeah. So crazy.
*  That's the opposite of what we're saying George
*  Bush did after 9-11. Right.
*  Rally. Yeah. Be a leader. That's
*  what leadership is. Say something that
*  makes you get inspired.
*  Ronald Reagan was the best at that shit, man.
*  Oh yeah, just rally you. You made you feel like
*  oh we can do it. We can do anything.
*  Before people hated him, they didn't
*  hate him really until like his second term though, right?
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  By the end, people were really mad at him.
*  Well, parts of the country always
*  disliked him. If you were poor,
*  you were a minority, he was never
*  a fan. But
*  But he would give a speech.
*  Yeah. Oh man.
*  With a powerful voice. He was an actor. He was an
*  actor. He's a reality
*  shit stirrer.
*  That's what those, right? That's what reality
*  stars are. They stir shit up. Right.
*  Reagan was an actor. He
*  could give you the big monologue.
*  Yeah. Yeah. It's a difference.
*  Do you remember when he's, I don't know if you ever saw this,
*  but he was addressing the United Nations
*  and he was talking about how quickly
*  we would all join together if we were faced
*  with a force from outside this world.
*  Right. Yeah. It's crazy
*  speech. Yeah. Because all the UFO people
*  went nuts. He knows. He fucking
*  knows. Right.
*  It's a great speech though. Yeah. Because it's true.
*  Yeah. It's true. Like we would realize
*  all our differences are bullshit.
*  If aliens had invaded us, we
*  would all unite as human beings. Right.
*  That's what's weird about this.
*  Like you could kind of have that moment now. Yes.
*  Exactly. That's why I brought it up. Yeah.
*  That's, someone could say
*  that. We need to unite.
*  Yeah. Someone could say. This is us.
*  But they have to say it in a way. People of planet Earth.
*  It can't be self-congratulatory.
*  Not at all. You take yourself out of it.
*  But he does too much of that. You put it in
*  the power of the people you're talking to. That's
*  the technique. But imagine being him where
*  your whole life you've gotten ahead
*  because you're self-congratulatory.
*  But that's his whole thing. Yeah.
*  That's his whole thing. It always works. His whole thing is just
*  letting everybody know you're the shit. Yeah.
*  Right. Then all of a sudden you can't do that anymore.
*  How much can you make an adjustment in your 70s?
*  Yeah. While you're the president.
*  And you have to make an adjustment and be someone who
*  you've never been. All of a sudden you're not the shit.
*  Can you shit? Yeah. You can't even say you're the shit.
*  No. What a terrible job.
*  So awful.
*  I'd much rather be a comedian.
*  Or you'd much
*  rather be publishing.
*  Tom Popper, you're doing great. It's available now
*  everywhere. Audiobook available
*  now everywhere as well. Yeah. Audiobook too. For sure.
*  Thanks for your writing the blurb.
*  Other reasons to stay alive. My pleasure, brother.
*  Thanks for the bread. I appreciate you. Always.
*  Have to come out on the podcast. Yes.
*  I'll do it. Teach me your ways. Breaking bread, baby.
*  Wizard bread making.
*  And where's the podcast available?
*  Wherever your podcasts are available
*  or wherever you get them.
*  Visual as well. On YouTube. Yeah.
*  Me and Segura do the first one together.
*  Beautiful. Beautiful. And it was really great.
*  He told all these great stories about his
*  grandmother making all of, his mom making
*  all these sweets. I'm telling you
*  just once you start talking about food we'll have to talk more
*  about your grandparents and everything. Yes. We'll do it. For sure.
*  I love you, buddy. You're the best. Love you too.
*  Bye, everybody.
*  So good.
*  That was fun.
*  Really good.
