# Joe Rogan Experience #2120 - That Mexican OT
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [March 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpV18GUn7A)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day.
*  Tell me the story of the pig with the seven wolves.
*  Yeah, well seven coyotes, yeah. I think it was nine. I think it was nine coyotes.
*  Damn.
*  That's a crazy story.
*  I feel like I'm looking at you on my phone right now. It's crazy.
*  Are we rolling?
*  Yeah.
*  It's hilarious. Yeah, it's weird when you meet people when you see them.
*  Me too with you. I've only seen you on YouTube.
*  I've seen you on my phone.
*  Right? It's cool, man. It's a pleasure, bro.
*  Pleasure to meet you too, man.
*  Bro, you're like, you're a bad motherfucker, bro.
*  First of all, to me, my dad was like my god, you know what I'm saying?
*  So to see him glorify you and stroke your ego, bro, it's just cool.
*  That's cool. I'd like to meet your dad.
*  Yeah, you just met him.
*  Oh, that was your dad?
*  Yeah, the swole man skin.
*  Oh, no shit. Oh, your dad's cool as fuck.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  That's awesome, man. That's awesome. Beautiful. Yeah, looks good, man.
*  Yeah, my whole life he's been like that.
*  He looks good.
*  I remember I'd get in trouble and he would punish me with workouts.
*  Oh, really?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Oh, wow.
*  I've been fit my whole life. I started getting fat when I touched that rapper money.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, really.
*  It's hard, right?
*  Yeah, yeah. I'd go out to eat and I was like, because I'm already indecisive,
*  so I'd go out to eat and order like five things and just eat small off each plate.
*  Well, that's a problem when you first start getting money, right?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  You just get indulgent.
*  Yeah, I'm chilling now, though, you know what I'm saying?
*  But definitely at first it was like...
*  When I was 25, I got a development deal and I was spending so much money,
*  my manager called me up. He thought I had a gambling problem.
*  Oh, shit.
*  He was like, do you have a gambling problem? I'm like, no, I'm eating steak and lobster every night.
*  I was just going to say, bro, like it goes to food, right?
*  I feel like, because I ain't bought jewelry or nothing like that.
*  Nothing?
*  Nothing.
*  I seen the grill.
*  I mean, yeah, but like I had a grill before I was anybody.
*  And then my second grill, Paul Wall gave to me.
*  Oh, that's cool.
*  Yeah, so...
*  Paul Wall's the man.
*  Yeah, shout out to Paul Wallachin.
*  It was just his birthday a few days ago, too.
*  Oh, yeah? That dude, he looks like a real estate agent.
*  With the come over?
*  Yeah, when he's got this crazy grill.
*  Yeah, nah, he's cool as shit, though.
*  He's cool as shit.
*  He's a nice person. I was smoking with him and I handed him the joint and he was like, thank you.
*  I was like, you're telling me thank you for your next rotation, you know?
*  But he's just a sweet dude, you know?
*  That's nice.
*  Yeah, he's cool.
*  I've seen him in interviews. I love to talk to that dude.
*  I've seen him in interviews. He always seems cool as fuck.
*  I'm just real happy.
*  If you're down, I'd love to connect you up.
*  Yeah, let's do it.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  Shout out to Paul, man.
*  I found out about you from Tony Hinchcliffe.
*  My friend Tony Hinchcliffe, he's like, yo, you gotta listen to this.
*  And he puts it on. He's a comedian.
*  And he put it on in the green room with the mothership.
*  He put Cowboy Killer.
*  I was like, oh shit, this is good, man.
*  Now it's in our Spotify rotation.
*  Thank you so much.
*  Cowboy Killer was a fun one to write.
*  I was in the Verizon with Columbia.
*  My buddy Nate was like, he was like, just do something different.
*  He was like, make a country song.
*  And I just played a country rap beat.
*  And from there, it just went crazy.
*  Yeah, dude, we find ourselves walking around the green room sometimes going, lately I've been fucking.
*  I just did that one at the rodeo.
*  I mean, at the rodeo, they went stupid.
*  Oh, I bet.
*  Yeah, that's one of the ones they go crazy for when I perform.
*  I feel like maybe just because it's easier to sing along to a lot of my stuff.
*  They don't even understand what I'm saying.
*  They just sound good.
*  Right, right, right.
*  Yeah, no, that one's a good one to sing along to.
*  It's also just fun.
*  Yeah, definitely.
*  It's a fun song.
*  You're having a good fucking time.
*  Definitely, man.
*  And I'm glad you said that because that's what I try to give out.
*  This next project I'm working on, I want to call it Recess.
*  And I want to call it Recess because at this point, bro, I don't have walls.
*  I don't have boundaries.
*  I don't have an ego that's holding me down to one sound or anything like that.
*  This is recess to me.
*  So therefore, I can go to the monkey bars and dominate.
*  Then I can go to the jungle gym and then I can go to the swings and have fun everywhere.
*  So it sounds like I'm having fun.
*  That's great.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a blessing, bro.
*  Man, I would have never thought I'd be here.
*  I thank God every day, bro, because I used to be on acid laid out in the middle of the street.
*  And I wasn't doing acid the way y'all do acid.
*  I feel like some people do drugs and they do it to better, to learn.
*  I was strictly abusing this shit.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  I just wanted to be fucking thick in the dirt high.
*  And it's just beautiful, bro.
*  I tell people all the time, God's going to have an amazing talk with y'all because y'all don't even understand.
*  Y'all saved somebody's life and you don't even know it because it's just pure enjoyment to you.
*  But bro, God watches that, man.
*  And I promise all my fans, God going to have a good talk with them because they spoil me.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  They make me feel good, bro.
*  I love my fans, dog.
*  They pay attention to the smallest shit ever.
*  I was in California.
*  I did a show in LA and this girl brought a shirt and she had a mural of my mom with her headstone on it.
*  It said when she passed her birthday, her name, my name, my little brother's name.
*  And I was like, damn, like, shit's just cool, bro.
*  Because my mother gave me my first rap name, V-Man, and I've been rapping since I was four years old.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  So it's just cool.
*  My mama was a gangster.
*  I was talking to Fat Boy a few days ago in Bay City and Fat Boy, he's like, oh my God, Virgil, I love you.
*  So me and Sophie, we were best friends.
*  And he was like, yo, mama taught me how to cook hard.
*  Just going on and on.
*  Mama was walking around Bay City like, where my money at?
*  We were just savage.
*  We were short.
*  She was a little pocket rocket.
*  Short with so much power.
*  And she was beautiful, man.
*  Everybody loved her.
*  I feel like it was hard with the family with her.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  I grew up watching my mother and her mother fistfight in the living room.
*  Oh, wow.
*  Yeah, but that's why sometimes when people be like, oh yeah, this for Sophie, or Sophie this, or Sophie that,
*  I'm like, man, none of you motherfuckers, all y'all traded her.
*  All y'all turned y'alls back on her.
*  There were some people that were supposed to fight for me in court when my mother died because they knew.
*  But they didn't, you know what I'm saying?
*  They backed out.
*  Fight for you in court? Like how?
*  So when my mother passed away, my mama was already planning on giving me to my nanny, which is my dad's mother.
*  And the reason why she was going to give me to her is because he was getting out of prison.
*  And my mama was gangster, cooking crack and selling this shit.
*  People fucked up in our house, you know what I'm saying?
*  So she knew she was already fucking up and probably going to go to jail.
*  And I was just bad.
*  I was a badass little kid.
*  I was in first grade and not coming home until 10 o'clock at night already.
*  Wow.
*  And she would just be, I remember her crying and she'd just be like, I can't take care of them.
*  It's Irma.
*  I don't know what to do with them, all this and that.
*  And some of my people knew that was on my mother's side.
*  They knew about this.
*  And they knew that she wanted to give me to Irma.
*  They knew all this.
*  And they knew that Sophie didn't want me to be with my mama's side because it really wasn't too much guidance.
*  She knew that I would almost be fucked over there.
*  I'm not saying that they don't love me because they definitely love me.
*  It's just they just weren't heavy handed on the rules and shit.
*  How old were you at the time?
*  When my mama passed?
*  When my mama passed?
*  I was eight.
*  But I was already grown.
*  I was already grown.
*  And so when I hear those people, oh yeah, Sophie this and that, I'm like, man, fuck you.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Because y'all left my mama out there dry for real.
*  Like everybody in my family left my mama dry like that.
*  Like my mama, she was close with Sabrina, my dear Sabrina.
*  I know that for sure, but that's because we all lived together.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  I know my dear Sabrina and my cousin Homer too.
*  My cousin Homer was close with my mama.
*  I never seen my mother respect any other woman except for my nanny and maybe my stepmama.
*  My mama used to take me to my stepmama.
*  We would meet halfway and my stepmama would take me to go see my dad in prison.
*  And I used to be rapping through them through a glass on the phone.
*  Really?
*  Yeah. I used to be rapping on the radio and he'd be like, fuck that radio.
*  I want to hear what you got to say.
*  Wow.
*  I'd be doing my push-ups, my sit-ups.
*  Dad, look at me. Check me out.
*  I'd hit the jumping jacks out and this and that.
*  I'd knuckle him and we would twist it.
*  He would say, lock it up.
*  He'd get him dappin' and he'd say, lock it up.
*  You know?
*  And I would just tell him, every time I'd go visit him, he would always ask for a sprite and some Kit Kats.
*  I used to go to get the coins and take them to the guards.
*  I'd be like, man, that's all I got, but let me take my daddy home.
*  You know?
*  And he did a long time.
*  He did about six years in there.
*  He learned a lot.
*  He'd tell me all the time that prison taught him how to be a political person and a politician.
*  How so?
*  You know?
*  Because you have to follow other rules in there now.
*  Let's say me and you got problems.
*  I got to go to whoever your leader is or somebody, what's going on in your situation and be like, say, bro, I can't just go over there.
*  Because I'm going to start a race war or some shit.
*  Everything has a reaction.
*  You just got to have permission from your hires.
*  I don't know too much about it.
*  I ain't ever been to prison and things like that, but I know a little bit from what's just being around.
*  That's a crazy statement when you're an eight-year-old.
*  You were grown.
*  Yeah, I was already grown.
*  I looked at a picture.
*  I seen a picture of me holding this basketball when I was a kid.
*  And I remember holding this basketball.
*  It grew in the dark.
*  And I remember playing with it.
*  I remember being with it, holding it and just seeing it around the house.
*  And I look at a picture of myself holding it and I was like, damn.
*  I look like I was a child, not even a kid, like a baby still.
*  And I was already feeling, I was already looking at my teachers like, bitch, I don't know what fucking is, but I will fuck you.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  For real.
*  I was already watching Hustle & Flow, Scarface.
*  Because my parents were still kids.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  So I just got to be a kid with them.
*  How old was your mom when you were born?
*  I think she was like 18.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah, that's what happens.
*  Yep, yep, yep.
*  I remember watching Scarface all the time with my mama and every single time before she died, she'd be like, Tony, turn around, Tony.
*  Like, this is going to change something.
*  I remember that was a movie that made her cry.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  Wow, she's rooting for Scarface.
*  Yeah, she cried when Tony died.
*  She was fucked up about that shit.
*  That's hilarious.
*  She cried when Tony died.
*  I remember it was me, SB, Quincy, and I feel like Romeo.
*  Romeo was definitely there because he was living with us.
*  And Keelan might have been alive.
*  Yeah, he was because Joseph was definitely alive.
*  These are all my cousins.
*  Like, I never needed friends because I always had siblings.
*  And I was the oldest of all of them.
*  So like, man, I'm making a palette.
*  I got all of us sleeping in the living room together.
*  And you know, like I said, my parents were still kids.
*  So they out doing kids stuff at the club, party, and all this and that.
*  So while they're doing that, I'm playing Scarface and all this other shit, you know?
*  But I remember we were sleeping in bed one time, and my mother comes in and she wake SB up.
*  SB, we whupped those bitches' asses.
*  All this and that.
*  We got them.
*  We got them.
*  Like, my mama just got into a bar fight with somebody and came home talking about, yeah, we whupped them bitches' asses.
*  I remember smelling the cold night on her.
*  Does that make sense?
*  A cold night.
*  Like, you ever, like it's cold at night and then you're inside and then somebody come in and it's like you can feel the cold on them.
*  And like, smell it and shit.
*  Like, I don't know how to explain it.
*  I just felt the cold come off of her body and I smelled her.
*  And I always knew she was around because I heard high heels.
*  Like, when she would pick me up from daycare, I always knew it was my mama because she was the only one coming in high heels.
*  You know?
*  And yeah, my mama, she was just crazy.
*  Her name was Sophia Gasca.
*  Sophia and Gasca.
*  Wow.
*  What a crazy way to grow up.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, look, it's definitely worse.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  It's not even crazy.
*  It's just we was just living.
*  Like, I remember I wasn't even sitting in car seats.
*  Like, my mother would be driving holding my little baby brother and I'd be standing in the passenger seat with my arm on the seat like this.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  Just living, like, you know.
*  This is wild.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a good way to develop a rapper.
*  Correct.
*  My mama, so boys would come around and they'd be like, you know what I'm saying?
*  My mama would always tell them, Sophie, I'm going to be, my son going to be a rapper.
*  You know, they'd be, Sophie, all right, Sophie.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  No, my son going to be a rapper.
*  I was failing every class in the first grade and my aunt Rosario told me this story.
*  My aunt Rosario was, she's not my aunt, but like, we were very close.
*  So like, they're family.
*  Right.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  That type of shit.
*  She was actually in the car with my mother when she passed and she, you know, they were
*  tight, man.
*  And she told me that I was failing every class in the first grade and her and her friends
*  were like, Sophie, he failing in the first grade?
*  Like, what the fuck going on?
*  He's failing.
*  Stop.
*  You know?
*  And she was like, fuck that school.
*  My son going to be a rapper.
*  My dad would wake me up before school at like four or five o'clock in the morning when I
*  was in the seventh grade.
*  And he'd wake me up.
*  He'd be like, son, you ready to whoop ass?
*  I'd be like, man, I got to get ready for school.
*  And he's like, fuck school.
*  You ready to get down there and whoop ass?
*  And he wasn't saying fuck school because like, you know what I'm saying?
*  Because he always pressed like being good and getting knowledge, you know what I'm saying?
*  But like, he knew I didn't give a fuck.
*  He knew I was just saying that.
*  So he's like, in his mind, he's like, motherfucker, you going to get up and come down here and
*  rap, you know?
*  Because he would party every night and he had the shit that people wanted.
*  And women wanted to be with him and men wanted to be him.
*  So every night after they get done partying, Monday through Sunday, he would always bring
*  the party back home and he would have me a house full of women, women sitting on the
*  fucking stairs lined up, one sitting on the refrigerator.
*  We had two.
*  I had a master of it.
*  He was mixed with Presque Canaria.
*  I think I said that right.
*  His name was Bronson, like Charles Bronson.
*  He was Brendo and his eyes were orange lit up.
*  Orange.
*  Oh, just a beast.
*  And I could see the house and we were living in a duplex.
*  So then it looked like it's even more crowded, you know?
*  And my dad would play like a ghetto boys beat, which is like five minutes fucking long, if
*  you don't know.
*  So I'm about two, three minutes in and he's like, the fuck you slowing down for?
*  The beat ain't over.
*  And I had to jump back on and not eat these grown ass men alive.
*  Alive.
*  And how were you writing your raps back then?
*  Were you writing them in your head or were you writing them down?
*  No, everything was on a pad.
*  I had everything in notebooks.
*  I was supposed to be taking notes in school and I'm writing.
*  You know?
*  I didn't do anything else except for write, draw or read.
*  So from the beginning, that's what you wanted?
*  It's not what I wanted.
*  It's not what I wanted.
*  It's what my mama wanted.
*  I don't even think I still know what I want to this day.
*  Really?
*  I think what I just want to be okay.
*  I don't even give a fuck about this money, the fame.
*  I don't give a fuck about.
*  I love the music because I mean, I'm blessed and I'm grateful for it.
*  I cherish it because like it's my living and I'm comfortable off of it.
*  This is what my mama wanted.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  So to this day, you're not sure that that's what you wanted?
*  I don't think it is.
*  I think what I want is just love.
*  I missed out on a lot of love.
*  I want a family.
*  I just want to be okay.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  I just want a simple life.
*  I think that happens to a lot of people when they get pushed into something at a really young age.
*  You hear that with a lot of athletes, a lot of young fighters, a lot of young football players.
*  They're just like, I never knew what I wanted to do.
*  They told me what I wanted to do.
*  Right.
*  You know?
*  And then here I am successful.
*  I guess this is all right, but am I even me?
*  Yeah.
*  I'm a product.
*  Correct.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm definitely me.
*  But this was definitely for my mama.
*  Well, it worked out.
*  Yeah, definitely.
*  I'm thinking how happy she would be right now.
*  Man, bro.
*  And that's one thing I've always, I just want to see her jam my music.
*  Because I remember being in the backseat watching her jam Ashanti and Ja Rule.
*  And I remember her body language.
*  I remember seeing her move.
*  I remember her beautiful smile when she would sing.
*  And I'm like, damn, I wish I could see her sing my music.
*  You know?
*  Wow.
*  I know she would.
*  And I ain't no bullshit.
*  Like everything I'm talking about solid.
*  So like I know she would feel it even more.
*  Like damn, my son gangster.
*  You know?
*  That's awesome.
*  Yeah.
*  I know she would love it, bro.
*  Well, that's a beautiful thing, though.
*  Yeah.
*  It's kind of amazing.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, you think about how many people you touch and inspire and how many people love
*  your music, how many people you excite.
*  Correct.
*  You know, I mean, you excite people.
*  Those songs come on, people get excited.
*  Correct.
*  She would be very happy with that.
*  Yeah, no, it's a blessing, man.
*  And my father, he tells me all the time, like, man, this shit started in the kitchen.
*  Right before I walked onto the rodeo stage, he said, son, you're still in the kitchen.
*  Wow.
*  And I was like, I know.
*  That's cool.
*  Yeah.
*  You're in the kitchen, but now there's millions of people in it.
*  Yeah.
*  Isn't that wild?
*  Yeah, no, it's beautiful, man.
*  How old are you?
*  I just turned 25, February 6th.
*  Damn, you're just a baby.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm a little bit older than you.
*  I'm a little bit older than you.
*  I'm a little bit older than you.
*  I just turned 25, February 6th.
*  Damn, you're just a baby.
*  Yeah.
*  Just a young man.
*  I'm trying.
*  We getting there.
*  That's amazing.
*  Yep, yep, yep.
*  When did things really start popping for you?
*  I would definitely, I don't know, because I feel like every time I drop something, I
*  always had good motion.
*  Like, I dropped a music video called Plan C in like 2018, 2019, which is a lot, but
*  it's not a lot.
*  And it hit like 30K and got stuck.
*  Now it's at like 40K.
*  It might be at more now.
*  I think it took it a while, but it was like at 40K and got stuck, which is, like I said,
*  a lot, but not a lot.
*  But I'm from the country, and I'm just a kid in the country.
*  Slash the hood.
*  I didn't really want no promo, no nothing.
*  Like, I just made a video and I'm doing music because my uncle's got a studio in the house.
*  So of course I'm going to be doing music.
*  I'm fucked up on drugs.
*  I don't want no job.
*  I don't want to be around nobody.
*  I'm going to do this.
*  And then one day, my cousin, he had a homeboy and he heard the song.
*  He was like, bro, I want to jump on it.
*  Let me jump on it.
*  So I was like, fuck it.
*  You know, jump on it.
*  And then he was like, man, I got a homeboy.
*  I got a buddy.
*  He be shooting videos.
*  I was like, shit, fuck it.
*  What else is there to do?
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  And we shot the video.
*  We're all doing this just for the fun of it.
*  Like there's nothing else to do.
*  And just dropped it and it went good.
*  Then I dropped another song called La Muerte, maybe about two years after that.
*  And when I dropped La Muerte, that's when I was like, all right.
*  I think it was like 2021, maybe 2020.
*  That's when I was like, yeah, like I could do something with this because I'm not rapping
*  no more.
*  I'm actually making songs.
*  There's a difference between rapping and making music.
*  And I think when I wrote La Muerte, that's when I was like, yeah, I think I could do it.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  So then.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  La Muerte.
*  That's right there.
*  That's my grandma's house and my grandpa's house right in the back.
*  That's out of country.
*  And how old are we in this?
*  When did this video drop?
*  Three years ago.
*  Oh, OK.
*  No, I reposted it on there.
*  So it's about five years ago.
*  I was maybe like 20 right there.
*  20 sound right.
*  So you, your whole life, you've been on this path.
*  Yeah, correct.
*  And you want to know what's crazy?
*  Some people that I talked to like back then in the country and they like, bro, like I've
*  always looked at you as a rapper, even kids in school, like people at school that I talked
*  to like, man, like you just always had a rapper.
*  Like I've always just looked at you as a rapper.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Even in kids at school like, oh yeah, he the rapper.
*  You know, like, bro, I was in I was in Miss Terry's class in eighth grade and everybody's
*  getting certificates in school.
*  And, you know, my buddy, Brand, he's like most likely to go in the UFC, most likely
*  to wear a red button up shirt, most likely.
*  And everybody's getting this stuff.
*  And mine's was most likely to be a rapper.
*  So like everything was just like surrounded by it.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Correct.
*  Yeah.
*  I remember being at school, rapping at lunch, having the teachers and the kids surrounding
*  me.
*  The bells ringing.
*  We supposed to go to the next class and we still going headstrong.
*  Wow.
*  You know?
*  Like I've always just had a crowd.
*  I've always been the center of attention.
*  I remember my nanny would take me to Pallie Royale, go school shopping when I was like
*  eighth grade.
*  I mean, eight years old, nine years old, 10 years old.
*  And I'm rapping to the people in Pallie Royale.
*  You know?
*  There was a car show.
*  My mother had just passed.
*  I was probably like nine years old.
*  My cousin Daniel took me to this car show.
*  Slim Thug, Z-Raw, and Paul Wall and them were on stage performing.
*  And while they're on stage performing, you know, the car show's gone over here and then
*  they got a bunch of vendors in their pop ups.
*  And this one dude has a microphone at his pop up.
*  He's trying to sell shit.
*  Oh, this and that.
*  Yeah.
*  Woo woo woo.
*  And I ended up grabbing his mic and I started rapping to Z-Raw and them performing live
*  on stage.
*  I don't even think they know this though.
*  I've never even told them that shit.
*  But yeah, bro, I was rapping to Paul Wall, Slim Thug, and Z-Raw on stage live while I
*  was probably like nine years old.
*  Wow.
*  You know?
*  I'm seeing all these women, you know what I'm saying, wearing booty shorts and these
*  crop tops.
*  And I'm seeing all these dudes and they just look clean with the chains.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  I'm like, damn, like I'm in here.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  At nine.
*  Yeah, this shit was cool.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  What were your first influences musically?
*  Definitely whatever my mama was jamming.
*  She was jamming at Ashanti and Ja Rule.
*  My dad was jamming everything.
*  My dad was jamming like fucking All Springs, fucking Tool.
*  He was jamming 3 Day Grace, fucking all that shit.
*  Oh, just mix it up.
*  Yeah.
*  And then on my mama's side of the family, they all gangsters and like chola, so it was
*  like gangsta rap music and then like some Latino music.
*  And then my mom, my dad's side of the family, they're all cowboys, so I'm jamming country
*  and shit like that.
*  Then I go with my dad and he's jamming rock and all this extra shit.
*  So like I just got to, and then once I got older and started discovering music on my
*  own, you know what I'm saying?
*  I've already like rock and rap to Latino music to country, so like how farther can I go with
*  this?
*  And now my taste in music is just all, I'll jam music.
*  I don't even know the language too, but if I feel it, I feel it.
*  Yeah.
*  I feel it.
*  I think that's why it's easy for me to just jump in any genre and dominate, because I can
*  feel it and put me in it.
*  Right.
*  You don't have a restriction in your head of what you can do.
*  Correct.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, that's Cowboy Killer.
*  Correct.
*  And that's, I think that's one of the reasons why I resonate with so many people, because
*  it's just, it's fun and it's like, what is this guy doing here, man?
*  But it don't sound forced either.
*  It also doesn't sound like anybody else.
*  Like you don't sound like anybody else.
*  I mean, you never hear, people, I play that and people go, who the fuck is that?
*  Yeah.
*  Like they get interested.
*  Like this is different.
*  Thank you.
*  It's beautiful when something comes along that just resonates like that, that like you could,
*  you know, there's so many influences out there.
*  So when someone comes along, you're like, wow, that's a different vibe.
*  Stevie was definitely my influences for like music like Cowboy Killer.
*  Yeah.
*  Yes.
*  Stevie Ray Vaughn, he was a white boy.
*  After every show, he'd be like, muchas gracias and walk off.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  My grandpa, he said he used to be on acid at his shows in Austin all the time.
*  He performed at my club.
*  We have a photo of him on stage in my club from 1983.
*  Are you shitting me?
*  Yeah.
*  Holy fuck, that's sick.
*  When you walk towards the club, when you're downstairs and you're walking towards the stage,
*  there's a photo on the side of the wall, there's two of them, of Stevie Ray Vaughn on stage at the theater.
*  You a bad motherfucker, Joe.
*  We got lucky with that.
*  We got lucky with that.
*  I didn't even know the history of the place until I bought it.
*  What was it?
*  What was it?
*  It was, at one point in time, it was the Alamo, it's the Ritz Theater on 6th Street.
*  Oh, I'm not sure.
*  So one point in time was the Alamo Drafthouse.
*  There it is.
*  That's the photo we have.
*  Wow.
*  Look at them.
*  It was a rock and roll club.
*  It was a punk rock club.
*  It was a nudie movie theater.
*  It was a pool hall.
*  Wow.
*  It was like-
*  So it's already been known for just being the spot.
*  Yeah, that's it right there.
*  Wow.
*  So it was always a cool spot.
*  Let's see.
*  And now it's my comedy club.
*  Let's see.
*  But it's just the, there's certain old places where you walk in them and you're like, you
*  can feel the memories in the walls.
*  I think buildings have memory.
*  I think that's why people don't want to buy a house where someone was murdered in.
*  Yeah.
*  I think buildings have memory.
*  I think things have memory.
*  I really do.
*  There's a guy named Rupert Sheldrake.
*  I forget what his discipline is.
*  I think he's an evolutionary biologist or something like that.
*  I forget what he does.
*  But anyway, he's got this theory about memory and that we have this idea that we are the
*  only things that have memory.
*  But he thinks that everything has memory.
*  And you agree.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a psychology researcher.
*  He proposed a concept of morphic resonance, a conjecture that lacks mainstream.
*  He gets criticized as being kind of a loon, but he's got some really fucking interesting
*  ideas and he's a brilliant guy.
*  He just thinks outside the box.
*  And one of the things he thinks is that everything has some sort of a memory to it.
*  He's not the only one that thinks that.
*  I want to understand him.
*  This table is going to...
*  It can't tell you things, but this table is different because of all the people that have
*  been in this room talking.
*  Great.
*  And I think there's something real to that.
*  Yeah.
*  So when I say I agree, I feel like I agree because words are powerful.
*  Yeah.
*  Like maybe the word...
*  Experiences are powerful.
*  Yeah, there you go.
*  Yeah.
*  Everything is powerful.
*  Like words facilitate experiences, right?
*  You go on stage and you're killing it and everybody in the audience is jamming out.
*  That's an experience.
*  And then will they go back to that place?
*  Maybe they'll go back and be empty someday.
*  Like, ah, I saw that Mexican OT here.
*  Right here.
*  I was standing right here.
*  And you feel it.
*  I think that's why when you go by your old high school, you go by your old high school,
*  you feel like a loser again.
*  Like, ooh.
*  Yeah.
*  It makes me feel like I felt when I was 16.
*  Yeah.
*  There's something about that.
*  And I know that's a psychological connection that you have, but I also think that high
*  school has got the memories of a bunch of confused, fucked up kids that didn't know
*  what to do with their life.
*  And they were buck wild and yelling and screaming and school fights and all the chaos.
*  I think it's burned into the walls.
*  I think I really believe that.
*  Yeah, I can agree with that.
*  That sounds crazy.
*  I've never heard it, but I actually love that.
*  I think that's what haunted houses are.
*  What?
*  Yeah.
*  I think ghosts are real.
*  But I think what a ghost is, is the, like if someone gets brutally murdered in a building,
*  like imagine if there's a house and some husband comes home and brutally murders his wife and
*  nobody wants to buy that fucking house.
*  Nobody wants to buy that house.
*  He stabbed her a hundred times in the kitchen.
*  Nobody wants that house.
*  You got to level that house to the ground and still people don't want that land.
*  It's just too fucked up.
*  I think when something truly horrific happens, the experience is so intense and extreme that
*  that energy creates like a void.
*  And you feel that void when you're there.
*  And I think if you're in the right state of mind and you're in a house where someone fell
*  down a flight of stairs and snapped their neck and was in horror, you would feel it.
*  You would feel it.
*  And you might feel them.
*  Their experience might be recorded in a way where it has a little flashback.
*  And you just like hear someone saying help, like real softly.
*  You're like, what the fuck is going on?
*  You turn the lights on.
*  No one's there.
*  Fuck.
*  Yeah.
*  Fuck all that.
*  I do agree though.
*  And I know I've always believed in God and things like that, you know, because I grew
*  up non-denominational.
*  My nanny always prayed, you know, and things like that.
*  But what made me full on believe it and like spirits and knowing that it's here was I seen
*  bad first.
*  And I was like, well, fucking yin and yang, you know?
*  Yes and no, on and off.
*  Like, if there's bad, there's got to be good.
*  And after that, that's when I've like been full on prayed up and like full on been trying
*  to get better with the message, you know, because I want to be real.
*  We got to be ready for that talk, you know?
*  But yeah, no, it gets wicked though, definitely.
*  This other thing that makes me uncomfortable as I get older is I realize that there probably
*  has to be evil in order for good to exist.
*  That there's some weird, with human beings, there's some very weird balance, very weird
*  balance of good and evil.
*  And it's just like you don't appreciate sunshine unless it rains.
*  You live in L.A., you're always used to the sun.
*  The sun's bullshit.
*  Nobody gives a fuck about that sun.
*  But man, you live in Portland.
*  The day it's sunny out, you're like, oh, you're out in the park with a coffee.
*  Oh, this is beautiful.
*  Feel that sun.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  It feels so good.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  You know, I think we need a balance.
*  And unfortunately, one of the things that creates more good is evil because someone
*  has to combat that good or combat that evil.
*  And the way you combat that evil is become a better person, become great, become something
*  special.
*  I like it.
*  I think that's real.
*  And it's like there's so much evidence of it.
*  If you look at human beings, there's never been a time where there haven't been evil
*  people.
*  Ever.
*  Yeah, correct.
*  No, correct.
*  We figured it out and everybody was cool.
*  Yeah, correct.
*  And if there are, it lasts like a couple years and then it falls apart.
*  You know.
*  I think, uh, no.
*  What?
*  I do want to tell you this though before I forget.
*  The wolves you got out there, have you ever seen the movie Creep?
*  Creep.
*  Yeah, it's like a fucking scary ass movie.
*  Where was that movie from?
*  How long ago?
*  I don't know.
*  Maybe like 2017, 2016 maybe?
*  I don't think I saw it.
*  I would highly advise it.
*  It reminds me of Peach Fuzz.
*  Peach Fuzz?
*  You just got to watch it.
*  I wouldn't even want to ruin it for you.
*  You know, I don't know if you like movies or not, but bro, it's an amazing movie.
*  That wolf out there, that's from the American Werewolf in London.
*  Oh, okay, shit.
*  Yeah.
*  You ever see that movie?
*  No, I haven't.
*  Oh, look at this thing.
*  Yes, Peach Fuzz.
*  Holy fuck.
*  Oh, that's hilarious.
*  Bro, please watch it.
*  Oh, so that guy's the villain?
*  So he's a bad guy with a wolf mask on?
*  He's not, yeah, I mean, yeah, but you just got to watch it.
*  Okay.
*  He's thrown off, man.
*  He drives around like that?
*  You got to watch it, bro.
*  Okay.
*  Oh, they're doing a Creep 2.
*  Yeah, they did.
*  They did a Creep 2?
*  Yeah, they did do a Creep 2.
*  Creep 1 was 2014, Creep 2 2017.
*  There you go.
*  Underrated horror movie.
*  So Creep 2 is all right, you know what I'm saying?
*  It's kind of like Grease, like it should just left it alone with the first one.
*  But.
*  Kind of like Rambo.
*  Correct, but.
*  It was a Rambo 2?
*  This is like three or four Rambo's.
*  How many Rambo's have there been?
*  A lot.
*  I think there's even a new one coming out.
*  Apparently, the last one is hilarious.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, my friend Joey Diaz saw the last one.
*  He said, dude, it's a comedy.
*  You got to watch this.
*  Sylvester Stallone is 80 years old.
*  He's killing everybody.
*  He's fucking everybody up and shooting everybody.
*  He kills like 150 people.
*  Apparently, it's ridiculous.
*  You ever seen Badass with Machete?
*  Badass.
*  Yeah, he's like the grandpa and he got caught whooping these dudes on camera and he went
*  viral for it.
*  Then he becomes like a hometown hero.
*  When was that movie?
*  Damn.
*  2012.
*  I don't think I saw that either.
*  I ain't going to lie.
*  I've seen a lot of movies.
*  From when you were on the road?
*  Yeah, that's what I was doing.
*  My mama had like, so we had the TV and then there was a big ass entertainment center surrounding
*  it and it was just filled with movies.
*  DVDs, VHS is down here in the middle.
*  I remember watching Monkey Bone on VHS.
*  Oh wow, that's an old one.
*  I've been trying to shoot a video like that.
*  I like Monkey Bone.
*  Whoopi Goldberg's in it and all that.
*  Yeah.
*  Land of the Nightmares.
*  It's funny how Scarface became like the gangster movie.
*  Like the gangster movie.
*  Everybody knew all the words to Scarface.
*  You know what I think is like the most gangsterest movie ever?
*  What?
*  Apocalypse.
*  Oh, that's a good one.
*  Bro.
*  That's a good one.
*  The best part is when he escapes him and he gudges back in his jungle and he's like,
*  this is my jungle.
*  And then this guy gets knocked off one by one.
*  That shit's wicked, man.
*  I like that shit.
*  That's a wicked movie, man.
*  That's a wicked movie.
*  I like that one.
*  That was back when Mel Gibson, everybody's like, Mel Gibson's fucking crazy.
*  Really?
*  They thought of him like that?
*  Yeah, he got pulled over and he was drunk and said a bunch of wild shit about Jews.
*  Wow.
*  Then the cops had it recorded.
*  Damn.
*  Yeah.
*  I feel like lately I've been hearing everybody talk shit about Jews.
*  It's popular these days.
*  It's popular these days.
*  Yeah, it's because of what's going on in Gaza.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Yeah, it's the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.
*  Oh, yes, bro.
*  Hey, I ain't gonna lie.
*  I know she scared the fuck out of him.
*  Yeah.
*  Bro.
*  I heard this movie recently described as just like it's a nonstop chase, which it kind of
*  is.
*  Kind of is, but it's fucking good.
*  What is a nonstop chase?
*  Like the whole movie's a chase scene.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Sometimes it's just a scene in a movie, but take the whole movie.
*  It was a brutal fucking movie, too.
*  Bro.
*  Woo.
*  Yo, you know what's good?
*  Have you seen Shogun?
*  That series that's on FX?
*  No, I can't get into series.
*  Oh, man.
*  Yeah, it's good?
*  This one's good.
*  Wow.
*  This one's good.
*  Wow.
*  This is on Japan in the 1600s and these dudes are starving at sea and their boat washes
*  ashore.
*  In Japan, they get captured and they kill a couple of them and this one dude, I don't
*  want to spoil it for you, but it's just like showing you the reality.
*  It's very well done.
*  Yeah, I believe it.
*  The reality of life in Japan, in Osaka, in 1600.
*  It's a fucking incredible, incredible series.
*  It's so well done.
*  This is it right here.
*  Yeah, they did it in the-
*  Shogun.
*  Oh, I feel like I've seen commercials of it, definitely.
*  Yeah, it's new.
*  It's still airing.
*  I think they've only aired three episodes so far.
*  Maybe four by now.
*  Okay, so you're into this.
*  How'd you feel about It Man?
*  I didn't watch It Man.
*  I mean, I knew the history of It Man, which I think it's kind of based on, who's Bruce
*  Lee's Wing Chung instructor.
*  But I don't get into those kind of movies that much.
*  Those kind of kung fu movies.
*  Too much of my analytical brain for fighting.
*  It's like, why are you fighting like this?
*  Just grab that dude, kick his legs out from under him, take him down, strangle him.
*  This is stupid.
*  This is stupid.
*  Why are you guys standing here in front of each other doing this shit?
*  Yeah, I dig it.
*  I dig it.
*  It just looked cool.
*  My dad always called it pretty fighting.
*  Yeah.
*  I could never get into kung fu movies.
*  A lot of my friends were into kung fu movies.
*  I'd go, but I didn't get into them.
*  Scary movies, how you feel about scary movies?
*  Love scary movies.
*  That's where I'm at.
*  Bro, it's almost like weed ain't enough no more.
*  I need meth.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Wow.
*  Yeah, like scary.
*  Because bro, I was already watching scary movies with my mama.
*  That was her favorite.
*  So now, I don't even want a scary movie.
*  I want something that's disturbing.
*  Well, what is that one movie where that dude wears like a clown face and kills everybody?
*  Bro, you gotta watch Creep.
*  That's what I'm trying to tell you.
*  Creep's a good one.
*  But this one's like that too.
*  I will watch Creep.
*  For sure.
*  There's some fucking, it's like real gruesome, horrible shit.
*  And the dude dresses like a clown.
*  They made a couple of them.
*  Terrifier.
*  Terrifier.
*  That's right.
*  That's my dad's favorite.
*  That's crazy.
*  My dad wants him tatted on him.
*  His name's Art the Clown.
*  Your dad wants him tatted on him?
*  That's amazing.
*  I'm gonna do a video, pull a clip up of Terrifier.
*  This motherfucker's legitimately terrifying too.
*  Yes, yes, yes, yes.
*  And he'll just be smiling.
*  Yeah.
*  Look at it.
*  You seen how he fucking cut homegirl from the puss down?
*  Yeah, not nice.
*  Cut her in two.
*  Really not a nice thing to do.
*  Ew.
*  Look at them teeth.
*  Yeah.
*  It's funny how people disrespect him.
*  They think he's funny.
*  They think he's silly.
*  Like, look at you, you fucking loser.
*  Yeah, that's really what it is.
*  Yeah.
*  They always have to disrespect him first.
*  And then they're like, get away, you fucking stupid clown.
*  Makes you know he's in that 16-year-old feeling comes back.
*  Yeah, they're just chopping him up.
*  Look.
*  He's like, are you gonna die?
*  Makes Pennywise look like Krusty.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, man.
*  Oh, shit.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a crazy movie, man.
*  Rob Zombie was also gnarly too.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  I was a big fan of his work.
*  Yeah, he's a cool dude.
*  I got to meet him.
*  What?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, I did a podcast with him back in the day.
*  Sick.
*  How was he?
*  He's great.
*  Great.
*  I believe it.
*  It's so interesting that that guy got really into making horror movies too.
*  Yeah.
*  And he does those same kind of movies.
*  Like, really fucked up slasher.
*  I feel like he had the best Halloween too.
*  Yeah, he had a really good Halloween.
*  For sure.
*  How many of those have they been?
*  Uh-huh, too many.
*  There's been so many of those movies.
*  Yeah, I feel like a lot of the scary movies now are a little lame just because they just
*  make them complete fucking studs.
*  It's more of like an action movie for the scary killer.
*  Yeah.
*  He just comes in and just fucking fuck shit up, goes ape shit.
*  Like, bro, I want to be scared.
*  I don't want to see him fucking take on a whole army.
*  Yeah.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  It's an action movie.
*  I prefer action movies.
*  A good one.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, a good action movie.
*  What's a good action movie?
*  Well, a stupid good action movie, it's good, but it's not realistic, is John Wick.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a great one.
*  What's a Vengement?
*  Yeah, a Vengement?
*  What's a Vengement?
*  A Vengement.
*  It's about, I personally, I always say that he, I ain't going to say whoop John Wick,
*  but he put John Wick in a fight.
*  Really?
*  For sure.
*  Have you seen Sisou?
*  Sisou, no I haven't.
*  Sisou is about a dude in World War II that's basically like a John Wick in World War II.
*  Wow.
*  And he kills like 100 Nazis by himself.
*  It's fucking amazing.
*  That's sick.
*  It's amazing.
*  Yeah, it sounds sick.
*  It's a real good movie, too.
*  It's real well done.
*  Sisou?
*  Sisou.
*  Sisou.
*  What country?
*  Finnish?
*  I think so.
*  Yeah, I think you're right.
*  Yeah, nah, fucking Vengement, I forgot what his name was, but like he was a fighter, and
*  his brother was doing some gangster shit and he ended up going down for his brother and
*  fucking, yup, right here.
*  He's in UK.
*  Vengement.
*  The prison that he's in is so, they call it the meat grinder.
*  Yo, I'm talking about just fucking, fucking shit up, bro.
*  Jesus.
*  Hit him with a napalm.
*  He's like, yeah, bro, he was like, you just gotta callus the mind and callus, like bro,
*  he was like, he's a badass.
*  Look at him.
*  Then that's when he escapes prison.
*  And you know what's my favorite part about him?
*  What?
*  His heart.
*  Why he does everything that he does in this movie.
*  Why is that?
*  He just got watches.
*  I always feel like I'm being conned when a movie does that, when there's like a hit man
*  with a heart of gold, I'm like, shut the fuck up.
*  Just shut the fuck up.
*  I know what you're doing, bitch, I'm not 12.
*  Yeah, of course.
*  He definitely was doing to be a savage, but like, you know, he might as well as end on
*  some good shit.
*  Yeah, but you know, like there's always like the guy who's the contract killer, but you
*  know, he has rules.
*  The person has to be guilty.
*  They have, you know, he has like a whole thing.
*  Yeah, yeah, for sure.
*  You know, that's like the gray man.
*  The outfit.
*  Have you seen the outfit?
*  That's another good one.
*  My dad just put me on that one.
*  It's like some like old school gangster time where they wear suits and shit, mobsters more.
*  I think that's more gangster to me.
*  Like I've always been into the mobs more than like some gang bangers.
*  Yeah.
*  For sure.
*  Like old school mob movies.
*  It's just player to me.
*  Yeah, correct.
*  Like The Godfather and all that.
*  Even The Goodfellas and things like that.
*  It's just player to me.
*  Yeah.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Well, there's something about it.
*  I think that lifestyle is so appealing to some people that feel like their life is mundane and boring.
*  You know, like that's why The Sopranos was so good.
*  Tony Soprano was a straight up murderer and he was the hero.
*  A straight up murderer.
*  He killed Christopher Maltesanti in his fucking Cadillac Escalade seat.
*  Jesus.
*  He just killed him right next to him.
*  He was a killer, but you liked him.
*  Yeah.
*  He was a liar, a killer, a thief.
*  Who were the two brothers?
*  I think it was based on the true story too.
*  They were like from Germany or something.
*  The Craze from England.
*  Was that it?
*  England.
*  Holy shit.
*  The Craze, bro.
*  Just from the actors in the movie, they looked like brutes.
*  They were brutes.
*  Yeah, I believe it.
*  Bro, England didn't play.
*  Bro, that's what I'm saying.
*  People think about England.
*  They were like fish and chips and fucking tea.
*  Cheerio.
*  Yeah, nah.
*  There's hood everywhere, bro.
*  It fucked me up when I saw there was hood outside of Bay City because I thought Bay City was like the only hood in the whole world.
*  The Kratrans were running.
*  Look at those two, bro.
*  Are they from Liverpool?
*  What part of it?
*  They look like they'll smack the shit out of you.
*  Yeah, they'll fucking stab you right in the dick.
*  Where's my crumpet?
*  Where are these guys from?
*  They look like, they just look like fucking...
*  Haggarsden.
*  Brutes.
*  Yeah, mostly in the East End of London from the late 50s until their arrest in 1968.
*  Damn, so they ran shit for 18 years.
*  That's a good run.
*  Yeah, the movie's crazy too.
*  The movie apparently is not too...
*  They didn't take any liberties.
*  It's basically the story, I believe.
*  That's sick.
*  Yeah.
*  Again, it's weird we like movies about bad people.
*  There's something about that.
*  Strange.
*  Yeah, because I...
*  Sicario.
*  I don't think I know that one.
*  Oh, you never saw Sicario?
*  Dude, that's a great fucking movie.
*  Put me on.
*  Show me.
*  That's Benicio del Toro, man.
*  That's a great fucking movie.
*  Sicario is all about Mexican assassins.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah, dude.
*  Sicario.
*  Emily Blunt, Benicio del Toro, it's a good fucking movie.
*  And Taylor Sheridan did it, the guy who did Yellowstone.
*  He did Yellowstone.
*  You know Ryan Bingham?
*  Mm-hmm.
*  I fucking met him at the rodeo.
*  He fucks with me.
*  Oh, really?
*  Everybody fucks with you, dude, once they hear you.
*  Yeah, right, right.
*  This is a good fucking movie, man.
*  It's heavy.
*  No, that shit looks gnarly.
*  Yeah, it's a heavy movie.
*  Yeah.
*  Did you see The Last Purge?
*  It made me think of The Last Purge.
*  No, I don't like those Purge movies.
*  No?
*  How come why?
*  Because I get prepared.
*  Bro.
*  When I see Purge movies, I start fucking loading magazines.
*  I feel like we're close to it.
*  We could be close to it.
*  I never felt that until the George Floyd riots.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, the George Floyd riots.
*  Here's the thing about riots.
*  This is my feeling.
*  Okay.
*  I support your right to protest.
*  Correct.
*  But I'm not going to one of those.
*  You know why?
*  Because I think protests are a lot like war.
*  I think there's a mode inside the human brain.
*  Let me explain to you.
*  You ever catch a fish?
*  You know when you catch a fish?
*  The moment that fish is on the line, your whole body gets excited.
*  Like, oh shit, oh shit.
*  That is an ancient thing that is in us because it used to be that was survival.
*  Survival mode.
*  If you caught that fish, your family was going to have food.
*  That's why you get so excited.
*  I think when people are on the ground marching and they're all together and they're all chanting,
*  that brings war.
*  It excites that feeling.
*  Just the way catching a fish excites that feeling.
*  I think it excites that feeling of war.
*  When you're like, no more Trump, no more Trump.
*  Whatever the fuck it is.
*  Black Lives Matter.
*  Whatever it is.
*  You're looking for someone to say it doesn't matter.
*  You're looking for someone.
*  It's not just a protest.
*  You are stimulating those thoughts of war.
*  You're marching on the ground with your fellow soldiers.
*  They even call each other comrades.
*  There's a lot of wild shit that's involved in protests that excites people in a very dangerous way.
*  Yeah, no, definitely.
*  Mob mentality.
*  That's what mob mentality is.
*  People always talk about mob mentality.
*  If there's something happens, there's a mob of people, people will do wild shit that they will never do normally.
*  Because that excites the war gene.
*  There's a war gene inside of us because every human being has survived war.
*  If you're alive today, that means your genetics survived war.
*  That means somewhere down the line, whether it's bows and arrows or rifles or whatever, if you got to 2024,
*  if your genes got to 2024, for sure, there's some war in those genes.
*  Damn.
*  Yeah.
*  What the fuck?
*  Yeah.
*  Damn.
*  That's why I will not go to protest.
*  You see, if there's a protest, I'm getting the fuck out of there.
*  Yeah, it's going to get wicked.
*  Because it could get wicked.
*  Damn, I never thought of how you said that though.
*  That's crazy. I like that.
*  It's war.
*  War is inside of us.
*  And your body knows when you go to war, you have to switch gears.
*  You have to switch gears.
*  You have to switch gears.
*  And that's where mob- That's where you beat some of the death with a rock in front of everybody.
*  You would never do that if it was just you and that person.
*  There's something about that experience of being around a lot of people that are all being hostile and all excited together
*  that just fires up parts of people.
*  And also you feel kind of like a badass because you're a part of a gang.
*  Yeah, I think it's comforting knowing that there's a bunch of you, like knowing you can't lose.
*  Which is also like war.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Fuck, fuck dude.
*  I just want to love.
*  Yeah, well that's a better way to live.
*  Yeah.
*  For sure.
*  But you also have a lot now.
*  You know, that's the thing.
*  Once you have a lot, you're like, you know what?
*  I just want to love.
*  But when you don't have a lot, and you're like, all these motherfuckers have a lot.
*  It's hard to love.
*  It's hard.
*  It's hard to be comfortable.
*  I do definitely agree because I feel like it was harder to be- I feel like then, before I was chilling and blessed.
*  Man.
*  Like my anger was so horrible.
*  I remember I'd get done being angry, and when I would be done, I'd be like, I just want to sleep.
*  Swarp yourself out.
*  Like don't even talk.
*  Yeah, like fuck.
*  I just want to sleep.
*  I'd feel like I got jumped.
*  Like I just strained my body.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Just being angry.
*  And for no reason?
*  Fuck.
*  For like, bro, for the simplest shit, bro.
*  Anything.
*  Like the wind blew the wrong way, and I'd be like fuck.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Like I don't know what it was.
*  It's probably pent up childhood shit.
*  I feel like it definitely was.
*  But like you said, it's easier to love when you have a lot of it.
*  Yeah, when things are going great for you, it's easier to love.
*  It's easier to also recognize that you want to kind of- like you've experienced bad, and now you're experiencing all this good.
*  And you want to kind of keep that rolling.
*  Yeah, correct.
*  It makes you want to do good.
*  Or at least me personally, because I know you do good.
*  Because energy is real.
*  I don't want to say karma or nothing, but like man, you be a whole ass motherfucker.
*  Some whole ass shit is eventually going to catch up to you.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Yes.
*  That's a great way to put it.
*  Yeah, someone should put that on a t-shirt.
*  I'm telling you, bro.
*  But you know, you do good.
*  You know, like man, I just like bro, relationships is everything too.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Just because I don't know how to do it.
*  Man, homeboy right here.
*  I'm going to make him my best friend.
*  He's going to do it for me.
*  Right.
*  You know?
*  Yeah, relationships are very, very important.
*  People that don't have friends are lost.
*  Lost.
*  The idea that you could be like the only one person having fun, that's not real.
*  You can't have fun unless your friends are having fun.
*  If you're doing great in your life and all your friends are suicidal and depressed,
*  that's not a good time, man.
*  Yeah.
*  You guys go out to dinner.
*  And if you're good with it and like they still depressed and shit, like you're
*  thrown off.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Like my boys like, man, I've never ever, ever flew first class ever.
*  And my boy Boomhauer, I started bringing him with me and I fucking started booking first
*  class because like I want him to experience that shit.
*  Yeah.
*  You know?
*  Like man, I just, I just make him, what make me happy is seeing my people happy and knowing
*  I did it.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Like we'd be out there chilling and shit like that and I'll do all this and I'll
*  cater to everybody.
*  And then finally I just sit back, light my joint up and I just look and I just, I see
*  my partner over there laughing.
*  I see cuz right here with some drinks and he laughing.
*  Yeah.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  And we just chilling.
*  I'm like, damn, I did that.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a good experience.
*  I did that.
*  The problem rappers have.
*  I do, I do shit for people that I know would never do shit for me, but I do it because
*  like, man, that's just who I am.
*  I just want to love.
*  Because it feels good to do that.
*  Hell.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a great sign of your character that you experienced that while you're having success.
*  That you want to do good for other people and make other people feel good.
*  That's a great sign.
*  That's true.
*  It make me feel good.
*  Yeah.
*  That's, well, you're a wise man.
*  That's a great sign of your character.
*  That's, that's, cuz a lot of people when they start doing good, they start going, I'm the
*  fucking man.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm the fucking man.
*  Now you started off as a nobody homeboy.
*  Yeah.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Everybody's a nobody.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  You just, you just happen to be good at that.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  I just happen to be good at rapping.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  This shit don't make my dick bigger.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Real life.
*  Imagine if it did.
*  I would, yeah, that'd be bad though.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Nines would have the biggest dick on earth.
*  Re-Wine.
*  Re-Wine, yes!
*  Bro, cuz it's hard telling the story.
*  Bro, right.
*  It's hard telling the story and rhyming.
*  Right.
*  It's hard telling the story rhyming and telling the story backwards.
*  It's a master class.
*  Get the fuck out of here, bro.
*  Master class in writing.
*  He's an animal, bro.
*  I was just listening to Re-Wine yesterday.
*  And I was thinking that exact same thing.
*  How good is that?
*  How good is that, bro?
*  The smoke goes back in the blunt.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Bull goes back in the gun.
*  Yeah.
*  It's an amazing rap.
*  Shoot, don't please.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's so good.
*  It's so well written.
*  It makes sense.
*  It flows.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  He's the best writer.
*  You think so?
*  He's the best writer.
*  He's the best writer.
*  His lyrics are so goddamn good.
*  He's the goat.
*  But you know what I'm saying?
*  I'm telling you, he's the best writer.
*  He's the best writer.
*  He's the best writer.
*  He's the best writer.
*  He's the goat.
*  But you know who's super underrated if people don't give him his props?
*  It's Willie D from the Ghetto Boys.
*  Willie D.
*  And he was knocking motherfuckers out.
*  Knocking motherfuckers out.
*  He's a legit boxer.
*  Willie D's a real boxer.
*  He showed me a video of one of his fights.
*  We were watching on his phone.
*  I was like, dude.
*  Bad motherfucker.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm like, this is good.
*  You got skills.
*  If you told me this was a middleweight contender who was coming up, I'd be like, oh, that guy's
*  good.
*  No shit.
*  He's good.
*  Billy.
*  Billy can knock people the fuck out.
*  Willie wrote Fuck a War in 45 minutes.
*  You ever heard Fuck a War?
*  All right.
*  Listen.
*  Sorry, YouTube.
*  We're going to have to edit.
*  I need to play this for him.
*  Let's do it.
*  With YouTube, we'll cut this out.
*  Can we cut this out?
*  Yeah.
*  And we'll come back.
*  We'll come back for the Spotify people.
*  You can whatever.
*  We'll figure it out.
*  But we'll cut this out.
*  Listen to this.
*  Yeah.
*  I agree, though.
*  Fuck that.
*  Yeah.
*  Willie.
*  I agree with that, too.
*  But Willie tells stories.
*  Yeah.
*  Like, there's a lot going on in his writing.
*  Yeah, correct.
*  That's what I love about 90s hip hop.
*  Yeah, correct.
*  Like, the lyrics of 90s hip hop.
*  They were saying shit.
*  Oh, yeah, man.
*  Yeah.
*  This, I grew up on 90s hip hop.
*  I grew up, like, when I was, when I lived in New York, all I did was play pool.
*  Play pool and do comedy.
*  Okay.
*  And when I was playing pool, that was the 90s hip hop era.
*  People were listening to Cool G rap and DJ Polo.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, it was like, it was a different time, man.
*  I think, to me, M was the best.
*  M and Big L. When it came to those stories.
*  Big L. People forgot about Big L, man.
*  Bro, Big L is one of the reasons why I'm an animal today.
*  Really?
*  A Mexican with no green card showed me who Big L was.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  My partner, Fermin.
*  Wow.
*  I found out about Big L because I was a Gang Star fan.
*  Oh, shit.
*  And so, in the beginning of full clip, it says, Big L, rest in peace.
*  Yeah.
*  And it goes into that, I was like, who's Big L?
*  Oh, and that's when you, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Looped off him now.
*  Yeah.
*  Big L and Big L had been murdered.
*  I'm like, oh, shit.
*  Yeah.
*  I think I was like in the seventh grade when I found out about him.
*  Eighth grade.
*  Yeah.
*  There's so many hip hop artists, but Cool G rap is one that I bring up all the time
*  because people forgot about him.
*  Tech 9, too.
*  Tech 9.
*  Tech 9 is another band.
*  I remember I was jamming Tech 9, Yellow Wolf, and all these dudes.
*  I was jamming World Wide Choppers and people would be like, turn this shit off.
*  Like, what the fuck?
*  I'd be like, bitch, y'all are tripping.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  But their minds wasn't there.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  They was like, I'm going to kill them.
*  I'm going to kill them.
*  They was like on that, I think Mumble Rappers belly coming out the fucking, you know what
*  I'm saying?
*  Right.
*  The drugged up SoundCloud rappers was here, so like all that shit was out the window to
*  them.
*  Well, people forgot about some of the great Mexican hip hop, too, like Kid Frost.
*  Kid Frost was cool.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know if you know Lil Bing and Big Flake.
*  No, I don't.
*  Yeah.
*  Those are some Texas Mexicans.
*  They was like really the shit.
*  And my uncles, too.
*  My uncles was like, they was SPM to me.
*  They was hard.
*  Even just having my uncles, them being my Mexican mentors, you know what I'm saying?
*  They was ripping shit real life.
*  Nice.
*  Ripping shit up.
*  That's like if you wanted to develop a rapper, you kind of was-
*  The perfect story for it.
*  It was like you got your PhD in the streets.
*  Well, that's what I'm saying.
*  Even my dad, he put me through gladiator school with that shit.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  I remember being like, dad, I don't want to rap.
*  Because everybody was trying to be a rapper.
*  Dad, I don't want to be a rapper no more.
*  He'd be like, shut the fuck up.
*  Get on this beat.
*  For real.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  He would have me rap not because he wanted me to be better.
*  Not because he wanted me to push.
*  He was being selfish.
*  It was his entertainment.
*  Yeah, but also, he probably knew that that's the only way to really develop a man correctly.
*  Correct, but I don't think that was on his mind.
*  No?
*  I think he was like-
*  Have you talked to him about this?
*  I mean, I hear him talk about it.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  He would just be fucked up.
*  Get down here.
*  I want to hear you.
*  Because he's been hearing me since forever, since I was rapping through a window.
*  There is a lot of that with parents of athletes.
*  They couldn't make it into sport, but then they're super involved parents and they forced
*  their kid to train and go to camps.
*  Nobody in my family did music.
*  No one?
*  No one.
*  Really?
*  So your dad just loved it and he wanted you to do it?
*  My mama loved it.
*  And then my dad was just a fan of it.
*  Well, that's fucking dope.
*  Having your dad be a fan of your shit.
*  Yeah, that's also another thing that I was super grateful for because there was a lot
*  of kids that I was growing up with and their parents drilled them to be something else,
*  you know?
*  Exactly what you were saying.
*  And like, man, fuck all that.
*  You can ruin a kid.
*  Even my step-mama, she wanted me to go, bro, I took the ASVAB five times and failed every
*  time.
*  I even cheated and still failed.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Real life.
*  I got the ASVAB for dummies, ripped those out of the fucking page, put them on pants, went
*  in there trying to look for answers, still failed.
*  It just wasn't for me.
*  And my grandpa's skill, he was like, Virgil, he said, do what the fuck Virgil wants to
*  do.
*  He said, but whatever it is, just make sure you fucking do it.
*  So if you want to be a rapper, you can be a rapper, but make sure you fucking do it.
*  And now he's like, you know what I'm saying?
*  You're going to have to have a job.
*  You're going to want a phone.
*  Now you got a phone bill.
*  You're going to want to call to move around to go to these shows.
*  You're going to have fucking card notes and all this extra shit.
*  And he just, you know, just giving me a game on it.
*  And his story, like his main thing to get to me was just do it though.
*  You know, fucking do it.
*  Just do it.
*  Do whatever you want to do.
*  Just do it.
*  But that's a big thing in life is just doing things.
*  So many people just lay up.
*  The hardest part is showing up.
*  Yes.
*  Always.
*  Still, to this day.
*  Correct.
*  To this day, the hardest part, going to the gym is actually deciding you're going to go.
*  Getting in there and then once you get going, it's pretty easy.
*  It's like, fuck, I'm here.
*  Yeah.
*  Even when it's hard, it's like, I know what I'm doing.
*  I've done this forever.
*  Yeah, correct.
*  And you get accustomed to doing it.
*  And then if you're like, that's where your dad really served you well.
*  Because he made you do it.
*  Even if it was for his entertainment, damn, you got something out of that.
*  Think about all those reps you put in.
*  All those times you were rapping from the time you were a little kid, all those reps,
*  just constant reps, constant reps.
*  Now it's muscle memory at this point.
*  Exactly.
*  It's like, he can wake you up at 3 o'clock in the morning and say, start rapping.
*  Yeah, correct.
*  And you fire right up.
*  Correct.
*  Yeah, it becomes a part of you.
*  And that only happens through repetition.
*  You got to get those reps in.
*  Yeah, correct.
*  There's no other way around this.
*  There's no shortcuts.
*  There's no easy road.
*  When you meet a dude and he's a bad motherfucker and he's 24 or 25, you go, how long you been
*  doing this?
*  I was a little kid.
*  Yeah, that's what I try to tell people.
*  I try to compare.
*  There's some people, as soon as they were walking, they were in karate.
*  As soon as I was talking, I was rapping.
*  Music is what taught me, it didn't teach me English and how to talk, but it taught me
*  how to put shit together, really.
*  Right.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Right.
*  If that makes sense.
*  It does make sense because you're formulating raps.
*  You're not just talking to your friends.
*  You're formulating shit that's going to be entertaining, so it's exciting, that creative
*  part of your mind.
*  And again, you're developing that way.
*  And you're developing that way with the internet.
*  So you have the influence of all these rappers.
*  You could get anybody who ever lived.
*  You can listen to 100 Miles and Running.
*  You can listen to Eminem shit.
*  You can listen to Snoop Dogg shit.
*  You can listen to anything, anytime you want.
*  It's a magical time for someone to be inspired and influenced.
*  Correct.
*  I agree.
*  Damn, that's beautiful.
*  Especially the MTV music videos.
*  I don't know if you remember that.
*  Yeah.
*  Yes, I remember those.
*  So my nanny, she was working at the plant.
*  So like 3, 4 o'clock in the morning, we're up.
*  She's taking me to the babysitters.
*  I'm putting MTV on because I want to watch some shit.
*  Music videos start playing.
*  You know, I remember watching the Black Keys and they had that Tighten Up.
*  Yes.
*  And I remember being a kid watching that.
*  I wanted to do music like that.
*  Bro, those guys are the coolest.
*  Bro, I've never met them, but they seem-
*  How long were you here for?
*  I got to be in South Padre tomorrow and then California for Rolling Loud.
*  I'll be back on the 18th.
*  Tomorrow, I'm going to see the Black Keys at Stubbs in town.
*  Are you shitting me?
*  Yeah, bro, I took them to the club Tuesday night.
*  They came, they did the podcast.
*  We hung out.
*  I got a little too high.
*  I was barbecued.
*  Yeah.
*  But it was just a little- I just love them so much.
*  They're so cool.
*  And Patrick is hilarious.
*  I believe it.
*  That dude is funny like a comedian.
*  Yeah, no shit.
*  He's funny.
*  I told him, I go, Don, I want to fuck up your life, man, but you could do comedy.
*  Yeah, right.
*  Like you 100- Because there's dudes you meet that could do- I used to work for this dude
*  who's a private investigator.
*  I feel like being funny though in a comedian is different.
*  It's only a little different.
*  It's next door neighbors.
*  You just got to figure out how to go over.
*  Yeah, but- But it's a skill.
*  You learn how to do it.
*  It's going to take time, but you can do it.
*  I believe it.
*  It's like a podcast.
*  I tell everyone, if you were an interesting person to talk to, you could have a podcast.
*  But you got to learn how to do it.
*  You got to learn how to not interrupt people.
*  You got to learn how to bring the most out of them.
*  You got to learn the flow of the conversation.
*  It seems like it's just talking because it is just talking, but it's an art form.
*  Being funny, if you're funny with your friends, you can do it.
*  You just have to figure out how to do it.
*  Yeah, I definitely agree, but to me, I feel like it would be hard just because my mind's
*  already so everywhere.
*  I suck at focusing.
*  Yeah, but you focus when you rap.
*  That's it.
*  But that's it.
*  You need a thing that you know you could do that now.
*  Yeah.
*  Bro, as good as you are, you could do anything you wanted.
*  You could do anything.
*  If you decided to stop rapping and you got super excited about making cars, you'd make
*  the dopest cars.
*  It's just a thing that a person ... It's Miyamoto Musashi, who's a samurai in the 1400s.
*  He wrote this book called The Book of Five Rings, and it's about strategy.
*  Miyamoto Musashi killed 60 men in one-on-one combat.
*  Jesus.
*  He was a legendary samurai.
*  I have him tattooed on my arm.
*  My whole right sleeve is Miyamoto Musashi.
*  Because he said this one thing, and I read this when I was 16 years old.
*  Once you know the way broadly, you can see it in all things.
*  Once you know the way broadly, you can see it in all things.
*  Once you become a master at something, you can see what it takes to be a master in all
*  things.
*  That's one of the reasons why I enjoy music so much.
*  This guy have no musical ability at all.
*  I have nothing.
*  I have no talent.
*  I've never tried.
*  I see people do music.
*  I'm like, yeah, just make it magic.
*  Look at this magic experience.
*  This dude's up there just singing and dancing and playing music.
*  My whole body's excited.
*  It's like I'm on a drug.
*  I'm like, wow, this is amazing.
*  It's magic.
*  I love it.
*  It's something about it, man.
*  You see people at the top of the game with anything.
*  It's so exciting.
*  Yeah, not correct.
*  That's what it is.
*  The way you do that with rap, bro, you would just have to have a thing that you love the
*  way you love rapping.
*  If there was a thing that came along and you loved that thing as much as you loved what
*  is painting, whatever the fuck it is.
*  I dominate.
*  You would dominate.
*  Yeah, I agree.
*  I agree.
*  Yeah.
*  Because you would have the same focus and energy that you have with your music that
*  you would have with that.
*  Yeah, that's why I'm grateful for the music, man, because that other shit, I feel like
*  I just always suck at.
*  I have zero patience.
*  I hate.
*  I suck at talking to people.
*  I don't want to talk to a lot of people.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Fucking.
*  But you're good talking right now.
*  Yeah, because I want to talk to you.
*  Yeah, but that's what it is.
*  That's what it's all.
*  Well, that's the secret to this podcast.
*  I only talk to people I want to talk to.
*  Correct.
*  So I just reached out to you.
*  I was like, this dude seems cool as fuck.
*  I want to talk to him.
*  I thank you, man.
*  I thank you.
*  But that's how I do the show.
*  I just only find people like, what's the black keys?
*  I can't wait to talk to them.
*  Yeah.
*  I would talk to them at a diner.
*  I talk to them anywhere.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  I love talking to interesting people because I think it changes the way you see the world.
*  You see the world through their eyes.
*  I feel like you get a little something out of a person every time you sit and talk to
*  them.
*  You ever met somebody and you were like, man, you're told off, but I almost get it.
*  Yeah, a lot of people like that.
*  Comedians, man.
*  Comedians, almost all of them are off in some way.
*  To want to be standing on stage and make people laugh, tell stories, that's hard to
*  do, man.
*  No, yeah, bro, definitely.
*  Like I said-
*  To want to do that, you have to be a weirdo.
*  And then being able to go from a story to another one and then bring it right back in
*  where you picked, you know what I'm saying?
*  You're a bad motherfucker, bro.
*  It takes a lot of work.
*  But it's just like rap or like anything else.
*  It's just time and reps and you're trying to make it better.
*  Correct.
*  Looking at it all the time.
*  Twisting it around, changing it, adding to it, taking it away, editing it.
*  But that's a thing like all things.
*  Like all things.
*  And you really put your mind and your soul to it.
*  All things.
*  Just you find where the best version of it is.
*  What genre of music was the first thing you heard and you were like, this is the music
*  I want to listen to?
*  Man, I was real lucky that-
*  Because you fucked me up with the ghetto boys.
*  Oh, I love ghetto boys.
*  Let's see.
*  I love ghetto boys.
*  Like I said, I love 90s rap.
*  I love a lot of East Coast 90s rap.
*  Like I said, Cool G rap.
*  You ever heard- Do you know who the brand new Heavies are?
*  No.
*  The brand new Heavies are like a jazz group that did collaborations with Gang Starr.
*  They did a thing called the Heavy Rhyme Experience.
*  So it was this one CD they put out in the 90s.
*  They did like jazz music, but they had like, Play Death Threat by Cool G Rap.
*  One more.
*  This is the last one, I promise.
*  Sorry, YouTube.
*  We're going to have to snip this out.
*  Pretty a fan of all that type of shit.
*  You were just saying that you think rap came from jazz?
*  Yeah, hell yeah.
*  I think rap came from jazz.
*  I mean, listen to it.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  It's got like a groove.
*  It's got that bounce.
*  Yeah.
*  It's got that kick in there.
*  But I think they made those sounds specifically so people could rap over it with live music.
*  But a friend of mine-
*  The Roots?
*  Yeah.
*  Holy shit.
*  The Roots had some fucking great jams.
*  I can't wait.
*  You know what?
*  I feel like this is a perfect podcast to say it on.
*  I can't wait until rock comes back.
*  Because I feel like rock is slowly dying, bro.
*  I want it to stay alive forever.
*  I can't wait till a good rock band come back out.
*  And they feel like a 3 Day Grace or like a Crossfade.
*  They feel like something like that.
*  Do I think there's just cycles of things?
*  I think if one killer band comes out now, a bunch will emerge.
*  You know?
*  Yeah, because they made it cool again.
*  Yeah.
*  But not because they haven't been found.
*  They're out right now.
*  Probably.
*  We just don't know who they are.
*  Yes.
*  Yeah.
*  There's another me coming around somewhere.
*  Probably.
*  There definitely is.
*  Definitely.
*  Yeah.
*  Like prisons?
*  Prisons are filled up with some badass motherfuckers, bro.
*  Of course.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  I've seen a lot of people, like bro, they master that shit.
*  Like you said, they're with it every day, twisting it, pulling it, figuring it out,
*  adding shit, taking it out.
*  No distractions.
*  Like bro, there's motherfuckers in there making fucking tattoo guns with nothing.
*  Yeah.
*  Like bro.
*  They're doing amazing tattoos.
*  Come on, bro.
*  I'm sure you've seen some prison tattoos are insanely good.
*  Yeah, a lot of my dads are in prison.
*  His are crazy.
*  Some dudes inside are so talented and because they have to be so ingenious to take like
*  pens and figure out how to weigh them.
*  And they got a single needle at that.
*  A spring to a pin, fucking toothbrush and a little motor from something.
*  Batteries.
*  Yeah, like what the fuck?
*  Fucking electric toothbrush.
*  I'm trying to tell you, bro, that's some bad motherfuckers in there.
*  All right, so my Tio Chui, he had me and my cousin Romeo in bars when we were like five
*  years old in Mexico and like little border towns, Matamoros and things like that.
*  And Laredo, Eagle Pass.
*  And I remember there was this Mexican and he was from Mexico and he was, I don't know
*  if he was slow or simple minded or what, but there was something off about him and he couldn't
*  do a lot.
*  But there was one thing he could do and it was his old school boombox radio.
*  The speakers, all the keys, you know, like the square one, old school ones and fucking,
*  he would bust that motherfucker down to springs and screws and fucking put it back together.
*  Wow.
*  Like bro, like bust that shit down to like springs, bro.
*  Like I don't even know, like just like whatever, like to the smallest piece and then put that
*  shit back together.
*  Shit was sick.
*  Yeah, there's mechanics out there.
*  Yeah, some people are just, some people like they even if they don't know how to do anything
*  else like that right there, that's what he knows.
*  They get obsessed with it.
*  They get obsessed with part numbers and shit.
*  Yeah, it's crazy.
*  They know where the gaskets go.
*  That OCD stuff, like I've seen somebody open a door and they'll open and shut it, open
*  and shut it, open and shut it and they walk through.
*  Is that some form of throw it off?
*  Yeah, that's throw it off.
*  Definitely, right?
*  Yeah, 100%.
*  They wash their hands like 15 times in a row.
*  They can't stop.
*  That's crazy.
*  Some people have to touch a door three times before they go through it.
*  I feel like I have to do this, but I've done this since a kid though, especially now.
*  Touching your fingers?
*  No, like doing that with your nails.
*  Yeah, I don't know why.
*  It's just a tick.
*  That's just a thing you like to do.
*  OCD is a disease.
*  That's a mental health disease.
*  Yeah, I know people who've had it.
*  They made something called Snapchat syndrome.
*  Did you see that?
*  What's that?
*  That's fucking stupid.
*  That's in the dictionary now.
*  So there are people like they're going to get surgery to look like these filters.
*  Oh.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Like that's crazy, bro.
*  You're really only supposed to, like God made you to give a fuck about what your family
*  thinks and you're meeting like your cousin, your brother, your grandma, your tia.
*  Even once like it's your third cousin, fuck them.
*  Snapchat dysmorphia, a body image disorder characterized by the need to heavily edit
*  one's own digital image.
*  At its most severe, the disorder may cause people to seek out cosmetic procedures in
*  order to replicate the altered images they present online.
*  That's ill.
*  That's ill, bro.
*  That's sick as fuck.
*  Well that is one thing that's happening with social media.
*  It's twisting people's ideas of what's real.
*  Yeah, bro.
*  And I don't know about y'all, but to me, there's such thing as too much.
*  But like the women from 2003, you know what I'm saying?
*  Like who was it?
*  Paris Hilton that made it fucking cute to wear the jeans like below her waist.
*  Those type of women.
*  Like Jennifer Aniston, oh my God.
*  You like that?
*  Oh my God, bro.
*  That's your one?
*  Holy fuck.
*  Yeah.
*  I'd still get her pregnant till this day.
*  Yeah.
*  It might be hard.
*  She's like 50.
*  Yeah, bro.
*  But I mean, probably no eggs left.
*  She's a bad motherfucker.
*  I bet she got a few in there.
*  For real.
*  For real.
*  That's a bad motherfucker right there.
*  Might as well like four months later we hear you got her pregnant.
*  She reaches out.
*  We're gonna hope.
*  We're gonna wish for the best.
*  She loves your music.
*  She wants to meet up.
*  I've never had a Mexican.
*  She's just bored with life and dating these dopey white dudes.
*  Dude.
*  Just decides to step up.
*  Fuck, man.
*  I mean shit, you know.
*  They had a real Mexican rapper.
*  There's her.
*  Bro, that's what I'm saying.
*  Like bro.
*  Damn.
*  Why you picked the one with the dudes?
*  Yeah.
*  She's naked.
*  But isn't there other naked?
*  Well, how about that one right there where she's the boobs, the blue one?
*  Bro, look at her.
*  That's a good one too.
*  How about that blue one on the far right?
*  Right next to that.
*  Yeah, look at that.
*  That's not real?
*  Oh, that's not real.
*  Yeah, that's why I didn't pick that.
*  Damn.
*  Looks good though.
*  Yeah.
*  That's new.
*  That's more recent.
*  I was trying to go with the 90s.
*  She look good even with age.
*  Oh, that's friends.
*  That's like, that's her.
*  That's prom.
*  That's like.
*  Fuck, bitch.
*  You crazy.
*  Shit's sick.
*  Yeah.
*  Fuck, dude.
*  It's easy.
*  Like, man, look at her, bro.
*  It's gotta be a weird world walking around where everybody wants to fuck you.
*  Maybe.
*  Maybe.
*  Definitely.
*  Think so?
*  100%.
*  Yeah, maybe.
*  Imagine just being a regular hot woman.
*  Yeah.
*  Everywhere you go, people are bullshitting you.
*  Yeah, you know what?
*  I agree, bro.
*  Because there was a few days ago, I was at a show and these girls were like, oh, they
*  were whistling.
*  I felt like one smacked me in my ass when I was.
*  Imagine a group of girls leaning against the wall like this, all thugged out and shit,
*  and I just walked past and they all harassed me.
*  I'm like, oh my god, is this what girls feel like?
*  Makes me never want to do it again.
*  Fuck.
*  Yeah, it's even worse.
*  I've been hit on by guys.
*  I used to work out at a gay gym.
*  There was a gym on Cole Street.
*  Hold on, wait.
*  Yeah.
*  When I did News Radio, the sitcom.
*  But why the gay gym?
*  Because I didn't know it was gay.
*  It was just a Gold's Gym.
*  But it was all gay clientele because it was a gay neighborhood.
*  So it was close to the studio.
*  So I could go during my lunch break.
*  I'd get a word from bros.
*  No, no, no, no, no.
*  They weren't like, hey.
*  They were like, hey, what's up?
*  They were like hard, hard gay dudes with fucking Timbalands on and mustaches.
*  And they were all like spotting each other and they all wore the shortest of shorts.
*  It was wild.
*  Pink tank tops.
*  These dudes were men.
*  It was like a gay disco.
*  You ever seen gay disco?
*  Bro, I'm not kidding, man.
*  I was one of maybe three or four straight men in that whole building.
*  What the fuck am I doing?
*  The women were like, they were like a mirage.
*  They would walk through.
*  No, they didn't even notice them.
*  Wow.
*  The women, they must have loved it.
*  Women could just work out there and get no attention.
*  But dudes would try to spot you for no reason.
*  You just spot bro?
*  Like you could just hear like a dagger of their nuts over your head.
*  Like, hey man, I'm good.
*  I'm good.
*  Get out of here.
*  Leave me alone.
*  You ever seen Balls of Fury?
*  Balls of Fury.
*  It's a ping pong movie.
*  No.
*  Fuck, please bro.
*  What is Balls of Fury?
*  There were fucking sex slaves and then he was like, nah.
*  He was like, I shut in.
*  He was like, you know what?
*  I'll do it.
*  Fuck it.
*  And they were like, bet.
*  Well, you know, here comes the sex slaves.
*  And it's like six foot five, dude.
*  Swole as fuck.
*  I imagine exactly what you're saying right now.
*  And they just walking in.
*  Look at this shit.
*  Hold on.
*  Yeah, it's homeboy, the bado awada.
*  Oh, Christopher Walken.
*  Yeah, that's how he talks.
*  That guy's great.
*  Christopher Walken is great and everything.
*  It's a ping pong movie.
*  George Lopez.
*  Oh shit.
*  What year was this?
*  Like oh seven.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh wow.
*  Fucking ping pong movie.
*  That's hilarious.
*  Homeboy right here.
*  Pat Oswalt.
*  Oh, this is hilarious.
*  Now you definitely have to watch it.
*  I feel like they don't make movies like this no more, man.
*  Oh bro, she's another one.
*  When I saw her, I was like, man.
*  It's hard to make a comedy now because everyone's scared to offend anybody.
*  Yeah.
*  Everybody lives in their fucking emotions.
*  Like, bro, who gives a fuck?
*  No, you order this vato, it only burns for a little bit, man.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Well with comedy, they're just worried about getting protested.
*  South Park is still a thing.
*  That's all out the window.
*  I know.
*  But South Park has got the ultimate cheat code.
*  What?
*  It's a cartoon and they don't look at all like people and you can have them doing wild
*  shit.
*  You can have them die.
*  You can be like, oh, they killed Kenny.
*  You bastards.
*  You can have people stuff people up their asses.
*  Remember when that teacher stuffed Paris Hilton up his ass?
*  No, but I remember when he put the gerbil in his ass.
*  You remember that one?
*  That guy put everything in his ass.
*  Dude.
*  South Park is the ultimate show.
*  They had Jesus and Hitler fucking.
*  Yeah, they did.
*  Holy shit.
*  Yeah.
*  Bro, no, South Park was on some shit.
*  He stuffed Paris Hilton up his ass to win the ho-off.
*  Holy shit.
*  Look at that.
*  He shirred her.
*  Right up to the shoes.
*  Jesus.
*  Yeah.
*  What would you do if you came in here and you seen fucking like this tall ass motherfucker
*  and you just see his feet hanging out dangling from the ass?
*  I would be very confused.
*  Would you help?
*  Yeah, I would help him for sure.
*  I would have to.
*  Would you fight him and then pull him out or would you try to pull him?
*  I would shoot him.
*  Shoot him.
*  Yeah, you shoot him.
*  The guy can stuff a man up his ass.
*  You have to shoot that guy.
*  Yeah, definitely.
*  You have to shoot him in the head otherwise you're going to hurt your friend because your
*  friend stuffed in his body.
*  I was just thinking that.
*  Yeah.
*  Imagine if I shot him in the chest and I killed Jamie.
*  No, Jamie.
*  No.
*  You have to shoot him in the head.
*  I killed Jamie.
*  And then you'd have to get people to help you and you have to put your feet on his ass.
*  Oh fuck.
*  Are you doing the mouth to mouth on me afterwards?
*  I think I'm going to have to.
*  I love you.
*  I love you.
*  You're my friend.
*  I'm not going to let you die.
*  Dude, my dad was like two elbows deep in a cow one time trying to help it give birth.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah, that's what I thought of when you said that.
*  Yeah, when they get in there man, they get in there.
*  They're pulling babies out and shit.
*  It's a rough world but that's how people lived forever.
*  Yeah.
*  I had a buddy, he was like 14 years old and he was already for a living, neutering bulls.
*  Jesus.
*  Yeah I was like, you're a bad motherfucker, yo.
*  Jesus.
*  He was showing me videos, snipping the balls and spraying it with some purple spray.
*  He was like, rrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.
*  I was like, bro, that dick, he going to fuck you up.
*  How do they do that?
*  Are the bulls contained in a pen?
*  Yeah, it's like in a little pen, like those pens right before they jump out with that
*  bull riding.
*  Like that and then the balls are hanging out there and they're just reaching and grabbing.
*  Chop.
*  Cut them bad boys.
*  And then they eat them.
*  Rocky Mountain oysters.
*  Do they?
*  Have you ever had them?
*  Yeah.
*  They good?
*  It's not something I would order.
*  Is it fat?
*  Yeah, it's like mushy meat.
*  It's like an organ meat.
*  Do you eat organs?
*  I don't think so.
*  I eat liver.
*  I eat a lot of liver.
*  I think I've had liver.
*  I had liver for breakfast.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, elk liver for breakfast.
*  I saw that elkie knock down out there.
*  I was sick.
*  Yeah, that's what I mostly eat.
*  No shit?
*  No shit.
*  Yeah, it's really good for you.
*  And it's wild protein.
*  You don't have to worry about any hormones or bullshit.
*  But it's expensive, right?
*  I don't eat elk cuts.
*  No, I go get it.
*  Sick.
*  Yeah, I go out there in the mountains and get it.
*  That's one thing, because I'll hunt.
*  I'll take you to, oh, you're going to taste this.
*  I'll bring you back over there where I'm at.
*  We'll be in a helicopter shooting pigs.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Yeah, I've been invited to do that, but my problem with that is that I don't think they
*  eat those pigs.
*  No, we don't.
*  We just leave them there.
*  Is that a problem with you?
*  No, it's not a problem with me.
*  It's a problem because it has to be done.
*  It does have to be done.
*  You can't do that to deers, though.
*  You can't do that to anything else.
*  They do it in other countries.
*  No, that's fucked.
*  They do it in Australia and in New Zealand because they get overpopulated, so they start
*  gunning them down with helicopters.
*  Yeah, see, I've got a fat ass AR.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  I blow these motherfuckers down.
*  But bro, seeing you and watching you, what you do, I've wanted to get on a boat now for
*  the longest.
*  But you've got to be a bad motherfucker, though, bro.
*  It's a lot of discipline.
*  When I think of the bow and arrow and I see you, you look like a fucking Viking, bro.
*  That shit looks badass.
*  I've been doing it a long time.
*  I've been doing archery for 12 years now.
*  No shit.
*  And I do it.
*  That's sick.
*  I've got a little bit of an injury right now.
*  I've got a little bit of a tendonitis in my neck when it flares up when I'm at full draw.
*  So I haven't shot at all for a month.
*  So for one month, I've just been walking around my house, going like this.
*  Because usually it's a part of every day.
*  Every day, I get in front of that target and shoot at least 100 arrows.
*  Damn, that's sick.
*  It has to be a part of your muscle memory.
*  Yeah, it makes sense.
*  In order to be able to do it when you're under pressure, when you're hunting, you have to
*  have ultimate confidence in your ability.
*  And even then, there's so much wild shit happening.
*  Animals moving, they're screaming at each other.
*  You ever heard an elk scream?
*  No, but I bet it's crazy.
*  And when you're in the mountains and you hear that, it sounds like a...
*  A mythical creature.
*  It doesn't even sound like a real animal.
*  I know that, it's beautiful.
*  Sometimes you're on a trail and you're hiding.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  And when it's right up next to you, there's times where you're in the woods hiding.
*  You're hiding behind a tree and these motherfuckers are walking through the trail.
*  So he's doing this 30 feet from you, 40 feet from you.
*  And you're trying to find when you can pull your bow back.
*  Like you hear him walk, and you don't want him to see you, so you gotta stay totally
*  still and wait till he turns his head away.
*  And then you're at full draw and he's screaming,
*  BLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
*  Yeah.
*  That's another thing, like you gotta have patience just fishing, I know you gotta have
*  patience with that shit.
*  Yeah, you have to have patience, you have to be fit.
*  Yeah, that's another thing.
*  You have to be able to go in the mountains and you have to be able to hike 8 miles, 10
*  miles in a day.
*  Fuck, I didn't even think of that.
*  Fuck all that shit.
*  It's hard.
*  A lot of food. Yeah, drink a lot of water and electrolytes. So you got to be ready
*  You can get dehydrated out there easy. Yeah, I believe it. They're worn the fuck and then you're I'm sure you're going somewhere higher
*  Yeah, I'm saying now you got less oxygen. Oh, yeah. Oh, we're at like 8,000 feet most of the time. Yeah
*  Well the elk they don't want to be around you they want to hide up in the place where it's tough to get make sense
*  Yeah, what about a ram? I've always wanted to catch around. I've never done that but they're beautiful

*  I was like bro, you were on fucking boondocks. Yeah
*  Yeah, yeah, I forgot about boondocks. That was my shit, bro
*  Yeah, I used to I used to freestyle over that beat all the time as a kid the intro the instrumental in the outro
*  Oh, wow. Yep. Yep. Yep. I was big on that shit
*  What was the first like people that you work with where they started like making beats for you?
*  My boy tb Robbie he my miss can out there in San Antonio. He definitely still is like one of my in-house producers
*  I love I
*  Love still working with him. I haven't used a beef. Oh, no, I got a beef from a few days ago the music video
*  I dropped tomorrow. It's his beat but lately I've been fucking with bankroll. Got it. It's two white boys out in, California
*  And those two white boys are my pocket. Yeah, they my pocket. Yeah
*  When you do that, what is the process like?
*  Do you have the lyrics in your head and written down and then you have a beat and you go here the beat first
*  Yeah, I don't ever really like to write the lyrics first I like to be first. Yeah. Yeah, and then I just catch it from there
*  So like it very very rare. I'll have like lyrics and then a beat
*  You know I'm saying like I had to have something heavy on my mind
*  You know other than that man, I'm jamming the beach first
*  So did they bring you beats and you know, you say hey, you know, what do you got for me?
*  And then I just text them. Yeah, I just text them send me beats and they'll send me like a fucking fat-ass
*  Fuckload. Really? Yeah, and I know they're good bro, cuz I'm picky with beats
*  Like I've had people send me a beat pack of like 50 and I left with one or two
*  Bankroll, they'll send me like 10 and I'll leave with eight. And so what is your process for listening to them?
*  You do it by yourself. Do you sit there just alone? Like how do you do it? It's always different
*  Like sometimes I'm by myself sometimes, you know saying my boys are with me
*  I like being in my truck when I write sometimes, you know, cuz I just be smoking hot boxing in my truck
*  Just catching that vibe, you know saying if you got a good sound system in your car, yeah
*  I do there's something about driving and listening to music that makes it even more fun because you're heightened because you're driving
*  So you got to pay attention to everything so your brain is kind of fired up and that music comes on
*  Yeah, exactly. Yeah exactly something cuz you're in a box of it, you know, like it has nowhere else to go
*  You know, I think that's what it is
*  I was telling the black keys when I would go to the comedy store one of the things
*  Tell them that miss canotis like an enormous fan. I 100% well, I'm gonna see him tonight. Thank you. I'll see him tomorrow night
*  What I listen to sinister kid sinister kid was like the song that I would listen to when I get on the highway
*  Yeah, cuz it's just like whoo like I'm living in LA. I'm driving to the comedy store. Yeah, let's fucking go
*  When you got a good sound system here it is yeah
*  They just got it
*  We probably get a copyright for that
*  I'll cut it out. Just cut it out. All right, we cut that out, but that's sinister kid that fucking song rules man
*  Their shit is just all authentic. Yeah, they have a new album coming out in April. Holy shit. Is it good?
*  Wow, I got an early copy of it. They let me listen to it. Fuck, dude
*  I love to send you this new shit. I've been working on. I want it. Like I said, I want to name it recess
*  I like it. Yeah, why recess because like bro like man, this is recess to me
*  I go out there and just just be a kid, you know I'm saying I think that's why it's still so fun. Yeah
*  Well, if you can keep it fun, that's the key to life. Yeah, correct
*  That is the key to life. My dad always cuz my dad's a trainer. He's been a trainer his whole life
*  I go like he knows a lot but there's one thing that motherfucker knows. He knows the human body and
*  I
*  Lost it. What was I going? Your dad was a trainer. Oh, yeah
*  Had a Ray Kurzweil flashback right there
*  Yeah, he would always tell people like man like working out ain't even working out like you stop working out one day when you just
*  Stop going to recess
*  you know I'm saying right and
*  I think that's another reason why I really like the word recess for the project cuz like my dad even preached that shit
*  Like just be a kid like it's all working out is at the at the playground having fun
*  You know, they found out that that's the best way people learn things is working out playing Oh playing. Yeah, I completely agree
*  Yeah, yeah, that's a pure moment. Are you just having fun? You know, mm-hmm
*  I was I was watching this video where this
*  this guy was breaking down martial arts development and
*  Learning how to strike and he was like the most important thing is to keep it playful
*  And if you can keep it playful, you'll develop skills much quicker than if you're tense
*  Like if you if it's like scary and work and everything like that is harder to develop those really finely honed skills
*  Great and the best way to develop them is to learn how to play correct
*  So like the the Gracie's the jiu-jitsu guys they were always that was their thing
*  They would always say keep it playful keep it playful when you roll don't that's up. Don't try to kill each other
*  Just keep it playful keep it playful and then you'll develop skills and you have to do it quickly
*  You'll know how to do it. Yeah, like if you really are in a real struggle real fight, you'll know how to do it
*  Yeah, but you don't have to do that every day. Keep it playful learn the moves learn the positions
*  Just get it in your head that it's fun
*  And there's a mindset a play mindset when you're really enjoying it where you get better at things. Mm-hmm
*  My dad had a buddy. He was a jiu-jitsu artist
*  Or fighter. I don't know if you'd call it a martial artist. Yeah, and bro
*  Oh
*  Seeing him he was a white boy and seeing him like do the way I seen him do these dudes up like man
*  That shit's humbling like that's some bad motherfuckers. Like there's levels of this shit is what I'm saying
*  You know I'm saying like I said the way cuz like it's it's different when you of course like it's easy to have control
*  Not easy, but like some people make it look easy having control of their own body
*  But to be able to have control of somebody else's body too, you know saying it's like damn, bro
*  I've seen this motherfucker ragdoll people, you know
*  Yeah
*  Yeah
*  And like he just like he'll move him with his leg like he'll grab him by the like their shirt right here and move him
*  With his right leg and like fucking trip him. It's just crazy, bro. Yeah. Yeah, I like that shit though, man
*  Yeah, learning how to manipulate a human body is a very underrated skill. Yeah. Yeah, it's a good thing to know. Yeah
*  Once you know how to do it
*  It's scary when you've experienced it on you and you don't know how to do it
*  That was a wake-up call for me when I first started doing jiu-jitsu
*  Fight and got stuck
*  I got fucked up over and over and over again. It was so humbling. Yeah
*  I'm humble I had a buddy named Emeril rest in peace Emeril man. That's crazy fucking um
*  He went to our little Rock, Arkansas
*  And he went to a gym over there and he said the first day he went in there and he was just fucking throwing up
*  And he said he said as soon as he threw up everybody in the gym was like, yeah
*  Fucking get up, you know saying he was like brothers some fucking animals in there, you know
*  Went through it already. Yeah, yeah unusual people if you go to a gym and you know, you meet a dude
*  He's a black belt has been doing jiu-jitsu for 12 years bad
*  Motherfucker, I mean that's that dudes put in some numbers my buddy droting. He fucking
*  he's like he's always saying he knows jiu-jitsu in taekwondo and
*  Cuz his son he put his kids in taekwondo. So fucking he you know, he went to class one day for one week
*  And after that he was like like one day I was like man
*  I don't know my guns head I didn't find my gun cuz I don't know where without my gun
*  I'm in church with my gun and he was like man, don't worry, you know, I know taekwondo
*  Yeah, master Lee taught me some shit today
*  Of course you don't know shit, but he just being funny, you know
*  Like nah fuck that shit. Yeah, it's always better to have a gun. He's a tall lanky ass man. He's tall for no reason
*  Tall for no reason. I'm talking about bro. He's walking you just look at his legs and they just look flimsy
*  Like
*  Tall for no reason if I was him bro, if I was as tall as him I'd be an animal
*  Animal it would make me want to be a beast, you know, remember I was telling about fat fat boy early
*  Uh-huh, and you know, he was talking about my mama
*  He's gay but like bro six foot five and just like you see him you think he a solid-ass gangster
*  I bet he worked out that gym. I worked out. Yeah
*  I
*  Said I'm bad boy, man. He's bad motherfucker. Yeah. No, but yeah, I
*  Feel like I feel like a lot of gay people. I've seen some gay people put them some hands on some people
*  Of course their men. Yeah, yeah, but besides that I feel like they were bullied
*  You know say so like they had to like it's not gonna fuck you up. Exactly. You know, yeah
*  You don't want to get fucked up by a dude with a lisp
*  No
*  Stars you see it stars. Holy shit leg kicking you you like, oh no, thank you pissed on you
*  He talking to you with a lisp
*  Fucking I always thought it was funny whenever Canelo learned English he learned English and became a menace
*  Yeah at first he was like, you know, I'm gonna punch him and I go punch him again
*  Now he's like fuck that motherfucker fuck that beach, you know, like damn he's a savage, you know, but like he's a wild dude
*  Yeah, even Sean O'Malley. I just watched that fight with him. I'm like, bro. There's some bad motherfuckers on earth
*  There are some bad motherfuckers on earth. I feel like they need to be in the military
*  Different those are bad motherfuckers too, but it's a different world different type of being a bad motherfucker
*  There's one thing to do it for a sport. It's a dangerous sport
*  There's another thing to do it in defense of your country and that is a lot more intense
*  Yeah, I definitely agree but I mean shit that I feel like I've seen some motherfuckers in the military and like I seen them cry
*  I'm like, what the fuck are you doing? Like this dude just yelled at you and you tripping on that
*  You know cuz they're emotional. Yeah want to do well
*  Those are the kind of guys you want now do well so much. No, no
*  So you saying they're crying because they were broken down. Yeah, just pushes like fucking me. I'm saying that's a nut thing, bro
*  Like don't get it twisted like what you're saying
*  I completely agree then there's some people and it's like why are you on infantry?
*  Well, they probably did it because they thought they wanted something to toughen them up
*  There's a lot of people like that. They feel like they don't have any discipline. They'll just join the military
*  I felt like that when I was 18 really when I was 18
*  The army had a taekwondo team and I was gonna join the army taekwondo team
*  Because I wanted to be able to train and in the army they they had it like a legitimate
*  Organized team that they would send to tournaments
*  There's this dude clay barber he fought for the US Army team and I remember he was like real good like one of the top
*  Guys in the country see I wanted to be like him. Yeah, and I was like, oh this dude's in the army
*  Maybe I'll join the army and then I talked to recruit. I'm like get the fuck out of here
*  What are you talking about?
*  It's and also like you don't get just because you know, you're a state champion or when won the US Open whatever
*  I had won at the time. Yeah, I'd won a bunch of tournaments
*  There was no guarantee that they were gonna have me compete for the army's team and then they might just fucking send me to Iraq
*  Right. I didn't know where I was going
*  Can you help me can you help me find this book I believe it's called through through the
*  Bob wire through Bob wire. It's about this dude. He's from Belgium and as a kid he had
*  He had heart problems
*  He had asthma all this stuff that would just like just hold him back for every for everything like being able to just go outside
*  And have fun and when he was like seven eight years old it just all disappeared and he went into taekwondo or karate or something and
*  Eventually that one thing led to another and he's in fucking Bangkok fighting underground fighters and bro
*  There was this there was it's and it's him
*  It's a book about his life and he's fighting this dude taller than him and he says he was like he didn't know how to dominate
*  This man, he's just a giant-ass motherfucker
*  He said he jumped up on the back of him fucking bit him on the side of his neck
*  And he said he fucking shoved his hand in that hole where he bit and fucking ripped his neck
*  Jesus yeah underground Bangkok fight Belgium, dude, probably like 5a
*  There's a bunch of people that are doing that shit now and you could find videos of it online
*  They're having these street fights where they'll pay people more money if you bite a chunk off the dude
*  So dudes are biting chunks off dudes ears and faces. Yeah, but this was then you know saying like I'm saying it's still going on
*  Yeah, but I think he did this like to survive this wasn't about money like he had to win the fight
*  You know, yeah, yeah
*  I do believe that though
*  I believe that there's places like I feel like there's places out right now that they just snatch people up and then they'll put
*  Them you ever seen the movie hostile. Mm-hmm. Oh, that's real. Yeah, we were talking about what they used to do
*  It's called Shanghai and someone they used to they used to take people and they would drug them and then they'd wake up on a boat
*  And you had to go to work
*  You'd be they were sending you off to China. They send you off to Shanghai to work
*  Yeah, they would kidnap people and force them into slave labor, holy shit, yeah, they called it Shanghai you get Shanghai
*  listen to this this dude was smoking he was in a cabin with his buddy and
*  Alaska somewhere where it's snowing and
*  Him and his buddy were smoking
*  he said this is how because you know dreams like when you dream a dream is probably eight seconds long at most and
*  He said that fucking
*  He was smoking with his buddy and he hit this weed and he just fell out boom hit the floor and when he woke up
*  He was completely soaking wet and inside of a boat and these people were like, bro. You okay?
*  You good like you almost drowned. Are you good? He's like, what the fuck are you? I don't know the fuck y'all are
*  You know I'm saying right and um
*  He was like bro. What are you talking about? I'm your best friend. This is your wife all this and that he was like, bro
*  I don't know who the fuck y'all are like at all and then you know two years passed three years passing
*  I still don't know the fuck y'all are like I'm sorry and
*  Five years passed six years passing. He's like, I don't know. I guess this is reality, you know, fuck it
*  Like I guess I was tripping maybe and then eight years passed and one day he's just sitting there
*  And he fucking falls out when he falls out
*  He wakes up and he wakes up in that cabin and this homeboy was like bro. Are you good?
*  You were out for like five seconds
*  I
*  Lived a whole eight-year span in five seconds. I have a friend of mine on a podcast
*  He smoked salvia Wow smoke salvia on a podcast and went into a dark hole and he said he lived a whole
*  Another life. He lived another life. He had relationships. He had jobs. Did he say he lived underwater? Do you see lived underwater?
*  Yeah, he was under water years, right? Yeah
*  And then he came back that's how crazy the mind is you see him coming back. He's like what?
*  What happened and this was right here? What's up when he was coming back?
*  He was struggling to breathe air because he learned to breathe water water. Yeah
*  But here's the thing here's the thing that sounds insane
*  It sounds insane, but this guy was saying that he was there for like months. Oh, yeah six months that he lived a life
*  He had relationships. He had jobs. I believe it and he just that was his life for six months
*  then all suddenly came back like I think
*  There might be neighboring dimensions where time moves differently and you can access them to psychedelics
*  Yes, I think that's possible what what it's going on right now. We're just not tapped in exactly
*  I was talking to my buddy fee about this. He brought it up. He was like it's going on right now
*  Yeah, you know like those things you see we're just not tapped into it
*  Yeah, well, that's one of the big theories about aliens is that they're here all the time
*  Would you smack an alien down? No, it's not behind the barbed wire World War two US Marine captured North China
*  1941 no, sir prison by the Japanese till 45. Holy shit. That sounds insane though, but that's not it
*  Bob wire maybe it's he's a bald dude bald white man shredded. Yeah, he's not big enough just lean and shredded

*  I'll be hearing Tyson talk about all those those warriors that he studied. Mm-hmm, bro. Some of them like
*  They fell into my algorithm and like I just started learning about them. Yeah. Yeah, there's some bad motherfuckers
*  I think you were talking to a dude that like he fucking had blades and like shoved them in his arm or some shit like that
*  What you talking to do this at that?
*  He shoved him as on like he had blades in his arms and like he fucking came back and killed everybody like they cut his
*  Arms off and killed this family or some shit like I don't know about that. What is that? Do you know we're talking about?
*  I don't know. No, this dude was a real warrior
*  Or at least that's what y'all were talking about
*  Yeah
*  Who was it was it the Chris Williamson one? I don't know y'all were talking about warriors though. Mm-hmm. I
*  Don't know. I don't know either
*  He replaced his arm with a sword both of them they cut both of his hands off Jesus Christ
*  He looked like Barack. Oh, yeah. Oh god. I found the clip of us talking about it. Okay with
*  Yeah, and oh Cory Sanhagan
*  I forget everything after a month of learning something but one of the one of the warriors was this Aztec dude
*  He got captured by the other team. They took him
*  They cut off his hands to like try to like make him miserable for his entire life
*  They sent him back to his camp
*  This guy like glues on knives onto his hands and then just commits the rest of his life to just like
*  When all of these people that I did that according to legend after his right hand was cut off by the Spanish Galvarino
*  Boldly held up his left hand offering up for his captives to amputate
*  He displayed no emotion as it was cut off and his future features recorded
*  No pain and because that's like the type of dude that I was trying to like to come sometimes
*  That's what I feel like I'm watching you on right now
*  Yeah
*  Well, you are this is crazy, but there's no TV right that's Cory Sanhagan. He's a bad motherfucker himself
*  He's one of the best UFC fighters. He's a bantamweight top contender bro Benavides. I've been watching him a lot
*  Oh, it's canal and Benavides gonna get together
*  From what? I don't know cuz I don't have too much knowledge of it from what I've been hearing he'd been running Canelo been running
*  He's gotta fight Benavides. Yeah, but I don't think he won't fuck his record up, you know
*  Is a body snatcher bro that motherfuckers a body snatcher bro like now take souls
*  Yeah, no, I think souls different bro. He's different and he missed. Yeah. He's a bad dude. I love that shit
*  He's a bad dude. He's a bad dude and he's relentless that motherfuckers relentless, you know, like his last fight
*  Who do you fight his last fight?
*  He fought even Tyson was saying he's an animal
*  Did he didn't he fight Charlo?
*  He fought one of the Charlo brothers, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, just beat him down man. He's an animal
*  Yeah, he's something special. There's there's dudes that come along with their what David Goggins likes to say uncommon amongst uncommon men
*  That's Benavides. Yeah, he has to fight Canelo that would be a trap
*  They and they can't wait like Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao did they can't wait until they're older
*  They have to fight now prime and now's the time and I know Canelo has one more fight scheduled
*  He's got a fight scheduled right now and people are mad at him because the May 4th fight
*  He's not mean that is the one right Mexican Independence Day. You're gonna fight on that weekend, bro
*  You're supposed to be fighting
*  Benevides, that's the fight. That's the fight. Everybody wants to see he running
*  Yeah, I think that I think that's what I've been hearing lately Demetrius on draw. That's who it was. That's right. That's right
*  Beat the dog shit out of that's right. Canelo fought one of the Charlotte brothers. That's right. I'm sorry
*  Yeah, and Demetrius on drought is a bad motherfucker and he was doing really well in the beginning of that fight because
*  He's a real slick boxer great mover, but Colin Kevin Harlan Kevin Harlan's a bad man
*  I forgot I met Michael venom page this weekend though. No, but I
*  Think I was I think I was at a show but he walked out to my music
*  Oh, they really he's been walking out to like Johnny Dango to or to

*  It's sick, right? There's no comparison
*  There's no sport like it where if you go to 1993 and watch it and to 2024 and watch it is completely different
*  Yeah, they're so much better. Everyone's so much better
*  Oh, yeah, cuz like it's all mastered now. Yeah, the sports complete
*  There's so many different styles and they'll so many different approaches even amongst the champions. There's so many different
*  Practitioners correct some guys are just strikers. Some guys are just grapplers
*  They all know how to do everything but they have styles and specials
*  I used to I used to watch the the grappling fights and be like well
*  This is bullshit
*  But then when I fucking saw it in person and like I got I have a buddy that does it I was like oh
*  Yeah, no, these are bad motherfuckers, too
*  Well, if you tried it yourself if you tried you just do yourself. No, I got fucked up. That's what I'm saying
*  Yeah, I got I got fucking humbled. Yeah, you know saying but if you learn how to do it
*  Then you really appreciate it because then you understand how difficult it is to do what they're doing
*  Yeah, and you also see the paths you see like is he gonna go? Oh, he went for it. Oh shit
*  Oh, look at that. Okay, he's got secured this he's got that. Oh, he moved him out
*  Oh, you know like you see the transitions and all the different chess moves that they're playing. Yeah, correct, correct
*  Yeah, you remind me when you said the understanding
*  That's what I wanted to say earlier, but we ended up talking about something else the music shit I
*  Just know of music. I
*  Don't know how to read music. I don't even know how to count bars
*  You know I'm saying I just know of it right imagine if I fully understood it. Why don't you I'm going to eventually
*  You know I'm saying it's just not my time right now. You know I'm saying I'm doing what I'm doing enjoying it
*  I definitely want to elevate though when I understood that I was like, bro

*  He was making his beats. Mmm. You know I'm saying like and he was really delivering that shit, bro
*  He had a swagger to him and like
*  Nobody nobody wanted to fuck with him
*  And that's why I make him even more of a beast cuz like when nobody wanted to fuck with him
*  They had no choice, but to fuck with him right it was so in their face. It was so good
*  It became undeniable exactly and it was so good that if you didn't like it you were a dry-ass hater
*  You know I'm saying yeah, like you're just dry hating cuz like you know that shit good. Yeah, those are the saddest people

*  Mid fight people fighting and that song come on bro. Why boys were mullets the black boys the Miskins
*  Everybody singing mid fight. We stopped fighting. We jamming really like that's what zero do to us Wow
*  Real life. It's funny how some dudes like that. They just don't get out into the mainstream for some reason people don't know
*  He don't need to be mainstream. He's ours. Oh
*  What's selfish with that shit, you know, I'm saying there's some people that don't I was jamming that shit in New York and some
*  People like oh my god, what is this? I'm like it blows my mind. Yeah, I don't know but that's okay
*  You know I'm saying like I'm okay with being selfish with zero cuz he had Texas legend
*  Like like I said, he's he's on the Mount Rushmore for us. Like yeah, you know I'm saying like what's the Texas Mount Rushmore?
*  You gotta have the ghetto boys in there we gonna put Scarface on there ghetto boys. Yeah for sure
*  I don't think you could put the full Scarface. I mean, it's a full ghetto boys though. I'd be a little unfair
*  Unfair I think so. They were all bad motherfuckers though
*  Definitely especially Willie D because he was backing that shit up. Yeah, I'm saying but like Scarface had the voice
*  He was cool at telling stories Bushwick just had a look to him and he was also good at it
*  But even then like I didn't you know, you said Willie D wrote that shit for him. Yeah, you know I'm saying
*  Willie D wrote a lot of shit. That's what I'm saying. He wrote most of the ghetto boy shit. Yeah. Yeah
*  Yes, I'm saying bro, like
*  You you I don't think you put Bush on there. I respect Bush like shit
*  I need my dog after me, you know saying like I love Bush, you know, but I
*  Would definitely they say scar even got Willie just cuz he got that voice. Mm-hmm. You know Sam. Yeah
*  Keith what wasn't there a fourth member to the ghetto boys, right? What's his name Keith some shit like that? I know
*  Jamie'll find it
*  Dude we still haven't found that book fuck that's gonna bother the fuck out of me bro
*  Like he's really a bad motherfucker. I'm gonna find it. Yeah, I'm gonna find it. Yeah, he's a bad motherfucker, bro
*  I think they made a movie about the his life too if I'm not mistaken because I remember reading
*  Like what is it called on the end of the book on the autobiography or whatever?
*  Like I said, they said something about a movie
*  Mmm. Yeah. Well, there's a lot of movies that never get made. Yeah, they're in the process getting made it never happens
*  Yeah, zero though bro back to zero man
*  He's just a champion bro, and and and people people be like Pac will he got that pain each bro now
*  Did nobody go through pain the way the way the way zero went through it losing his mama
*  Nobody wanted to fuck with him. Nobody wanted to hand him the weed
*  you know I'm saying like everybody loved Pac cuz he was like he was a movie star like he was a
*  Role model right zero was like really good a raw uncut, you know, I'm saying from the streets
*  Nobody want to fuck with him. You know, I'm saying people hating on them, you know, I'm saying
*  Yeah, and like I love it because he made the people have no choice but to love and respect his music at one point
*  Because it was just so in their face
*  You know I'm saying and me being Mexican. I'm playing a black predominant game
*  So like I had to put it in their face same thing with Paul. He white having to put it in their face
*  Yeah, so when it's in whenever you when you come up like that, it's it's more respectable, you know, right?
*  I love that's undeniable. Correct. Yeah, like I said Pac he influenced the world, which is cool
*  But like he wasn't making better music than zero in my personal opinion. Well, you're allowed to have your opinion. Yeah, correct
*  Yeah, it's also and it might also be just cuz I'm from Texas
*  That's what I grew up on like you were growing up with Pac
*  You would have a different opinion you see what I'm saying, of course
*  But I personally feel like cuz he was singing he was making music
*  You know saying Pac was rapping and then he'd have like a sample come and sing
*  You know saying and he wasn't making no beats right zero was putting that shit together
*  You know, I don't you're saying yeah like that shit have you listened to Kanye's new shit
*  No, but to be honest to be fair though. I haven't been listening to anything new. I've been like so tunnel vision in my own shit
*  Yeah, you know if I'm jamming anything it's not rap like I'm jamming some three-day grace or some fucking smack guard
*  You know something like that makes it up in your head. Yeah
*  You know, I don't want to listen to rap. I'm already surrounded by so much, right?
*  That makes sense and then like you're not only that, you know, I really jam like rock and country
*  I just happen to be good at rapping, you know I'm saying so most of the time when you're in your car
*  rapping country
*  Rocking rock and country. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm I don't know why bro
*  I just like I've never never just emo never had an emo phase or nothing. I just love that music
*  Yeah, love that's me with the 60s rock. Yeah, like Hendrix. Yeah, love Hendrix
*  That's how I named this podcast the Joe Rogan experience the Joe Rogan experience with
*  I even have the alien picking up the cow right there
*  You do. Yeah, what do you think about aliens? What do you think is going on with all that?
*  I think they're in the water. I think space is a distraction
*  I think I think NASA maybe used to be in the water and they seen something that scared the living shit out of them
*  And they never wanted to go back. Mmm, I don't know we were talking to your homeboy outside like I love the water
*  I think it's one of the most beautiful places ever
*  But if they threw me in the water, I would die of heart failure before I died from an animal in there
*  Mmm, one of my biggest fears, but it's also one of like something I've always wanted to do because I think it's beautiful
*  Yeah, but it's not our jungle right now. You're so vulnerable. Yeah, like the fuck out here
*  It's so vulnerable. You're not even like I mean you are as vulnerable as a shark is on land, correct?
*  You walk right up to shark on land and go bitch. Yeah, exactly
*  You can't do a thing that shark fucking that with that jet speed coming. He's not even gonna eat you
*  He just gonna fucking you know run into you and knock your ass or just take your legs
*  Yeah, just takes your legs away from you like that. Yeah, some people be trying to be like no scary movies made them like that
*  Yeah, no those things are vicious. I don't give a fuck what you're just not a lot of people in the water
*  That's all it is. Yeah, the number of people in the water is relatively small compared to the overall population
*  That's why they're not killing that many people. Yeah, they kill somebody in Hawaii once a year. No shit. Yeah, man
*  There's a guy just got got the other day the way you go hunting
*  Do you like going fishing like that? Like would you go deep-sea fishing? Yeah, I go deep-sea fishing
*  Damn, I'm always one of the so so on my bucket list. I want to catch a swordfish
*  Yeah, yes, I want I'm talking about I want to fight for that I want to almost fall out the boat
*  You know like I really want to fight. I want to earn that shit
*  Fucking swordfish. I think that'd be badass. Yeah, that's a delicious fish, too
*  That's a good one to catch you eat that fucker you eating that fucker for a year. Yeah. Yeah, so like boots
*  I love boots pericou fish. Yeah, it's my favorite. Yeah. Yeah, definitely. It's definitely my go-to for the skin
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah the pericou that does look badass. I've seen some dude here had one
*  It's one of the guests had a pair of fish boots on. Yeah, I was like those are fish
*  Yeah, you see the dude was it did it look kind of like pineapple like it was yeah, like where the scales were. Yeah
*  Yeah, that's what it is. It's pericou fish. Wow. I like alligator. I like eel. There it is. Yeah
*  I got to yeah, I got I got both of those two you just click right there them brown ones and them black and white ones
*  What is a pericou? What does that look like? Oh, let's look it up
*  I know it's a big-ass fish
*  It must be big if the skin so fucking thick you can make boots out of it. That's wild
*  I mean, there's some fish skin boots were like it looked like scaly
*  You know, oh look at that fucker. Yeah, that's a big motherfucker. Whoa
*  What a crazy looking fish
*  You can't tell me there's not no damn alien. Well, that is a dinosaur sir. Yeah
*  Oh, Paul try to tell me he don't believe in dinosaurs. Oh, that's hilarious Paul
*  He just thinks it was bullshit like he thinks it was just like a conspiracy theory there is a whole conspiracy theories that dinosaurs didn't
*  Exist. Yeah, I'm sure
*  They're that fucking pocket still living in Greece right now. Yeah, that's a little more ridiculous
*  Yeah, that actually is probably less ridiculous than dinosaurs not being real
*  I mean what the fuck do you think those bones are like the idea that pocket's dead?
*  It's not likely but in a world
*  Like if you decided to fake murder someone and that send that person to Spain and they live in Spain
*  The problem is pox too famous
*  It doesn't make sense. Everyone would see him somewhere as tourists everywhere. They're like that guy looks exactly like Tupac
*  They take a picture of them and then people would realize Tupac still alive great
*  so it's physically possible for Tupac to be alive, but
*  Extremely extremely extremely unlikely. It's not possible
*  And turtles it's not possible for dinosaurs to not be real. We know too much
*  Yeah, we know we know like what year they died. Yeah, I mean with these the carbon dating
*  They know which animals lived 250 million years ago, which animals lived 65 million years ago. They know all that
*  I'm a huge fan of rhinos. I love rhinos and bro. They just the the black rhino one of them
*  I forgot which one it was just went extinct. Yeah, bro. Yeah, those motherfuckers survived pangea
*  Survived fucking lava didn't survive bullets. They couldn't survive humans
*  No, people started using them for their horns the horns
*  That's what they got to the point people were going out there and shaving the horns down so they wouldn't kill. They still do that
*  Yeah, like fuck. Yeah, they see they the horns are very popular in Asia and they make like a tea out of them
*  It's supposed to give you hard-ons. No shit. I mean it probably doesn't even work
*  Yeah, it's probably just some old wives to a pair of those rhinos and honey peck like what the fuck are y'all doing taking those?
*  some some countries there's groups of wealthy people that want to eat endangered animals and
*  They they get off on it. They get off on the fact that they're they'll they'll have dinner and like eat a tiger steak
*  They get they get off on the fact that they're eating something that's forbidden
*  And one of the things that they like to do is drink rhino tea
*  Very expensive very hard to get and they'll sit around drink rhino tea together. Yeah shark fin
*  Yeah, I think so. Yeah, that sucks. Yeah, it sucks for the shark
*  But yeah, yeah, I mean it sucks for the whole thing that you're knocking these motherfuckers off for a fin
*  I know it's pretty ridiculous. It's it's not even that good. Yeah, I had a shark fin soup when I was a kid
*  It's okay. I get it liver is better
*  No liver is better for you probably but shark fin soup tastes pretty good, but it's like it's not the way they do it
*  It's disgusting. They just chop the fucking if they ate the fish look this you can eat sharks. They're good
*  They taste good Mako sharks delicious, but eat the whole thing
*  Yeah
*  But then people started getting crazy because they chopped the fins off shark like you should never kill sharks like then you're gonna have
*  Overpopulation of sharks great like there's places where they have an overpopulated
*  Population of sharks and if you kill them people get mad at you like listen
*  They're in Florida and Florida Keys that you're allowed to kill bull sharks. They those motherfuckers are everywhere
*  Yeah, you see I watch these videos these dudes fishing in the Florida Keys because they fish off the piers and
*  It's a race to get that fish to a net before shark kid kills it
*  Well, the sharks are everywhere this giant bull sharks and bull sharks are the most aggressive and bull sharks live in freshwater
*  So shark can swim upriver and get all the way to fucking, Illinois
*  They've found bull sharks in the Mississippi River like deep deep deep into the country. Damn. That's crazy
*  Yeah, well, you know jaws the movie jaws
*  It was based on something that happened in New Jersey in a freshwater river
*  Oh, yeah, the sharks were in a freshwater river
*  So these people would go swimming in the river and these sharks start fucking these people up. Oh
*  Yeah
*  In a river, yeah, like you think what's in that river trout salmon
*  Nope sharks sharks made it all the way up into this freshwater and because I love Lake Travis that fucks me up
*  Well, I think Lake Travis is okay. Yeah, you would have heard by now. Yeah, definitely
*  Yeah, Lake Travis is not what you need to worry about. Where are the piranhas at? What's piranhas at Brazil?
*  Yeah, Amazon. Yeah different parts of South America, bro fucking andacondas andacondas are I can't believe those are fucking real
*  See the biggest one they just caught no, there's just found one. There was 28 feet long, bro. Yeah, there's video of it
*  It's insane. It's so fucking big. I have a friend of mine Paul Rosalie. He lives in the Amazon
*  he does a lot of work and preserving the rainforest and
*  He hopped on one and he said it was so big he couldn't get his arms around it 26 feet long
*  It's so big couldn't get his arms around his arms around it. Look at the size of this thing
*  Look how big this thing is and then I'm swimming next to it bitch. You're crazy
*  Look how big that fucking thing was snapping look at the size of that thing's head. I mean
*  That thing is just steady and everything it wants goats. There's a there's a snake. I mean, there's a snake
*  There's a video on YouTube of a fucking snake throwing up a kangaroo. This guy's out of his fucking mind
*  Yeah, he's like look at it. Look at the size of that thing
*  Like it's a pet or something slithering around under that water and they can't even breathe water
*  They're just under there
*  They just use their legs use their their they use their their body to undulate. I'd be scared fucking shit
*  Yeah, they move pretty fucking fast to the squid to look at squid one. Yeah. Well, there's giant squid
*  You ever see that squid that they found they found it on
*  An oil rig they had a deep water camera on an oil rig and they're like what the fuck is this?
*  It looks like an alien. It was a new species of squid. They'd never seen before that had like crab legs
*  Yes, look at that thing. Yes
*  What the fuck is that it's an alien that's what I'm trying to tell you bro. They're not in space
*  I mean look at that
*  If that was in space
*  You would 100% think that was an alien if we went to another planet and you saw that thing floating around the sky
*  He'd be like, oh my god the magnificent alien and everyone who want to study it 2007. Yeah, what the fuck?
*  Yeah, 2007 they found that thing
*  Well, they've always known that giant squids were real
*  But I don't think they really caught him on camera until like a decade or so ago. This was in the Gulf of Mexico
*  Look at that one
*  That's in the good. That's where I'm from
*  Magnapina squid attack. Look at the fucking length of that thing. That's insane
*  Look how long those tentacles go Jesus
*  While they technically tentacles, what would you call them and look how thick they are long?
*  They are look at the bottom one. Where the fuck is the end of that thing?
*  Man, how long is that? What the fuck is that swimming in the bag? Is that black dot? Yeah, what is that?
*  No, bro, yes, I'm saying this to be I would die of heart failure
*  Yeah, that's on the camera I'd be terrified bro, yeah, you should be terrified look at that thing do you think they sting?
*  Oh, yeah, they must they do something. I mean there's got to be some reason that it has this long long
*  Appendages, I don't know jellyfish are pretty that's true too, but they oh wow. Look at it moving around. That's how it got out of there
*  Oh, look at him it's reaching out towards the camera look how close it got
*  Wow, bro, it's an alien and by the way, they only know what like is in look how fast is going. Yeah
*  Crazy how moves I just guessed there's so long because there's nothing down there in the second
*  One of those tentacles touches something that thing is gone. That's seven thousand feet. Yeah
*  There's nothing there seven thousand feet below the ocean that thing lives
*  Oh
*  Yeah, that's the thing bro, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you
*  Oh, yeah, those crazy fish that live in the bottom that actually have illumination. Yeah
*  Yeah, that's what I'm saying
*  Luminous ins they have bio luminescence. So their body actually makes light
*  Do you think eventually will be on Mars living?
*  Yeah, if human beings don't kill themselves, eventually we'll figure out how to get to Mars and set up a colony
*  Yeah, I think there's probably life on Mars at one point in time
*  Really? Yeah, they think life at Mars had a stable atmosphere and Mars had water
*  Yeah, you think do you think?
*  Do you think that the moon landing was real? I?
*  Don't know. I hope it's not really. Yeah, it's more exciting if it was fake. Yeah, correct
*  It's more it's more exciting to know that something so big could be faked and that that hoax could last for so long
*  Correct until they go back dude. I bet people would be fucked
*  Yeah, they would be there would be it would be really rough if we found out that the moon landing was fake
*  Yeah
*  And there's a lot of people that think it's fake including a lot of people that have studied it
*  And then there's a lot of people think it's real and a lot of people that know a lot about it
*  The cameraman had to have been the first person not Neil, right?
*  Well, I think they probably had a camera supposedly set up to capture Neil climbing out of the lunar rover the lunar lander
*  But the fun part is that they faked it the fun the fun theory is that there was no way to get through the Van
*  Allen radiation belts and that we were in a war with Russia cold war with Russia to who could get to the moon first and
*  That we faked it
*  It's that's a fun way to say
*  Because it's news stand for it news and news the word news. Yes, sir. Isn't that a acronym? What is it national and
*  Entertainment
*  So I know it's entertainment some entertainment
*  Why do I keep seeing a dude right there with no clothes on? Oh, that's a that's a Elon Musk
*  That's this dude people. He's a digital artist. He created us this NFT and it also has a digital art
*  It's like a swole giga Chad. It's like super swole Elon Musk once AI allows you to edit your body
*  I seen this AI of Elon Musk and he was like no notable events were oh what notable events weather and sports
*  They don't agree I mean
*  Okay, the world news has been claimed to be an acronym of the four cardinal directions northeast with west and south
*  However, the old spelling of the words varied from new ease new is
*  Any w is any vi s any us, huh? So what was that? What's the origin of the word then?
*  It's not an acronym, okay people think news is an acronym, but it's not it's not okay
*  It makes sense is like what's new what's new what's going on that's new what does news mean it stands for a notable event
*  It says that no no that says it said verify yeah, no, it's not okay
*  Collected a new events as referred to news. No, I think that's what it is. I think it's new events
*  Is an acronym see this is there
*  Okay, no the claim that's Snopes. Okay. I think it's just what's new
*  That's crazy, but people always make acronyms out of things, you know, yeah. Yeah
*  Harry Harry Eve, but they to be yeah
*  Here everything's better. That's what HB supposed to be. Yeah. Yeah, they just people do that all the time with stuff
*  They also do it because makes them sound more intelligent correct, you know pretend that this you know what it really means
*  My cousin Romeo that motherfucker he'd be getting my stupid ass all the time
*  But he'll make words up and that motherfucker like he just make it sound so real. He commits bro
*  He'd be making me think like damn I gotta buy a new part, you know saying fuck it Romeo punk ass
*  I love that motherfucker man. I love my family, bro
*  Well, one of the things I really like about you is how much you credit people and how much you you talk well about people
*  And you know, you're really interested in elevating people around you. Mm-hmm
*  You know, bro, I've been dicking a third bro. Like I know what it's like to be nobody and loved by nobody
*  You know I'm saying that's I wouldn't wish that upon my worst enemy, you know, like
*  It's good being lonely. I like being lonely, you know saying easy time to think you could fucking figure shit out
*  You know I'm saying people are headaches sometimes too
*  But being lonely is fuck that you know being lonely forever is the worst place to be. Yeah
*  Yeah, we need each other. That's what we were talking about earlier like to be the only person who's doing well, it's crazy
*  You don't want to be that yeah, that's a terrible place to be. Yeah, and then you're surrounded by people are mad at you
*  All I want to do is just make friends bro, like everywhere I go people love me
*  But they're because I come correct, you know saying I treat it good
*  I make them feel people only start hating when they feel up excluded, right?
*  You know saying but you give that motherfucker broom and tell him go sweep and he gonna be happy
*  That is true. People feel mad when they get excluded. They feel jealous and bitter and angry. It's the walled garden
*  You know, they see you having a good time over there and they can't even be a part of that like fuck that dude
*  Yeah, fuck those people cuz they associate their bad feelings of being rejected with you doing something to them
*  you know, I
*  Was just one dude I seen back mom from and I was like man, what's up cuz he was just like what's up?
*  I was like
*  Okay, I could really talk some shit to you but then I'll be down bad cuz you down bad
*  You know I'm saying but like man like I just tried to make him feel good. I was like man. I love you, bro
*  I don't love that motherfucker at all. And matter of fact, I probably have hate towards them. But like man, I love you, bro
*  Well, you might change the way he thinks if you said that when you said that and said you I love you
*  Maybe how to confront his own shit. How long has it been a dick that dude?
*  Yeah, like cool to me cuz because he's excluded, you know, I'm saying right well, yeah, I love you, bro
*  I really like it. Yeah, I don't even hate you not take it back. I don't think I hate no
*  I don't want to hate nobody
*  Yeah, you know if you can get through your life without hating people you'd be way better off. Yeah
*  I got grudges. I got grudges since like the third grade. That's just me though, but I don't think I hate nobody
*  I don't want to hate nobody and you wish you probably didn't have those grudges. Mm-hmm. Yeah, it's a better way to live
*  It is and get through life with as little hate as possible. That's good cuz that hate
*  What's that old expression that hate is on the only?
*  poison that that
*  Affects the vessel that holds it. Yeah, I don't know what you're saying
*  But I know my Bob whenever my dear rose pests, you know, we were talking about it and he was like she was just always mad
*  You know I'm saying like her anger is what drove her to the dirt
*  There's a lot of people that live life like that it's a defense mechanism at first, you know, it's how you stay alive
*  It's self preservation. You stay angry keep people away from you that are gonna hurt you
*  Mark Twain once said anger is an acid that can do more harm to the vessel in which it's stored than anything on which it's poured
*  Perfect never solves any problem or worry rather. It makes us more stressful
*  100% 100% yeah, I do agree. Yeah, if you can get through life with no hate no anger, you'll be way better off
*  My dad always said you're gonna bitch and moan about it. You're gonna fucking figure it out
*  I think that was my words that you know same thing too
*  It's a lot of life is how you address a situation
*  You could decide that this situation is the end of your world and life sucks down life falls apart
*  Oh, you could say okay. I'll learn from this. Yeah, correct. Correct. I can get something out of this
*  It's a the hat the glasses half for half empty. Mm-hmm
*  Yeah, so where you at from here where you going
*  SPI going to South pie South Padre Island. That's what I'm saying
*  Like my shows bro, like my fans spoiled me bro, like it's cool performing at the rodeo
*  It's cool doing all this other stuff
*  But those aren't my shows right when they're my shows and the crowds all yours and hit different
*  Yeah, you know and like man like like I said, bro, it's it's a beautiful moment. They they babied me, you know, that's awesome, man
*  Mm-hmm. I love my friends. So South Padre Island is gonna be crazy and it's number Rasa out there
*  You know number miskins out there. They feel go crazy
*  But they treat me like I'm Michael Jackson, bro. Well, you're you're the fucking man right now. I'm trying it's exciting
*  I'm trying it's exciting time for you
*  And I feel like the beautiful part about my story is like broth and be a 20 plus years, you know
*  I see myself being in this game forever because like I just besides the fact of me just not knowing what else to do
*  It just comes too natural
*  You know like I as a fear. I always had a fear
*  As a kid that I would eventually just stop having shit to talk about like I'm because I'm I might I'd be like bro
*  How do people do it like they make new songs every day, right? I
*  Was like 13 years old when I thought that
*  Yeah, you know saying like well I would like I just I just needed to live more but that's every artists fear
*  You're running out of things to make run out of things to say and also sounding repetitive. That's another thing
*  Yeah, it's always been a fear of mine
*  But like like I said, it's recess so I have no walls like I'll bounce everywhere. Well, that's a beautiful approach
*  How often you touring?
*  Every time I drop a project. I like the tour
*  I mean, I'm pretty much torn 24 fucking 7 because I'm always booked
*  You know I'm saying even when I'm not having a tour
*  I got side shows and shit like that, but every time I drop a project
*  I like to you know have a tour with it, you know saying like I just dropped this project March 1st
*  it's called Texas Technician and
*  I probably work it for like a month or two and then once they have it all memorized and down boom
*  I'm a jump on the road with them. Yep. That's it. So Texas Technician. I wanted to go with the CD just because like
*  Like I
*  Where I'm from like even riff-raff being at Sharps town, you know, I'm saying hand and see these out like check me out
*  Check me out. Check me out. Like that was the hustle of it
*  That was the beauty in it, you know I'm saying and I feel like I wish that was still a thing
*  Cuz like I hold pride in and hand the CDs out, you know, I'm saying like that shit's cool, bro
*  Especially cuz I don't look like I rap especially as good as I do it
*  You know I'm saying so like when they see me and they're like man
*  Fuck it like that one person just gonna happen to put it in and then he hears like what the fuck
*  You know, I'm saying sound like you look. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, so it fucks them up, you know, yeah
*  I like that hustle though, you know, like I guess it's a south side thing
*  I think that's a part of our music culture though, you know, Texas, you know
*  We're handing CDs out and shit like that cuz we just hustlers. Yeah, you know, we don't gangbang
*  We don't pop me. Yeah, there's gangbangers out here shit, but we're not politicking. We're not we're not worried about that bullshit

*  Go and I looked up and I just thousands of people
*  And I could I had no choice but to cry on that one
