# Joe Rogan Experience #1564 - Adam Alter
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [November 13, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J68gMp9nVE0)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day.
*  Hello, Adam.
*  Hey, Joe.
*  How are you?
*  What's going on?
*  Yeah, not too bad.
*  Thanks.
*  Not much happening.
*  Just the pandemic.
*  I really enjoyed your book, man.
*  It's terrifying and accurate and irresistible.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  I appreciate that.
*  When you write a book like that, I mean, first of all, the irony is not lost on me that we're
*  doing an electronic show about avoiding electronics.
*  Like it's so much of a part of our life, our addiction to all these devices and games and
*  applications and all these different things.
*  But yet we use them constantly.
*  It's such a weird balancing act, isn't it?
*  Yeah, it is a weird balancing act.
*  I think a lot of people who write about this stuff and think about it really just focus
*  on all the negatives.
*  There are obviously massive positives.
*  This is a time when we're being forced to physically distance ourselves from other people.
*  And yet we are incredibly lucky to be able to carry on conversations like this, to be
*  able to connect to other people through screens.
*  And so screens are in many ways great, but obviously there are downsides as well.
*  Yeah, the good thing is that people can work remotely.
*  And I think there's a lot of people that are recognizing that.
*  It's not really necessary to be in a cooped up office all the time.
*  And many people are finding that they're even more productive from home.
*  But then you've got distractions while you're at home that you could just look at whatever
*  you want on your computer if no one's looking over your shoulder.
*  And therein lies the problem with being connected to the internet really, right?
*  Yeah, I think that's a really big part of it.
*  It's that the good stuff, the stuff that brings us value, that makes it possible to connect
*  to people.
*  There are huge values that come from being on the screen.
*  There's a lot of great stuff there, but it's so close in proximity to all the stuff that
*  takes us away from what we should be doing.
*  And so you're constantly trying to balance these two issues.
*  Yeah, I know several comics who write on a computer that doesn't have Wi-Fi.
*  They've disabled the Wi-Fi on their computer just so specifically they can never get on
*  the internet while they're writing.
*  Because it's such a pull.
*  It's so difficult to imagine that people lived without it.
*  And that now that we have it, it's so difficult to ignore it, so difficult to get away.
*  Yeah, it's true.
*  There's this big push in the last few decades, especially in the last decade called Retro-mania,
*  which is this kind of falling in love with things that are from the past, things that
*  people didn't really like at the time that much.
*  And so now we've got all these capacities and capabilities on screens that make them
*  phenomenal, and they can do so many more things than they used to be able to do.
*  But like a writer who's trying to get work done, the only way to really do it sometimes
*  is to roll back time 10 or 20 years.
*  And so there are a lot of people who do that.
*  They'll disable the most kind of advanced features on the screens they're using because
*  it's the only way to get past that hurdle of trying to do the right thing, but have
*  the wrong thing be right there at your fingertips.
*  When you're writing a book like yours, which is warning people about technology, what was
*  your motivation for doing this?
*  Is this something that you've struggled with personally?
*  Is this something that you've just seen other people struggle with?
*  What was the reason?
*  Yeah, it's definitely something I've struggled with a lot.
*  And I think a lot of us in academia who end up writing about topics like this focus on
*  the things that are most prominent for us.
*  I remember being on a flight once between New York and LA, so a good six hour flight.
*  And a friend had texted me and said, you should check out a game.
*  It was this game that he told me to check out, a game called Flappy Bird.
*  I downloaded this game on the runway.
*  And I remember as we took off, I started playing.
*  And I had grand designs of doing work, having a good nap, having some food.
*  And I spent six hours playing this game.
*  So that by the time we landed, I had done absolutely none of the stuff I was planning
*  to do.
*  I remember landing and the guy next to me actually turned to me and said, are you OK?
*  Because I sat there just tapping the screen like a maniac for six hours.
*  And I remember thinking, this is not good.
*  I'm a reasonably high functioning individual and six hours just melted away.
*  Now you blow that up to a lifetime.
*  We're spending like 15 or 20 years behind these screens.
*  So the question is, are we doing it in a way that's good for us or is it not good for us?
*  And so that's what inspired me to research this and to write about it, to try to get
*  a sense of what I think of as the biggest, the single biggest change in the way we live
*  as a planet in the last 20 years and trying to get a sense of whether that's being mostly
*  good, mostly bad, somewhere in the middle, at least pushing people to think more about
*  this thing that's occupying so much of their time.
*  Because that's what I wanted to do.
*  I wanted to understand better, it's fine if you're going to spend one flight doing the
*  wrong thing for six hours if you have other plans.
*  Expand that to the life span, talking about 80 years or so.
*  I think it's going to have a huge effect on the way we live.
*  And so I wanted to understand it more deeply.
*  Which was the game that you wrote about where the maker of the game, even though it was
*  hugely successful, decided to delete it?
*  Yeah, that's the one that I started playing.
*  That was Flappy Bird?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, Flappy Bird.
*  He removed it from the market.
*  It was an incredible thing.
*  This guy was making an absolute killing.
*  At its peak he was making, I think it was something like tens or even hundreds of thousands
*  of dollars a day in ad revenue.
*  Which for an indie game developer, you create this game, it's kind of a move of passion
*  more than anything.
*  You just enjoy pouring your artistic talents into making this game.
*  You don't expect to make tons of money.
*  But the guy was making him killing.
*  And rare in this industry, and I think rare in any commercial industry, he had a conscience
*  And he basically said, I feel terrible about this and removed it from the market.
*  And people reached out.
*  It was almost like he'd taken a drug away from drug users because he removed it from
*  the market.
*  And a lot of them responded and said, can you just like give me a copy on the side?
*  And he was pretty firm about it.
*  He said no.
*  Wow.
*  Wow.
*  So what is so uniquely addictive about that one game?
*  I know there's games like Candy Crush that are uniquely addictive and Subway Surfers.
*  My wife's addicted to that game.
*  What is it about Flappy Bird that's uniquely addictive?
*  I'd say the thing for me that was addictive, it was incredibly simple to play.
*  Everything about it was incredibly straightforward.
*  There was a clear objective and you could see the little points tick upwards.
*  So what you have to do for anyone who hasn't played the game, it's so simple.
*  It's just a bird who has to fly through obstacles.
*  It's just mindless.
*  But one of the things that I think made it so hard for me to stop playing was that if
*  you think about games in the 80s, the 90s, you'd end a game and you get this little game
*  over screen and then you'd have to push a button to keep playing.
*  And so each time that happened, that was a little prompt that maybe you want to get on
*  with your life, go do something else.
*  The thing about Flappy Bird is the bird when he crashes, he just automatically reanimates
*  and he starts flying again.
*  And it almost feels rude to the bird at that point to say, I'm not going to keep playing.
*  So I felt like, look, we're two hours into the flight, three hours into the flight, but
*  that bird just never stops flying.
*  And I don't want to be the guy who just says it's game over bird.
*  And that's how, I mean, it's an exaggeration.
*  It's a bit silly, but it's really how it felt in the moment.
*  And I think this is something that a lot of the screen experiences we have as a feature
*  now that the companies that have produced the products that we're using have systematically
*  gone through their products to remove those little cues that would have said to us, it's
*  time to move on.
*  So the maker of video games now doesn't have a big game over screen.
*  The game just kind of keeps rolling on.
*  And if you do that, you short circuit one of the things that pushes people away from
*  what they're doing onto the next thing.
*  And we call these stopping cues.
*  And if you think about the bottomlessness of social media feeds, they were not bottomless
*  when they were first designed and released.
*  So when Facebook first came out, you had to click a little button at the bottom of the
*  page that said load more.
*  And that's not true anymore.
*  Things just spool and spool and spool.
*  And so there's no bottom to them.
*  And as a result of that, we've short circuited that little nudge that used to say, okay,
*  move on.
*  And that was true of Flappy Bird.
*  And that's what made it so hard for me to resist it at the time.
*  The stopping cues or starting cues, that's one of the features that people find uniquely
*  addictive about TikTok, because TikTok videos play immediately.
*  I've never used TikTok, but when I was talking to Tristan Harris, he was saying that that's
*  one of the things about it that really hooks people right away.
*  You open up the app and it just starts playing.
*  You don't have to click on anything.
*  You don't have to touch it.
*  It just immediately starts playing videos for you.
*  Yeah, it's true on most of the video playing platforms now.
*  TikTok certainly true.
*  It's true about Netflix.
*  They're all just designed to autoplay.
*  And so that's removing one of the decision points that might have stopped people from
*  engaging.
*  And as a result, we're just automatically right in there.
*  You basically want to take people from not being in an experience to being deeply immersed
*  in it as quickly as possible.
*  And the more quickly you can do that, the more likely they are to just find themselves
*  kind of entranced by that process.
*  It's a lot like playing a slot machine.
*  If you gamble and you sit in front of that machine, I mean, it takes only a couple of
*  minutes for the well-designed ones to hook you.
*  And suddenly you're in a trance and you're generally losing a lot of money.
*  And suddenly an hour's gone by at two hours.
*  There are no clocks.
*  They don't tell you that it's time to move on.
*  There's no sense of daylight.
*  You know, it could be the third sunrise.
*  You wouldn't have any idea that's happening.
*  And that's all by design.
*  Jamie just pulled up a statistic about Flappy Bird and the phones that still have it now
*  are on sale on eBay.
*  Flappy Bird equipped iPhones are listed for $1,000 to $10,000 on eBay with a few priced
*  above $50,000.
*  An iPhone 5S with the app sold for $10,100.
*  An iPad Air listed at over $80,000 has received multiple bids.
*  eBay nixed the auction of a Flappy Bird equipped iPhone as it neared $100,000, the LA Times
*  reports.
*  $100,000.
*  $100,000 for a regular phone or a regular iPad that has this stupid game on it.
*  That's how addicted people are.
*  Yeah, you should read it.
*  Check out some of the reviews of it.
*  It's pretty entertaining, actually, because these people, they have such a love-hate relationship
*  with it.
*  These are reviews written around the time it was released in 2014.
*  You'll see these reviews that give it a five-star rating, and then they say next to it, this
*  game will be the death of me.
*  They have this perfect kind of addictive relationship with it.
*  They talk about, this one guy was like, I've lost all my friends.
*  It's so dumb because it's this bird who's flying around.
*  It's the most trivial, silly thing, and yet the experience is compelling enough that it
*  has that effect on people.
*  Until you've played it, it also sounds silly.
*  That's the thing.
*  When I was playing it, when I landed, after six hours of playing it straight, I remember
*  just being like, what just happened?
*  That makes no sense at all.
*  It's a very powerful experience.
*  I had a serious addiction to a game called Quake for years.
*  The first-person shooter.
*  I know it.
*  I had a real problem, like eight to 10 hours every day.
*  I had a T1 line installed in my house so that I could play it.
*  I was gone, and one day, I just shut it off.
*  I just stopped playing.
*  I couldn't do it.
*  I realized what was going on.
*  I was tired all the time.
*  I was playing until four or five o'clock in the morning, and then sleeping until noon,
*  and then playing it again.
*  It was really bad.
*  It's a game that is uniquely addictive because it's so immersive.
*  It's a 3D experience.
*  The sound is 3D, and it's very competitive, too.
*  You could hop online, and you're constantly playing with these other people all over the
*  world, really, in these servers.
*  There's a lot of people that lose their life to these games.
*  That's not as addictive as, apparently, World of Warcraft.
*  Is that one of the things that you were saying is the most addictive game?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, it's been labeled the most addictive experience we can have or we have had that
*  doesn't involve a substance.
*  Based on the numbers, yeah, based on just the numbers of players, it's not at its peak
*  anymore.
*  It's been eclipsed by some other experiences.
*  At its peak, it had tens of millions of users, and they were playing for hours and hours
*  and hours a day.
*  People just forgoing sleep to play in the middle of the night all day.
*  Sometimes there are stories of people who played so much that they would sit in diapers
*  because they didn't want to have to go to the bathroom.
*  Oh my God.
*  It's just incredibly powerful stuff.
*  What has eclipsed it?
*  I think there are just newer experiences like Fortnite.
*  Fortnite's the really big one.
*  I don't know if it surpassed World of Warcraft.
*  I think World of Warcraft was a more colossal experience, disrupted the world of video game
*  and playing more profoundly.
*  But there's also been a big shift in the way we play and who plays video games.
*  Historically, video games were, I was like you, for me it was Doom.
*  I would play Doom for hours and hours a day.
*  Same developer.
*  Same developer, yeah, just preceded Quake.
*  That was typical of gamers.
*  They were often young males, teenage or adolescent age or in their early 20s.
*  That's really shifted with the advent of the iPhone in particular.
*  Because most games now are being played on iPhone screens or on smartphone screens, the
*  biggest demographic of gamers from I think it was about 2014 or 15 on became middle-aged
*  women.
*  It's a big shift in who plays games and spends the most time.
*  That's hilarious.
*  It's a big change.
*  Those are the ones that were yelling at their sons just a couple of decades ago was middle-aged
*  women.
*  Get something going with your life.
*  What are you doing?
*  Now they're doing it.
*  When you see these games and you see this massive addiction that human beings have to
*  them and then you see the technology increasing rapidly, do you anticipate us being in the
*  matrix in your lifetime?
*  Yes, some version of that I think.
*  What's really smart about the devices we use now, at least from the developer's perspective,
*  most of us resist the idea of having an implanted tech device.
*  We don't want something implanted in our brains yet.
*  We're still pretty queasy about that idea.
*  But if you ask people, 80% of adults will say that they can reach their phones 24 hours
*  a day without moving their feet.
*  So they're not physically implanted devices, but they're already basically there.
*  And then down the road, if you speak to people who work in virtual and augmented reality
*  industries, they'll tell you, we're only a couple of years away from this being a huge
*  commercial success where just as we now almost all universally from quite a young age walk
*  around with our own personal iPhones and smartphones, we're going to be doing the same, but they're
*  going to be virtual reality glasses.
*  And so you'll be going somewhere and at any moment in time, instead of deciding whether
*  to live in the moment or pick up your phone, it'll be, do I want to live in this moment
*  or live in an alternate reality where I can go exactly where I want to go, do the thing
*  I want to do, spend time in a virtual space with exactly who I want to spend time with.
*  I think it's going to be incredibly hard for us to resist the temptation to do that.
*  And that's going to create a literal physical barrier between human beings.
*  I think we're all going to be living in our own little universes eventually if things
*  go the way they've been going.
*  Well, if I was conspiratorially minded and I kind of am, but only for fun, I would think
*  that someone has probably set that ball in motion with COVID, with COVID and the lockdown.
*  It's almost like if you wanted to make a movie where artificial intelligence wanted
*  to figure out a way to hook us deeper, artificial intelligence would release a virus
*  and they would force us to stay inside.
*  It doesn't kill everybody, but it makes people scared.
*  So you stay inside and it connects you even deeper to computers and maybe more importantly,
*  separates you even more from the human experience of touching and being around each other in
*  social queues and social gathering.
*  And it makes it even more compelling to do things virtually, more compelling to be on
*  your computer all the time and messing with applications.
*  And then while this is all going on, something far more immersive is released when you're
*  already accustomed to it.
*  Yeah, I've got to say, I mean, life in the last decade in particular has has got way
*  stranger than fiction.
*  Yeah. The real world right now, there is so much about it that just seems like it can't
*  be real. You know, if anyone wrote a movie with the script of the last five to 10 years,
*  how about the last four here?
*  Oh, the last four. Let's pick the last four.
*  People would say this is, this isn't, yeah, it's not, it's nonsense.
*  Like what, it's kind of B grade Hollywood stuff that we're looking at here.
*  But, you know, the interesting thing about this pandemic period for me is I think it
*  might have a weird backlash effect where we've all been forced to spend time on screens.
*  It's instead of going to the screen because we love it and we're attracted to social
*  media and whatever other things we're doing on screens.
*  A lot of us are being forced to use them.
*  And one thing that's changed is sentiment towards screens.
*  I think a lot of people are just over it.
*  And so when we are past all of this, I think there's a chance that's going to be the
*  catalyst to push people away from screens a bit.
*  Because if you, you know, before this, if you were, you speak to especially younger
*  people, they'll say, and then this is true for me too.
*  I would rather just use the most remote form of communication possible, whatever's
*  easiest. I don't want to have to speak on the phone.
*  I don't want to have to see people.
*  Let me just send a quick text or an email or WhatsApp or whatever.
*  And I think there's a shift now where people are like craving that that true face to
*  face time where you're actually sitting in front of a person having a real conversation.
*  And that's that's been, I think, a shift in the last roughly eight or nine months.
*  I think there's people like you that are craving the experience of being around other
*  folks, because I think you're aware of the repercussions of this virtual experience
*  that we're all engaging in and the addiction to screens and screen time and phones and
*  games and applications.
*  But I think there's plenty of folks that are happy to just get lulled to sleep and
*  sucked into it.
*  And I think that's my real concern.
*  My real concern is mindful, thoughtful people like yourself that are that are saying,
*  listen, we need just a real experience with human beings and we're revolting and
*  leaving. But if you look at the numbers in terms of human beings like what the average
*  screen time, all that stuff's going up.
*  The use of these things is all going up.
*  And I think there's folks like you that would like to think that we're rejecting it.
*  But I think it's a it's a minority that's rejecting it.
*  I think the minority, the majority are embracing it.
*  Yeah, I think I think that that may be true.
*  I mean, I think one of the big drivers of screen time is, you know, if you take psychological
*  needs away from people, the things that are really important to them to function
*  psychologically, that's when they turn to screens.
*  That's when they turn to drugs. That's when they turn to alcohol.
*  That's when they turn to all the things that soothe us.
*  And screens do that. They are a kind of a non-substance way to to be soothed.
*  That's what happened with me on that flight for six hours.
*  That's what happens when you're on social media scrolling mindlessly, when you're
*  watching tons and tons of videos online.
*  All that sort of stuff is is is a way of soothing you.
*  And I think people need to be soothed more than ever right now, because this is a
*  is a hard time for a lot of people.
*  It's hard financially. It's hard because you're socially distant from people.
*  It's it's just it just creates this kind of pool of uncertainty that sits above
*  everything we do. And humans hate that.
*  We don't like uncertainty. We don't like not knowing what's coming around the
*  corner and not just about the pandemic.
*  I mean, politically, in a lot of different ways, there's a lot of uncertainty right
*  now and for the last while.
*  And when you put people in that state, they're going to turn to screens.
*  I don't know if that's an enduring thing, but any time you rob people of well-being,
*  of some sort of psychological need, they're going to try to find it elsewhere.
*  And one of the ways they do that is now the easiest way to do it is to turn to a
*  screen. Have you spent any time at all playing virtual reality games?
*  I it's funny, I when I was doing the research for this book, I spoke to a game
*  designer, a brilliant guy at NYU.
*  He sent the NYU Game Center named Bennett Foddy, and he teaches he teaches
*  game design. He's designed a number of phenomenal games himself.
*  And he told me something that I found fascinating, and I took it on board.
*  He said to me, I asked him about World of Warcraft and I said, you know, do you enjoy
*  it? What do you think about it? And he said to me, I know that if I start playing that
*  game, I either don't play it at all or I'm going to basically be giving up years
*  of my life and I don't have the time to do that.
*  So I just have never even opened the game to play it.
*  It's just not something I want to do.
*  And that's that's how I have felt about most of those experiences.
*  I did play one virtual reality game.
*  It was with a haptic suit. So it basically fits over you.
*  It was this Ghostbusters game.
*  And I grew up watching Ghostbusters and loved it.
*  So so the ghosts fly through you and you can feel the suit compresses.
*  And so it feels like they're actually kind of butting into which maybe doesn't make
*  much sense because they're ghosts.
*  But you fly around with one of the little Ghostbusters guns and you're in New York
*  City and you're running around.
*  This was a 10 minute experience.
*  But if you had told me that I could give up the next 48 hours of my life, put on
*  the suit, run around, no food, just just do this for 48 hours.
*  It was so incredibly immersive and engaging and interesting.
*  I would have done it. It was it was amazing.
*  And it wasn't even like that's not even where we're going with this stuff.
*  This was, you know, step one out of step 10 in terms of sophistication.
*  This is the early days. It's only going to get more compelling.
*  Are you aware of sandbox?
*  You've heard of the company Sandbox?
*  No.
*  Sandbox is it's a virtual reality game destination.
*  So you go to this place and it's essentially a warehouse.
*  And inside of it, they have these arenas set up for games and a series of games
*  that you play. And I play with my whole family.
*  We put the haptic feedback suits on virtual reality helmets and you kill
*  zombies. You fight off skeletons on a pirate ship.
*  There's a bunch of games and it is wild.
*  And you see it and you go, I see where this is going.
*  Like this is right now pretty immersive, pretty immersive, really, really fun,
*  very engaging, exciting to do.
*  But you know for a fact that it's just going to keep getting better and keep
*  getting better. And right now it's insanely addictive.
*  Like I get so pumped up to do it when we do like I'll go with my family every
*  couple of weeks or so.
*  And we get so excited when we're on our way over there.
*  Luckily, it's got a set time.
*  It's it's a one hour experience.
*  And when it's over, it's over.
*  But my God, you know, you're you're in it.
*  Like there's one of them where you're in a haunted house and you're fighting off
*  zombies and they're just running at you like hundreds of them and you're gunning
*  them down. It's so exciting when they get a hold of you.
*  You feel their touch like in the haptic feedback.
*  And you see red in front of your face like you're getting torn apart.
*  It's wild. And you know that this is essentially like doom.
*  Right. If you play doom today, it's the pixels are enormous.
*  It's just like it looks clunky and squarish and blockish.
*  I mean, it's fun still, but it's so it's so crude in comparison to a modern game.
*  You know, the modern games have like there's a new Unreal Engine and we were
*  playing a video of it the other day because it's so hard to believe that this
*  is just a video game.
*  And in this this video game, the lighting and the textures and the shadows are so
*  exact. It's so incredible.
*  And you just have this feeling of inevitability.
*  Like there's just going to come a time where you're going to be in this virtual
*  reality thing and you're going to have a whole haptic feedback outfit from your
*  fingers to your toes all over your face.
*  And it's going to it's going to be better than real life.
*  And that's what everyone's terrified of.
*  Yeah. And I mean, it's it's hard to it's hard to avoid that.
*  Right. That that feeling, that excitement that you have as you're about to play.
*  Imagine if that were always available to you at any moment of the day.
*  It would be hard to resist it.
*  Yeah, I felt the same way about that, that very brief experience with Ghostbusters,
*  that Ghostbusters game. It was just there was a level of excitement.
*  And, you know, you used to have to kind of suspend disbelief.
*  Like you, as you say, with Doom, you'd have the pixels and you'd be like, yeah,
*  it's not quite real, but it's real enough.
*  And then there was this point where everything just the processing speed,
*  the sophistication of the development, the design, you could make it seem
*  basically real and it's only going to become more so.
*  And so you don't have to suspend disbelief at all.
*  The minute you're in that experience, it's there.
*  It's real. It may as well be real.
*  What bothers me is people way smarter than me that aren't worried about it.
*  You know, I had John Carmack on the podcast who I'm a gigantic fan of.
*  You know, he's the guy who created Doom and Quake and engineered those engines.
*  He's his take on phones was basically, well, people enjoy them and they make life
*  better. And he just doesn't seem to be worried at all.
*  And, you know, obviously he makes games and he's working with Oculus.
*  He was at the time, at least working with Oculus, making all these games.
*  And he he's also a very disciplined person.
*  So he'll code for 16 hours a day, you know, and he's also
*  he plays that there's the one game where you have the drumsticks and the things
*  are coming at you and you're swinging at the air and knocking these things down.
*  What is that game called? Do you know?
*  I can't remember. I know the game. Yeah, I can't remember what it's called.
*  Beat Saber, Beat Saber, James's Beat Saber.
*  But he does it at an insanely high level where he's basically getting this wild
*  cardio workout in like like he's doing some sort of stick fighting martial art.
*  You know, he's like swinging his arms back and forth through the air.
*  And he actually is a cardio workout.
*  Like you can do that.
*  And there's there is some benefits to like there's a boxing game that you can play
*  on Oculus or no HTC Vive.
*  I played it on. And when you play this boxing game, you're you're squaring off
*  against an opponent. And when you get hit, your screen lights up like you got hit
*  in sparring and you can maneuver around.
*  So it's actually a workout.
*  You actually move around this person coming at you and they turn with you to
*  try to meet you. They know where you're standing and they they swing at you.
*  And you can you can do certain things where it's actually beneficial.
*  You can get some exercise.
*  I've seen some of their engineering now with omnidirectional treadmills.
*  So you have a harness around your waist.
*  You're connected in position on this omnidirectional treadmill so you can go
*  any way you want. And you're running and you're shooting at things and running.
*  And you get this great workout while you're having fun.
*  So it's not all doom and gloom.
*  No, I totally agree.
*  I think there's a temptation to to fall on one end of the spectrum or the other.
*  And I don't think that makes sense.
*  As with most issues in life, you know, there's there's some nuance that's got to
*  come in. So there are people who will just talk about, you know, screens are going to
*  be the end of the world. And there are there are people who will say there's
*  absolutely no problem and everything we're doing is good for us and healthy and
*  making the world better.
*  And the truth is somewhere in the middle.
*  And I think it also varies by by the person and what kind of experiences you're having.
*  If you're someone who is sedentary, you weren't working out, you weren't moving.
*  And suddenly you find this game that encourages you to to run and move around.
*  That's got to have some beneficial effects.
*  If you if you're someone who's unnaturally disciplined like John Carmack, then great.
*  Then you're able to say, I'm going to take the best from screens and I'm going to
*  resist the worst and I'm just going to move on with my life.
*  But, you know, the data don't lie and the data suggests that the amount of time we're
*  spending in front of screens has gone up dramatically.
*  And when you speak to people about it, they don't say I'm happy about that.
*  They say, what is going on?
*  Where is all that time going?
*  Yeah. So so that's that to me is the most compelling thing that we want to try to work
*  out. How do we extract the best and leave behind the worst with screens, with any kind
*  of technology, with any kind of shift in the world?
*  You always want to try to do that across the population, find the stuff that's damaging,
*  weed it out and find the stuff that's useful and try to capitalize on it and emphasize
*  that. I think that's what that's what this project is all about.
*  It's about certainly not throwing out the baby with the bathwater and not trying to roll
*  back to the 1950s here.
*  We want to retain the screens, but work out the best way to use them and the best way
*  for us to resist them when we need to do that.
*  Yeah, these dance dance revolution people, they figured out a way how to how to get
*  something positive out of a video game.
*  Right. There's a lot of people that played that game that lost a ton of weight.
*  So there are some things that you could say would be beneficial because the game is
*  addictive. But while it's addictive, you're also getting in shape.
*  Yeah, absolutely. I mean, there's a there's a good example.
*  So there's the physical side of it.
*  And then, of course, like the mental experience of being on screens can be very, very
*  positive for us to, you know, your learning languages that you wouldn't have otherwise
*  been able to learn. You're being exposed to people and experiences that you could
*  neither experience because you live far away from them.
*  I moved to the US in 2004 from Australia.
*  And, you know, it's hard to believe it's only 16 years ago.
*  But this is before YouTube.
*  This is the same year that Facebook came about.
*  I couldn't really find a good enough Internet connection to be able to speak with
*  video to my family in Australia.
*  And that only came a couple of years later.
*  So that's a miracle that during this time of lockdown, when we're all so far apart
*  from each other, we are able to actually communicate through these screens in a way
*  that's basically seamless.
*  Do you worry when you're researching this and you're spending all this time working
*  on this subject and you accumulate all this data and you look at the big picture and
*  you look at where this is going, do you think that we are on our way to being
*  obsolete, that human beings are going to be either replaced or we're going to have
*  some sort of a very bizarre symbiotic relationship with electronics where we're
*  not like we're not what we think of as people right now?
*  I don't worry about humans being replaced as much as I worry about humans becoming
*  just isolated entities.
*  I think humans for all of evolutionary history have always been in groups, in tribes.
*  They've had to come together.
*  They've relied on each other.
*  They formed coalitions.
*  I worry that the way we get most of the psychological needs met, the psychological
*  nourishment, it used to require getting together as a species, coming together in
*  certain ways. And I think when you can get so much of what you need from a device that
*  you strap onto your face that basically separates you from everyone else around you,
*  I do worry about that.
*  And I also think there are certain critical periods in maturation and development for
*  kids when they learn how to interact with other people.
*  They learn how to work out the difference between someone being angry and someone
*  being afraid. They work out, you know, if you take another kid's toy, the kid's going
*  to bop you on the head and say, that's not OK.
*  You've got to learn that stuff through trial and error.
*  And I think because kids are placed in front of screens at such a young age, many of
*  them. And because these devices are going to remove us from the contact with other
*  people, I just think we're becoming a much more isolated species.
*  We used to call humans the social animal.
*  That's still true, for sure.
*  But it's it's kind of an impoverished, stripped down version of what it means to be
*  social if you compare it to even 20 years ago.
*  Yeah, that's what I'm talking about when I'm talking about us being almost obsolete,
*  is that I worry about the advent of AI and I worry about things like Neuralink.
*  Where you're increasing the bandwidth that human beings have to access information.
*  And I'm not exactly sure what kind of effect that's going to have on human beings.
*  But I'm positive that whatever effect it initially has is going to exponentially
*  increase over the next few decades.
*  And then I'm worried that, like you said, most people's phone is never more than a
*  hand like a arm's reach away.
*  You wake up in the morning, it's right there by your bedside.
*  People are always constantly checking their pockets when they get up from the dinner
*  table. They always want to have their phone.
*  How long before we let them stick that thing in us?
*  How long before you have a chip that sits in your arm or something real simple that
*  just goes under your skin in a very easy way and doesn't it's not very painful, but
*  you have some access to everything that you want.
*  And then slowly but surely we start replacing body parts.
*  I mean, I'm yeah, I'm genuine, genuine.
*  I know it sounds science fiction and ridiculous, but I'm genuinely worried that
*  what we think of as human beings now, this is like a legacy version of human beings
*  and that 20, 30 years from now, it's going to be obsolete.
*  I mean, just go back 20 years.
*  Imagine you could go back to the year 2000 and speak to people and say, hey, you're
*  going to go to the restaurant and everyone's going to be sitting isolated looking at a
*  small device and then they're going to go home and they're going to spend four hours
*  looking at that device and then they're going to wake up in the morning and look at
*  that device. I've been asking this question of thousands of people.
*  I basically ask them from age 13 up to people in their 90s, would you rather now have
*  your phone broken so you can have your phone shattered in front of you or would you rather
*  have a broken bone in your finger?
*  And older adults say I would rather have a broken phone.
*  But if you ask teens and adolescents, about half of them say, well, they want to bargain
*  with you first. They're like, when I've broken my hand, can I still swipe my phone?
*  But a lot of them will say, I would rather have a broken bone in my hand than a broken
*  phone. Now, imagine going back 20 years and saying to people, there's going to be this
*  little device and people are going to be willing to have body parts broken to preserve the
*  integrity of that device.
*  And it's going to be worth only a few hundred bucks.
*  People are going to say that people would say that's crazy.
*  And I think this has been like a long 20 year process of desensitization.
*  You know, the stuff that we're willing to do now, we're willing to give up four, five,
*  six, ten hours of our days to screen experiences that at the end of the day, we look back and
*  say, man, I didn't really want some of those experiences.
*  That wasn't good for me. I don't feel happy or better off.
*  So you extrapolate, you look forward.
*  I mean, this is the beginning of an incredibly long road or a tall mountain.
*  We're just at the very base and we're moving upward.
*  And that's why talking about VR and AR and Neuralink and all of the kind of
*  augmented reality, artificial intelligence that's around the corner, all of that stuff,
*  we're going to look back at this and this is going to look quaint in the same way that
*  looking at people watching TV's in the 50s, looking at that little square wooden box
*  looks quaint. We're there.
*  It feels like we're at some destination, but we're on the road and it's still very early
*  on that road. And this is one of the really important reasons, I think, for thinking so
*  carefully about this stuff, because if we don't think about it now, if we don't
*  think about how to manage it in our own lives, it's going to affect us as individuals
*  and in our small communities. But I think it's going to affect the whole planet on some
*  level. So it's really important to at least be mindful about the choices we're making.
*  I agree with you every step of the way.
*  But my concern is that it doesn't matter what we're saying here, that
*  this is like we are like holding a thousand bison as they run towards the
*  cliff. We're like, guys, this is a cliff, guys behind me.
*  And they're just pushing us back and we can't stop it.
*  That's what it seems like to me. I agree with everything you're saying.
*  And I bet this is going to resonate with all the people that are listening and watching
*  this right now. They're going to go, yeah, it makes a good point.
*  And then they're going to grab their phone and go, huh, who's calling me?
*  Who's texting me? What's this? What's that?
*  And they're going to get sucked right back into it.
*  Yeah, they will. And this is the kind of eternal problem with this.
*  I think it's important that we are up again.
*  I'm sure Tristan Harris said this to you the other day, that we're up against very
*  powerful, impressive foes and they know all the right buttons to push.
*  And if they don't know, they'll collect data to be able to answer that question.
*  And then they'll institute those practices in their products and they'll put those
*  features into their products that seem most capable of, you know, bypassing our
*  resistance. But I do think I'm a little bit hopeful.
*  I'm hopeful because a lot of this is going to depend on, I think, two things.
*  You know, there are kind of top-down influences and bottom-up influences.
*  The bottom-up is grassroots.
*  The fact that we're talking about this is a big step forward from where we were just
*  three or four years ago.
*  So in 2014, I was preparing to write this book and some of the people I spoke to
*  about it said, this is a storm in a teacup.
*  No one cares about screens.
*  They're all good. There's nothing to worry about.
*  They were already doing a lot of the same things they're doing now.
*  We just weren't really sensitive to those issues.
*  Now, between 2014 and 2017, when the book actually came out, sentiment swung
*  dramatically. Suddenly, just I'd say millions and millions of people started to care
*  about this issue. And now it's many, many millions, maybe even billions of people
*  who are really paying attention to it.
*  So it's good that at least awareness is there.
*  That's something. That's the first step.
*  And then the top-down influences.
*  Can you shape how companies use email?
*  You know, like if you can get a lot of the biggest companies to start saying, hey,
*  you know what? E-mail is kind of destroying the lives of our workers.
*  Maybe we're going to try to institute a policy where when they go on vacation, they
*  absolutely don't have to check email.
*  There are these companies in Germany in particular and other parts of Europe that
*  have this vacation policy where when you go on vacation, every email that comes into
*  your inbox is automatically deleted.
*  So your inbox, the way it looked the day you went on vacation, does not change until
*  you get back from your vacation.
*  So you don't need to check it while you're away.
*  And so that's the top-down influence.
*  And then, you know, the question about whether, you know, it's a really, really hot
*  button issue. Should governments intervene?
*  Should they start changing the way tech companies operate?
*  Should they legislate how we use these products?
*  For very understandable reasons, I think a lot of people bristle at the idea that
*  governments should get involved.
*  But these are questions, they're open questions.
*  And some of the countries around the world have said, yeah, governments should
*  probably get involved.
*  We should. It's not going to fix itself and it's not going to be fixed by
*  grassroots pressure, by consumer pressure.
*  So we're going to have to do something from the top down, which is how a lot of
*  governments deal with drug issues.
*  They go to the source.
*  I think it's a real problem if you let the government intervene in something just
*  because you think it's addictive.
*  I think if you're dealing with issues of censorship on social media and things
*  along those lines, I think yes, I think the government should probably, they
*  should probably figure out some sort of revision to the First Amendment because
*  it seems like these platforms, it's not as simple as this is a private company
*  because this is a private company that has immense influence over the way the
*  world communicates.
*  It's just too big of a pipeline to say this is just a private company and we can
*  decide who's on our platform and who isn't because you're seeing things
*  censored by ideology and you're seeing this polarizing effect that that has
*  between Democrats and Republicans in the United States and the right and the left.
*  And but that's one subject.
*  That's just about free expression and free speech, which is a cornerstone of our
*  democracy, a cornerstone of our culture.
*  But addiction, like here's the thing.
*  If you want, if you want to be competitive, there's no way you're going to
*  allow emails that come into your inbox to be deleted when you go on vacation.
*  If you're one of those people that's all about kicking ass and taking names and our
*  companies going to the top, you're not going to allow that because what if that
*  email gets deleted and that email could have a critical information that could
*  help your company and that could be the next level and you can get that promotion
*  you've been working towards and people are not going to go for that in America.
*  They might go for it in Germany and good luck to you.
*  But in America and competitive business practices, I just I can't imagine that
*  people are going to agree to something like that.
*  And the idea that I don't think that you're suggesting this necessarily, but that
*  the government should step in and say, hey, you know, when you're on vacation, you
*  get two weeks of vacation every year.
*  And when you're on vacation, all your emails get deleted.
*  People are going to go, fuck you.
*  I need those emails.
*  What are you crazy?
*  Yeah, I don't believe they should do that.
*  I think that's absolutely absurd.
*  What do you think?
*  But I when you say the government, like, yeah.
*  One thing they could do is they could intervene with protected classes like kids.
*  Right.
*  So kids are incredibly vulnerable on screens.
*  A friend of mine who writes about these issues near a L talks a lot about protected
*  classes and that we have we have to have separate laws for people who like if they
*  want to sign up, if an adult wants to sign up and say, look, I need help.
*  I'm addicted to screens.
*  I'm spending 12 hours a day on them.
*  I want some help.
*  Can you help me?
*  Or for kids who are also a protected class, perhaps the government could intervene and
*  say, we need ways to ensure that we're protecting these classes of people who've
*  basically either they've identified as needing help or they are kids and by
*  definition need some help.
*  So the government might intervene there.
*  I mean, this is this is the thing about this issue.
*  I've been thinking about it for six years.
*  There is no magic silver bullet.
*  It is one of it is an incredibly difficult thing to solve, because as you say, if you
*  are telling people, especially in the US, we have found a way to make you happier
*  and healthier, but it's going to make you much less competitive.
*  And there's a chance you're going to miss out on opportunities.
*  No one's going to buy on that.
*  They're not going to say that's fine.
*  And different countries and cultures will have a different balance that they strike.
*  But that's what makes this so difficult is that in the moment, a lot of us want to
*  be doing these things.
*  We don't want to be deprived.
*  We don't want our immediate liberties to be deprived.
*  Our ability to scroll mindlessly.
*  If the government intervened and said, you're not allowed to scroll on your screen, I'd
*  bristle at that.
*  And I think most people would.
*  Even if we know that maybe that'll make us more productive and happier in the long run,
*  it's just not what we're looking for from from governments.
*  So you ask what I think we should do.
*  I think it's incredibly difficult.
*  It's a really difficult problem.
*  I don't know that there's a very obvious set of solutions, although I think we should be
*  very, very mindful, especially with respect to kids.
*  Because I think they are unbelievably vulnerable and sometimes their parents don't really
*  know what to do.
*  It's a difficult problem.
*  And so there, I think we should be open to more.
*  I don't know if extreme is the right word, but more intense interventions.
*  So when you're writing a book like yours, do you get this?
*  Because we both have the sort of same conclusions that it's really difficult, an
*  enormously difficult problem, and there's no clear cut solution.
*  Do you have a feeling, a sense of almost.
*  Just futility.
*  Just like, what is the point of all this?
*  This is moving in a direction that I can't stop.
*  I mean, maybe you can give out advice that a scant few individuals will act upon that
*  a small percentage of the people who read your book are going to go, you know what?
*  Adam makes a good point.
*  I am.
*  I'm going to cut back.
*  I'm going to delete all my apps.
*  I'm going to get to a point where I'm going to delete all my apps.
*  I'm going to delete all my apps.
*  I'm going to delete all my apps.
*  I'm going to delete all my apps.
*  I'm going to delete all my apps.
*  I'm going to get to get a flip phone.
*  I'm going to I'm going to do something.
*  But how many what percentage are going to do that?
*  It's a weird thing when you write a book like this, because the book for me was it was
*  supposed to be not an expose, but it was supposed to be a hey, there's this thing that
*  you haven't been thinking enough about.
*  And it's an issue and we should probably focus on it more than we have been.
*  That was my intention.
*  So it's it's not written as a self-help manual.
*  It's written as a let me uncover what's going on here.
*  And so you can understand the psychological hooks that are embedded.
*  But as I've been speaking about this to audiences for the last three or four years,
*  everyone wants a solution.
*  And you're right. There are going to be a lot of people who are just like, I don't care
*  about this. I'm fine.
*  I'm happy. I just leave me alone.
*  And that's fine. But when I'm in front of audiences and they can be anything from
*  people who work in the tech industry to the parents of kids to school districts,
*  to big companies, I mean, it just it varies pretty dramatically.
*  But one of the things I always say is tell me all of you from one to ten.
*  How big an issue is this for you and how much do you want it to change?
*  And most people fall at the top half of the scale.
*  They're at like a six or a seven or an eight.
*  Now, they're in front of me. Right.
*  So it's possible that that's just what they're saying in that moment.
*  And in fact, they when it comes to push comes to shove, they're not going to do
*  that much about it. But the solutions that I'll share or the suggestions that I'll
*  share, they're incredibly straightforward.
*  They're things like cultivate a habit where you don't have your phone at dinner time.
*  This is not a high tech solution to a high tech problem.
*  It works. You know, I've managed to do this.
*  A lot of the people I know have managed to do it.
*  And even these small interventions, they're very analog.
*  They're just like put your phone in a drawer for a couple of hours a day.
*  Don't put your phone in the bedroom.
*  That stuff matters. And I think the best we can do, the best I feel that I can do
*  right now is to talk to the end consumers of tech.
*  And if they want to hear the message and they want to hear that this is a
*  concern and what you could possibly do about it, that's great.
*  If they don't, I'm not a proselytizer.
*  I'm not I'm not trying to convert anyone to my view.
*  I just wanted to put this out there and to have people say, oh, yeah, this is a
*  thing. And it seems like people are on board with at least that part of it.
*  But like you and I, they're not sure what to do about it.
*  One of the things that's helped me immensely is doing this podcast, because
*  while I'm talking to people like you for hours, there's no phone.
*  There's no no distractions.
*  And it's one of the things that I love about wearing the headphones and just
*  sitting across from someone in this case virtually, but most of the time in person
*  talking to someone, it's just a conversation.
*  That's that's all it is.
*  There's no there's no checking the phone.
*  And that is so rare.
*  It's it's such a strange time where checking a phone becomes like one of the
*  most common activities that a person does throughout the day.
*  If you if you just looked at how many times a person checks their phone
*  throughout the day versus all the other things they do, have a glass of water, go
*  to the bathroom, all the various things people do every day.
*  That's at the top of the list.
*  And again, like you're saying, 10 years ago, no one would have ever imagined that
*  was the case. Yeah.
*  I mean, I can't imagine there are too many people on the planet who spend more
*  time in conversation than you do.
*  And, you know, there's incredible benefit to that.
*  And most people, when they have those deep conversations with other people, they
*  recognize that benefit. They enjoy it.
*  And so, you know, one of the pieces of hope is that, you know, if you tell people
*  try to try this for a while, try this for a week, don't have your phone at the
*  table when you're having dinner.
*  It's hard at first for people who are always used to just kind of mindlessly
*  scrolling through dinner.
*  But most people end up finding that there's quite a lot of benefit to it and
*  they enjoy it. So part of this is to get people to have the experience of what the
*  other side could be.
*  But yeah, you're right.
*  These conversations are rare and for most people and picking up the phone is
*  one of the most common things we do.
*  We spend on average, the average American adult spends four or more hours a day on
*  a cell phone screen. It's a huge amount of time.
*  And most people can't believe it.
*  Yeah, it's hard to imagine when you look down at that number and you go, what?
*  Because you just think of it in these little tiny chunks like a few minutes here
*  or there. But those few minutes, you know, there's 60 minutes in an hour.
*  They add up quick. And yeah, but when you were what was the most disturbing
*  when you're researching this and you're looking at all these trends, what was the
*  most disturbing aspect of it for you?
*  If there was a most there were two.
*  The one was the you know, there were people who play video games more than they
*  would like. But then there are people at the very top end of that spectrum who are
*  just absolutely helplessly addicted.
*  You know, they'll play play games for five weeks straight, put on 50 pounds, lose
*  their hair, sit in diapers, have pay someone to bring pizza boxes to their room
*  till they're just piles and piles of pizza boxes.
*  I met some of these people and spoke to some of them.
*  And those stories I just found completely shocking.
*  You know, I was sitting.
*  Tell the story about the football player, if you would.
*  Yeah, I mean, he's the he's the one I'm thinking about now.
*  This this guy who just he basically told me he was a he's a very strong student.
*  He was in college. He was a straight A student and was on the football team.
*  So he was a student athlete, very bright, very capable and slightly lonely.
*  Felt a little bit distant from other people and started playing World of Warcraft,
*  formed a guild, played with some other players and just found that experience
*  incredibly immersive and rewarding.
*  He loved the social aspect of it more than anything.
*  And he felt a sense of obligation, I guess, that, you know, there were people
*  playing at different parts of the world.
*  He was playing with people around the world.
*  And so when it was night time where he was, other people would be playing
*  because it was daytime where they were.
*  And so he started to stay up later and later and later.
*  His his sleeping hours shrank.
*  And he ended up flunking out of college.
*  It's happened twice, actually, because he relapsed after he got treatment.
*  But he flunked out of college.
*  He put on he told me, I think he said he put on 40 pounds of fat
*  in a period of five weeks and five weeks straight, sitting at the screen,
*  playing the game 23 hours a day, he said, between 23 and 24 hours a day.
*  He told me he didn't use a diaper and that that accounts for the hour a day,
*  but he didn't bathe.
*  And he had he paid this doorman to bring up boxes of pizza.
*  So that's what he was eating.
*  He was eating basically pizza three times a day.
*  And he was unrecognizable by the end of it.
*  Looked different, bailed out of school.
*  That that to me was that was one of the two most shocking things was hearing
*  these stories from people face to face, explaining what they've gone through.
*  It's just and there's no substance involved.
*  You know, you hear these kinds of stories from from substance abuse.
*  But but the idea that an experience can be compelling enough
*  to have the same effect on some people, I found that really shocking.
*  Yeah. And the fact that he relapsed to like he he got over it,
*  recognized that there was a giant issue and then the lure of it
*  drew him right back to the computer.
*  Yeah, he he went for treatment.
*  He went for a dose of treatment. It was expensive.
*  He was lucky that his family could afford it.
*  He went to this
*  facility just outside of Seattle called Restart.
*  And they take in mostly young males and they they teach them
*  how to cook and clean and all these things that seem to kind of pass
*  by a lot of people and being self-sufficient and not not just being stuck
*  in front of the game.
*  They expose them to nature.
*  They get them outdoors.
*  They teach them how to play sports.
*  They get them to exercise a little bit.
*  They feed them healthy meals, all this sort of stuff.
*  So he went and he did this for a few weeks.
*  And at the end of it, he thought, OK, I'm going to go back to the life
*  I had before and I'm not going to play this game.
*  I'm not going to play World of Warcraft.
*  And for a while it worked.
*  But one of the things, one of the mistakes he made is that he basically
*  went back to the exact context he had been in when he had that
*  addiction in the first place.
*  And so soon enough, you know, a period of loneliness.
*  He was inspired to just fire up the game.
*  And he said, you know, I was just going to play one more time.
*  Suddenly it happens all over again, which is what you hear from people
*  who have have drug abuse issues as well.
*  You can't you obviously can't just do it one more time.
*  And so he had to go back to the facility.
*  Now, this time, when he finished his treatment, instead of going back to college,
*  he he actually stayed out there.
*  He lives and stayed out in in Washington State.
*  So he's clean now.
*  Do you still in touch with this guy?
*  Is he's clean.
*  He's a tremendously successful guy.
*  He's a businessman.
*  He's doing very well.
*  And yeah, he's doing well.
*  And I think a big part of what helped him was just completely
*  removing himself from the context that was problematic for him.
*  That seemed to be a huge part of what allowed him to get past it.
*  There's a certain aspect of of people
*  when they get addicted to things that I've heard people
*  try to figure out what that is or why people get obsessed to certain activities.
*  And they think that it's some that it's
*  you're hijacking or the games are hijacking
*  some positive evolutionary trait
*  where you get obsessed at trying to get good at things
*  that will help your survival, like be a better hunter, learning how to fish,
*  learning how to fight off your enemies and becoming obsessed
*  with these things has allowed people to thrive and survive and procreate.
*  And that somehow or another, these games hijacked.
*  Is that accurate? Am I?
*  I find that explanation really compelling.
*  I mean, if you think about it, if you had driven towards mastery,
*  towards completing goals rather than leaving them incomplete,
*  that's going to predispose you for a lot of the right kind of traits to succeed,
*  especially going back thousands of years.
*  You know, if you were on a hunt and you decided, oh, no, I'm good.
*  I'm done. It's not going to work out today.
*  You know, if you were that person, you didn't succeed and your ancestors
*  don't your your progeny don't exist.
*  There's no one here to speak for you.
*  But if we exist today, that's because our ancestors were the ones who said,
*  actually, no, I'm tired, I'm done, but I can't be done
*  because I need to complete the goal. The mission's got to be complete.
*  And so there's this overhang of this now, which is, as you say,
*  the unproductive part of that is that we we are really bad
*  at letting things go as a species.
*  You open up a loop for me and you don't tie the loop off.
*  I hate it. Don't tell me half a story.
*  Don't teach me half a skill.
*  Don't tell me to read half a book or watch half a movie.
*  Humans hate that. We all hate that.
*  And it's it's productive in some contexts when it's good for us
*  to finish what we start.
*  But we're not in pre, you know, prehistoric times anymore.
*  We're not hunter gatherers in the same way.
*  And so you get these experiences on a screen.
*  Suddenly you're playing Candy Crush and the old hunter gatherer in you
*  who says, I can't give up on this experience until it's done
*  because otherwise I'm not going to survive kicks in.
*  And suddenly you're playing 14 hours of Candy Crush or six hours of Flappy Bird.
*  So I think it is a hijacking of some of the traits that were incredibly
*  adaptive and beneficial in those evolutionary contexts.
*  But don't make a lot of sense in the modern world in some contexts.
*  It's so strange that these traits would translate the Flappy Bird.
*  I mean, it is right. It's really weird.
*  It's really weird that these things that would have helped our ancestors survive.
*  They can be hijacked.
*  Yeah, I mean, look at so I'm a runner.
*  I don't run.
*  I'm not extremely fast.
*  I don't run insane distances, but but I find ultra running absolutely fascinating.
*  And I find elite marathon running fascinating.
*  There's there's no good reason to do an ultra.
*  I mean, there are good reasons that are kind of intrinsic, like the reward.
*  I would love to do one one day.
*  But that is a hijacking in the same way.
*  I mean, this is this is just kind of it's a chip that is in there and it works for us.
*  And it worked for us in prehistoric times.
*  But it doesn't distinguish between the occasions when it's going to work well for us
*  and when it's going to work badly.
*  I mean, it's the same with food, right?
*  That that desire for sugar, that craving for sugar, for salt, for fat.
*  If you were roaming the savanna and you were looking for
*  something that was calorie rich, calorie dense, that was going to be good for you,
*  that was going to sustain you.
*  High high sugar, high salt, high fat. Great mix.
*  But give people the situation they're in today.
*  They're still operating on those same principles.
*  Their brains are still operating the same way.
*  They're just as attracted to those things.
*  But they have an endless font of of foods that are going to give them those things
*  in massive surplus.
*  And that's hugely problematic.
*  It's exactly the same with the brain responding to rewards, to mastery,
*  why we do crosswords, why we play games that get progressively more difficult,
*  that suck up more and more of our time.
*  It's a huge part of it.
*  The ultra marathon running thing is particularly interesting to me,
*  because one of my very good friends does it.
*  His name's Cameron Haynes, and he runs these three hour or three day
*  races where they run 240 miles.
*  He does like he did the Moab 240.
*  He's done the Bigfoot race, which is 200 miles.
*  You're going through the mountain.
*  And I think there's and he interestingly enough,
*  he got involved in that because he is a hunter and he wanted to be
*  have better endurance to hunt in the mountains.
*  And so he started getting obsessed with running marathons.
*  Then ultra marathons and these crazy multiple day endurance races.
*  But he it's literally for him that thing that we're talking about,
*  these ancient traits that allowed persistence,
*  allow you to be a successful hunter through that persistence
*  and through that dedication and focus and discipline.
*  He's sort of got stuck in this where he's just insane with it.
*  He'll run a marathon a day,
*  multiple days in a row to prepare for these things where they used to tell you
*  you have to have six months off when you run a marathon.
*  Right. That was ancient wisdom.
*  Like your body so broken down after running 26 miles.
*  No, he runs a marathon every day.
*  Have you seen the three Chinmoy challenge?
*  This is this is a I wrote a piece about it again.
*  What is it called? It's three Chinmoy S.R.I.
*  and then Chinmoy C.H.I.N.M.O.Y.
*  I've heard that three times. I've heard that.
*  It's it's this insane.
*  It's what you do is you go to Brooklyn.
*  I think it starts in May or June.
*  You go to Brooklyn and there's this little block around the school.
*  It's a nondescript block. There's nothing special about it.
*  And you run thirty one hundred miles over.
*  That's right. Over about 60 days.
*  There's no scenery. I can understand running the Moab.
*  I would love to do the Moab, the Western States, bad water.
*  I'm very attracted to the idea of doing that.
*  And I can totally understand why that could be a life changing experience.
*  But running around a half mile block.
*  Thousands of times, six thousand times, I think it is.
*  I just I struggle to understand that.
*  But again, for people who do that, it's it's all about just pushing yourself.
*  And it's about the challenge and stripping it of its of its beauty,
*  like making it in a place that's not beautiful.
*  It's a city block. Makes no sense.
*  That that then just kind of exaggerates that it's all about completing the quest.
*  The only reason people will do that is because there is that part of us.
*  That's an extreme expression of that, that tendency.
*  But we all have some of that in us,
*  and especially people who are high on conscientiousness, who are kind of tenacious.
*  That there's something about that that's really compelling and it's hard to ignore.
*  Yeah, there's something about completing tasks
*  that gives you this little spark of dopamine, right?
*  This little something gets excited.
*  And the more difficult the task, the better.
*  The feeling is when you've completed it.
*  I've never run an ultra marathon, but I got a man.
*  What is the longest you've ran?
*  I absolutely punished myself running the New York City Marathon ten years ago.
*  It was hell. I remember I crossed the finish line completely depleted.
*  And I know this sounds sounds a bit silly after we've been talking about this.
*  Reach in my thirty one hundred mile challenge.
*  But after twenty six miles, I was just done and I hadn't eaten enough food.
*  I remember crossing the line and this woman put a medal around my neck.
*  And she said, how did that feel?
*  And I said, that was hell. I'm never going to run another marathon.
*  She said to me, that's what everyone says, but I'll see you next year.
*  And I've got to say, I have stuck to that.
*  I have never run another marathon.
*  It nearly killed me.
*  Did you just not prepare enough for it?
*  No, I prepared really well for it.
*  But what I didn't prepare for was the ordeal of trying to get to the starting line
*  in Staten Island. I mean, it's it's hell.
*  So I ate my breakfast at what, three a.m.
*  And then the race begins at something like nine or ten in the morning,
*  depending on which which way you're in.
*  And so I had some food with me, but I just didn't.
*  I didn't budget for that six or seven hour period.
*  So I remember being at the starting line and being absolutely famished.
*  I was starving, which is a terrible place to begin.
*  So I was I was the guy running along the course, just like asking
*  spectators if they had food, like mashing bananas in my face.
*  I was I was just eating constantly throughout that whole race
*  because I was so hungry.
*  So that was my biggest problem.
*  I mean, I think I should probably do another one where I get get the right nutrition,
*  because I probably be able to do a lot better and enjoy it a lot more.
*  And I do run a lot.
*  I still run pretty regularly around where I live, like between eight and 12 miles.
*  But the idea of training for another marathon, I also have two young kids.
*  It's just not something I have that much time for right now.
*  Why did you eat breakfast so early?
*  Because that's when I left home, the bus you had to take.
*  So this is the way it worked, because you had to go uptown.
*  I live downtown in Manhattan.
*  You had to go and get a bus at 3am.
*  That took I don't know why it took so long, but it took forever to get to Staten Island.
*  It's cold because it's November in New York.
*  It was just unpleasant.
*  I think the key is to run a marathon that you just show up.
*  You drive your car to the marathon starting line.
*  You get out and you start running.
*  That's what I need to do next time, because the New York City Marathon
*  is an incredible spectacle.
*  Millions of people watching.
*  It was one of the most fun experiences I had for the first eight of the 26 miles.
*  But then it went downhill.
*  How long did it take you to complete it?
*  I it's funny, I trained and I wanted to run a sub 330
*  and all my training runs had been consistent with that.
*  And then the day of the race, I could tell by halfway through,
*  it just wasn't going to happen.
*  And so I was approaching the four.
*  I started running with the guy who's holding the sign that's 330.
*  And, you know, this is a pacer.
*  He said to me, I'm going to run this in 329.
*  And I said, how can you guarantee that?
*  And he was like, well, I can run a 216.
*  I should be OK.
*  So so I started running with him.
*  And then he he just receded into the distance
*  because I couldn't keep up by about mile nine or mile 10.
*  And then the 340 went by and the 350 went by.
*  I realized I was staring at four hours.
*  And right at near the end of the race, a friend of mine ran on and said to me,
*  you're looking at a 401.
*  And I was I was pissed.
*  I was not happy because I wanted to run a sub four.
*  I basically said to myself, if you don't run sub four, you have to do another one.
*  So I ended up just finding some hidden store of energy and ended up running a 357.
*  Wow. One of the things you talk about in your book is the addiction
*  that people have to fitness devices.
*  To these watches and iPhones and I wear a whoop strap
*  and, you know, a lot of people that wear these things, they start counting steps
*  and they they start looking at how many calories they've burned.
*  I was in a sober October contest a couple of years back with my friends.
*  We were using the my zone
*  chest strap app, and it calculates points based on how many minutes
*  you are at 80 percent or above max heart rate.
*  And we were killing ourselves, just putting in six, seven hours of cardio a day.
*  Like just madness.
*  Your your your take on them was mostly negative.
*  Right. You were you were.
*  Is that a fair?
*  Yeah, that's fair. I've revised my position on this.
*  I think the bigger issue in the US is and in the world in general,
*  in the developed world, the bigger issue is that we're sedentary as a species.
*  We don't exercise enough.
*  So if these devices are pushing us to do more exercise, that's good.
*  But then there are people like you, like me.
*  I am an absolute slave to my Garmin watch.
*  And if I take it with me on a run, it's game over.
*  Like I I could be at the beginning of a run.
*  I'll be standing at the end of my driveway about to go.
*  And I'll say to myself, you are going to run slowly.
*  You're going to do a slow, long run.
*  And 30 seconds later, I'm tearing down the street because I'm looking at my watch,
*  which is saying to me, are you running just over seven minute pace?
*  You should probably dial it down to 650 or something like that.
*  And I cannot resist it.
*  So if I want to run and enjoy it, I just can't take the watch with me.
*  So my take is negative just because I think in the book, at least.
*  I have a positive feeling about them in general,
*  but they are they're just really, really hard to resist.
*  And even if you give yourself a bit of self-talk, you're like,
*  I'm not going to pay attention to it.
*  It ends up being the case that you you fall in line.
*  I never last more than 10 minutes without looking at my watch and saying,
*  all right, it's time for me to really pick things up a bit.
*  That seems it's it's I get what you're saying.
*  But I feel like.
*  The addiction to fitness is probably one of the best addictions
*  you could ever have in terms of the overall quality of life improvement,
*  the actual benefit to it.
*  But you're you are still dealing with this weirdness, right?
*  You're compelled.
*  You feel you feel helpless and drawn in to the the the siren song of your watch
*  or your your strap or whatever, whatever is pulling you in.
*  It's making you do all these extra miles and extra rounds and extra this.
*  And but ultimately, you're getting a benefit out of it,
*  as opposed to like World of Warcraft or something like that,
*  where you're just sitting in front of a screen.
*  So for sure. Yeah.
*  So I totally, totally agree.
*  Sorry, carry on.
*  No, no, I'm just saying you.
*  So you revised your position.
*  You think that sedentary lifestyle is more dangerous.
*  So the benefit of being addicted to this is at least you're moving
*  and you're exercising and you're doing something healthy with your body.
*  I think it's it's more nuanced than that.
*  It's that there is for someone who's going from zero to exercising.
*  That's great.
*  That's great. That's a great thing.
*  And there are more people in that position than there are people who are working too hard.
*  So I think on balance these devices, if they're getting people off the couch
*  and inspiring more activity, they're great.
*  But I think for people like me, people like you, people who do exercise a bit,
*  the danger is that you you stop relying on your internal cues
*  and you end up just going by the device.
*  So there are people who will be out like 4am
*  because they didn't get to their 10,000 steps, you know, that kind of thing.
*  There's nothing inherently wrong with being out at 4am, but it just signals to you.
*  It says something about these devices.
*  It says that what's fueling your drive to exercise is an obsession
*  that's pretty either unhealthy or not driven by, you know, your body telling you
*  you want to run some more.
*  There are days when I'll run in the morning and then by the afternoon,
*  I'm just itching to run again.
*  That doesn't happen very often.
*  But that's my body saying, hey, you've got a lot of energy pent up.
*  Why don't you go out and have another run?
*  But there are also people who will walk in the morning
*  and then they'll look at their watches and say, oh, it's the afternoon
*  and I'm only at 5000 steps. I better go out.
*  That's you're driven entirely by these external cues that are not about well-being.
*  They don't reward you in a way that's like truly deeply rewarding
*  in the way that exercise, I think, should be when it's, you know, when you're doing it right.
*  But still better, better to be doing some with the artificial reward
*  that comes from the chirp on the watch or the Fitbit or the whoop or whatever it is.
*  It tells you you've you've hit some threshold.
*  That's definitely better than not working out at all.
*  And again, these things, these devices are hijacking these traits
*  that have been positive for us, evolutionarily speaking,
*  in terms of our ability to survive and thrive and work through uncomfortable moments
*  and achieve desired results.
*  So it hijacks these systems.
*  It's the same the same hijacking.
*  Yeah, it's that idea that, you know, there's a binary.
*  If you think about what it is to be a hunter gatherer, it's binary.
*  Like if you're chasing some big animal, there is no gray area.
*  You catch the animal and you you get food and your your group, your tribe gets food
*  or you don't catch the animal.
*  And so there is a kind of bright line between success and failing to achieve the goal.
*  And there's no there's no really there's no way around that.
*  And so we are predisposed to focus on those goals and to make them these big, bright issues.
*  Like for me, that four hour mark with the marathon, if I didn't get under four,
*  I mean, there should be no difference between a four or one and a four or a three fifty nine.
*  There are tiny differences in the scheme of it.
*  It's like a half a percent or quarter of a percent difference in time.
*  But it felt to me like this really important milestone.
*  And I think that's what these devices do is they carve out
*  the difference between success and failure and make it really bright
*  in a way that it was historically.
*  But don't you don't you think some people need that, though,
*  because otherwise, oh, the good enough.
*  Oh, it's fine. Oh, you're getting out.
*  You're moving. You're fine.
*  If it's like some people need that number,
*  like they need a very clear, hard line in the sand in order to push themselves,
*  in order to show what they're actually physically capable of.
*  Yeah, I think most of us do.
*  I mean, that's that's, you know, self-control,
*  doing the thing that's hard right now because it's good in the long run.
*  It's it's one of the like age old human problems.
*  It's something that I think we're all going to struggle with forever
*  on some dimension, whether it's about screens or about getting out
*  and actually exercising and doing meaningful exercise that, you know,
*  it's easier to sit on this on the sofa and watch the TV or use your phone
*  or whatever. We're all going to have that feeling forever.
*  Some of us have enough intrinsic joy for exercising and working out.
*  We develop we kind of cultivate that over time that it pulls us off the couch.
*  But for a lot of people, the only way they're going to do it
*  is with this sort of tricking, this hijacking of the brain systems.
*  And and that's that's probably OK.
*  I mean, one of the things I write about at the end of the book is
*  we know all this stuff makes it hard for us to resist social media.
*  It makes us hard, makes it hard for us to resist email, texting,
*  checking the news, all that sort of stuff.
*  We go back to it over and over again.
*  But you could use those same hooks for the good.
*  You could you could use them or apply them in situations like fitness,
*  where they are mostly things that are good.
*  And fitness is one eating healthy, healthy foods,
*  things like education.
*  Like you could kind of trick kids into learning stuff, trick even my students.
*  Like if you if you could in some way make education more compelling
*  by creating goals and gamifying and all that sort of stuff.
*  There are worse things, right?
*  If you can use those tools for the good.
*  That's one good thing about the books app on the iPhone.
*  It'll give you like, oh, you've achieved your goal of reading X amount of pages per day.
*  So there's one good aspect of being addicted to achieving those goals.
*  Is the ultimate irony being addicted to a meditation app?
*  Yeah, I this idea that the solution to tech is tech is more tech is.
*  I this is the important thing for me is that we talk about screens.
*  We say you addicted to screens or are you addicted to tech?
*  And that's obviously just the massive gloss on what's going on.
*  Right. It's not about being addicted to a screen or tech.
*  No one's going to walk around with a blank iPhone screen and just say,
*  I can't get enough of this device.
*  It's a vehicle and it's delivering something to you.
*  And if it's delivering an experience that you find compelling,
*  that's bad for you, then that's bad.
*  If it's delivering an experience that you find compelling,
*  but that ultimately teaches you a new language or helps you connect
*  with a loved one who's far away or whatever.
*  If it's if it's helping you meditate, find wellness, psychological calm,
*  all of that sort of stuff, more power to you.
*  If you're reading on your phone, people always say,
*  oh, I shouldn't be reading your book on Kindle.
*  I'm like, it's totally fine.
*  It's a screen.
*  It's whether you're looking at a page or a screen with writing on it.
*  That's fine. It's not a big difference.
*  The issue is not the screen. It's what you're doing on it.
*  So if you're using a screen to to administer medic meditation
*  or like to lead you in yoga or something that's important to you
*  for your wellness, for your for your psychological well-being,
*  I think that's fine.
*  We don't need to demonize tech to the point where we say we should,
*  you know, you only should do mindfulness activities
*  that involve another human being in your presence or being alone.
*  And you can't use screens.
*  I think that's that's again, another example of throwing the baby out
*  with the bathwater. And and it's it seems silly to me.
*  Do you think that it's possible to develop some sort of a program
*  or a structured discipline on how to correctly incorporate
*  these technologies into your life?
*  Like so you can give people a framework like this is what you should do.
*  This is what you shouldn't do.
*  This is this is the way to avoid the traps,
*  because a lot of what people are doing, it's not even compelling.
*  I see what you're saying about as long as you're doing something,
*  it's compelling.
*  You're getting something good out of it, like an education
*  or you're learning something new.
*  But God, a lot of what I look at is nonsense.
*  I just I'll just like and I was thinking this one day.
*  I was looking at all these people that were just staring at their phone
*  and scrolling through things.
*  I'm like, imagine if there was no phone,
*  but there was a drug that made you stare at your hands.
*  And just like mindlessly just stare at your hands
*  like a lot of people are doing with their phones.
*  You know, you might watch you might be watching some video on nothing.
*  Like to me, I watch a lot of muscle car videos.
*  I'm not getting anything out of that.
*  I'm not getting anything out of that.
*  But I'm watching these little look how pretty look how shiny.
*  Oh, listen to the sound.
*  Yeah, I'm not getting anything out of it.
*  I might as well be staring at my hand.
*  If there was a drug that made people just look down and stare at their hand,
*  we would be like, oh, my God, these people are under a trance.
*  Look how horrible this is.
*  Yeah, there are there are people who are kind of puritanical about it.
*  They're like, you know, they would say you shouldn't be looking at those muscle cars
*  or you shouldn't be doing whatever it is that you're doing.
*  That's not enriching your life.
*  I think that's nonsense.
*  I think we we take too seriously this idea that, you know, every minute of our lives
*  needs to be spent in the service of efficiency and maximization and all that crap.
*  You should spend time looking at the cars if they make you happy in the moment.
*  And not every decision needs to be made for long term well-being.
*  I do stuff.
*  You know, I find myself on YouTube for hours at a time.
*  And actually, at the end of it, I'm like, you know, was that OK?
*  Probably not the best use of my time.
*  Is it going to make me a, you know, an impoverished human being
*  who hasn't reached his goals? No, it's fine.
*  I mean, you don't do that all the time.
*  Your question about a framework, I think, is really an excellent one.
*  And it's one that I've thought about a lot.
*  Now, one of the things I've started to do is to work with some school districts
*  and thinking about education and curricula.
*  You know, could you, you know, we teach kids good manners.
*  We teach them math.
*  We teach them a lot of things that are actually not at all practical,
*  that they're not going to need when they leave school.
*  But one thing that's incredibly practical today is
*  teach kids about screens, digital hygiene or whatever you want to call it.
*  Like, how do you interact with a screen for the best outcomes?
*  I don't know exactly what that course would look like,
*  but it's something that I think smart people should get together on and figure out.
*  I think it's a very valuable use of kids' time.
*  It doesn't have to be like years of education,
*  but just have a conversation with them about this thing.
*  You know, there's this thing that's probably going to try to eat up
*  hours of your life and amounting to 20 years.
*  Let's talk about what the benefits are, what the costs are.
*  Here are the questions to ask yourself.
*  And for me, that framework, that question, like I'm not I could never tell someone
*  don't look at videos, don't use social media.
*  I would never want to do that.
*  It's not my it's not my sensibility.
*  It's not the way I think about these things.
*  But what I do think is we should all just ask the question,
*  just kind of audit or interrogate your your use of these devices.
*  And if you come away from it, you're like, this is fine.
*  Like I wasted a bit of time, but I live a fulfilled, healthy, happy life.
*  I have good social connections.
*  I'm not spending tons of money on experiences that I can't afford online.
*  You know, if you if you answer all those questions, you come out with it.
*  You say things make sense for me and I'm OK spending a bit of time on these devices.
*  Then you're fine.
*  But if like a lot of people, you say, this is not great.
*  This feels problematic.
*  Then that's that's when you know something needs to change.
*  I think you're nailing it in terms of
*  getting children to be aware of the problems of these devices now
*  and to get ahead of it with education and to just get it into their mind
*  and maybe have them reinforce it with each other.
*  That there's there's real issues here.
*  And we weren't even aware of these real issues a decade ago.
*  This is why it's not in the curriculum.
*  I've always been frustrated at the fact that we spend so little time
*  educating children how to think about things,
*  how to think about the way you react to things,
*  why you react to them this way, the way you live your life,
*  the way you treat each other, the just communication issues
*  and observation issues and and just just cognitive issues,
*  just the way we view things and problems.
*  And I think we could solve a lot of these issues by educating children
*  just simply on how to think in the the the positive aspects
*  of looking at things objectively and honestly.
*  And then this would fall right into place with that,
*  because if you're being honest about yourself,
*  you're being honest about addictions,
*  you're being honest about the positive and negative aspects of technology.
*  We could at least give children the framework to use that sort of discipline
*  and understanding to not just approach it to electronics,
*  but all this future shit that's coming down the line,
*  not the current electronics, but things that we haven't even
*  we haven't even conceived yet, things that we're not aware of
*  that are going to probably be far more immersive
*  than all these current problems we're handling.
*  Yeah, I couldn't agree more.
*  I mean, I think the education system we use today is an overhang from,
*  I don't know how many hundreds, certainly decades,
*  but I'd say hundreds of years of a legacy of
*  just bad, bad education choices.
*  I mean, I think a lot of what kids are taught is just not useful for them.
*  It's not practical. It doesn't help them think.
*  At least if you're going to teach something that's not practical, make it
*  teach it in the service of some bigger aim that's really important.
*  You know, it's got to be it's got to have some value to it.
*  You only have kids in the classroom for a certain amount of time.
*  And I think you're right.
*  Like the most basic skill is critically assessing yourself
*  and the information in the world around you.
*  And it's a really hard one to learn.
*  And there are a lot of psychological biases built into us that mean that we are
*  fundamentally incapable of doing that, unless we're taught how to try to
*  at least begin to overcome those biases.
*  And then you put us in a world of echo chambers of whether they're political
*  or whether they're just the cultures we happen to be immersed in.
*  It's impossible to think about anything objectively and in a kind of
*  canonical, true sense anymore.
*  If you could teach kids how to do that, it would be a different world.
*  It would be a different planet.
*  It would be I think it's an incredibly valuable enterprise.
*  And I think it's something that is worth spending time on and thinking about.
*  And I would like since we're taking up, you know,
*  a quarter of our waking hours by staring at these little devices,
*  I think that should be part of that education for sure.
*  Yeah, I mean, I think it would apply to
*  every aspect of a kid's life.
*  It's just such a strange thing.
*  You have to learn that on your own.
*  Out of all the things that we teach children, which are important,
*  you know, history and mathematics and all the other things we teach them.
*  How do we not teach them that critical thinking skills and how to
*  how to look at yourself accurately and the benefit of it,
*  even when it's painful and uncomfortable, but that you you
*  can actually learn and grow through that and to learn to accept those
*  painful, uncomfortable truths because there's there's great benefit in that.
*  Yeah, I some of the research I've done has looked at this idea of
*  the benefit of hardship, basically, that grappling with difficult things,
*  practicing where the practice set that you're doing is harder rather than easier.
*  These are all, you know, they kind of go against our natural tendencies.
*  We like to do things that are a little bit easier.
*  We as a species like not to expend the effort that we don't have to expend in general.
*  But there are tremendous benefits that come from doing that with grappling,
*  with with complexity, with difficulty, actually being really honest about who we are.
*  And it all goes against the grain.
*  So the only way you're ever going to get kids to be, you know, self aware
*  and to to think about these things is by inculcating that when they're pretty young,
*  by teaching them that when they're the younger, the better, really.
*  Because as you get older, the gloss of of culture and society
*  and all the kind of stuff that's around us, that makes it hard for us to engage in that way,
*  it starts to take over.
*  How long did it take you to write this book?
*  It took about 15 months.
*  I spent six months doing a lot of the research.
*  I interviewed about 50 or 60 people for it.
*  And then about nine months on and off of writing.
*  And then there was an editing phase back and forth with the editor.
*  Now that it's done and you you go back and you look at it
*  and you you think about the time that's passed since you released it.
*  Is there anything that you would have revised?
*  Is there anything that you wish you had added?
*  Yeah, you know, a lot of it, I think, stands.
*  A lot of this stuff is still true.
*  It holds holds the same sway with me.
*  I still endorse it.
*  I really, really struggled to get behind the curtain of the big tech companies.
*  And I wanted to write about the business side of what these companies were doing and
*  tried really hard, but didn't get that far in delving with these companies.
*  I couldn't get past a lot of the kind of there are some barriers.
*  And I knew what I was writing about because I wanted to be honest about it.
*  And I couldn't get a lot of the information that I wish I had been able to get.
*  Now, when I speak about it, I have a lot of that information.
*  I would have folded it into the book.
*  A lot of it's not in there.
*  I mean, I still talk about what these companies are doing,
*  but I would like to have known more about the business side.
*  And a lot of that was hidden from me.
*  So that's a big part of it.
*  There's not there's not much else, really.
*  I'm I have a PhD in psychology, and so I'm interested in what makes people tick
*  and how they think.
*  And so the middle big chunk of the book is these is different hooks
*  that are embedded in these platforms that make it hard for us to resist them.
*  And that hasn't changed.
*  That's as true as ever.
*  And so I don't feel that I would change anything about that part of the book.
*  What about the the business practices of these companies was interesting to you?
*  That they're aware of how addictive all these things are.
*  Yeah, I one of the practices I found fascinating
*  was the extent to which these companies use massive data sets
*  to make their decisions and huge amounts of data.
*  So, you know, there are two ways to make smart decisions
*  when you're designing a product.
*  The one way is you you speak to smart people who know a lot about humans
*  and what makes them tick their motivations.
*  And then you you take that information and you embed it
*  in the platform that you're designing.
*  But that's really hit and miss.
*  That's how a lot of video game development worked.
*  And again, speaking to these video game experts
*  who've designed games that have made tons of money,
*  who have been very successful, a lot of them will say, look,
*  I created a lot of games, but, you know, a lot of them missed the mark.
*  I had a couple that were great successes,
*  but for every two that were successful, there were 10 that weren't.
*  So there's a lot of kind of trial and error.
*  What the big tech companies do in large part is they avoid the trial
*  and error by being completely agnostic about the theory of what's going to drive us.
*  They don't need to know about that.
*  All they need to do is run this series of kind of trials by combat.
*  So if you're playing again World of Warcraft, Fortnite,
*  what I do is I throw two different versions of a particular mission up
*  and half the players will play one version, the other half will play the other version.
*  Let's say one of them is by is through a forest.
*  The other one's identical.
*  You have to do the same thing, but you're going by the ocean.
*  The question is, what effect does that have?
*  And you might discover people will play the mission 10 minutes longer
*  if they're by the ocean.
*  So then you say, OK, we're going to privilege ocean missions.
*  So now we have two versions of the ocean mission.
*  This is round two of the trial.
*  You can either rescue an artifact or you can rescue a person.
*  And people, it turns out, are more interested in rescuing a person.
*  So they'll play for an extra 10 minutes.
*  If you do this, this kind of trial by combat round after round after round,
*  you're evolving a weaponized version of the platform.
*  So you keep selecting the version that's hardest for us to resist.
*  And if you do that en masse, it ends up shaping the user experience.
*  You end up having features on the platform that are designed to be hard
*  for us to escape from.
*  If you're creating a game, you release the version
*  that's most difficult for us to resist.
*  Now, of course, forever, people who are writing movies or books
*  or any form of entertainment were trying to do this.
*  They just were much less good at it.
*  What the tech companies do is they they make this kind of a sure thing
*  by having access to billions and billions of data points
*  and getting real time, very rapid feedback from us.
*  Isn't it also to compare it to books and movies?
*  It's it's not a fair comparison because those things end.
*  Yes, that's really where the problem lies.
*  Right. Is that a book or a movie is not going to make you eat pizza
*  three times a day and gain 40 pounds over five weeks
*  because you're trapped in your house doing nothing
*  but enjoying this book or movie constantly because there is no end to it.
*  Like there's something
*  like I completely understand why they would do that.
*  I mean, it makes sense. You're engineering a game.
*  You would want to make this game the most compelling,
*  the most entertaining, the most engaging possible.
*  But do you think that these companies have a social responsibility
*  for recognizing the fact that they are massively addictive?
*  Do they have an ethical or social responsibility?
*  Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. I think they do.
*  I think I think the biggest problem, the most broken part of all of this
*  is is the incentive model.
*  So all of these platforms pretty much rely on.
*  I'm thinking about Google, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter.
*  These platforms require your eyeballs for as many minutes of the day as possible.
*  And every minute that you're not spending on that device,
*  you're spending minutes doing other things.
*  That is a loss. They conceive of that as a loss.
*  And it is because it means that less capable of attracting advertising dollars.
*  And that drives the whole model. That is a broken model.
*  It's a terrible model because it privileges
*  extracting minutes of time over delivering well-being.
*  Now, historically, products were largely if I made a great product.
*  Like when you played, I think you said it was Quake, right?
*  It's a quake. Yeah.
*  When you played Quake, when I played Doom,
*  when I played Super Mario as a younger kid than that, when Nintendo came out,
*  that was just an incredible product.
*  I think that was just, you know, that was designed to deliver
*  a phenomenal A-plus top class experience.
*  And when you speak to the video game developers, there's a purity to it.
*  You know, the creator of Mario and the creator of Tetris
*  and all of these games, they all talk about the kind of love
*  that went into the creating these games. That's gone.
*  This is not about making us happier, giving us a good experience,
*  an experience that we're willing to part with our money for.
*  It's all one big kind of heist.
*  They're trying to trick us.
*  They're trying to basically get us to part with our time
*  and therefore with our money.
*  And yes, there's an ethical responsibility.
*  I mean, if you if you see this as an industrial company
*  and this company is making billions of dollars,
*  but there are major externalities, so negatives that come with that.
*  Let's say they're spewing crap into the waterways and into the air.
*  That's something that, you know, for the last 25, 30 years or so,
*  the government has said, you know, that's not OK.
*  We're going to penalize you for that.
*  I'm not suggesting they do exactly the same thing with tech companies,
*  but there is an externality.
*  These companies are making billions of dollars.
*  The externality is not that they're poisoning their waterways and the air,
*  but they're changing how we live our lives.
*  And I argue in many ways for the worse.
*  Do you think a warning label would have the same sort of effect
*  that a warning label has on cigarettes?
*  Like, it doesn't really matter.
*  Like when they put those cancer labels on cigarettes,
*  people that smoke cigarettes already know it causes cancer.
*  I don't think it stops anything or helps them at all.
*  Warning labels are toothless.
*  They only work if you don't know, you know, if they're educating you.
*  And everyone knows everyone knows about cigarettes.
*  I mean, fighting fighting tobacco addiction is really difficult
*  with both with smokers and with young people who are thinking about smoking.
*  It's going to be the same with these devices.
*  I think no one needs.
*  Well, maybe maybe there's slightly more room to educate people about these things
*  with respect to screen time and what we're doing on screens.
*  But most of us know this stuff and warning labels don't do much.
*  I agree. So what could they do?
*  You're not going to have them hamstring themselves
*  and make a game that's less addictive.
*  Like if you like, let's propose they reverse engineer
*  what they've done and do it the opposite way.
*  Like going towards the ocean makes people play more.
*  So we're going to go to the woods.
*  Rescuing a person makes you play more.
*  So you're going to you will rescue a gem, you know, like,
*  and you're going to choose the least addictive out of all of these paths.
*  Then you're going to be noncompetitive with the people that are engineering games
*  that are going to choose the most addictive.
*  So then it's almost like everyone's agreeing to make the shittiest game possible
*  because that's the only way people can not be addicted.
*  It's true. I mean, there's there's no way in the arms race for our attention
*  and, you know, our dollars and all that sort of stuff.
*  No one's going to buy into this idea.
*  We should make a shittier version of the product.
*  I think that, as I said, the model is broken.
*  If the model is about attention and about picking
*  the version of the game that's going to extract the most time,
*  that's that's problematic to begin.
*  And it would be better if there were a way to basically
*  create a model that prizes consumer welfare,
*  which then translates into people wanting to part with their dollars.
*  I don't know. That's obviously difficult to do in practice.
*  But, you know, a lot of industries work that way.
*  It just so happens that the model we chose for in particular social media,
*  this is not as true for games, but for social media, for sure.
*  We are the product and our eyeballs are the product.
*  And the consumer is the big industry of companies
*  that are buying ads on those platforms.
*  So, you know, these the reason they're free is because they need our eyeballs.
*  But you could imagine an alternate universe where where you had to pay
*  a small annual fee to use these products, but there was no advertising.
*  And so the money came from revenue, from the billions of dollars of revenue
*  that you got from from individual users who are paying to use the platform.
*  And that's that's a universe that I think leads to better outcomes
*  for everyone and designing features based on people enjoying them,
*  getting value from them rather than features designed to hook us.
*  But I mean, I I've been thinking about this for it's now six or seven years.
*  And I am I'm just as exasperated.
*  And that's why I think a lot of the focus now has to be on the individual consumer.
*  If you're a consumer who needs help with this, you're spending too much time.
*  You feel bad about it.
*  Then let's talk about ways to deal with it.
*  But working at the level of the of the tech companies is really, really difficult.
*  I like how honest you're being about it, because it is.
*  You can be exacerbated.
*  There's no way you're going to say, oh, I've found the solution.
*  The thing is too big.
*  So when you're a guy who studied this for so long, you're spending so much time
*  and you're writing this book about it and you're constantly immersed in these ideas.
*  If you're not finding a solution.
*  Like if you're not saying this is what the tech companies have to do,
*  this is what we have to do as a society.
*  This is the path forward as a healthy culture.
*  No one is going to be able to figure it out.
*  If someone like you who's spending so much time looking at it,
*  when you're looking at the future and you if you just take away
*  what you hope people do and what you would like people to do to be healthier
*  and less addicted to these devices and these games and these social media platforms.
*  What do you think is going to happen?
*  Take away what you want.
*  And what do you if you have to be really honest, what do you think is happening with us?
*  I think we're making inroads in that we're chipping away at the problem in little ways.
*  Like I can tell you a thousand small ways that we're fixing the problem or making it better.
*  But none of them is what you're what you and everyone else is looking for,
*  which is what is the magic solution here?
*  Like, what is the one big thing we can do that would reverse this whole thing
*  that I don't see happening?
*  I'm pretty pessimistic about it.
*  I think the big changes, I can't predict what the government's ultimately going to do around the world.
*  There might there may be more government intervention.
*  I don't know whether that's a good thing or a bad thing ultimately.
*  Depends on the nature of it.
*  But I do think consumers are getting more savvy.
*  So one of the really interesting developments in the last decade or so
*  is that when I first started thinking about this,
*  parents would come to me and say, this is a disaster.
*  I can't get my kids off devices.
*  But there's been this weird shift where now kids are coming to me and saying,
*  my parents won't get off their devices.
*  And it's starting to affect older people.
*  And the younger people seem to have worked out ways of managing their lives more effectively than older adults can.
*  So I'm kind of hopeful that this is generation, maybe with the help of a curriculum
*  that's more thoughtful about this, which I know a lot of private schools are starting to teach this stuff,
*  that there will be the generation now of kids who have grown up around these devices.
*  Give them 10, 15, 20, 30, 40 years.
*  They're going to be the leaders of, you know, everything, basically industry, the leaders in a political sense.
*  They will be savvy about this in a way that we are not.
*  We were caught in this kind of no man's land.
*  This thing was a visited upon us.
*  You and I are part of a generation that straddle these two worlds.
*  People who are much older than us are still kind of coming to terms with the situation.
*  But, you know, there's a group of kids now who are probably 12, 13, 14, 15,
*  who have never known anything different.
*  And they're going to get older and older and older.
*  Having learned ways to cope, it'll be the kind of native world in which they grew up.
*  I am hopeful that they will be more mindful about this stuff.
*  They will, I don't know, maybe develop a kind of soft spot for the way we used to do things,
*  if we can teach them that.
*  And they'll be more mindful about it in a way that I think the generations that have this
*  visited upon them later on in life have struggled to be.
*  God, I hope you're right.
*  I don't think you are, though.
*  I'm already thinking about this stuff.
*  You know, I try.
*  Well, I appreciate that.
*  I love optimists.
*  I subscribe to the Elon Musk notion.
*  There's a great quote that he said, human beings are the biological bootloaders for AI.
*  And when I said that I think that one day we're going to be obsolete, that's my real concern.
*  My real concern is that what we are is some sort of an electronic butterfly that's
*  building a cocoon.
*  We're a caterpillar.
*  We're building a cocoon and we don't even know what we're doing.
*  We're just immersed in consumerism and buying the latest, greatest laptop and iPhone and all
*  these different things.
*  But we don't recognize is that what we're doing is contributing to this pattern of
*  technological innovation that will ultimately make us obsolete or at least make us become
*  one with it so that we avoid becoming obsolete.
*  Yeah, I mean, you know, the ultimate problem for us is that we we prize ease, comfort,
*  well-being, happiness overall else.
*  And so give us something that will help us do that.
*  And we will will be like mindless animals that don't actually have a brain and we'll keep
*  moving in that direction.
*  And there are certain drives that will keep pushing us in that direction.
*  And if you can meet them with screens and we'll say, you know, that's fine.
*  I'll sell my soul.
*  I'll sell the species and sell the long term, you know, the long term survival of humanity
*  for that. And that's that's where we are.
*  I mean, what you said, I thought was really interesting about the idea that maybe we're
*  all just not you didn't say this, but I was thinking maybe we are all staring.
*  There's no phone with it as a drug that we've all taken.
*  It's in the water and we're actually just staring at our hands for four to five or six
*  hours a day. I basically believe it.
*  I mean, it's it's as absurd as what's actually going on in the world right now.
*  It's not much different in terms of the actual impact that it has.
*  Well, staring at your hand might actually be better because it's stared at your hand.
*  You wouldn't have all the social anxiety that particularly kids have.
*  Jonathan hates book The Coddling of the American Mind paints are particularly disturbing
*  portrait of young girls and the pressure that young girls deal with because of social
*  media and online bullying and then comparison, comparison, comparison to each other and
*  then the use of filters and all these different things that that paint this very unrealistic
*  depiction of what a person looks like.
*  And that's what everyone aspires to.
*  And how many girls are self-harming, how many girls are committing suicide and that this
*  massive uptick in depression and and medication and all these different things that show
*  this psychological damaging aspect or psychologically damaging aspect of these devices
*  and social media.
*  Yeah. So I know I know John well, he's also at NYU where I teach and I know his his
*  work. We've talked quite a lot about these issues.
*  I think that people always say what's the biggest problem with these screens?
*  And I think for me, it is this experience for teenage girls in particular of spending
*  colossal amounts of time looking at, as you say, Instagram filters, influencers being
*  bullied online, the effect it's having on depression rates, anxiety and even rising
*  suicide. I know you I think you have a daughter.
*  Is that right? I have three daughters.
*  You have three daughters. Yeah. So I have one daughter and a son.
*  They're very young still.
*  But I think a lot about about that, these issues and how I know what I want to do to try
*  to encourage them not to not to be in this position as they grow up.
*  And that to me is the biggest concern.
*  I think John is right to focus on those issues.
*  I think getting them involved in physical activities that don't involve cell phones is
*  important, too. Like one of my daughters was really into gymnastics and the other one is
*  into basketball and to get them into things that are physical that they have to do.
*  Like you have to you have to do a tat.
*  There's a thing that you have to do physically.
*  And then you get. Yeah.
*  Yeah, I think I think physical activity is huge, you know, just exposing them to the
*  things that are so hard to be exposed to naturally today.
*  So they'll all end up finding screens.
*  But what they won't end up finding is, you know, hikes, team sports, all that sort of
*  stuff. I think I agree with you.
*  That's that's it doesn't have to be a team sport, but just using your body physically.
*  I take my kids there, as I said, they're really young, but I take them to this little
*  park. What's quite a big park.
*  It's like a national park around by the water.
*  And so they see the ocean and they see a little beach and they see trees and they
*  climb on logs and all that stuff.
*  The stuff that I used to do as a kid that was very natural in the 80s that's just not
*  available in the same way that now.
*  And that's that's very purposeful.
*  I mean, I think we you've got to you've got to be a bit retro in the kinds of things
*  you expose people to when they're young.
*  Well, that's what's weird about raising kids today is that there's not a bunch of
*  past generations that can tell you how to train your kids in a world of immersive
*  technology. You're really kind of on your own.
*  This is like I grew up without the Internet.
*  The Internet came around when I was an adult and I sort of have learned to cope with
*  it. But I at least had the foundation of growing and getting through high school and
*  all the formative years without it.
*  And kids don't have that today.
*  And parents don't have the experience of having their parents tell them, well, this is
*  where I made mistakes and this is where you got to be careful with these devices.
*  That doesn't really that there's no precedent that's been set.
*  There isn't. We're the first generation of parents to have to deal with this.
*  And that makes it especially tricky.
*  You know, there's no common wisdom.
*  Older adults certainly have no no idea how to counsel us on this.
*  And I think that does make it extremely tricky.
*  We're all flying by the seat of our pants.
*  Which is why I think focusing on this issue is really important.
*  So, you know, there are there are areas of this, as we've said, that you can't really
*  touch. I think tech companies are going to keep making billions of dollars.
*  They're going to continue to arms race.
*  That's not going to change. They're all going to push as hard as possible to extract
*  every spare minute. But the other side of this is the I think the much more human side,
*  which is how do you help your kids stay out of trouble on screens?
*  How do you prevent bullying? How do you prevent them from from being overwhelmed by the
*  kinds of anxieties that are much more common on screens than they were in the pre
*  screen era? And that stuff, I think, is where we we people who write about this
*  and think about it can make real inroads.
*  And that seems really important.
*  I think there's no more important enterprise around the subject than learning how to be
*  parents and learning how to help kids grow up in this world that's become really
*  full of this kind of new minefield that didn't exist before.
*  What has changed for you from studying this and writing this book?
*  What has changed with the way you interface with technology and what what steps have
*  you gone through to alleviate some of these problems in your own life?
*  The biggest thing for me is is really just very basic analog interventions.
*  So what I mean by that is physical distance and time are the biggest things.
*  So I track my time and how much I use my screen and I make sure that I have certain
*  parts of the day where I religiously and consistently don't have a phone nearby.
*  If I have a phone within reach, I'm going to be thinking about it all the time.
*  There's no way around that. And I'll probably reach for it.
*  So I did that experiment where you try to sort of get a sense of how much time during
*  the day can you reach your phone without having to move your feet.
*  The answer for me was pretty much the whole day.
*  It was I was by my bedside.
*  It was wherever I was, it was there.
*  So one of the things I've done is we have a little box near our kitchen where we have
*  our dining table. We put our phones there when we're when we're having dinner.
*  So there are no phones around physically when we're having dinner.
*  That's true at any kind of meals where possible.
*  I try to keep my phone out of the bedroom.
*  So I have an alarm. I have this little watch that I wear that has a vibrating alarm on
*  it. It doesn't really have much of a screen on it.
*  It just vibrates when it's time for me to wake up.
*  So when I'm in bed, I have absolutely no screens around.
*  And that's that's been really helpful, because I think the worst thing is when you wake up
*  in the night, you roll over, you pick up your phone and it's like instant jet lag.
*  You're basically signaling to your brain that it's daytime.
*  And that's that's incredibly damaging.
*  So those are the two biggest things.
*  I also have have done a number of things that defang the device itself.
*  So if you remove all the notifications except the absolutely most critical, urgent
*  ones, there are a few of those that are important to some people.
*  That's that's been very helpful for me.
*  So I've done that. I the other thing I do is periodically, you know how you have that
*  script like you'll go on your phone and you'll be like, it's email, Instagram, Twitter,
*  Facebook email, and you keep going round and round in this kind of loop.
*  One way to disrupt that is every month have a reminder go off in a calendar that says
*  it's time to switch my apps around, my icons around.
*  And I just I screw the whole thing up.
*  Like I'll put them in different places, make it hard to find them.
*  And so what that does is it short circuits this tendency to fall into that loop because
*  every month or so I'm changing the way my phone looks, which most people hate.
*  But if what you're trying to do is short circuit the process of getting into that loop,
*  it's actually very effective.
*  One other thing that a lot of people talk about is there's a black and white mode on
*  your screen. Your phone, it's called grayscale, I think grayscale mode.
*  And the whole experience, it's still a utility.
*  Like the best things about these phones are the maps, all the stuff that you get from
*  them, they're utilities.
*  You still have that. But the experiences that rely on like gusts of color and all that,
*  they are defanged.
*  And that tends to lead people to spend less time on their screens as well.
*  Do you use that?
*  I have. I am. I'm colorblind.
*  Really? Yeah, I am.
*  I'm not profoundly like I can see some color, but my first book was called Drunk Tank
*  Pink, which was about this color pink that they used to paint inside jail cells to calm
*  prisoners down. And that was that was one of the anecdotes in the book.
*  So I called the book Drunk Tank Pink.
*  And people always used to say to me, does that affect work on you?
*  And I mean, I really I don't know, because I can't I can't really see these colors.
*  So I don't have the same response.
*  Like I confuse a lot of the colors.
*  And so the color feedback that would be really like intense for you on a phone, it's mostly
*  lost on me. I can't tell the difference between reds, browns, greens, oranges.
*  They'll look basically like fall for me is confusing.
*  Everything's just gray. Really?
*  Yes. But that's funny because you're saying gray like you recognize gray as a color.
*  But how old were you when you realized you were colorblind?
*  So I have this I have the sense.
*  So when you're very young, you know, the picture books, the kids look out where there
*  are colors on the picture books and then you talk about the colors like there's a bright
*  red. You'll see a cherry and it's red and you'll see grass and it's green and you'll see
*  trees with brown bark on them and, you know, the blue sky.
*  I learned very quickly what colors things were supposed to be.
*  And so for the first few years of my life, I wasn't seeing those colors, but I knew what
*  colors I was supposed to be seeing.
*  And so it looked like I was learning my colors.
*  So what do you see?
*  What do you see?
*  So well, so later on, once colors became more subtle, when I was about eight, nine or
*  ten, it started to look like something was wrong because I'd get colors wrong.
*  And I was old enough to know.
*  And so they took me to an optometrist and he did he administered this test.
*  I'm sure you've seen these before.
*  They're called the Ishahara dot tests.
*  And you see all these dots and you're supposed to see a number if you can see normal
*  color. But they're very clever tests because a lot of people say they're colorblind when
*  they aren't. Like if you want to get out of military service or something like that,
*  or you don't want to be a fighter pilot, you can say, I don't want to do these things
*  colorblind. These tests are brilliant because if you are colorblind, you will see a
*  number that people who have proper vision cannot see.
*  And so you can't just say, I can't see anything.
*  You can't you can't like fool the test taker, the test administrator.
*  So what happened was I did this test.
*  There it is. I can't see any.
*  That actually just looks like dots to me.
*  Really?
*  But yeah, some of them I can see a number.
*  But hold on a second. If that's the case, wouldn't that be that it would be easy to
*  fake? Because I can see the number.
*  If you get those. So the problem is they have to be the exact right colors.
*  So they're in these booklets.
*  You can do it on screens.
*  If you pull one up, that's the contrast and the colors are correct.
*  I will see a number that you won't see.
*  OK, so we're looking at one here.
*  Like this is this to us looks just like it's 12.
*  So you can see that and I can't.
*  Wait a minute, let me see that again.
*  That looks like a three to me.
*  You see three?
*  Yeah, I do see a three.
*  I see an eight.
*  I see an eight on that one.
*  There you go.
*  There you go.
*  So you see an eight.
*  I see a three.
*  If I said to you, I can't see a number there, they would say to me, you're faking.
*  But what happened when I did the test and I saw all these numbers, I was like, I
*  guess I'm not colorblind.
*  And I got to the end of it and the guy was like, you've seen all the numbers
*  that colorblind people see, like where you would have seen a 12, I'll see an 18.
*  And I'll be confident that I'm getting the right answer.
*  Um, so it's, it's a pretty clever test.
*  Is this an inherited trait?
*  Yeah.
*  My grandfather on my mom's side was, and what happens is he passes it down to his
*  daughter who's who carries this trait, but most women don't actually express it.
*  But then 50% of her sons, if she has sons will be colorblind.
*  My brother is not colorblind and I am colorblind.
*  So now I have a daughter.
*  If she has sons, 50, they have a 50% chance of being.
*  So do you let your wife dress you?
*  Yeah, but I probably do that anyway.
*  Because you, you wouldn't match things correctly, right?
*  Wouldn't that be the idea?
*  Or you would do it by shade?
*  Yeah, I would.
*  I I'm, I'm just for colors.
*  I mean, I've made some horrific color decisions.
*  Actually, when I started teaching, when I first started teaching at NYU, this is
*  about it just over a decade ago.
*  I, I was a grad student for years.
*  I had no money and I wanted to get some cheap business shirts.
*  So I went, I went to this store and I had this bargain bin of shirts and there
*  were just this huge array of white shirts.
*  So I was like, it was like 10 for a hundred bucks or something.
*  So I got 10 of them, like had a full wardrobe of white shirts.
*  Thought that that's all I needed.
*  Turns out they were pink.
*  And I had no idea.
*  So I'd show up a class every day, every single day in a pink shirt, thinking it
*  was this like kind of basic nondescript white shirt.
*  And at the end of the semester, the comments were like, was this an experiment?
*  Why did the professor come in pink every time?
*  So the only thing they focused on after a semester of teaching was what's
*  going on with the pink.
*  So, so yes, it's important that I let my wife dress me.
*  That's, that's hilarious.
*  It's also such a strange statement.
*  Like we have a weird thing with pink.
*  I don't understand why pink is such a polarizing color with men.
*  I've never had it explained to me correctly that there's this one
*  color that represents girls.
*  There's no one color that represents maybe, maybe blue, but girls wear
*  blue all the time and no one thinks anything of it.
*  Yeah, I agree.
*  I agree.
*  I did some research on it just to try to work out what the deal was between this,
*  you know, with it's, you know, the blue versus pink idea and the fact that these
*  colors are associated with different genders.
*  Um, and until about 50 years ago, pink was associated with youth, with young
*  people, with being a teenager or a young person that had no gender association.
*  Yeah.
*  What happened?
*  I mean, I don't know.
*  No one seems to know what the original point where that split happened, where
*  it became really a color that was marked as being for girls, but.
*  I, it's true though that it is the only color that has that strong a gender
*  association, it's rude and it's a very strong, very strong, very strange.
*  What is it like for you when you looked at, did you, did you see that internet
*  meme where it was a dress and people couldn't figure out whether it was, what
*  was it like gold and black or blue and like, what were the colors?
*  Do you remember what they were supposed to be?
*  It was blue.
*  I think it was blue and black and gold and white, something like that.
*  Maybe.
*  What did you see?
*  Um, that worked for me.
*  I did see one of them and I was very firm about it and angry with people
*  that disagreed, which I think was just another way to polarize us.
*  I, I think I saw, I saw the darker one, whatever the darker one was.
*  I didn't see white.
*  I couldn't see that.
*  I just saw, I think it was black and maybe gold.
*  There are a few of these that have come through now.
*  They do work on me because that's really about tone.
*  That's not as much about hue, the specific color.
*  So I'm good with tone.
*  I'm very good at distinguishing tone, but when you give me a color, so
*  everything I wear is pretty much either blue, black, white or gray.
*  Cause the only color I can see very well is blue.
*  The way I see blue is pretty similar to how you see it.
*  The way I see most other colors is kind of washed out and, um, I
*  don't have a good sense of it.
*  Oh, so some people there's varying degrees of color blindness.
*  It's not as simple as your color blind.
*  Like you just color blurry.
*  Yeah, it's basically like that.
*  So there are different kinds of color blindness that, that, uh, it's
*  basically, there's a problem with the cones in your eye, which pick up color.
*  And there are three cones.
*  There's a one that's sensitive to red, one that sensitive to green, and one
*  that sensitive to blue, and depending on which ones are, you know, malfunctioning.
*  And for me, it's, I think it's the green ones.
*  Um, you get a different kind of color blindness.
*  There are different forms of it.
*  So some people really struggle with blue and yellow.
*  I can see those two and distinguish between them pretty perfectly.
*  My big issue is much more common.
*  And you know, the most common kind of color blindness is red green.
*  I have red green, which also means Browns and oranges and some other similar
*  colors and somehow blue kind of escaped for me.
*  So my ability to see blue is, is untouched mostly.
*  And that's why I like to wear blue.
*  Cause I can see it.
*  I also, it's my favorite color.
*  It's the only one that's like bright for me.
*  So for you, the, the allure of screens must be at least slightly lessened than
*  the average person who concentrates on the latest, greatest OLED screen with a
*  massive amounts of pixels and beautiful clarity and high definition.
*  Yeah, sure.
*  I, I, my first job was I worked at Sony in a retail store that sold Sony equipment.
*  And I struggled to sell TVs when they were kind of the best, most expensive.
*  I could tell people stuff, but I couldn't see it myself.
*  It was kind of wasted on me.
*  I could see the definition, but I could never get the sense of the color.
*  And I started to, this is in the early 2000s, they were really pushing this
*  idea of like realistic, rich, bright, vibrant colors totally lost on me.
*  So when you watch a movie like Avatar, you don't, you just see this sort of gray mess?
*  Avatar's it's a little bit like those, those picture books when you're a kid
*  where the colors are so bright and obvious that I got a good sense of it.
*  Maybe it's still washed out compared to what you see, but take anything subtle.
*  Like look at a real, a real world landscape.
*  If you, you probably, you'll see trees in the fall and you'll see this wash of colors.
*  You'll get some oranges and reds and greens and browns.
*  People describe it to me as like the most incredible experience to see that.
*  If you're in the right part of the country, I've never, I've never experienced that.
*  I just, I've been taught that leaves are green and then at some point they fall off the tree.
*  So I, I know that, but I really do struggle to see that, that the variations, the one
*  color I can usually see is yellow because it's lighter, but if the intensity of the
*  hue is the same, I just, it's lost on me.
*  Is there a treatment for that or some sort of proposed treatment?
*  There are these incredible glasses.
*  You could check them out.
*  They're called, I think they're called N-chroma.
*  E-N-C-H-R-O-M-A.
*  And they help some people, but not everyone.
*  But there are videos online of people who are colorblind getting N-chroma glasses as a gift.
*  They're expensive.
*  They're a few hundred bucks.
*  And you, you pop them on and it's supposed to make it so that you're seeing the world
*  through the eyes of someone who isn't colorblind.
*  So you get these videos online now of people getting their glasses for the first time.
*  Like a dad will get the gift from like his son or daughter and he'll put them on and
*  he will break down in tears.
*  I'm watching it right now.
*  I'm seeing it right now.
*  A guy doing it.
*  There you go.
*  I mean, it's, it's emotional.
*  Like it's, it's like being, having this faculty suddenly visited upon you later,
*  very late on in life.
*  Um, so I bought, I bought one of these.
*  I actually got in touch with one of the companies and I asked them if they would send
*  me a trial pair.
*  Didn't have any effect for me.
*  It doesn't work forever.
*  I was, I was, I was pissed.
*  I was pissed.
*  Yeah.
*  And, but there's nothing medically they can do.
*  There's nothing gene there.
*  No, it's nothing.
*  No, it's maybe with stem cells at some point, they'll be able to do something with
*  it because it's, it's really just the, the structure, the anatomy, the physiology.
*  I don't know the exact terms, but the, the cones themselves are just malfunctioning.
*  So there's no surgery.
*  There's nothing, you know, it's just, it's a really kind of fundamental deficiency in
*  the way you see things.
*  And this is 10% of men.
*  It's not, it's not a tiny part of the population.
*  10% really?
*  I had no idea.
*  It's 1% of women and 10% of men.
*  Wow.
*  So if there is any benefit, it would be that you're not as compelled to look at screens.
*  That's right.
*  That is, that is one of the, one of the upsides.
*  And I really do feel that.
*  I mean, I don't, I don't enjoy the experience of looking at screens the way I think a
*  lot of people do.
*  I just don't, I don't get much from it.
*  Um, I get much more from the experience, but not as much from the screen itself.
*  So ask about the colorblind mode in video games.
*  Is that something that's helpful to you?
*  Like, can you see, do you see what we see?
*  Or are you seeing like blood that would appear red here then?
*  Yeah.
*  So what happens when I see a colorblind mode, when there's an attempt to sort of
*  improve or fix something for me, it makes two colors that I would see as the same
*  appear different.
*  And then what I do is a big part of color perception is top down, which means that if
*  you know stuff about what you're supposed to be seeing, your brain will see that thing.
*  So if I see what is supposed to be blood, I'll see it as red, even if to you, you can
*  say, Hey, that's green or that's brown.
*  I'll just assume it's red.
*  So that's, that helps people like me.
*  Like I don't walk around constantly saying, I don't know what color that is.
*  I don't know what color that is.
*  I don't know what color that is.
*  I may not be seeing it the way it actually is, but my brain thinks I am.
*  We're looking at this screen right now of this video game.
*  Is this Doom?
*  Yeah, I just picked Doom because you guys were talking about it earlier.
*  And it's the new version of Doom.
*  And it's a colorblind version of it.
*  So do you?
*  Looks the same to me.
*  It looks basically looks and yeah, it doesn't look weird.
*  Okay.
*  So this is just how you see everything.
*  This is sort of like a yellowish hue.
*  Yeah.
*  So they usually to make something more, more clear for a person who's colorblind, you,
*  you either make it more yellow or you really make it more red.
*  Red's usually the best way to do it.
*  So if I, if I look through red cellophane, like I took transparent red, not like from
*  those, those old 3d glasses, when I look through the red, what that does is it
*  eliminates any green light.
*  And so it means that I'm seeing the world the way a person with proper color vision
*  would see the world through that same piece of red.
*  So if you and I look through red cellophane, we see the world the same way.
*  And actually, if you, if you look through green cellophane, you will see the whole
*  world is green.
*  It's not that different from how I see the world.
*  It's got a green wash over it basically.
*  Wow.
*  Well, I'm sorry to hear that, man.
*  Thanks.
*  I've never known anything else.
*  I'm good.
*  Well, you seem very happy.
*  But listen, thank you for being here.
*  Thanks for, thanks for writing the book.
*  I really, really enjoyed it, although it's very sobering.
*  And, and again, it seems like at the end of it, it seems like there's no real solution.
*  But I think that taking personal steps to mitigate some of the issues that we talked
*  about today is what really everyone needs to do.
*  Yeah, I think that's right.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, thanks very much for having me.
*  I appreciate it.
*  My pleasure.
*  Thanks, man.
*  Take care.
*  Thank you.
*  Bye.
*  Cheers.
*  You too.
