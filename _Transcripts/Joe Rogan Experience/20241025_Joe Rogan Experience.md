# Joe Rogan Experience #2219 - Donald Trump
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [October 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBMoPUAeLnY)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day.
*  All right, we're rolling.
*  Good to see you.
*  Let's go.
*  Here we go.
*  One of the things I wanted to talk to you about, I wanted to play this, but we decided
*  we shouldn't play it because it could get copyright strike and we don't want to get
*  the episode.
*  We don't want anybody to have any sort of way to get it down.
*  But it was the episode of you when you're on The View, and I think it was 2015 or 2006,
*  when you were running for president.
*  And you sat, you got introduced as our friend Donald Trump.
*  Whoopi Goldberg gives you a big hug and a kiss.
*  Joy Behar gives you a big hug.
*  Barbara Walters gives you a big hug.
*  They all loved you.
*  They were all talking about how you might be conservative in your financial positions,
*  but you're very liberal socially.
*  They're talking about you as such a favorable light.
*  The audience was cheering.
*  And then you actually started winning in the polls, and then the machine started working
*  towards you.
*  There's probably no one in history that I've ever seen that's been attacked the way you've
*  been attacked and the way they've done it so coordinated and systematically.
*  When you see those same people in the past, very favorable to you, like Oprah, when you
*  were on Oprah Show, she was encouraging you to be president.
*  Last week I did one of her last shows, I think maybe Thursday or Friday, that was a big deal,
*  being on Oprah Show, the last one.
*  I was like one of the last shows in that final week, and I said, boy, we've come a long way
*  since that.
*  What was it like?
*  Well, the concept, it was really like two different lives.
*  I had a very wonderful life, but I wanted to do this.
*  The Apprentice was still going very strong.
*  We had 12 seasons, and we had actually 14 seasons, 12 years over.
*  They had a couple of them.
*  Well, they canceled The Apprentice when you were running for president, correct?
*  No, they had Arnold Schwarzenegger do it.
*  I was involved in that.
*  I had enough of it, and we did great.
*  It was doing great, but they wanted me to stay.
*  They all came to see me.
*  They said, we're going to give you a contract.
*  They wanted to extend my contract.
*  Mark Burnett is a great guy.
*  They wanted to extend the contract.
*  Mark said, you're crazy.
*  Don't run, don't run.
*  Nobody gives up prime time, they said.
*  You know, it's one of those little things, which is probably true.
*  Nobody gives up prime time, though, for being president?
*  For running, well, for running against 20 some-odd people.
*  It turned out to be 18.
*  18 professional people, mostly politicians.
*  They said, who would do this?
*  I mean, it's a long shot.
*  Actually, the heads of NBC came over.
*  The Paul Talegni, all the top people came over to see me, try and talk me out of it,
*  because they wanted to have me extend.
*  The Apprentice was doing well.
*  So it was 14 seasons.
*  It was 12 years.
*  We had one, two seasons where we had a double, which rarely happens.
*  It was just a hot show.
*  And I said, you know, I want to do this.
*  What happened is, previously, like three years, four years before that, they did a poll.
*  They had Mitt Romney.
*  And somehow they put me in a poll.
*  And I blew everybody away.
*  I blew him away, which isn't that hard, frankly.
*  But I blew everybody away.
*  And I said, that's interesting, because I never really gave it that much real thought.
*  I thought about it, but never real thought.
*  But I saw these polls were very good.
*  And so I was thinking about doing it then.
*  But I had a contract with the Apprentice.
*  Plus, I was building two big buildings at the time.
*  And I wanted to make sure they got finished up properly.
*  And it was one of those things.
*  The kids were just sort of getting involved.
*  They're very capable kids.
*  But they were getting involved early on.
*  So I did that.
*  I got them done.
*  I had some very good successes.
*  And I came on.
*  And then I thought about it for the next one after the Romney disaster.
*  And I ran.
*  And I won against Hillary.
*  And it was quite an experience.
*  But it was a different life, because you're right.
*  I was on The View many, many times.
*  And they loved me.
*  Just the way people would talk.
*  Even if people had criticisms about you, people that didn't like you,
*  there was always feuds and stuff like that.
*  But the reality was the thing turned on you
*  when they found out that you were going to be president.
*  It was very coordinated.
*  And some people are catching on to that now.
*  There's a lot of people that were longtime Democrats,
*  like Elon and Bill Ackman and all these different, very
*  intelligent people.
*  And they support me now.
*  Bill Ackman supports me.
*  He's been very supportive, too.
*  This is what I wanted to ask you.
*  What was it like when you actually got in?
*  Because nobody really can prepare you for that.
*  When you're running for president, you don't really
*  know what it's going to be like when you actually get into office.
*  What was the what did you think it was going to be like?
*  So do you mean in office or when I decided to run?
*  No, when you got in.
*  When I was in.
*  So when I was in and won and was in the White House, essentially.
*  Well, first of all, it was very surreal.
*  It's very interesting.
*  When I got shot, it wasn't surreal.
*  That should have been surreal.
*  When I was laying on the ground, I
*  knew exactly what was going on.
*  I knew exactly where I was hit.
*  They were saying you were hit all over the place
*  because there was so much blood from the ear.
*  You would know that better than anyone.
*  When they get the ear torn off.
*  Ears bleed a lot.
*  They bleed.
*  Anyway, so and I was thinking the other day,
*  when that happened, I really knew where I was.
*  I knew exactly what happened.
*  I said I wasn't hit anywhere else.
*  With the presidency, it was a very surreal experience.
*  What's day one like?
*  You win.
*  You get inaugurated.
*  Holy shit, I'm the president.
*  Yeah, that's what happened.
*  So I'm driving down Pennsylvania Avenue.
*  I just built a building on Pennsylvania.
*  You know, the hotel, the old post office it was.
*  We called it Trump National Hotel.
*  And we sold it to the Waldorf Historia.
*  And it was a wonderful thing.
*  But I'm driving down.
*  I'm passing the hotel.
*  You've never seen so many motorcycles, police, military.
*  You know, it was a major thing.
*  I got off really the first time I used Air Force One, landed.
*  And we're coming down.
*  And it was very beautiful.
*  I mean, it was incredible.
*  And we're going down Pennsylvania Avenue
*  in the opposite direction.
*  You know, normally you're used to going one way.
*  And all of a sudden, you're going the other way.
*  The street was loaded up.
*  And I wanted to go out.
*  And I wanted to wave to everybody.
*  But that wasn't smart.
*  You know, the kids, a little bit dangerous, right?
*  When you watch, like, Kennedy and some of these, right?
*  But I really felt, I don't know, the love was so crazy.
*  And so I did get out of the car for a brief,
*  just for a very short walk.
*  I thought it was very important to do.
*  And Melania got out with her beautiful dress
*  on that became sort of a staple.
*  People loved it and barren.
*  And we're walking down the street.
*  But where it really got amazing, we get to the White House.
*  And now it's a little bit before dark, beautiful.
*  And we went up to the President's quarters.
*  They call them the presidential quarters.
*  And I'm standing in this beautiful hallway.
*  You know, it's funny, nobody ever talks about the White House
*  as being beautiful inside.
*  You know, you think it's going to be everything's
*  going to be all metal doors and stuff.
*  It's not.
*  It's so beautiful.
*  I made my money largely on luxury.
*  The hallway is like 25 feet wide.
*  The ceiling heights are, you know, every, it's so beautiful.
*  But I was standing there and I said to the guys,
*  I want to see the Lincoln bedroom.
*  I had never seen the Lincoln bedroom.
*  I'd heard about the Lincoln bedroom.
*  And I was standing with my wife.
*  I said, do you believe it?
*  This is the Lincoln bedroom.
*  I mean, it was like, it was amazing.
*  Because it's, look, if you love the country,
*  but here you're, the Lincoln bedroom and the bed,
*  you know, he was very tall.
*  He was six foot six, which then would be like, like Barron.
*  Right.
*  Would be like Barron Trump.
*  He's six nine, but six foot six.
*  He was very tall.
*  Then on top of that he wore.
*  There it is.
*  He wore that.
*  Yeah, there it is.
*  It's a long bed, elongated bed.
*  Because very, you know, people were shorter than,
*  you see some of the chairs are very,
*  very low to the ground actually.
*  But he had the long bed and they had,
*  you had the Gettysburg address right on that,
*  right under that.
*  You can't see it here, but right there,
*  the original version of the Gettysburg address.
*  And this is the original.
*  And I'm looking and I just looked around.
*  I said, do you believe this?
*  Because I was never a, first of all,
*  even if you were a politician,
*  but I was never a politician.
*  It just, I sort of just started, right?
*  Right.
*  And all of a sudden I'm standing at the White House.
*  And it was very, very surreal.
*  That room was so beautiful to me,
*  much more beautiful than it actually is.
*  You know, to me, when I looked at the bed
*  and the bed you could see it was a little bit longer,
*  had to be a little bit longer.
*  He lost his son and they suffered.
*  The two of them suffered from melancholia.
*  They didn't call it depression.
*  They called it melancholia and they suffered from it.
*  He was a very depressed guy
*  and she was a very depressed woman, more so than him.
*  And on top of that they lost their son,
*  whose name was Ted, Ted.
*  And it was, just seeing it in the little pictures,
*  little tiny picture, I mean, you can't see the details there,
*  little tiny, everything at the wedding,
*  a little tiny picture of Ted, who he lost.
*  And it was devastating.
*  And he was, you know, he was, look, he was in a war.
*  And he was having a hard time
*  because he couldn't beat Robert E. Lee.
*  Robert E. Lee won like 13 battles in a row.
*  And he was getting like a phobia, like a fighter.
*  You know a lot about the fight stuff.
*  But like, I went to a UFC fight
*  and it was a champion who was 14 and one,
*  about a year ago, you would know the names, 14 and one.
*  And the only guy he lost to was this one guy,
*  but the guy that he was fighting was like,
*  almost just an average fighter, lost numerous times,
*  but he beat this one guy.
*  So I said, okay.
*  I really don't know who you're talking about.
*  I will figure it out.
*  Okay.
*  But about a year ago, but the point is that he lost,
*  he wasn't nearly the fighter,
*  but the one who was not nearly the fighter had beaten,
*  he's the only guy that beat the champ,
*  like five years before.
*  And I said, I'll take the guy that won the other fight.
*  And that's what happened, he beat him a second time.
*  Sometimes psychological advantage.
*  No, it was just a crazy thing.
*  Lincoln had a, I don't know, I've never read this.
*  I heard it from people in the White House
*  who really understand what was going on
*  with the whole life of the White House.
*  But Lincoln had the yips about, in a way,
*  as the golfers would say,
*  he had a phobia about Robert E. Lee.
*  He said, I can't beat Robert,
*  because Robert E. Lee won many battles in a row.
*  He was just beating the hell out of him.
*  They tried to get Robert E. Lee to be on the North,
*  but he said, no, I have to be with my state.
*  The state was his whole thing, and he went to the South.
*  And he was, I've had generals tell me,
*  we have some great generals, the real generals,
*  not the ones you see on television,
*  the ones that beat ISIS with me.
*  We defeated ISIS in record time.
*  It was supposed to take years,
*  and we did it in a matter of weeks.
*  These are great generals, these are tough guys,
*  these are not woke guys.
*  But their favorite general,
*  in terms of genius, was Robert E. Lee.
*  In terms of strategy?
*  Strategy, strategically.
*  He took a war that should have been over in a few days,
*  and it was years of hell, a vicious war.
*  So here I am standing there,
*  and again, I had never really done this before.
*  I ran a number of months before I won.
*  I probably, I guess if you figure max it out,
*  it would be a year, something like that.
*  So I had never run for office.
*  And I did well, I mean, I went into debates.
*  We had 18 people, including me,
*  and then slowly but surely they started to disappear.
*  We had debates, good debates.
*  Everyone's aware of all this stuff,
*  but what I want to get to is like,
*  what was the experience once you got inside?
*  It was just a-
*  What did you think it was gonna be like
*  in terms of like your ability to govern?
*  Yeah.
*  It was your first experience governing anything.
*  You'd never been a governor, you'd never been a mayor.
*  Yeah, private stuff.
*  Business.
*  But now all of a sudden you're inside the White House.
*  The biggest thing was just that first moment
*  of being in this hallowed,
*  it was really a hallowed place to me.
*  It was beyond.
*  To me, that was the experience.
*  It was a surreal experience.
*  And then with time, that wears off.
*  With time it becomes your place where you stay.
*  Right.
*  I was doing a lot of, I had two things
*  that I really focused on.
*  Governing the country and survival.
*  Because from the moment I won,
*  before I got to office, all of a sudden,
*  I mean, they came down.
*  I mean, nobody has ever been treated that way.
*  And you see that.
*  I mean, you see we're in the Washington Post
*  very early on.
*  They said, well now the impeachment stuff starts.
*  And it did.
*  I mean, it literally started from the beginning.
*  So I had survival and run the nation.
*  I had a combination.
*  Most people don't have the survival.
*  They get in.
*  What did you expect though in terms of,
*  once you got inside, you had to appoint all these people.
*  How many appointments did you have to make?
*  Well, you have actually 10,000 appointments.
*  Now they're different.
*  You have big ones and then they appoint
*  100 people and 200 people.
*  But the president really is involved
*  with approximately 10,000 appointments.
*  So you'll appoint a secretary of state
*  and he or she will appoint a lot of people.
*  So it's a lot.
*  But in terms of major ones, you probably have like 100,
*  but they're big ones.
*  Treasury, state, military.
*  And how did you know who to appoint?
*  Well, I didn't.
*  I had no experience.
*  You have to understand, Joe.
*  So I was there 17 times in Washington
*  and I never stayed over.
*  According to the press, which I think is probably right,
*  over the years, I was only there 17 times.
*  I never stayed over.
*  So now I'm sitting there, I'm saying,
*  this place is gorgeous, but you know,
*  I don't know anybody.
*  It's like you.
*  You go to certain areas and other areas,
*  they may be great.
*  Washington was great.
*  Washington's not so great right now.
*  We gotta fix it.
*  We gotta make it better.
*  A very dangerous place, very badly maintained place.
*  We're gonna make it great.
*  We're gonna make it better.
*  We're gonna bring it back.
*  But I wasn't a Washington guy.
*  I was a New York guy.
*  I was a New York builder
*  and I built buildings in New York
*  and I knew that whole world,
*  but I didn't know the Washington world too well.
*  And all of a sudden,
*  you're supposed to be appointing top people.
*  What did you think it was going to be like?
*  Versus like, did you have any ideas
*  of what it was gonna be like and what was different?
*  Well, I was always involved in politics,
*  but usually from the standpoint of a donor.
*  I was a donor.
*  You know, I was a big donor.
*  I gave money to politicians.
*  I enjoyed politics.
*  Mostly Democrats, right?
*  Both, really, pretty much both.
*  I actually have pictures of Ronald Reagan in me
*  when I was very young.
*  Were you a Democrat until like what year?
*  I was a Democrat.
*  I could get you the exact,
*  but the early 90s, the early 90s,
*  I switched over eventually.
*  Actually, they had a reform party.
*  I was thinking about doing that for a little while,
*  but then fortunately I didn't because it's very hard.
*  You know, it's a two-party system.
*  And anytime you hear third party,
*  I know you like RFK Junior and so do I.
*  He's a fantastic guy.
*  I do, but I thought that being an independent
*  was nonsense.
*  It doesn't work because even if you do great,
*  you're not gonna get Congress.
*  In other words, you need now to say,
*  okay, now I'll get half of Congress.
*  They're never gonna vote for you.
*  So even if you got there, which is very hard,
*  and I know how you feel about Bobby,
*  and I feel the same way, and he's now with us,
*  but it doesn't, it's pure and simple.
*  It's a two-party system.
*  And somebody, I won't mention his name,
*  but somebody spent $250 million trying to get the nomination
*  as a reform party candidate or whatever,
*  and they got just nowhere.
*  You just get eaten.
*  The system eats you alive.
*  So it was really somebody that not only was new
*  to Washington, but was new to politics.
*  So in the office of the presidency,
*  over the years, all those presidents,
*  you've had 92% were politicians
*  and 8% were generals, General Eisenhower,
*  General Washington, right?
*  General George Washington, he had generals.
*  So it's 8% generals, no admirals,
*  8% generals and 92% politicians.
*  They're politicians and they go on.
*  So they never had a business guy
*  or they never had a guy that wasn't elected to an office.
*  They were all, like Ronald Reagan was really,
*  he was a movie actor, but he became the governor
*  of California for, I think, two terms, and then he ran.
*  So you'd never had a thing like this.
*  But in terms of me, and sometimes I'd use it as an excuse,
*  and I don't like having excuses actually,
*  but I'd use it as an excuse.
*  I had to rely on people that I respected or liked,
*  but that I didn't know that well,
*  because I didn't know them that well.
*  Some of those people I campaigned against,
*  because when you have 18 people,
*  we had mostly politicians running in the election,
*  running in the primaries,
*  and they got knocked out one by one,
*  but I got to like some of them.
*  Some of them I didn't like at all,
*  and I don't like them now.
*  And I'd rely on them and I'd rely on other people.
*  So all of a sudden, people would come in,
*  I'd like to recommend so and so to be secretary of state,
*  and I'd have three, four people recommend.
*  One thing I can tell you, everybody wants the position.
*  Of course.
*  No, no, but sometimes I'll hear,
*  a lot of people don't wanna work with Trump,
*  because Trump is tough to work with, et cetera.
*  Let me tell you, everybody wants to be
*  any one of these positions, they'd die for it.
*  Of course.
*  Now they don't wanna be known.
*  I mean, there's a particular guy in New York, primarily,
*  very big, very big, very successful,
*  very strong, very political, although he's not a politician.
*  He'd give anything to be secretary of state,
*  but if they ask him, no, I don't think I would do it,
*  but in the meantime, begging for it, okay, begging.
*  They all, everybody, look, everybody wants it.
*  But my point, what I wanted to get to.
*  By the way, no matter what you do,
*  but it's very dangerous to pick somebody
*  outside of a politician, because a politician's
*  been basically vetted for years.
*  You pick a business guy, and they've never been vetted
*  at all, and they're the head of a big company or something,
*  but they've never been vetted.
*  You know nothing about his personal life,
*  you know nothing about where he's been.
*  When you put him in, it's a little bit dangerous,
*  because all of a sudden they get checked up,
*  and you hear things that you're saying,
*  wow, this is not gonna work out too well.
*  So it's very dangerous.
*  Picking people that are outside of politics
*  is somewhat dangerous.
*  So you're kind of stuck in a position
*  where you have to pick established people,
*  and then the problem with established people
*  is established people are already indoctrinated
*  into the system.
*  And they're stiffs in many cases.
*  They're stiffs.
*  They're survivors.
*  I find that, you know.
*  What do you mean by stiffs?
*  When you say stiffs.
*  A stiff, they don't have nothing, they have nothing.
*  Or they're smart and survivor.
*  One little thing, so there was a congressman
*  years before I ran, and I was very close to him.
*  And I needed a license on something,
*  and he was very important in getting the license.
*  But it was a little bit controversial,
*  the license, this particular thing that was being licensed.
*  But I was close to this guy,
*  and helped him and everything else.
*  And I went to him, I said, I'd like to have your help.
*  And he said, let me take a look at it.
*  I said, ooh, that's not too good.
*  But I really hope you're gonna help.
*  Anyway, he tapped me along for a long period of time,
*  and ultimately didn't do it.
*  And I said, you are a stiff,
*  you could have done this thing so easy, et cetera.
*  But it was controversial.
*  He was in congress for many years, like 28 years.
*  And you know, there's a reason,
*  when somebody's there for 28 years,
*  you gotta be sort of smart.
*  Right, a survivor.
*  You know, you have older scandals.
*  And I realized he was a survivor.
*  And so they never do anything controversial.
*  They never take any chances or speak their opinion.
*  It's outside of the...
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  And yet, I don't disrespect him for it.
*  I actually respected the guy more in a way,
*  because he did survive.
*  You know what, he's been there for 28 years,
*  and he made it through.
*  A lot of people don't make it through.
*  It's a good way for non-exceptional people to survive.
*  Well, it is.
*  It certainly is.
*  So you're in there.
*  You have 10,000 appointments you have to make.
*  So you're getting advice from people.
*  And at one point in time,
*  did you have a moment in time where you realized,
*  these are bad choices?
*  Some of these people I shouldn't have had in there.
*  Oh yeah, I think...
*  So the one question that you'll ask me,
*  that I think you'll ask me, that people seem to ask,
*  and I always come up with the same answer.
*  The one mistake, because I had a lot of success.
*  Great economy, great everything.
*  Everything was great.
*  The military rebuilt it, biggest tax cuts in history,
*  all this stuff.
*  We had a great presidency.
*  Three Supreme Court justices.
*  Most people get none.
*  You know, you pick them young.
*  This way, they're there for 50 years, right?
*  So, you know, even if a president is there for eight years,
*  oftentimes they never have a chance.
*  I had three.
*  It was sort of the luck of the draw.
*  But I will say that it always comes back to the same answer.
*  The biggest mistake I made was I picked some people.
*  I picked some great people, you know.
*  But you don't think about that.
*  I picked some people that I shouldn't have picked.
*  I picked a few people that I shouldn't have picked.
*  Neocons?
*  Yeah, neocons, or bad people, or disloyal people, or...
*  People that were just bad.
*  People that were into the...
*  Because you got bad advice.
*  Yeah, I mean, look, I mean,
*  you're reading about them a little bit today.
*  A guy like Kelly, who was a bully,
*  a bully but a weak person, you know.
*  You know more about bullies than anybody probably around,
*  because you deal in a certain sport
*  where the bullies are exposed very quickly.
*  But you know, he's bad.
*  Bolton was an idiot, but he was great for me,
*  because I'd go in with a guy like a John Bolton.
*  You know John Bolton.
*  A friend of mine called me up.
*  I was picking Bolton, and he's a very smart guy.
*  His name is Phil Ruffin.
*  He's a very rich guy from Las Vegas.
*  He's a great card player.
*  He doesn't play cards, but he's a great player.
*  He's just a natural.
*  Got poker sense, right?
*  You know, good old poker sense.
*  And Phil Ruffin is a very, very wise kind of a guy,
*  and one of the richest people around,
*  and has had great success and understands people.
*  So it was in that I was picking Bolton,
*  or I picked Bolton, he called up.
*  He said, don't pick him.
*  He's a bad guy.
*  Now he wasn't in politics at all.
*  He's in various businesses.
*  He said, he's a bad guy.
*  He's just, it always works out bad with that guy.
*  And I said, oh man, I wish you'd told me this two weeks ago.
*  I already hired him.
*  You know, he's here.
*  And he was right.
*  But he was good in a certain way.
*  He's a nut job.
*  And every time I had to deal with a country,
*  when they saw this whack job standing behind me,
*  they said, oh man, Trump's gonna go to war with us.
*  He was with Bush when they went stupidly
*  into the Middle East.
*  They should have never done it.
*  I used to say it as a civilian.
*  So I always got more publicity than other people.
*  And it wasn't like I was trying.
*  In fact, I don't know exactly why.
*  Maybe you can tell me why.
*  Oh, I could definitely tell you.
*  You said a lot of wild shit.
*  Maybe.
*  I'll tell you.
*  Maybe.
*  You said a lot of wild shit.
*  And then CNN, in all their brilliance,
*  by highlighting your wild shit, made you much more popular.
*  And they boosted you in the polls
*  because people were tired of someone talking
*  in this bullshit, pre-prepared, politician lingo.
*  And even if they didn't agree with you,
*  they at least knew, whoever that guy is, that's him.
*  That's really him.
*  When you see certain people talk, certain people
*  in the public eye, you don't know who they are.
*  You have no idea who they are.
*  It's very difficult to know.
*  You see them in conversations.
*  They have these pre-planned answers.
*  They say everything.
*  It's very rehearsed.
*  You never get to the meat of it.
*  One of the beautiful things about you is that you free ball.
*  Like you get out and you do these huge events
*  and you're just talking and you're making,
*  we've highlighted you on the show many times
*  when you did this Biden impression
*  where he's walking around, he doesn't know what he's doing.
*  It's funny.
*  It's funny stuff.
*  But it's like you, and you were making fun of Elon one time,
*  you were doing an Elon impression.
*  It's great.
*  You have comedic instincts.
*  Like when you said to Hillary, you'd be in jail.
*  That's great timing.
*  But it's like that kind of stuff was unheard of
*  as a politician.
*  No one had done that.
*  And I think-
*  You know it's funny, you need at least the attitude
*  of a comedian when you're doing this business.
*  This is a very dangerous business, first of all.
*  It's a very tough business.
*  It's the most dangerous business.
*  Well, for a job?
*  Yes.
*  I mean, other than going to war and being a firefighter
*  or being a cop, it's the most dangerous business.
*  It's the most dangerous.
*  Being president is the most dangerous.
*  Especially you.
*  I mean, you haven't even got to the election.
*  There's been two assassination attempts.
*  And they've brushed those out of the news
*  like it was nothing.
*  Yeah, they'd rather not talk about them.
*  Imagine if there was assassination attempts on Biden.
*  How hard people would be attacking the right.
*  They would be trying to get guns taken away from people.
*  They would try to ramp up gun laws.
*  They would try to figure out some way to blame you.
*  If there was a tax on, if Biden got shot in the ear,
*  we would have never heard the end of it.
*  But I think he's in good shape
*  because it's only consequential, presidents.
*  If you take a look at what's happened,
*  look, I'm for having countries pay us
*  billions and billions and trillions even dollars.
*  I took in hundreds of billions of dollars from China.
*  Nobody took in 10 cents, not one other president.
*  I do things that make it, I mean,
*  that don't necessarily make me so popular.
*  I just do what's right.
*  And when you do that, you know, you're more,
*  look at Iran.
*  We would have never had the attack on Israel at all.
*  Iran was broke.
*  I told China, if you buy, you can't do business
*  in the United States under any circumstances.
*  I was gonna, we're gonna go cold Turkey with China.
*  Some people think that would have been a good idea anyway.
*  But if you buy any oil, one barrel of oil from them,
*  you're not doing business.
*  I said that to many countries.
*  Iran was broke.
*  They had no money for Hezbollah.
*  They had no money for Hamas.
*  They had no money.
*  But I make myself, you know, I mean,
*  I understand what I'm doing.
*  You make yourself a target.
*  And it's a very dangerous business.
*  But if you just look at statistically,
*  so I said, I sort of think, I don't know if it's right,
*  but one tenth of 1% for a race car driver.
*  It's pretty dangerous business, right?
*  Yeah.
*  One tenth of 1% for a bull rider.
*  I tell you, to me, I was talking-
*  These guys that ride the bulls is worse than UFC is worse.
*  These guys that you see these big monster bulls
*  and you see it in slow motion where the foot is like,
*  you know, an inch away from the head.
*  If it hits him, the guy's gone, but they die.
*  You know, they die.
*  So one tenth of 1% die, is that what you're saying?
*  Yeah, one tenth of 1% die.
*  And they certainly get hurt badly.
*  I really, I mean, they can't walk
*  after a certain period of time.
*  But with a president, if you look at-
*  The amount of assassination attempts.
*  And attempts too, and attempts.
*  No, it's a very dangerous position.
*  I never thought of that, by the way, when I did it.
*  You know, you don't tend to-
*  Did you just assume because people loved you
*  on The Apprentice, they were gonna love you as a president?
*  Well, I figured it would be so easy.
*  You know, it's very interesting.
*  Well, it probably would have been
*  if the media didn't attack you the way they did.
*  If they didn't conflate you with Hitler.
*  I mean, even today, like,
*  Kamala was talking about you and Hitler.
*  They're gonna take what you said about Robert E. Lee.
*  Oh, Donald Trump was just the South One.
*  That's right, he loves Robert E. Lee.
*  They love to take things out of context
*  and distort things.
*  But they don't even have to take them out.
*  They make them up entirely.
*  They do that too.
*  But you know, it's interesting when you mentioned the-
*  I was very popular, and all those people loved me.
*  I mean, some of these women, they're so stupid.
*  And Joy, every time she'd see me,
*  like I'd be in the theater or something,
*  and she'd, you have to be on the show again?
*  Come on, come on, let's go.
*  She loved you.
*  She loved me.
*  That episode where-
*  By the way, Whoopi-
*  People should watch that episode
*  just to see what we're talking about.
*  Like I said, we don't wanna get a copyright strike,
*  so we're not gonna put it up.
*  But if you watch the episode, it's bananas.
*  It's like an alternative universe.
*  And it's only-
*  But Whoopi loved me.
*  Nine years ago.
*  Whoopi loved me.
*  Loved you, gives you a hug and a kiss.
*  And how about that other one, the new one on there,
*  the one from my administration?
*  She writes me a letter, you're the greatest president.
*  She leaves.
*  You know, she worked as like an assistant press secretary.
*  I hardly knew her.
*  But she leaves and she writes me this gorgeous letter.
*  What's her name?
*  She was, I don't even know.
*  Anyway, she was in the administration.
*  She's on now currently.
*  Sits on the far right-hand side,
*  whatever the hell the name is.
*  And she writes a letter, the most beautiful letter.
*  She's quoted in the paper.
*  He's a consequential.
*  He was the greatest president, blah, blah, blah.
*  Then all of a sudden she goes to interviews.
*  She started hitting the hell out of me.
*  Because they won't hire unless-
*  I've had many people go on CNN and they call me and say,
*  I don't know what to do.
*  They want to pay me a lot, but I have to be negative.
*  I knew, I said, be negative, that's okay.
*  There are guys on like CNN, they won't hire them.
*  Sean Duffy is a, you know, congressman and he retired.
*  He got a good job with CNN,
*  but he was only positive about Trump.
*  So they kept him, but they would never put him on.
*  I mean, I respect what he did.
*  He could have gone, you know, negative.
*  I tell people, go negative.
*  Let my friends make the money.
*  Well, it's just-
*  It's so crooked.
*  The press is so crooked.
*  It's crooked, but it's also,
*  they're diminishing themselves.
*  They're hurting themselves.
*  They're killing all their credibility.
*  And it's opening up the credibility to new media.
*  It's opening up the credibility to independent media.
*  All these-
*  The worst I've ever seen though,
*  and I've seen the worst.
*  I mean, I've been a part of it.
*  I've seen the worst.
*  Kamala goes on, 60 minutes,
*  gave an answer that a child wouldn't give.
*  It was so bad.
*  And 60 minutes took the answer out.
*  They took the whole, and they put another answer in.
*  They edited it deceptively.
*  Which didn't make sense either, but it was better.
*  They took the, well, it wasn't editing.
*  It was fraud.
*  This was not editing.
*  You know, editing is where I'll give an answer
*  and they'll take a couple of words and change them around.
*  Or they might even take a sentence or two off,
*  which is very bad.
*  But that's, it's sort of bad.
*  You know, I'd give an answer, which was a very good answer.
*  I always talk about, you know,
*  I like to give wrong the weave.
*  You know, I like to give wrong the weave.
*  Yeah, you like to weave things in.
*  But when you do the weaves,
*  and you have to be very smart to do weaves.
*  When you do the weave, look at this,
*  just in this one thing,
*  we're talking about little pieces around here,
*  but it always ends up.
*  No, no, it comes back home for the right people,
*  for the wrong people.
*  It doesn't come back home
*  and they end up in the wilderness, right?
*  But they can take my answer,
*  and you know what, they may take a little piece of it out
*  or something, and they use the term,
*  yes, we want to save time.
*  Well, it's not, but I've never heard.
*  I think it's the biggest scandal in broadcast history,
*  what happened to CBS.
*  So you have CBS 60 Minutes, that's a news program.
*  It's not an entertainment program.
*  It's under their news.
*  It's the head of their news thing.
*  She gives an answer that was,
*  that shows that she's essentially incompetent.
*  And they took the answer.
*  Could you imagine them doing that for me?
*  We can show it if you want people to see it.
*  Can we show it? Go ahead, sure.
*  No, we get in trouble, we'll get copyright strike.
*  Okay, listen, anyone can find it.
*  I'll indemnify you.
*  But it's drastic.
*  Interesting was the other full version
*  was available initially.
*  It was like a preview.
*  Somebody made a big mistake.
*  Somebody put that preview out there.
*  Some kid put the preview out.
*  Exactly.
*  And then the bosses did this or that.
*  And then all of a sudden said, we got a problem.
*  Exactly.
*  And then it became- They got caught by mistake.
*  Well, you know- But don't you think that's a big,
*  to me, and don't forget,
*  this is election interference and fraud.
*  And it's 60 Minutes, it's their news division.
*  So they give- It's a big deal.
*  They give those licenses out, Joe, for free.
*  They should pay a fortune.
*  They're worth a fortune.
*  They give them out for free
*  because they're using the public airwaves.
*  With cable, you don't have that.
*  Cable's different.
*  But, you know, it's just a different deal.
*  But with the networks, they give those licenses.
*  They're worth billions of dollars.
*  They give them out free,
*  but you have to be honest and all.
*  That was bad.
*  I think that David Muir and that woman that was aside,
*  I never even heard of her, but they kept interrupting me.
*  I said, how many people am I debating here?
*  I got this one and I got you two.
*  But he went after me 11 different times.
*  You know, it's interesting.
*  I always thought he was a nice guy,
*  but he's just like the rest of them, you know?
*  Well, that's his job, unfortunately.
*  And I'm sure- No, but not when they're wrong.
*  You're right.
*  Well, the problem was they fact-checked you
*  and they didn't fact-check her.
*  And one of the most egregious examples of that
*  was when she said that there are no troops right now
*  deployed in war zones.
*  There's a very famous viral video that went online
*  of troops in a war zone saying,
*  well, what the fuck are we then?
*  Because there's thousands of them.
*  Dan Crenshaw, the congressman, posted on his Instagram
*  all of the various examples of troops that are deployed,
*  thousands and thousands of troops
*  that are currently deployed.
*  Stupidly deployed.
*  But the point is, if this is going to be
*  an actual real debate and not a propaganda exercise,
*  if it's gonna be a real debate,
*  you have to fact-check everybody.
*  Like if someone says maybe she thought there was no,
*  which is also a problem.
*  So it's one of two things.
*  It's either it was not true, it was a lie on purpose,
*  which is terrible, or it was the opposite.
*  It was ignorance, which is also terrible.
*  Well, Joe, when I said crime is soaring,
*  he said, no, no, crime has gone down.
*  I said, where did he hear that one?
*  Crime has gone down.
*  I mean, I'm debating with this guy, but I've had that.
*  Well, there was amended FBI statistics
*  that came out after that,
*  that showed that crime had gone up substantially.
*  And by the way, the statistics were a fraud,
*  because when they put out the statistics,
*  they didn't include some of the worst places.
*  They didn't include some of the worst cities,
*  some of the most deadly places.
*  But when the real numbers came out,
*  I turned out to be right, but I haven't gotten.
*  You turned out to be right, but then there's another problem.
*  Unreported crime is way up, because people have lost,
*  look, the morale that the police department has
*  in a lot of these cities where they've done this
*  defund the police bullshit,
*  the morale of these poor cops, it's fucking horrible.
*  It's the dumbest idea of all time.
*  But what they've done is they've made these cops
*  feel terrible, like good cops.
*  I think cops are just like everybody else.
*  Most of them are great.
*  It's like everybody else.
*  But if you run into one carpenter
*  and he does a shitty job in your house,
*  he'd say, carpenters fucking suck, but they don't suck.
*  Most of them are great, and that's the key thing with cops.
*  But the point is, they did all of these things
*  in this very foolish way, and these cops are suffering
*  the consequences of it, and so subsequently,
*  what happens is a lot of crime is unreported.
*  A lot of crime, like you call the cops,
*  they're too busy, they can't even get to you,
*  or your house got broken into, sorry.
*  You know, it doesn't even make a report.
*  There's a lot of people that, they just give up.
*  It's so sad what's happened, and I'll tell you what,
*  I go to police funerals, and we went to one in Long Island,
*  I visited the family in Long Island, a very big deal.
*  It's so dangerous, people don't realize.
*  The car, dark windows, pull over, he's a gentleman,
*  please pull over, door opens, guy comes out firing.
*  Even if they were allowed to pull out their gun,
*  which they're not, they can't, you know, pull out their gun.
*  Doing time, yeah.
*  They still wouldn't have time.
*  It's every cop's worst nightmare.
*  They open the door, and he was killed,
*  and his partner was hurt, he was killed,
*  and you don't have, I mean, you don't even have
*  an eighth of a second to think,
*  and it is such a dangerous job.
*  That in particular, think of it, you go up to a car,
*  you don't know who's sitting there with a gun,
*  and if they have a gun, you really don't have a chance.
*  You're not allowed to have your gun out, by the way.
*  Yep, they have very strict rules.
*  So, number one, they're, but even if you could have
*  your gun out, the door opens, and bullets start firing out,
*  and especially where they have the dark windows,
*  where they have the darkened windows.
*  It is such a dangerous profession,
*  and it's very hard to get cops now,
*  because they're not given any backup,
*  and you're right, they have like an eighth of a second
*  to make a decision that's gonna change their life.
*  If they make the wrong decision, they're gonna end up
*  on the front page of every newspaper in the country,
*  and they're gonna lose their house, and their pension,
*  and their job, and their wife is gonna be gone,
*  and everything's gonna be gone.
*  Absolutely, and here's another thing
*  that people don't talk about.
*  How many of them have PTSD?
*  Probably most of them.
*  These guys are seeing people shot all the time.
*  I've talked to a ton of cops about it,
*  and a lot of cops commit suicide.
*  A lot of cops are deeply depressed.
*  A lot of cops have seen that.
*  But we have to give them back their dignity.
*  We have to, we can't, we just have to give them back.
*  You said it's so good.
*  You never hear anybody say that.
*  You're never gonna have it perfect.
*  You're gonna have a bad apple.
*  In everything, in every profession.
*  But every time there's a bad apple,
*  that gets massive publicity, and it taints everybody else.
*  But it's also this very irresponsible thing
*  where people say, defund the police,
*  get rid of the police.
*  Even Kamala Harris was a part of that.
*  It's a very stupid way to look at it.
*  What you should do is fund the police.
*  You should have better training.
*  You should have cops that feel more appreciated.
*  You should have something that helps mitigate this PTSD
*  that all of them suffer through.
*  She was a big part of defund the police.
*  That was a big thing for her, defund the police.
*  Always defund the police.
*  Well, it's a political idea, right?
*  Yeah, but anybody with that political thought,
*  I don't think should be running for president.
*  And I think people are getting wise to it.
*  We're doing pretty well now.
*  I don't know, maybe in a week from now,
*  sorry about that.
*  I was wrong, but we're leading everything.
*  And I think we're going to have a very good election.
*  But I tell people, because people are starting to get to know her.
*  But she was defund the police.
*  She was all these transgender operations.
*  You know, if you wanted a sex change and you were in detention
*  and you demanded a sex change, they would give you a sex change.
*  Well, the wildest one is this idea of giving free sex change
*  to illegal immigrants. That's right. In detention.
*  That is the wildest thing.
*  Is that the biggest problem you have?
*  You just walked here for Guatemala. You need to become a girl.
*  But she was in favor of it. Yes. So think of it.
*  She was now she changed.
*  She changed 15 policies.
*  In fact, I'm going to send her a MAGA cap.
*  She stole your idea about no tax for tips.
*  I came up with this idea that honestly nobody ever heard of.
*  And now it took her two months.
*  But you know what? All of a sudden, it caught fire.
*  And she just put it into a little speech. Yeah. Well,
*  but I think we have I think we still have that issue.
*  I think that issue is a good one for us.
*  But now we have a lot of good issues.
*  You know, we had the the other day.
*  Think of how simple some of these things are.
*  We're trying to get cars built in the United States.
*  Detroit has been really tough. It's been a disaster.
*  They have a huge factor, a huge car auto plant being built by China in Mexico.
*  Make cars, sell them in the United States, put everybody out of business.
*  Right. Here we go again.
*  I said, if that plant is there when I'm president, I will put
*  100 or 200 percent tariffs on every car.
*  They'll be unsaleable in the United States.
*  And they just announced they're not going to build the plant
*  because they think I'm going to think of it.
*  They're not going to build the plant.
*  This was the biggest plant in the world.
*  It would have more than all of Michigan makes.
*  That's how big you know, this is what we're getting to.
*  And I said, if that plan goes up, I want them to understand, if I win,
*  I'm going to tax those cars at the rate of 100 or 200 percent a piece.
*  So that you won't be able to sell them in the United States.
*  They just announced they're not going to build the plant.
*  Yeah, I read that. I did a big favor for our country by doing that.
*  And I'm not even there yet.
*  To me, the most beautiful word, and I've said this for the last couple of weeks
*  in the dictionary today and any is the word tariff.
*  It's more beautiful than love.
*  It's more beautiful than anything.
*  It's the most beautiful word.
*  This country can become rich with the use
*  the proper use of tariffs.
*  It'll keep just float out the idea of getting rid of income taxes
*  and replacing it with tariffs.
*  Well, OK, we're serious about our.
*  Yeah, sure. But why not?
*  Because we ready?
*  Our country was the richest in the relatively in the 1880s and 1890s.
*  A president who was assassinated named McKinley.
*  He was the Tariff King.
*  He spoke beautifully of terraces.
*  His language was really beautiful.
*  We will not allow the enemy to come in and take our jobs
*  and take our factories and take our workers and take our families
*  unless they pay a big price.
*  And the big price is tariffs.
*  And he'd speak like that, but he was right.
*  And then around in the early 1900s, they switched over stupidly to,
*  frankly, an income tax.
*  And you know why?
*  Because countries were putting a lot of pressure on America.
*  We don't want to pay tariffs. Please don't.
*  You know, they believe me.
*  They control our politicians.
*  If you look at the kind of numbers that these guys make then and now.
*  But we had a commission meeting in the eight.
*  I think it was 1887.
*  Think of this problem.
*  We were so rich.
*  We had so much money.
*  We didn't know what to do.
*  So they set up a blue ribbon commission on tariffs.
*  And the sole purpose is what to do with all the money we had.
*  We were so rich because we were taxing other people
*  for coming in and taking our jobs.
*  And China does it.
*  That's what China did.
*  If you want to open a factory and sell cars, if you build a factory here
*  or have a factory, they don't take our cars.
*  They wouldn't take our cars.
*  But if you build a plant in China, you can do that.
*  Elon did that. By the way, Elon is great.
*  That guy is such a great guy.
*  I think you're a fan of Elon.
*  He is from a different planet.
*  He's the greatest guy.
*  That rocket coming in.
*  I told the story once or twice.
*  So you may have heard it because his speeches have been good.
*  Did you see the one last night?
*  Yeah, 29000 people.
*  That was it. Yeah.
*  And the one the night before was the same thing.
*  We are we are rocking and rolling.
*  But but Elon, I'm talking to this very important guy.
*  I said, wait a minute, I'm looking at something.
*  The television's unmuted, right?
*  And I see this rocket sold brown from the heat.
*  Uh huh.
*  Ten thousand degrees pouring down at thousands of miles an hour.
*  And I see this thing, you know, it's like a 20 story building.
*  And it catches.
*  I say to this guy, it's an important guy.
*  Wait a minute.
*  Let me just put you to hold it.
*  I got to see this.
*  And I see this and it's going to crash.
*  I say it's going to crash into the gantry.
*  They call it a gantry.
*  I said, oh, man, that's going to be a disaster
*  because it's starting to get very close.
*  And then all of a sudden, you see the flames and about a roar
*  and it boom.
*  And then you see the two arms grab it crazy.
*  And I forgot the guy.
*  I had him on the phone.
*  I forgot. No, I said, no, I called Elon.
*  I said, was that you?
*  He said, that was me.
*  And I said, who else can do that?
*  He said, nobody. Russia can't do it.
*  The United States. Nobody can do it.
*  You know, I set up Space Force.
*  That was me.
*  And that's the first time in 82 years that we opened another branch
*  since the Air Force.
*  And that's going to be one of our most important things.
*  But think of what Elon does.
*  And he did one other thing that I never heard of.
*  It's Starlink.
*  I went down to North Carolina, Georgia, the different places.
*  Right. I followed it right down.
*  And they had no communication.
*  The polls were all knocked down.
*  And one of the guys in North Carolina said, could you
*  do me a favor? Do you know Elon Musk?
*  Yes. He endorsed me.
*  By the way, he gave me the nicest endorsement to this.
*  The tougher. He said the country is going to fail.
*  You should do the same thing, Joe,
*  because you cannot be voting for Kamala Kamala.
*  You're not a Kamala person. I know you.
*  I've watched you. I know him better than he is.
*  You know what? Without speaking to you, I think I know you maybe
*  almost as well as your wife.
*  I have watched you for so many years.
*  You're not a Kamala person.
*  You're a Khabib person, but you're not a Kamala person.
*  Nobody's going to know who Khabib is, but they know he was.
*  He was not. He was not bad. Right.
*  That guy was phenomenal. But that's your kind of your weave is getting wide.
*  We're getting wide with this weave.
*  I want to bring it back to tariffs.
*  But wait, one said before we finish with tariffs,
*  so they said, they said, could you get him?
*  We need Starlink. And I call Elon.
*  He got it for him so fast, saved so many lives.
*  And I said, how was it?
*  They said better than the wires.
*  You know, they couldn't put him in.
*  They were all they were all gone.
*  So I used it recently in Utah in the mountains.
*  Did you find it good? It's phenomenal.
*  It's the size of a like a iPad.
*  You just set it down on the ground.
*  You get high speed internet. It's incredible.
*  We're spending just to show you,
*  we're spending a trillion dollars to get cables all over the country. Right.
*  Upstate areas where you have like two farms
*  and they're spending millions of dollars to have a.
*  Well, talk about the 42 billion dollars that was wasted on this internet
*  access program that they didn't get anybody.
*  They haven't hooked up one person. Not one person.
*  They spent 42 billion dollars.
*  They could have gotten Starlinks to everybody with that kind of money.
*  For almost nothing.
*  Yeah. For a monthly charge.
*  And it would have been incredible.
*  And it's high speed internet everywhere you want to go.
*  And he wanted to do that. And he wanted to do it.
*  How about this? They built the charger stations, right?
*  In the Midwest, Midwest, they built eight of them.
*  Because nine billion dollars.
*  That's like a gas pump, right?
*  They built nine gas pumps, except electricity comes out.
*  They spent nine billion dollars.
*  Three of them don't work.
*  The whole thing. There's so much waste.
*  I could I could sit here and tell you about things that that
*  there's so much waste, abuse and fraud.
*  Oh, there's yeah, I'm sure.
*  I mean, I think everybody's aware of that.
*  Let's get back to when you're talking about one of the criticisms
*  of your administration was with tax cuts and with tariffs,
*  you increase the deficit.
*  So was the strat what was the strategy behind that?
*  And did you think it was going to increase the deficit by a substantial amount?
*  OK, we were ready to rock.
*  It was all you know, I had a bad system.
*  We had horrible tax policy.
*  I made it great.
*  With a much lower tax rate.
*  So I took it from almost 40 percent down to 21 percent.
*  Now I'm bringing it from 21 down to 15.
*  But only if you make your product in the United States, which is great.
*  People call me this. What a great idea.
*  Nobody ever heard of that before.
*  I don't care if they make the product in Japan.
*  Why should I give them?
*  So it's a 21 that at 21.
*  In the first year, we took in much more revenue than we did at almost 40.
*  Think of that. It inspired.
*  Now we had other things, too.
*  We we were able to get people to bring back their money.
*  You couldn't you couldn't bring back your money if you had money in Europe.
*  Like Apple. Apple had many billions of dollars outside.
*  They couldn't bring it. There was no way to bring it back in.
*  The bureaucracy, the documents, the whole thing,
*  and also the tax was too high.
*  You know, they wanted like half of it or something.
*  Nobody's going to do that.
*  So they they leave their money in Japan and they spend their money there.
*  That was part of what I did.
*  The money came pouring back in.
*  Apple took in hundreds of billions of dollars.
*  They brought it back from overseas. They brought it in.
*  So how does the deficit increase because of that?
*  So what happened is this.
*  We were ready to rock and roll.
*  And then we had the covid thing and we had to focus on that.
*  And if we didn't give some businesses a hand,
*  they would have all you would have had a depression like in 1929.
*  But we were ready to start.
*  We were going to we would have very shortly been paying off debt.
*  You know, we have thirty five trillion dollars in debt.
*  And I'll never forget it.
*  We were it was talking about from, you know, the standpoint of being in office.
*  I'm in the Oval Office and I have John McLaughlin and Fabrizio,
*  the two very good pollsters, probably.
*  I don't know. I would say the two best who knows, but very good pollsters.
*  And we're starting to think about running for a second term.
*  And we had the greatest economy in history.
*  Never has there been an economy.
*  And you attribute that to lowering taxes, tariffs, two things.
*  And also I cut regulations more than anybody else.
*  And if I ask many of the businessmen, you know, from the big companies,
*  you know, the guys running the big companies, I'd say,
*  so if you had your choice, you've had it now for a long time.
*  What's more important to you, the tax cuts?
*  You paid less tax or the regulation cuts.
*  Every one of them said the regulation cuts meant more.
*  Who would think that? Right.
*  Because you don't equate it to dollars, but it actually is more dollars.
*  We had it going and then we just had to focus on something else.
*  But they were sitting on these two these two pollsters were sitting there.
*  And they said, sir, if George Washington came back
*  and Abraham Lincoln was his VP, as opposed to Waltz,
*  how bad is he, by the way?
*  But if Abraham Lincoln was his VP, they couldn't beat you.
*  You have and I'll never forget it.
*  The following day, they said something's happening in China, sir.
*  Could we meet? So what's happening?
*  People are dying.
*  And it was all around the Wuhan lab, by the way.
*  There are pictures with little lines, their body bags
*  all around the Wuhan lab.
*  But I always said that from the beginning, Joe, was, you know,
*  they tried to say first, I said it was France and they blamed everybody.
*  But then they say it was bats from a cave two thousand miles away.
*  So we got hit with that.
*  And despite that, we had the best economy.
*  And when I gave it over, the stock market was higher than it was pre covid.
*  I mean, nobody could even believe it.
*  But we saved it.
*  And we were helping businesses.
*  They were dying. You know, they were.
*  So it's your belief that if you had a second term, given the policies in place,
*  the way the economy was booming, that you would have been able to pay off
*  a lot of the debt. And that was the strategy.
*  If we didn't have covid, we would have been paying off debt and we would have had.
*  And don't forget, by growth, the word growth is actually more important
*  in a way because you could have the same debt.
*  But if you doubled your growth, all of a sudden you're under levered.
*  But still, we should pay off debt.
*  You know, if you viewed this
*  thirty five trillion dollars right now, it's a lot.
*  But if you look at the asset value, if you looked at it purely as an asset value,
*  we have oil underground, we have water, we have mountains, we have.
*  I mean, the assets are so enormous.
*  But regardless of that, we've got thirty five trillion in debt.
*  We should pay it off.
*  And we would have started paying off debt and probably even giving further,
*  further tax reductions.
*  I want to get it down to 15 percent.
*  We're going to do more business.
*  But when you get hit with a covid, everything stops
*  and you have to keep these businesses alive.
*  The businesses were dying.
*  I mean, they were just dying.
*  This whole place, this country is going to die.
*  Are there influences outside of environmental
*  that keep people from wanting to drill for oil and frack
*  and do those sort of things outside of the environmental concerns,
*  which are legitimate, of course?
*  No, I was.
*  But are there other influences that may be over accentuate
*  or over exaggerate these environmental effects?
*  Are people being influenced in a way where they're trying to keep us
*  from producing American oil? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*  So the environmental is the biggest tool for stopping growth.
*  The biggest tool. The other is regulation.
*  And if you speak to Elon, he said the regulation now to send a rocket up
*  to anywhere, even if you do everything, it's it's almost
*  it's becoming impossible.
*  But they use environmental in order to get people
*  not to do anything.
*  And sometimes I say, you know, I look at some of the I know
*  the environmental stuff better because I had to build buildings in New York.
*  I had to build I had to do environmental impact studies.
*  And I would see some of these guys that I'd hire for a lot of money,
*  environmentalists that would get you through the process.
*  And they'd be up in Albany.
*  That's the capital of New York.
*  And they're up there trying to make it tougher for guys like me
*  that were builders because they get paid more money.
*  In other words, I had one guy
*  highly recommended all, you know, I was good at getting permits.
*  I was one of the kings of I was always very good.
*  But the environmental stuff was always horrible.
*  They could slow a project down 10 years, 15 years.
*  I had a project in Louisiana built big LNG plant.
*  It was for 14 years.
*  It was going to cost 18 million, 18 billion dollars.
*  One of the biggest like the Empire State Building laying down on the side
*  times for massive in the coast on the Gulf Coast.
*  And they said, sir, they're going to give it up.
*  I said that they shouldn't give it up.
*  What's the problem? They can't get their environmental.
*  They had environmental permits that would fill this whole room up to the ceiling.
*  And they said there was one mistake on one little line.
*  They wanted to do it all over again.
*  It's not going to happen.
*  And I got them their permit instantly.
*  And they built a plant that's massive.
*  So when you're saying that so there's there's people that are making money
*  by making it difficult. Yeah.
*  Are you talking about lawyers?
*  No, I'm just talking about environmental consultants and lawyers.
*  Environmental consultants profit off of dragging out the process. Absolutely.
*  And how do they process?
*  How do they probably do the same thing about with them?
*  To be honest with you, I want to be honest with you.
*  How do they do that? How do they make it?
*  They go, let's say New York, they go to Albany. OK.
*  And they convince people that if you have a certain type of plant
*  on the ground that's this big and in theory, valueless, that it's a rare plant
*  and you cannot even touch it, you can't go near it.
*  You can't put a building on it.
*  You can't do anything.
*  Or there's a little puddle and they call it a lake.
*  And you have to go by the standards of a lake.
*  I said, no, no, that's a puddle.
*  Oh, you have no idea.
*  Guys are filling a little puddle.
*  You have no idea what they do.
*  And so they use it as a way to stop you.
*  They use it as a way to stop you and also as a way to generate money.
*  I'm curious how they're generating money that way, though.
*  Well, they get fees. They get fees. Massive fees.
*  And pay these people rely on them as experts
*  because they're the people that they go to when they have to run these studies
*  in the first place. But some of them are just bad guys.
*  And they're trying to make it more and more difficult.
*  And they have a lot of power.
*  Yeah, I think they maybe had more.
*  They didn't have as much with me because I would get through them.
*  And I understood it.
*  Look, I've had I've done so many.
*  They call it environmental impact study.
*  I did so much to build a building, to build a building in New York is very tough.
*  You got to be very you got to deal with.
*  Think of it. Financing unions,
*  all the municipal stuff, environmental of all of it.
*  To me, the toughest thing was the environmental
*  because they could stop you cold with the environmental impact study stuff.
*  And and you do you hire a so-called expert.
*  They say, sir, he's the one guy he can get you through the morass.
*  It's a morass. It's horrible.
*  They use it as a weapon. They use it all over the country.
*  But there are legitimate concerns about environmental impact, correct?
*  Like look about the BP oil spill.
*  There's a lot of things that do happen that are environmentally devastating.
*  And you want to mitigate that as much as possible.
*  Look, I had during our four years, we had the cleanest air and the cleanest water.
*  I view it differently. I say air and water.
*  Remember this.
*  It costs much more to do things environmentally clean.
*  China doesn't do anything. Right.
*  When Kerry goes to see
*  President Xi at China, which he probably doesn't even get to see him.
*  But they look at him. Oh, yes, yes, we will do.
*  Oh, yes, yes, we're going to do that.
*  No more coal, no more coal.
*  And then they approve 58 coal plants for the next, you know, every
*  they build a coal plant a week.
*  OK, they build a lot of coal plants.
*  But let me just tell you, though.
*  So here we are cleaning and scrubbing everything and everything's got in.
*  The air's got to be pure.
*  But in three point eight days.
*  That stuff floating over China is right over the top of us. Right.
*  Same thing with the oceans.
*  They dump their garbage into the Pacific Ocean.
*  If you take a little cork and put it there
*  in about a week and a half, it'll be in front of Los Angeles.
*  We're picking up their garbage.
*  So nobody ever talks about that.
*  But in a way, the bigger one is even the air.
*  It's the currents. It's an amazing thing.
*  It's been flowing that way for a million years, a long before.
*  We share air with the whole world. Yeah.
*  No. If we get the Sahara dust clouds over here. Absolutely.
*  We get dust clouds in Austin from the Sahara Desert.
*  But we get the China.
*  You know, they call it the China curse.
*  We get the China curse.
*  They're better and their air is dirty.
*  You know, when I went there,
*  I had a great relationship with President Xi.
*  We got along very well.
*  And they treated me better than anybody's ever been treated.
*  Same thing with Saudi Arabia.
*  Number of them.
*  But they laid it out.
*  And I said, this air is good.
*  Do you know, they closed every factory one week before I got there
*  from within 200 miles.
*  That's like what Gavin Newsom did when Xi Jinping came to San Francisco.
*  He cleaned it up. He got rid of all the homeless people.
*  Isn't it terrible in a way to think, you know, he cleaned it up
*  and then it became a pigsty.
*  Well, the dumbest thing is he said when your friends come by,
*  when you have visitors, you clean up your house.
*  Like, how about just keep your fucking house clean?
*  Can you imagine?
*  That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard anybody say ever as a governor
*  as to excuse to why you finally cleaned up your homeless problem.
*  And the day he left.
*  Right back to it. It went right back.
*  But in a way, that was a bad thing that he did because he showed.
*  Showed it could be done. What a disgrace that was.
*  What a disgrace.
*  Well, this is the thing that like shows you how foolish
*  a lot of these people that are running these cities think.
*  A lot of these people that are running these states think it's it's foolish.
*  Like you you're insulting the intelligence of the people
*  that live in that city that are impacted by these people just camping
*  and needles and human feces.
*  There's an app that you can buy.
*  There's an app that you can get rather that will show you
*  where the human feces has been documented in San Francisco.
*  It's a poo app.
*  And it's everywhere. It's just bum crap everywhere.
*  But let me give you one that you may not know.
*  OK, which I think you know everything, actually, as a student,
*  as a student of yours.
*  But but water, you know, in Los Angeles,
*  you can't get proper amounts of water. Right.
*  And it's unbelievably expensive.
*  And you might have a house in Beverly Hills.
*  And they're actually thinking about rationing water.
*  Can you believe it?
*  I can believe it. I was in I was in the farm
*  court country with some of the congressmen were driving up a highway.
*  And I say, how come all this land is so barren?
*  It's farmland and it looked terrible.
*  It was just brown and bad.
*  I said, but there's always that little corner that's so green and beautiful.
*  They said, we have no water.
*  I said, do you have a drought? No, we don't have a drought.
*  I said, why don't you have no water?
*  Because the water isn't allowed to flow down.
*  It's got a natural flow from Canada all the way up north.
*  More water than they could ever use.
*  And in order to protect a tiny little fish,
*  the water up north gets routed into the Pacific Ocean.
*  Millions and millions of gallons of water gets poured.
*  You got to see this.
*  We're driving up and I had never seen it before.
*  It's the most it's like Iowa.
*  It's the most fertile land.
*  I was blessed with great land.
*  Idaho for a potato, right?
*  But these they're just by the way, you know, some land is good for a potato.
*  Some land is good for corn. It's the craziest thing.
*  I love the farmers. They're great.
*  They're the greatest.
*  And by the way, they're getting killed right now.
*  They're getting killed because of the stupid administration.
*  But so I see this and I said, you got to be kidding.
*  I said, you mean you have water?
*  And I looked at it.
*  It's like a valve in your sink, except it's massive.
*  The thing's five times taller than your ceiling.
*  Did you know the center of California was a giant lake?
*  They have so much water.
*  You ever see what it looks like before they rerouted it?
*  The center of California, like was it 200 years ago?
*  How long ago did they do that, Jamie?
*  The center of California had a fucking enormous lake in the middle of California.
*  They dumped it into the Pacific.
*  Who knows what they did.
*  But whatever foolishness that they did led to the situation they're in now.
*  Think of those dry forests that burned down all over.
*  You know, the head of Austria said, you know, Tulare Lake or Tachi Lake.
*  It's a freshwater lake in the southern San Joaquin Valley, United States.
*  Historically, Tulare Lake was one of the largest freshwater lakes west of the Mississippi.
*  Show a photo of what it looked like back then.
*  It's a great system.
*  So that's what it looked like.
*  Look at that image.
*  Now, the one go to the one on the third from the right.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  That was an enormous lake in the middle of California.
*  Imagine that would be much more valuable property.
*  How crazy is that?
*  How crazy is that?
*  What do you think?
*  And human beings screwed that up.
*  They let it go into the Pacific and then they I don't know what they did.
*  What did they do that?
*  Why did how did it go missing?
*  Yeah, they drained it.
*  Nineteen.
*  1983.
*  Oh, my God.
*  Oh, when dry a handful of times.
*  Well, you know, lakes do go dry, but that's a big one.
*  But think of it.
*  Big one. You could have all of the water you need.
*  All of that land would have more water.
*  The whole thing could be like that little patch.
*  Yeah. Literally, literally, I'd say, as with Devin known as a congressman
*  and other congressmen were going up, I was visiting that because they asked me
*  to go up and visit their territory.
*  And I did.
*  But I kept saying, look at this land.
*  It's beautiful, but it's so dry.
*  And I thought they were going through like a desert, like a drought.
*  They said, no, we have water, but it gets.
*  So I looked into it.
*  What is the fish? And I got it done.
*  I got it done.
*  I could have water for all of that land.
*  Water for your forest.
*  You know, your forests are dry as a bone.
*  Yeah.
*  Dangerous.
*  That water could be routed.
*  You know, you could have everything.
*  Not only dangerous, billions of dollars a year they spend on forest fires.
*  And, you know, there's a case with the environment.
*  They're not allowed to rake their forest because you're not allowed to touch it.
*  When a tree falls down after 18 months, it becomes very dry.
*  It's like, you know, like real firewood.
*  It's bad.
*  You know, a tree that's up, these are all things I learned the hard way, the easy way.
*  But when a tree is up, it sucks water.
*  It's wet.
*  I went to that the hard.
*  They had a couple of horrible forest fires in California.
*  And I went, I said, you know, you get a lot of trees standing.
*  Yes, they were healthy trees.
*  I said, with this intense heat that you could see they were charred a little bit
*  on the bottom, but they were going to be all right because they're soaking wet
*  because they suck up the water. Right.
*  But when they fall, they're like, you know, it's like lighting a match.
*  Yeah. And you got to be able to clean.
*  They call maintain your forest.
*  So I was with the head of Austria.
*  He said, you know, it's a shame.
*  I see all those forest fires in California and all they have to do is clean their
*  forest, meaning rake it up, get rid of the leaves, get rid of leaves that are
*  sitting there for five years and certainly get rid of the dead fall and get rid of the
*  trees that are falling. Yeah.
*  You know, are like so many things this country.
*  By the way, could you really have the whole forest, though?
*  I don't think you could break the whole forest.
*  I think you can get rid of the dead fall, but raking all you could certainly get rid
*  of the dead. OK, that's the real issue.
*  You know, environmentally, they don't want to do that.
*  They don't. They said, you know, it's got to be nature and all this stuff.
*  But in the meantime, this is exactly.
*  Yeah. But you could have.
*  So it was the Department of Commerce that needed the approvals.
*  But Gavin Newsom had to sign them.
*  I got it all done. Nobody could believe it.
*  It was all done. I said, I got it.
*  You got so much water.
*  All you have to do is sign.
*  And that guy didn't want to sign.
*  Did he not want to sign because that would be a political victory for you?
*  I think no, he didn't. No, I don't think so.
*  You know, he used to say he's a great president.
*  And we got along. We did.
*  We actually got along at that point.
*  But I think somebody said, you just can't continue to call him a great president.
*  You know, they do say that.
*  But we had it all done.
*  He didn't sign.
*  And then we got on to other things.
*  And every time I go to California, you have so much water.
*  They don't know it.
*  I'm telling you, people living in Beverly Hills, they turn off the water.
*  Same thing with the electric.
*  They want to go to all electric cars, but they have brownouts every weekend.
*  You know, well, right after they made the announcement that as of 2035,
*  you're not going to be able to buy an internal combustion engine in California.
*  Like within a month, they had some announcement asking people to not charge
*  their Tesla's.
*  Because the grid couldn't handle it.
*  Well, how are you going to handle it?
*  I will terminate the mandate immediately.
*  This is a mandate.
*  That will be done, I would say, in my first day, maybe two days, because, you know,
*  let me ask you about nuclear.
*  One of the things that when I've talked to people that have a real understanding
*  of nuclear power, what their position is, it's probably the cleanest,
*  safest form of electricity that we could generate.
*  And that the fears of nuclear power are really about a few disasters,
*  the Fukushima, Three Mile Island.
*  These these are old systems and that they're much more capable now
*  and they're capable of making even better systems.
*  But it's a difficult political issue because you think nuclear power,
*  you think Chernobyl. That's what everybody does.
*  They have this connection.
*  They had the potential for Fukushima, which is where you're not supposed to enter
*  the land for three thousand years or something.
*  I think it's worse than that.
*  I think that area is like going to be radioactive for probably longer
*  than you could imagine.
*  But the point is, they're better at it now. Right.
*  And that they could do it now and you can generate power in a way
*  that you don't have to worry about these.
*  One of the most ridiculous things is electric cars being powered by coal
*  fired plants. It's a ridiculous thing.
*  So it's happening. Yeah, it is what's happening.
*  And people want to think they're being green, you know, but it's well.
*  You look at the way the batteries are made.
*  But here's the other thing. We don't have.
*  Well, we do, actually. It's being held.
*  You know, we have certain areas where we have great raw earth material
*  and we're not allowed to use it because of the environment.
*  And we have areas in California that have incredible raw earth.
*  And they're not allowing. And I'm going to open it up.
*  I'm going to let them use it.
*  But how do you do that? China.
*  How do you do that and protect the environment?
*  Because the environment is going to be protected.
*  You can do it. You can make a lake out of it.
*  OK, we'll put back a lake.
*  I mean, something nice about lakes, you can do things magnificently.
*  You just have to do it carefully and responsibly. Absolutely.
*  You have to do it carefully.
*  But the problem, you know, China has all of those areas, most of those areas.
*  And yet when they say go electric with the cars,
*  China is going to be the one that gives us the cars.
*  All of those guys in Detroit are going to be out of business.
*  You're going to make your electric cars over there.
*  We have a thing called gasoline,
*  and we have more oil and gas under our feet than any other nation.
*  You know, I had in Alaska, there's a find it's called Anwar.
*  I got it approved. Reagan couldn't get it.
*  Nobody could get it. I got it all done. It was amazing.
*  They were getting ready to start drilling.
*  The equivalent, they think, of Saudi Arabia, one of the biggest fines in the world.
*  It was all set to go.
*  And Biden comes in, his one of his first orders were
*  we're not going to use it.
*  It would have been so good for the we could have supplied all of Asia
*  with oil and gas. What was that was the negative?
*  And you talk about money. Right.
*  The negative was politically, they didn't think it was good for them.
*  That's all. That's all it was.
*  So you don't think that it's environmentally dangerous.
*  Taking it from way down deep in the earth, environmentally would have been fine.
*  So it can be done responsibly. Absolutely.
*  Oh, otherwise, let's not do it.
*  Well, I think windmills. OK, so they talk about windmills.
*  I think windmills are really disruptive.
*  When you talk about the environment, they killed the birds.
*  You want to see a bird cemetery, go under a windmill someday
*  that hasn't been cleaned out with all the bird carcasses.
*  You like massive amounts of.
*  Well, they're also a massive eyesore.
*  I went to a ranch in South Texas.
*  We had to drive past this enormous windmill farm.
*  It's gross. It's dystopian.
*  You're looking in the left and the right.
*  Oh, he sees these big spinning machines that aren't even that effective
*  at generating electricity.
*  Most expensive form of electricity is a windmill.
*  And then they start to rust and rot.
*  And you have to get abandoned by the people that built them.
*  Well, you have to get rid of all that material, too.
*  When you replace those blades, now you have a problem
*  because you have to dispose.
*  Right. You have to dispose these enormous windmills.
*  And how do you say you can't bury them?
*  So I even question that, but I'm not going to get into it.
*  But they say you can't bury the bird.
*  So you have the blades and you can't bury the blades.
*  You can bury the blades. It's not going to matter.
*  You can bury the you'll find areas you can bury.
*  But they come up. This is what I mean.
*  They come up with this.
*  But the environmentalist dream is windmills.
*  You know what happens to them after five years, they start to rot.
*  After 10 years, you have to replace them.
*  Did you ever look at certain parts of California where they have heavy windmills
*  and they've been abandoned and they're all different manufacturers
*  in all different companies?
*  And they haven't seen it is the ugliest thing.
*  It looks like a graveyard, almost a graveyard of windmills.
*  It's pollution. It's so bad.
*  It's put it is. And in the oceans, it's no different than leaving
*  garbage on the ground.
*  How about in New Jersey, off the coast of New Jersey, they want to build.
*  The people are going crazy not to build them.
*  But we have them. The whales are washing up on shore. Right.
*  So in 50 years, they had one whale come ashore.
*  Now they had like 18 come in the last year.
*  What is the what is happening with the whales?
*  I've read about this.
*  Well, they say that the wind drives them crazy.
*  You know, it's a vibration because you have those, you know, those things
*  that 50 story building some of them. Right.
*  And they're super sensitive to vibration.
*  They have those, you know, the wind is rushing.
*  The things are blowing. It's a vibration and it makes noise.
*  You know what it is? I want to be a whale psychiatrist.
*  It drives the whales fricking crazy.
*  Yes, something happens with them.
*  But for whatever reason, they're getting washed up on shore.
*  And, you know, and yet the environment is
*  conveniently ignored by the environmental.
*  Environmentalists, they don't talk about it. Right.
*  I think there's nothing uglier.
*  I see it in Scotland. I see it all over the world.
*  You have this beautiful valley.
*  It's been there for, you know, in civilization, thousands of years,
*  but millions of years.
*  And all of a sudden you have these ugly windmills up.
*  Would your plan to be replaced out with nuclear?
*  What would you do? Well, nuclear is better.
*  I mean, I think there's a little danger to nuclear, but, you know,
*  we had some really bad nuclear.
*  They did one in Alabama.
*  They did one in, I think, South Carolina.
*  They do them wrong.
*  They build these massive things.
*  Then the environmentalists get in.
*  I don't want to go into a long story because it's too long for the show.
*  This show is too valuable to talk about concrete, but they have hardened
*  concrete. It's number 12 concrete.
*  It's harder than steel. It's incredible.
*  They put up a wall and an inspector comes along, knows that.
*  No, no, you're a quarter of an inch.
*  The wall might be eight feet wide.
*  You're a quarter of an inch too short.
*  I'm sorry. You got to rip down the wall.
*  You got to because it's got to be poured contiguously. Right.
*  You're one quarter of an inch.
*  I'm sorry. Rip down. You can't rip it down.
*  This stuff, you can't put a hammer through it.
*  You can't. It's it's incredible.
*  Concrete technology is unbelievable.
*  What you know, what's happened.
*  You think of concrete.
*  So you think that's an example of over regulation.
*  Yeah. Pointless. Well, you have an inspector that comes along
*  and he says, take down a 25,000,000,000 dollar wall.
*  These things ended up costing 25 billion dollars.
*  And one of them never got opened.
*  But here's the story.
*  So France does it.
*  France is largely nuclear.
*  And they build small, little compact plants.
*  And if they need more, they build the same thing
*  and they hook it up and they hook it up
*  because they get too big and too complex and too expensive.
*  And it is very clean.
*  They say it's it's absolutely you know, my uncle,
*  I had a great uncle who was a great genius, just like
*  other members of my family.
*  But he was a professor at MIT
*  for, I think, 41 years.
*  He was a long.
*  When I was in the White House, the head of MIT,
*  Princeton and Harvard came down to meet me.
*  And the MIT person said, I have a book on your uncle, Dr.
*  John Trump. He was our longest serving professor.
*  He was a great genius, sir.
*  Do you know how? And he had he knew everything about nuclear
*  from math to chemistry to nuclear.
*  He knew it. And he said, some day it's going to be the way to go.
*  But the problem is so dangerous in terms of war.
*  He said. Right.
*  Donald, some day.
*  This was a long time. Uncle John, Dr.
*  John Trump, he said, someday you'll have a little satchel
*  at your side and you'll go into a building
*  and you'll be able to blow up New York City.
*  I said, Uncle John, that'll never happen.
*  He's right. You know, he's right.
*  Well, that was part of the problem with giving nuclear power
*  to other countries, right?
*  Like that was the problem that happened with India and Pakistan.
*  They got nuclear power and then they were able to weaponize it.
*  The biggest problem in the world today is not global warming.
*  It's nuclear warming.
*  And we have idiots that are negotiating for us.
*  We have a guy that doesn't make it past four o'clock.
*  And it's not because of age. You know, they are.
*  I know so many guys in their late 80s and they're better than.
*  I said to one guy, I think you're smarter than you were 25 years ago.
*  I've known him a long time. He's 89 years old.
*  He's sharp. I mean, he's great.
*  Biden gives people a bad name because that's not an old.
*  That's not an age.
*  I think they say it because I'm three or four years younger.
*  You know, I think that's why they say it.
*  They say his age. It's not his age.
*  He's got a problem.
*  Two major brain surgeries.
*  He did. Those are not good operations.
*  And do you see what he did today?
*  He went running towards the camera and made some apology to Native Americans.
*  And he said that's why he's headed out west.
*  Like, he's off the reservation, so to speak, for lack of a better term.
*  You know, it's interesting because during the debate.
*  I was looking over, I'm saying, hmm, this is strange.
*  It's just sort of like strange things were happening.
*  Yeah. But he couldn't keep it together.
*  But do you think they knew he couldn't keep it together?
*  I think so. Do you think that they wanted that?
*  Is that why, like, historically, that debate was earlier than they've been in the past?
*  Right. I think they wanted to.
*  Well, there's a lot of theories.
*  A lot of people said, do the debate now and we'll get him out.
*  Right. I think that maybe could be.
*  Well, that is what happened.
*  I think they also said, do the debate now and get it over with.
*  Right. I don't think anybody thought he was going to get out, really.
*  That didn't make any sense.
*  The debate got him out.
*  But I think it's very unfair.
*  Look, you have a bad debate.
*  His numbers went down.
*  But I think she's not doing very well right now.
*  And I think she looks...
*  Well, I want to get to that, too, because it's hard to know.
*  Like, the whole poll thing is very bizarre for most people
*  because most people don't answer polls.
*  So they read the polls.
*  Well, you have a call from a poll.
*  I was never called by a poll system.
*  If I did, I wouldn't answer. I'm busy.
*  You know how polls are done?
*  Oh, I'm going to get myself in trouble.
*  But so I really don't believe too much in them.
*  So well, 2016 taught a lot of people about the ineffective.
*  Well, they were very effective because I thought I was doing well.
*  I'd go to a place and I'd have 30,000, 40,000 people.
*  Hillary would go. They have 500 people.
*  And they tell me I'm going to lose.
*  I said, why am I going to lose?
*  I had 40,000 people. She had 200 people.
*  But, you know, I have a theory.
*  These pollsters, they charge you a lot of money, too.
*  You know, they charge you half a million bucks to do some stupid poll.
*  And they interview like 251 people.
*  I don't think they interview in many cases.
*  I don't want to get myself in too much trouble.
*  You think it's bullshit?
*  I think they sit there. They make a deal.
*  They get a half a million bucks and they say Trump's leading 51 to 49.
*  They announce it and everybody says, oh, do you understand?
*  Yeah. So you think it's...
*  I don't think they...
*  I think in a lot...
*  Look, I'm a very common sense person.
*  I think that they probably don't always poll.
*  Some of them probably never poll.
*  What's the difference between 49 to 51 and 47 and a half?
*  Well, it's also a tiny percentage of the population.
*  I don't think it's representative of the overall population.
*  I just don't think it is.
*  I don't know of one person in my whole life that ever got called by a pollster.
*  Exactly. That's my point.
*  So here's my question.
*  But I shouldn't say that because I'm doing very, you know, really well in the polls.
*  But I think that...
*  So this week, I happen to believe in a verse.
*  I only believe if they're good.
*  No, I like them this month.
*  But no, I honestly believe that there's probably a lot of fraud.
*  I had a poll, Washington Post, ABC, in the Hillary thing on Wisconsin.
*  They had me down 17 points the day before the election.
*  I knew it was wrong because I had a rally.
*  I had 29,000 people at a racetrack and it was like zero degrees Wisconsin.
*  And they had me down 17 points.
*  In other words, you had no chance.
*  And I won.
*  And I called up my pollsters.
*  Good guy. Good, good guy.
*  And I believe he's legitimate.
*  And, you know, some of them are.
*  Some of them are.
*  I said, tell me, why did they have me down so much?
*  I mean, nobody's going to believe them.
*  The next time they said they don't care.
*  When you're down 17 points, people are going to stay home.
*  They're not going to vote.
*  Because they're going to say, I love Trump, but I'm not going to waste my time.
*  It's cold out.
*  I said, but why don't they make it four or five?
*  He said, at four or five, they're going to go and vote.
*  At 17, they're not going to go and vote.
*  So think of it. I was seven.
*  This is the Washington Post, ABC poll.
*  I was down 17 points in Wisconsin and I won.
*  It's crooked stuff.
*  There's a lot of crooked stuff.
*  And I wanted to talk about that, too, because one of the things that people
*  talk about with you is the denial of the results.
*  And I think J.D. Vance did a brilliant job the other day when he was being
*  interviewed and they they asked him, did Trump lose the 2020 election?
*  And he turned it around and said, was there legitimate election
*  interference in suppressing the Hunter Biden laptop story on social media?
*  And was that a concerted effort?
*  Well, they say it made a 10 point difference.
*  And I lost by one one
*  tenth of a point.
*  What is they say it was twenty two thousand votes.
*  But look, it was much more than that.
*  And I appreciate J.D. Vance saying that.
*  And by the way, I think he was a great pick.
*  Do you like J.D. as a pick?
*  I like him a lot. Yeah.
*  You're allowed to say that.
*  No, I do. I like him.
*  I think he's a brilliant guy.
*  And I think his ability to talk like a normal human being he did.
*  You did my friend Theo Vance podcast, right?
*  And he just did it. How did he do?
*  He did great. And he just talks.
*  I want you to call me.
*  Is that why you called me to do? No, no.
*  I was he was a nice guy.
*  They shot you. I was like, he's got to come in here.
*  It's all about timing.
*  It's all about the timing.
*  Timing is perfect.
*  Do you even have a scar in your ear?
*  You got anything on there? I do.
*  What do we say?
*  So right over here.
*  Oh, it's a tiny little mark.
*  It zicked right there.
*  But it healed up pretty fucking good.
*  Well, it's pretty good.
*  Yeah, it's little.
*  It's not like some of the wrestlers, some of the UFC fighters.
*  No, you didn't get cauliflower.
*  No, no. It was sort of like a top shot.
*  The point of the bullet was over the edge.
*  But you see the the things take it off a little bit.
*  But it makes me a tougher guy.
*  You know, the fighters, you know, the fighters love their,
*  you know, Bo Nicol is a great fighter.
*  How's he going to do? I think he's great.
*  He's a fantastic.
*  He was almost like undefeated in college.
*  Yeah, he's a fantastic wrestler and one of the best mixed martial arts.
*  What is he fighting again?
*  He's fighting in Madison Square Garden in November.
*  Oh, that's going to be an after the election.
*  Yep. So I'll either go as president or I'll be depressed and I won't bother.
*  I really think they're having a fight right now.
*  One of the things that was fascinating also was the denial of the election
*  results is is a pretty common thing.
*  Hillary Clinton famously denied that she called you an illegitimate president.
*  And she said that Russia put you in place, even though she conceded.
*  Yes. You know, she conceded the night of the election because she was beaten.
*  Yes. And it was a thing that was pretty common for people,
*  especially Democrats, to deny the elections.
*  There's been many of them, the Bush administration, the, you know,
*  the dangling Chads, all that stuff.
*  Well, look at these guys in Congress, all these sleazebags in Congress
*  that are Democrats, they're still denying 2016.
*  But now they don't so much because, you know, they try and pin it on me.
*  You don't hear them say, but they denied it right up until the end.
*  My point is this idea of election fraud is a forbidden topic.
*  And you get labeled an election deny.
*  It's like being labeled an anti-vaxxer if you question some of the health
*  consequences that people have from the covid-19 shots.
*  Oh, my God, you're anti. You're an anti-vaxxer.
*  If you say and what I say publicly, and I've said this a lot, it's not zero percent.
*  So if you ask me, what is the amount of election fraud in this country?
*  Is it zero percent? No one thinks it's zero percent.
*  I've never met one person, not a super liberal, progressive,
*  far left person or a right wing conservative.
*  Not one person thinks it's zero percent.
*  They think when you have human beings and also you have a lot of weirdness
*  that was going on during the 2020 elections, particularly with mail in ballots.
*  And you had legislatures that had to approve and they didn't approve
*  and they went out and did it anyway.
*  And you had ballot. You had old fashioned ballot screwing.
*  I mean, you had you have people going up and dropping in phony votes.
*  You had unsigned ballots, et cetera, et cetera.
*  There's certain people that they have.
*  And the rhetoric is also that you're Hitler and that in order to stop Hitler,
*  you have to do whatever it was. OK, yeah.
*  Yeah. And this is I mean, you're hearing this now.
*  Kamala compared you to said your love of Hitler yesterday.
*  It's you know, Kamala is a very low IQ person.
*  She's a very low IQ.
*  You know, I'm for taking tests, too.
*  I think anybody that runs for president should take.
*  They should give him tests. And it's not an age thing.
*  It's not based. If you look back on history, 70s and 80s,
*  some of your greatest leaders in the world, world history, long time world history.
*  They were in their 70s and their 80s.
*  But I think you should take cognitive tests.
*  I think everybody they say it's unconstitutional.
*  But I think I think Kamala should have a test because there's something missing.
*  There's something wrong with her.
*  Well, I think it's pressure.
*  I think the pressure and the scrutiny.
*  You've been a celebrity for a long time and you understand what this is like.
*  But for someone who's in her late 40s, who becomes the vice president,
*  who runs for president, becomes the vice president.
*  And then all of a sudden, the weight of the world is on your shoulders.
*  And there's all these people paying.
*  A lot of people clam up.
*  But you either have it or you don't. Correct.
*  Look, this is an interview you've we've covered a lot of territory, right?
*  And, you know, it's fine. I don't care.
*  I want to. I think it's much more interesting.
*  She to do an interview with
*  Anderson Cooper, a softball, crazy softball interview.
*  She took two days off and she studied and studied all day long.
*  And then she comes out with a result that was a real embarrassment.
*  That was a really bad interview.
*  She couldn't answer a question.
*  And every question is not answered.
*  I mean, like, what would you do your first day in office?
*  OK, I'll build a wall. I won't build a wall.
*  I'll do. There's a hundred things you can say.
*  Just say anything. Right.
*  There's something off with her.
*  Well, I'm dealing.
*  Joe, we're dealing with the smartest people.
*  They hate when I say, you know, when the press, when I call President Xi,
*  they said he called President Xi brilliant.
*  Well, he's a brilliant guy.
*  He controls one point four billion people with an iron fist.
*  I mean, he's a brilliant guy, whether you like it or not.
*  And they go crazy. Right.
*  It doesn't mean he's not evil or it doesn't mean he's not.
*  Yeah, of course. Dangerous.
*  But but actually, we have evil people in our country.
*  Yes. If you have a smart president, he can deal with Russia.
*  He can deal with all of it.
*  I had a I. Russia would have never gone into Ukraine if I were president.
*  How would you have stopped it?
*  Automatic, two things.
*  I told him, I said, Vladimir, you're not going in.
*  I used to talk to him all the time.
*  You're not going in.
*  I can't tell you what I told him because I think it would be inappropriate.
*  But someday he'll tell you, but he would have never gone in.
*  But you know why else he wouldn't have gone in oil prices at forty dollars
*  a barrel wouldn't have allowed him, wouldn't have given him
*  the money to prosecute that war, wouldn't have given him the money.
*  I said it with President.
*  I was with President Xi.
*  I said it was almost the same conversation with Vladimir.
*  It was Moscow with President Xi.
*  It was Beijing.
*  It was almost the exact same conversation.
*  I said, don't do it. He would have never done it.
*  The day I left, they flew 28 bombers over the middle of Taiwan.
*  Twenty eight bombers.
*  And it's the apple of his eye.
*  And the same thing with Russia.
*  It's the apple. Ukraine is the apple of his eye.
*  I used to talk to him.
*  I had a very good relationship with him.
*  He wouldn't have done it.
*  He would have never done it.
*  But he also wouldn't have done it because of the you know, one of the reasons
*  that what happened is, number one, he doesn't respect Biden at all.
*  Not even a little bit. And who the hell would?
*  But he doesn't respect him.
*  But when he saw what happened in Afghanistan, how horribly that was handled.
*  Number one, you take the soldiers out last, not first.
*  OK, that was that big mistake.
*  And we had that thing charted out and they weren't obeying us.
*  They weren't.
*  Abdul is the head of the Taliban.
*  Boom, boom. He had to do all these things.
*  Some he didn't do. I said, nope, you're not doing you got to do them all.
*  This guy took he immediately took all he left the equipment behind.
*  Thirteen soldiers did, but he took everybody out.
*  He took his soldiers out before a child would know.
*  That's where Milley was so stupid.
*  He was such a stupid guy. Milley.
*  OK, those generals should have all been fired.
*  The Afghan the people that were involved with Afghanistan
*  should have all been fired.
*  Then they'd be writing books about him, how stupid he was and bad he was.
*  But you take your soldiers out last.
*  I had a big rally and I saw a child in the front row
*  about a year and a half ago, and I called the child up.
*  I said, do you mind if I borrow your child?
*  Oh, yes, please. And they came up.
*  Kids five years. I gave him quick details.
*  You know, I said, we want to get out of this place.
*  And we have this and we have this and we have the equipment.
*  I gave him a little thing.
*  I said, do you take your soldiers out first or last after everything's done?
*  You take them out last, sir.
*  A child would know that we took our soldiers out first.
*  What was your plan? And we left a bag room.
*  Well, not only that, we have billions of dollars worth of equipment
*  and military vehicles that they use for parades now.
*  The best equipment yet to embarrass us, the best equipment in the world.
*  The Taliban parade where they've got tanks rolling down the streets
*  and black hawks flying is the craziest thing I've ever seen.
*  We left the best equipment in the world behind.
*  What would you have done differently?
*  Well, number one, we would have taken it out.
*  Just so you go back a little bit further,
*  I had a couple of conversations with Abdul.
*  And from the time I had those conversations,
*  because they were shooting our soldiers, you know, with the sniper stuff,
*  they were shooting, they were shooting a lot of them.
*  They were shooting a lot with Obama, much less with me, but they were shooting him.
*  And I said, get this guy on the phone.
*  The press went nuts when they heard this.
*  I had a great conversation with it was a tough conversation.
*  18 months later, there wasn't one soldier that was ever shot at.
*  And even Biden admitted it in a moment of stupidity
*  because he shouldn't admit it. His people went nuts.
*  He said, yeah, well, I will admit no soldier.
*  We didn't have a soldier killed in 18 months in Afghanistan.
*  Not one soldier was killed because he understood
*  what was going to happen if that happened.
*  I didn't have one. So then when I left
*  after having gotten more votes than any sitting president
*  in the history of the country and much more votes than he got in 2016,
*  when I left, they started shooting our soldiers.
*  But more importantly, what they did is they did that whole thing with,
*  you know, leaving. He shouldn't have left.
*  Number one should have left from Bagram because Bagram is this massive base.
*  It's got tremendous acreage around it. Tremendous.
*  It's a very big it was built many years ago.
*  And part of the reason you wouldn't have taken that is because it goes to China.
*  One hour from where China makes its nuclear missiles.
*  You should have never left Bagram.
*  Number one, they should have left from Bagram.
*  They should have left last.
*  They should have got, you know, we have Americans that are still there.
*  They should have taken all their equipment out.
*  Everything, every plane, every screw should have been taken out, every tent.
*  And I said that that's when I realized that Milley was a dummy. I said,
*  we're leaving, but I want to get everything out.
*  Sure, it's cheaper to leave it. I said, it's cheaper to leave it.
*  He said it's cheaper to leave it. That was cheaper.
*  Cheaper. He said it's cheap.
*  Sir, not more dangerous.
*  He just said cheaper.
*  I said, I want every plane. I want every tank.
*  I want the goggles.
*  They have night goggles.
*  They have all this stuff that these guys now have.
*  He said, sir, it's cheaper to get out and leave it.
*  I said, so you think it's cheaper to leave a hundred and fifty million
*  dollar brand new airplane in there than it is to fly it out
*  with a tank of jet fuel and put it in Pakistan or just fly it directly back?
*  It's cheap.
*  I said, this guy's nuts.
*  I'm telling you, he was so stupid. He was so unwise.
*  He was like an unwise man.
*  And there were a number of them.
*  But I defeated ISIS with the greatest generals.
*  I had a guy who was so great.
*  I flew to Iraq and I met the real generals,
*  not these idiots that we deal with.
*  And we knocked out, you know, I defeated 100 percent of the ISIS caliphate.
*  They said it would take five years.
*  I did it in a matter of a few,
*  literally a few weeks, and we hit them hard.
*  And he said, so we're going to hit him here.
*  We're going to hit him there.
*  We're going to hit him here there.
*  And I said, this guy's great. I like this guy.
*  I was told it would take five years. That's why I went.
*  I said, how could it take five years?
*  We have brand new fighters.
*  We have the best planes, the best weapons, the best guns, the best bombs.
*  How could it possibly take that long?
*  And I flew to I flew and left at three o'clock in the morning.
*  Nobody knew I was going.
*  I got on Air Force One and we started flying.
*  And when we reached about half an hour away from Iraq,
*  that was where the airport was, big airport,
*  about a half an hour away, they said, sir, I'm sorry.
*  You have to turn off all your lights. Why?
*  We're getting close to our site.
*  I said, you mean we spent eight trillion dollars
*  that we can't leave the lights on? Think of this.
*  Twenty years, eight trillion dollars that we can't leave the lights on in a plane.
*  I said, that's OK. Turn the lights on.
*  I'm not going to fight him.
*  This is because it's too dangerous.
*  Too dangerous because they see the light up in the air.
*  They'll shoot at it.
*  So I said, turn the lights off.
*  Then they said, sir, we're going to also pull your shades if that's OK.
*  So that's the plane was pitch black.
*  All the lights outside, you know, the blinking, the blinking reds.
*  They were all turned off.
*  And I like to sit with pilots a lot of times.
*  And these guys are specimens.
*  I always say they're better looking than Tom Cruise.
*  OK. And they're even taller.
*  Like perfect specimens.
*  These guys like for a fighter, you know, you have some guys that are perfect specimens.
*  Right. And, you know, they pick they pick the best pilots in the Air Force,
*  United States Air Force to fly Air Force one.
*  And I get up there and I'm sitting and I'm feeling my way up.
*  You know, it's up on the 747 as you go through the stairs.
*  But I sort of knew my way up.
*  There wasn't a light in the plane.
*  I'm saying, can you imagine we spent trillions of dollars
*  and we're trying to fly in blind.
*  But I got into the plane, the cockpit is dark black, little tiny light.
*  You could see the pilot, a perfect looking human being.
*  His co-pilot, everybody was perfect.
*  They were all like movie stars.
*  You know, it's like I could have cast a movie with these guys
*  and nobody would believe it because they were too good looking.
*  So I said, how are we doing?
*  So we'll be landing in 10 minutes.
*  I look outside. There's not a light.
*  And I'm saying, you know, I've landed a lot of planes.
*  And you see like little lights, at least.
*  There's nothing. It's just pure desert.
*  And I said, OK, Captain, good.
*  But I'm looking now where did you you've been in many plans
*  where it has the computer, so I'd say 1000 feet.
*  Goes one thousand nine hundred eight hundred.
*  It's a computer voice, but it sounds like it.
*  But it's incredible voice.
*  Seven hundred. I say, Captain, are we OK?
*  I'm look, are we OK, Captain?
*  There's no lights.
*  And I'm looking normally when you land up, because I sit with Paul Solot.
*  I think it's great. I think it's a great profession.
*  Everything is incredible. They're incredible.
*  These machines are incredible.
*  He said, Sir, we're fine. No problem, sir.
*  I said, you know, I don't see the lights up there, Captain.
*  Sure, we're OK.
*  You know, so I mean, I'm exaggerating a little bit, you know,
*  probably exaggerating.
*  They'll tell the story.
*  They'll say Trump was a coward.
*  So I'm sitting with him, you know, five hundred and four.
*  And I'm and I'm telling you, there wasn't a light on the runway.
*  Nothing. And we're going in.
*  You OK, Captain? Everything good?
*  Yes, sir. No problem.
*  We'll be down in about one minute, sir.
*  And I'm telling you, Joe, you know, there's always a light.
*  There's not a little pin.
*  And all of a sudden, and you hear it.
*  Wow. Perfect landing like glass.
*  That's how good I mean, these guys between the equipment and it's genius.
*  It's pure. It was so dark.
*  You couldn't see a thing.
*  There was no runway.
*  You wouldn't know where the hell you are.
*  You're in the middle of a desert.
*  And then I got out of the plane.
*  I said, thank you, Captain.
*  It's a great job.
*  And then I get out of the plane and I'm going down and I see a general
*  and another general and I see a staff sergeant, a drill sergeant
*  and various guys, all central casting.
*  Central casting.
*  They said, sir, would you like to arrest?
*  I said, I don't want to arrest.
*  I want to figure out what the hell are we doing with ISIS?
*  I'm hearing we can't.
*  It's going to take years.
*  No, sir, we can do it very quickly, sir.
*  And anyway, we go into the room.
*  We go and I mean, Biden would have taken a nap for four days
*  and then left without a meeting.
*  So we go into the room and they have these guys.
*  I say, how long can you do it?
*  How long?
*  We can do it in a couple of weeks, sir.
*  I said, wait a minute, they told me five years.
*  We can do it.
*  And he gave me a number like, like just like in no time.
*  I said, why haven't you done it?
*  Because the orders came in from Washington, sir,
*  and they would come here and tell us what to do.
*  Don't you challenge us?
*  We're not allowed to do that, sir.
*  That's not the military way.
*  They tell us what to do and we have to respect them.
*  I did.
*  So do you think that it was incompetence?
*  Why they didn't go after ISIS?
*  I think it's a bad system.
*  When Mattis goes there or when Milley goes there,
*  who's stupid, and they tell these guys that are actually smart what to do,
*  and the guys that are smart are saying,
*  we don't like what they're doing,
*  but they're not allowed to sort of counteract.
*  Plus the guys that went there are arrogant.
*  They're arrogant fools.
*  They're like stupid fools.
*  The way they pulled out of, as an example,
*  the way they pulled out of Afghanistan with the people falling off the planes.
*  That's a disgrace.
*  It was worse than Vietnam with the helicopters falling.
*  It was so bad.
*  There was no reason for it.
*  Anyway, so we knocked them out.
*  We have great military.
*  We have great people, but not the television guys.
*  And I rebuilt the military and then they gave a chunk of it.
*  As much as it is, it's a tiny little piece, believe it or not.
*  We have an unbelievable...
*  I rebuilt the military.
*  I rebuilt our nuclear.
*  And in a way, I hated to redo it,
*  but I got to realize how powerful that nuclear is.
*  Joe, one bomb...
*  Israel is gone, but forget.
*  One bomb could take out the entire East Coast.
*  It's so bad.
*  And I watched these poor fools talking about,
*  our oceans will rise one eighth of an inch over the next 500 years.
*  I mean, we have people, we have countries.
*  Right now you have five countries.
*  And don't underestimate North...
*  If you take a look at North Korea, I was there.
*  I mean, I was with Kim Jong-un.
*  I had a great rel...
*  I got along great with him.
*  You know, the press, she got along great.
*  That's a good thing.
*  It's not a bad thing.
*  It's a great thing.
*  Obama thought we were going to go to war with North Korea.
*  When I met with Obama just prior to the takeover,
*  you meet, you have sort of a ceremonial meeting,
*  but it lasted a long time,
*  a lot longer than it was supposed to last.
*  I said, what's the biggest problem?
*  He said, North Korea.
*  By the time I finished, I was...
*  We had no problem with North Korea.
*  We were really...
*  It was a little tough at the beginning, remember?
*  He said, I have a red button on my desk.
*  I said, I have a red button also,
*  but mine's bigger than yours and mine works.
*  I liked how you called them little rocket man.
*  I said, yeah, little rocket.
*  I said, little rocket man, you're going to burn in hell.
*  And it was a rough...
*  Oh, so rough that people were worried.
*  This is crazy.
*  And then one day I got a call, sort of like a fight.
*  I got a call.
*  You know, you ever see that pounding,
*  then all of a sudden, but I got a call.
*  And it was from him, meaning his people,
*  they wanted to meet.
*  They wouldn't meet Obama.
*  He tried to meet.
*  They wouldn't even talk to him about it.
*  And I think he expected to go to war.
*  I actually do.
*  I believe he expected to go.
*  And we checked their nuclear stockpile.
*  It is substantial.
*  I mean, it's...
*  I said, do you do anything?
*  I got to know him very well.
*  I got to know him better than anybody, anybody.
*  And I said, do you ever do anything else?
*  Why don't you go take it easy and relax, go to the beach?
*  You have beautiful beach, nice beachfront property.
*  You know, kiddingly.
*  I said, you're always building nuclear.
*  Just relax.
*  You don't have to do it.
*  Let's build some condos on your shoreline.
*  They actually have gorgeous stuff.
*  And he said, I just have to do it
*  because I need it for my safety, et cetera.
*  I got to know him very well.
*  We had no problem with him.
*  If you have a smart problem,
*  if you have a smart, really the right president,
*  the smart president,
*  you're not going to have a problem.
*  And I say it to people.
*  We have a bigger problem, in my opinion,
*  with the enemy from within.
*  And it drives them crazy when I use that term.
*  But we have an enemy from within.
*  We have people that are really bad people
*  that I really think want to make this country unsuccessful.
*  When you look at what's happening at our border, Joe,
*  when you have people coming in that...
*  When other countries are allowed to empty their prisons
*  into our country with murderers,
*  we had 13,099 murderers
*  dropped in our country over the last three years.
*  And 15,000 rapists convicted.
*  Rapists, drug dealers, drug lords,
*  And that's just the ones that have been counted for.
*  terrorists, correct.
*  People from mental institutions.
*  What do you think this strategy is?
*  Hundreds to hundreds of thousands of major criminals,
*  tougher and worse than anybody we have.
*  These are...
*  We're seeing the consequences of it in San Antonio.
*  They've taken over apartment buildings in Aurora, Colorado.
*  They've taken over apartment buildings.
*  These Venezuelan gangs.
*  Just the beginning.
*  What do you think the strategy is?
*  One of the things that they've said is that you
*  stopped a bill from being passed.
*  But didn't that bill also include amnesty
*  for the people that are already here?
*  Joe, this is years after the fact.
*  The damage was already done.
*  But what was the bill?
*  Well, the bill was nothing.
*  It allowed two million people in.
*  They were going to get amnesty.
*  It was a horrible bill.
*  It didn't protect us at all.
*  But we should just tell people what the strategy is.
*  So one of the things that's been very clear is that
*  they've moved a large percentage of these migrants.
*  They're coming across the border illegally.
*  They've moved them to swing states.
*  This is what's going on with Springfield, Ohio, right?
*  They're in swing states?
*  Well, that's not a swing state.
*  I'm going to win Ohio by a lot.
*  So that's not a swing.
*  But it's called Springfield, Ohio, to be exact.
*  And Springfield, Ohio is this very nice community
*  of 52,000 people that just had 32,000 migrants
*  that don't speak the language dropped into their community.
*  You can't get into a hospital.
*  You can't get into a school.
*  It's gone from a beautiful little place to a horror show.
*  And the mayor is a nice guy.
*  And the mayor says, we're looking for interpreters.
*  I said, no, you've got to remove them
*  and bring them back to their country.
*  Mostly Haitians in this case.
*  But they speak no language.
*  They speak no English.
*  In fact, even the language they do speak,
*  it's I mean, they can't get interpreters.
*  They can't do anything.
*  And the mayor is trying to be politically correct.
*  They're all trying to be.
*  In Aurora, Colorado, you have the worst,
*  probably the worst gang, MS-13 might even be,
*  you know, those two are the worst gangs.
*  These are Venezuela gangs.
*  They have taken over apartment complexes
*  and they're going to want to take over the whole thing.
*  And you have a weak governor, pathetic governor,
*  who's a radical left Democrat.
*  He doesn't know what the hell to do.
*  But you have it in many other communities,
*  but they don't like to talk about it because it's,
*  you know, it's bad for the community to talk about it.
*  These people have been let in here by this imbecile.
*  And I mean it.
*  She's a low IQ person, low IQ.
*  Right, but it's also obviously not just her.
*  There's a strategy involved in letting these people in.
*  Well, she was in charge of the border.
*  Well, she's in charge of the border,
*  but they also they utilize that app,
*  the app that used to be used.
*  It used to be used, I think essentially,
*  wasn't it for shipping?
*  Wasn't it when people were in this country?
*  It was used for shipping and now it's used to deal with the cartels.
*  The cartel heads of the cartel, rich people, by the way,
*  these are loaded.
*  These people have so much money.
*  They would call up.
*  Think of this.
*  They call up the app and the app tells them
*  where they should take their load of illegal migrants from the Congo.
*  You know, we have a lot from the Congo, prisons in the Congo.
*  I made a little bit of a sarcastic joke.
*  A man named Dana White, who you love, who I love.
*  I assume you love him.
*  I love that dude.
*  I think he's in a class by him.
*  He's probably the reason why you're here.
*  I don't know.
*  Maybe he's one of the big ones.
*  He is the greatest guy.
*  You know, I always say nobody's indispensable.
*  You know, everybody can be replaced.
*  Maybe you can't be.
*  You might not be.
*  But Dana White, truly, I don't think, you know,
*  the things he sold it for four billion.
*  I said, what a hero.
*  Who the hell is going to pay four billion?
*  And they made like a great deal.
*  I mean, because of him.
*  Take him out.
*  I think it's all different.
*  No, he's the best.
*  He's also the greatest guy.
*  He spoke at the whole thing with, you know,
*  I had just been shot and he got up
*  and he spoke so better than anybody.
*  I mean, who would be better to introduce you?
*  I asked of all the people,
*  and I know the biggest people in the world
*  and they all would have loved to have done it.
*  I said, Dana, would you do it?
*  You know, it was interesting.
*  He was away.
*  And he said to the people that, you know,
*  one of my guys called, said,
*  I won't be able to do it.
*  I'm, gee, I just left with my wife and family.
*  I said, we said, no, yeah, I was a little surprised,
*  even though I knew he was very far away.
*  He was in some place, you know,
*  and he deserved it with his family and all that.
*  And then I said, all right, that's it.
*  And so we're looking who we're going to get.
*  And all of a sudden she comes in,
*  Sir Dana White just said he's going to do it
*  and he's coming back in tonight.
*  He's taking it.
*  You know, the guy is just an incredible guy.
*  And he's like a tough champion, but loyal.
*  Yeah, he's got to be one of your favorite people.
*  He's one of my favorite people.
*  I've been friends with him for 23 years.
*  I love him.
*  So would you have because you're what you're doing here
*  is incredible.
*  I mean, everybody tells me all I noticed today,
*  I'm going, you know, you're on Joe Rogan.
*  Take people are telling me like, I said,
*  I say, how the hell do you know that?
*  But it's sort of what you've done here is amazing.
*  Where would you be if you didn't do the UFC stuff?
*  Would you have this show?
*  Do you think?
*  Yeah, I would still be doing it for sure.
*  Yeah, would it be at the same?
*  Would it be at the same level?
*  I don't know.
*  But you would have.
*  It's hard to know.
*  I think one of the things that works for this show, I guess,
*  is that I'm involved in so many different things.
*  You know, stand-up comedy, UFC, and all the interests
*  that I have that lead to the podcast.
*  Will you always want to do you?
*  First of all, you love UFC.
*  I love it.
*  Yeah.
*  You love the fights.
*  I mean, I watch you.
*  You are loving it.
*  They could pay you nothing.
*  It'd be very.
*  They didn't pay me anything for the first like 13 shows.
*  I did it for free because they were hammering money.
*  And I became friends with Dana.
*  And my position was you're going to give me
*  the best seat in the house.
*  I get to sit cage side for the fights.
*  I go through it.
*  And I wanted to help.
*  I was like, I think these are the guys that we had always
*  hoped for.
*  And early days of the sport.
*  I started working for the company in 1997.
*  Before the UFC was purchased by Zufa, which Dana worked for.
*  So I was a part of the previous owners.
*  And I only did it for a couple of years.
*  It was just too much.
*  And I was losing money.
*  And it was banned from cable because of Budweiser and John
*  McCain.
*  And you could only get it on direct TV.
*  And then I came along and I gave him the sites.
*  And he loved it.
*  He never forgot it.
*  He loves you for that.
*  He talks about it all the time.
*  Just interrupt you for one sec.
*  So they couldn't get a site because it was too dangerous.
*  Everybody was against it and they couldn't get licensed.
*  And I gave them the first two or three sites.
*  And they were great.
*  And by the way, I went to the first fight.
*  I said, I never saw anything like this.
*  It was crazy.
*  It was so good.
*  Take the best fight you've ever seen.
*  It was like that fight.
*  Right.
*  It was so good that I gave it to him again.
*  And all of a sudden, it caught on.
*  But you know, when I wasn't in Vogue, you know, I've had time.
*  You probably never had a time.
*  But I had times when I wasn't exactly in Vogue.
*  Dana, they called him.
*  He said, he's the greatest guy.
*  There's nobody like him.
*  He said, I'll never say anything bad about that guy
*  because when I need it.
*  Because they were having a hard time at the beginning.
*  They almost pulled the plug a couple of times.
*  Right.
*  He said, he stood up and he gave us stuff that nobody else
*  gave us and nobody wanted anything to do.
*  And he said, I will never.
*  And there was a time where it would have been very popular
*  for him to say bad stuff about me.
*  He said, the greatest stuff about me.
*  He said, you're going to try and get me to say bad stuff
*  about Trump.
*  I'm never doing it.
*  No, he's a very, very, very loyal guy.
*  Very unusual guy.
*  He's a fantastic guy.
*  A perfect guy to be at the helm of something so controversial
*  as the UFC.
*  Less controversial now.
*  Well, now it's huge.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, this was always the thing that I would hope
*  did it would be.
*  I always knew that it was unbelievably entertaining,
*  but I just didn't know if maybe I was crazy.
*  Maybe I loved it because I've had this long history
*  of being involved in martial arts and maybe like other people
*  who just think it's too violent.
*  But can boxing make it?
*  Yeah.
*  Boxing is still a great sport.
*  I love boxing.
*  But it seems to be so unimportant now by comparison
*  to UFC, don't you think?
*  I think, well, you know, Dana is working with the kingdom
*  of Saudi Arabia.
*  They're going to start promoting boxing now.
*  And with Dana at the helm of it, I think boxing can return
*  because the thing is they want to make fights that other people
*  maybe, you know, promoters don't want to make because they want
*  to protect their fighter.
*  Controversial fights where it's dangerous.
*  Like, you don't know this guy could lose.
*  And so the Saudis, they're smart.
*  They just offer a tremendous amount of money.
*  And they're putting together fighter fights
*  that no one else can put together.
*  They're doing that in boxing.
*  If Dana is involved, he'll probably make it good.
*  You know, the amazing thing, though, in fighting,
*  no UFC fighter, they say, has ever died.
*  And it looks to be much more violent than Box.
*  Many Boxers have died.
*  Isn't it interesting?
*  And Dana tells me because they take so many shots to the face.
*  Yes.
*  And there's also no other options to preserve yourself,
*  to protect yourself.
*  So if you get hit in a UFC fight, you can clinch.
*  You can try to take the fight to the ground.
*  You get options.
*  Also, you don't get allowed to get knocked down
*  and then get back up.
*  When you get knocked down, you're concussed.
*  And generally, you know, if a guy's really hurt,
*  they can be finished on the ground.
*  And the fight's over.
*  If it's boxing, you have 10 seconds to get up.
*  You get up, your head kind of clears,
*  but you're still in real bad trouble.
*  And you can kind of run away and survive until the bell rings.
*  There are only three-minute rounds.
*  And then you start again.
*  So you're getting repeated punishment to the head.
*  And then there's also the issue of guys weight cutting,
*  which is a problem with the UFC as well.
*  But weight cutting in boxing has led to,
*  if you look at deaths in boxing, there's very few of them
*  in the heavyweight division.
*  Most of the deaths in boxing are the lighterweight divisions.
*  Because when guys dehydrate themselves to lose weight,
*  to make weight, their brain is the last thing
*  that gets rehydrated.
*  It's very difficult to completely rehydrate
*  your brain quickly.
*  And you only have 24 hours between the weigh-in
*  and the fight.
*  And it used to be the weigh-ins were the day of the fight.
*  Like when Boom Boom Mancini had a fight with Duk-Koo Kim
*  and killed him in the ring, which is one of the last ones
*  on television that we've seen.
*  That's right.
*  That was a crazy event for people and heartbreaking.
*  And it led to a bunch of different changes.
*  And one of them is day before weigh-ins
*  to allow people to rehydrate better.
*  And the other one is they dropped it from 15 rounds
*  down to 12.
*  Which, look, they should do that again.
*  You know, I'm not the fighter, so.
*  But those 15 round fights were unbelievable.
*  They were unbelievable.
*  Unbelievable.
*  Yeah, you go back to the golden age.
*  Yeah.
*  In terms of entertainment, those were the championship reps.
*  Those were the greatest fights ever.
*  Those last three rounds were crazy.
*  That was brutal.
*  I mean, it's such a war of attrition.
*  You know, a lot of people think even like a five round UFC
*  fight.
*  UFC is five minute rounds.
*  It's so much energy you're burning out.
*  And those last couple of rounds, those five round fights,
*  the fourth and the fifth round, unbelievably brutal.
*  Who's the greatest UFC fighter are you allowed to say?
*  In your opinion, it's tough for you to say because you do this.
*  But who do you think is the greatest of the fighters?
*  There's a lot of arguments for who's the greatest of all time.
*  John Jones, most people would say is the greatest of all time.
*  Never lost.
*  There's certainly a really good argument for that.
*  There's another argument for George St. Pierre.
*  I always leave in BJ Penn in his prime, Anderson Silva in his prime.
*  Mighty Mouse.
*  People forget about Mighty Mouse because unfortunately he's a smaller guy.
*  He's 125 pounds, flyweight champion.
*  He's one of the greatest expressions of mixed martial arts I've ever seen.
*  I think to this day.
*  And Khabib?
*  What about Khabib?
*  Khabib is fantastic.
*  But if you looked at like accomplishments in terms of championship fights,
*  Khabib retired 29 and 0, but he didn't have as many world championship fights.
*  They say he might have lost to Glaze and Tebow.
*  He might have lost to him.
*  Around.
*  Might have lost around.
*  And that was a controversial fight where people think that
*  Glaze and Tebow could have even got the decision in that fight.
*  I'd have to go back and watch it again to make a decision.
*  But they're great athletes.
*  Oh, the best athletes in the world and the most dangerous sport in terms of like,
*  it's I always call it high level problem solving with dire physical consequences.
*  Yeah, it's just brutal.
*  That's what fighting is.
*  You know, I never forget.
*  So there was a fighter named James Tony.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  I love James Tony.
*  He fought as a very light fighter and he ended up as a heavyweight.
*  This guy went through everything.
*  He was almost like a lightweight.
*  He went from middleweight all the way up to heavyweight.
*  Yeah.
*  And Peter van der Holyfield is a heavyweight.
*  And he was a real fighter.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  So James Tony and I think it was say George.
*  George St. Pierre.
*  St. Pierre.
*  I think it was him.
*  Who did he fight?
*  James Tony?
*  No, James Tony didn't fight George St. Pierre.
*  He fought a UFC fighter.
*  Yeah.
*  Randy Couture fought James Tony.
*  Was it Randy Couture?
*  That was like an easy fight.
*  That was a very easy fight.
*  Randy Couture just took him down and strangled him.
*  And he's half the size.
*  And he just once he got to the ankles, in fact, the announcer said it's over.
*  Yeah.
*  He took him down, mounted him, strangled him.
*  It was pretty quick.
*  And he was talking big because he was much bigger.
*  Pretty big.
*  James just wanted to make some money.
*  You think so?
*  Yeah.
*  But I never forgot it.
*  I don't think he knew what he was doing.
*  It was over very quickly.
*  And he was lying sleeping on the mat.
*  And he was talking.
*  You know, he was doing the Muhammad Ali stuff, but it didn't work out.
*  But I remember.
*  He sold the fight.
*  Yeah, that was Couture probably.
*  Yeah, it was Couture.
*  George never fought a boxer in an MMA fight.
*  If he did, he would kill them.
*  Was he one of the greatest?
*  Yes, unquestionably.
*  That's the argument.
*  There's like a handful of guys you can make the argument as the greatest of all time.
*  People forget about Anderson Silva.
*  In his prime, he was on the top.
*  He was unstoppable.
*  Anderson Silva?
*  But that's the thing is.
*  And then there's Fedor Emelianenko, who fought in Pride.
*  In his prime, he was unstoppable.
*  And you have a couple now that are pretty good.
*  Yes.
*  We've got so many now.
*  Alex Pereira.
*  Correct.
*  There's an argument that he's the top pound for pound fighter in the world right now.
*  He's looking very good, yeah.
*  He's unbelievable.
*  But it's like fighters can only compete at that level for so many years.
*  And so my opinion, you have to judge them at their very peak.
*  You can't judge them when they're hanging on and still fighting.
*  You can't judge them when they're coming up.
*  You got to judge them in that championship peak.
*  And that championship peak, there's a handful of guys that you would consider at the very top.
*  If they stopped a little bit sooner, some of them would have had, you know, I mean,
*  there are a couple of that you just mentioned without mentioning names.
*  If they stopped, they had the perfect, they were unbelievable.
*  And then at a certain age, they start getting knocked out, right?
*  Yes, it's unfortunate.
*  But the thing is that same belief in themselves that lets them become a champion.
*  It's OK.
*  Makes them think that they can do it long past the time that they actually can.
*  Well, Anderson Silver was essentially unbeatable.
*  And then he lost at last one.
*  Then all of a sudden he got knocked out.
*  He got knocked out by Chris Weidman.
*  He was kind of clowning in that fight famously and Chris Weidman had a vicious left hook,
*  knocked him out.
*  And then they fought a second time and he broke his leg on Chris Weidman.
*  And after that fight, he was kind of never the same because that that leg break injury,
*  which Conor McGregor had, there's quite a few fighters.
*  That was a wide one actually one of having the same injury.
*  Ironically, there's only been like it.
*  You're never the same because you can't never the same.
*  Well, you can.
*  Weidman is still kicking with that leg.
*  You can.
*  But psychologically, when you throw a kick and your leg snaps in half
*  and you're in agony for a year, right, you have to get surgery.
*  You have to get bolts and plates to keep your leg together.
*  And then it takes forever for it to heal.
*  It always amazed me how the kicker.
*  I mean, you have those cases, but the kicker will do tremendous damage to somebody's leg.
*  But their leg doesn't seem to get damaged, isn't it?
*  It does get damaged.
*  It hurts more than you.
*  Yeah, but your shin, your shin gets very numb after a while.
*  And guys that are really good kickers, they're kicking the thigh and they're kicking the calf.
*  They're kicking soft areas and they're slamming this hard, numb shin.
*  The shin gets all these like micro fractures all over the shin and it calcifies.
*  Like these guys can kick baseball bats.
*  You ever seen him break baseball bats with their shins?
*  No, I've never seen.
*  It's crazy.
*  Some guys can do two baseball bats.
*  Someone will hold the baseball bat and they'll just kick right through them.
*  I watch your enthusiasm now, right?
*  Yeah.
*  And it's like, that's why you're good at it.
*  Nobody does this better.
*  Without the enthusiasm, forget it.
*  Well, it has to be authentic.
*  The only reason why I do MMA commentary is because I'm very interested in it, for real.
*  I don't have to manufacture it.
*  I'm very interested.
*  You love going in there after the fight and they're sweating all over you.
*  They're slopping all over you.
*  They bleed on me.
*  They're bleeding.
*  Sometimes their nose is bleeding.
*  Does that bother you a little bit?
*  No.
*  Two weeks ago, I never saw him.
*  A little round street, yeah.
*  More stuff came out of his nose.
*  Yes, it was pretty nasty.
*  But no, I'm very used to it.
*  I just wanted him to be able to express himself.
*  You've done a great job.
*  Thank you.
*  You've done a great job.
*  So back to you and back to what are you and first of all, I love this idea of you teaming
*  up with Robert Kennedy.
*  Right.
*  And I love this Make America Healthy Again idea because there are chemicals and ingredients
*  and there are food that are illegal in other countries because they've been shown to be toxic.
*  There's pesticides and herbicides and there's a lot of shit that's been sprayed on our food
*  that really is unnecessary and there's a lot of health consequences that people are suffering
*  from a lot of these things.
*  I brought this chart for you.
*  Beautiful.
*  Because I had a feeling you'd be asking me.
*  Thank you.
*  Look at this chart.
*  These are healthier countries.
*  Look where the United States is.
*  I'm going to send this to R.F.K. Jr.
*  Look at this.
*  Well, something along the line.
*  I was actually talking to R.F.K. today and he told me that more than 70 percent of young
*  men are ineligible for the military because of their health.
*  I could see it.
*  That's crazy.
*  A lot of it's obesity.
*  So here's the life expectancy versus health expenditure.
*  Same chart.
*  Yeah.
*  Did you see that?
*  USA.
*  Wow.
*  That's pretty good.
*  Jamie's the best.
*  He's very good.
*  He's the best.
*  So no, but look at that.
*  Look at the USA.
*  Not good.
*  And that's our food.
*  That's our diet.
*  That's that sedentary lifestyle.
*  That's our diet.
*  That's the chemicals we ingest.
*  That's what that is.
*  But R.F.K. is going to be very, you know, I think he's a great guy.
*  I love the fact that you guys teamed up.
*  Yeah.
*  And are you guys, are you completely committed to have him a part of your administration?
*  Oh, I am.
*  But the only thing I want to be a little careful about with him is the environmental
*  because, you know, he doesn't like oil.
*  I love oil and gas.
*  I think, you know, I think it's to fire.
*  So I'm going to sort of keep him out of a little bit.
*  I said focus on health.
*  You can do whatever you want.
*  But I got to be a little bit careful with the liquid gold, you know?
*  I understand.
*  But listen, there's plenty of good work that could be done if you focus on health.
*  Here's the one that here's the one that my all time favorite.
*  Do you see the arrow right here?
*  That's what I love.
*  Do you have anyone that is pressuring you to not work with him?
*  Have there been people who are reaching R.F.K. Jr.?
*  Yes, I would imagine.
*  Because financially, he could put a dent.
*  I would say that and, you know, I think in many ways they've done a good job
*  and many ways they've done a bad job.
*  But I would say that the big pharma wasn't thrilled when they heard that,
*  you know, I have a really I've actually always gotten along very well with him.
*  I've known him a long time.
*  He's a different kind of a guy.
*  He's very smart, great guy.
*  And he's very sincere about this.
*  I mean, he really is.
*  He thinks we spend a fortune on pesticides and all this stuff.
*  And then you end up that chart is a terrible chart.
*  The one previous.
*  It's such a bad chart when you look at where we are compared to other countries
*  that don't spend 10 cents.
*  Right.
*  So, you know, and you save a lot of money.
*  But yeah, we I've had some people that aren't exactly thrilled.
*  You can imagine, right?
*  Sure.
*  It's a good question.
*  Actually.
*  Well, certainly, if there have been some pharmaceutical drugs that have been prescribed
*  that have negative consequences that these people have been profiting off of.
*  And then you have a guy like R.F.K. Jr.
*  who spends an enormous amount of time highlighting those things.
*  You could say how they've been very reluctant to have you support him.
*  I would say that's an understatement.
*  Yeah.
*  So what do you do to stop that from getting in the way?
*  Well, look, they've come up with some amazing things.
*  I mean, I don't know how you feel.
*  I know you're against the certain vaccines, but like the polio vaccine,
*  people had polio.
*  There were it was like a disaster.
*  And they came up Dr. Salk and he came up with a vaccine and there's no polio.
*  Now, very interesting.
*  There hasn't been polio, but now in the Gaza Strip.
*  Can you believe that?
*  Have you heard that?
*  There's been a big strain of polio coming out in the Gaza Strip.
*  Is it vaccine derived polio?
*  Because, you know, there's there's a strain of polio that comes directly from the vaccine,
*  because unfortunately, sometimes we vaccinate people for polio.
*  Or I see.
*  See, I haven't heard that.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, all I can do is I sit down and I listen to him and I'll give it a total.
*  I would love him to be right, because it's if he's right,
*  it's a lot less expensive generally.
*  There's two things that people point to when they point to
*  the dangers of the pharmaceutical drug industry.
*  One thing is when pharmaceutical drugs were allowed to advertise on television.
*  We're only one of two countries in the world that allow pharmaceutical drugs to advertise on TV.
*  The other one's New Zealand.
*  But they're more restrictive than we are.
*  People are worried.
*  But those ads, those ads when you hear like, you know, take a certain drug.
*  And then you hear all the consequences.
*  And then you say it causes cancer and baldness.
*  We don't like baldness.
*  Suicide, audiation.
*  And they said that in the eyesight and you can lose your vision.
*  Yeah.
*  And, you know, I just I actually asked one of these guys,
*  I would never take it.
*  I mean, it causes things that are so bad.
*  They go through a whole list.
*  I guess they save some liability.
*  But man, I said, does that affect the purchase?
*  And they say it really does.
*  When they when there's something you have and you read
*  and then they go through the list of side effects, the potential side,
*  it's not even the potential side effects.
*  I mean, a lot of people are just I ask that question.
*  People hear that when I hear it, I'm going to take a pass.
*  It says may affect your vision may cause blindness.
*  May this.
*  Yes.
*  But I know you're aware of Callie and Casey Means, right?
*  Yes.
*  Well, one of the things that they pointed out,
*  and this is a very important thing for people to understand,
*  is what a lot of these drugs do is they they act to to somehow or
*  another mitigate the effects of poor metabolic health.
*  But most of these problems that these people are suffering from
*  wouldn't exist if we put an emphasis on metabolic health.
*  If people got healthier, they started eating nutritious food and taking vitamins,
*  a whole host of these problems that people are having would go away.
*  And the problem with that from the pharmaceutical drug standpoint is they
*  wouldn't be able to sell drugs to these people.
*  And this is pesticides and things like that on the plants.
*  And what do you think of that?
*  It's terrible.
*  Well, I think regenerative agriculture, unfortunately, is very difficult to scale
*  to a point where you got a jack in the box on every corner.
*  This if everybody wants food and we have food deserts and we have
*  places like Los Angeles where no one's growing anything and everything has to be shipped in.
*  It's very difficult to feed that many people.
*  We've created this incredible society where we have these enormous cities,
*  but it's very difficult to get food to these people.
*  And then for a lot of these people in low income areas,
*  the only food that's available is cheap, unhealthy food.
*  And we could fix that.
*  If we could send one hundred seventy five billion dollars to Ukraine,
*  we could do something to fix a lot of the health problems that the United States has.
*  And I think it would it would help us as a nation overall.
*  If you just put it out there that, hey, as a nation,
*  we're going to make a concerted effort to get people healthier.
*  Just put it out there and people start making better choices.
*  Well, when you look at that chart, I was crazy.
*  They just gave me that chart because they said you may want to discuss this topic,
*  which I know is a big topic for you.
*  And when I looked at that chart and I looked at how unhealthy we are as a nation,
*  that's a that's a pretty big thing.
*  How are you so healthy?
*  Is it golf?
*  No, it's genetics.
*  I believe you know, I'm a big geneticist.
*  It's a big fact.
*  I really am.
*  I mean, my father was.
*  Unfortunately, it is a big factor for health.
*  Some people are just way more robust.
*  But you do play golf a lot.
*  And that is both of my parents.
*  For me, it's good.
*  Fresh air.
*  It really is.
*  It's fresh outside.
*  Even mentally, you're focused on three footer for some for a couple of hours.
*  You're not.
*  And I go quick.
*  I play fast, real fast.
*  And I'm in amount.
*  But, you know, it gives me I was never one that could like run on a treadmill.
*  And I can do it.
*  You know, when passing a physical, they asked me to run on a treadmill.
*  And then they make it steeper and steeper and steeper.
*  And the doctor said it was at Walter Reed.
*  They said, it's unbelievable.
*  I could have got I'm telling you, I felt I could have gone all day.
*  But I said, Doc, I can do this all day long.
*  I'm not I have no problem.
*  But it's boring to me.
*  Do you understand?
*  Right.
*  It's just boring.
*  Golf's exciting.
*  But I did it for so long.
*  They couldn't believe it that I did it.
*  And I never did.
*  You know, I don't do it.
*  I don't do it.
*  You know, I have friends who run on this stuff all day long.
*  But I had no problem doing it.
*  But it's really boring.
*  So with golf or something, you know, or tennis or whatever.
*  Right.
*  Golf as you get older, there's something really good about it.
*  And you have competition, competition, concentration.
*  And it's a great handicap sport.
*  And it's also a thing.
*  I think that's it cleans your mind because when you're looking at a shot,
*  that's all you can think of when you're executing.
*  It gives you a couple of hours.
*  You know, it's interesting, like with tennis,
*  if you're much better than somebody, you can't really play with somebody.
*  You know, it doesn't work.
*  You can give them sort of the equivalent of strokes.
*  Right.
*  But it's not this with golf.
*  You can play with a lousy guy and give him a stroke, a hole or two strokes, a hole or something.
*  You know, it's a good handicapping.
*  Right.
*  But it gives me a little exercise.
*  But I haven't played in a long time.
*  I won a lot.
*  I won 32 club championships.
*  Didn't you play right after you got shot?
*  No.
*  What I did is I played with Bryson DeChambeau.
*  Do you know Bryson?
*  Yes.
*  The pro.
*  He's a great player.
*  And we played.
*  It was a certain thing that we played, I guess, called breaking 50 or something.
*  50 would play from a certain tee.
*  And if you can break 50 and it got tremendous ratings, sort of like a crazy thing.
*  He's a great guy.
*  But wasn't that like a couple of days after you got shot?
*  I don't know.
*  I know.
*  I think that was one of the funniest things.
*  You were on the golf course.
*  I think I did.
*  Yeah, maybe I did.
*  But I, you know, I view it very interestingly.
*  I'm running for president of the United States.
*  To me, it's such a big deal.
*  It's so important.
*  So I've got now.
*  Biggest deal in the free world.
*  It's 100 times bigger than the Super Bowl and it's one person.
*  Yeah.
*  So you're down to two people and we start off at 9 billion because you have 9 billion,
*  they say in the world.
*  Who knows what that number is.
*  But you get down to 350 million.
*  Sadly, we have no idea what we have in this country, but let's assume it's 325, 350.
*  And you're down to two people.
*  It's the biggest thing in the world.
*  And when I heard she took off yesterday and she took off the day before,
*  and she's going to take off tomorrow or the next day,
*  I haven't taken a day off in 56 days.
*  That's a long time.
*  I haven't taken one day off.
*  I don't want to plug up.
*  This is too exciting.
*  Golf is great, but this is too exciting.
*  This is more exciting than anything you can do.
*  Also, it's the home stretch.
*  It's the home stretch.
*  Who would take a day off?
*  So we have 11 days left now.
*  And think of it.
*  So I think I've gone 54, 55 days in a row.
*  No days off.
*  And I make speeches oftentimes, sometimes not, but I make speeches.
*  And when you make a speech, and my speeches last a long time because of the weave.
*  You know, I mean, I weave stories into it.
*  If you don't, if you just read a teleprompter, nobody's going to be very exciting.
*  You got to weave it out.
*  So you always have to, as you say, you always have to get right back to it.
*  Yeah.
*  Otherwise, it's no good.
*  But the weave is very, very important.
*  Very few weavers around.
*  But it's a big strain on your, you know, it's a big, it's a lot of work.
*  It's a lot of work.
*  You got to be careful with the voice.
*  You can lose that voice.
*  The voice wasn't designed.
*  I said today, so I made a big one last night.
*  I was in Las Vegas.
*  Big one the night before in Arizona.
*  Big one.
*  I mean, they're all big.
*  We have the, there's never been anything like it in terms of crowd.
*  Never been close.
*  Never been close.
*  They say, he talks about crowds.
*  He says, you know, it's very interesting.
*  So we get crowds that are really big.
*  And I say, you know, I've never had a story because I don't get good press.
*  I don't think I've had a good story in years.
*  I really don't.
*  I swear.
*  I don't think I, you were talking about it a little bit with Oprah.
*  Everybody loved me.
*  I don't think I became president of the United States.
*  I did great the second time.
*  I did much better.
*  I don't want to get you in any disputes, but I won that second election so easy.
*  And not just because of that.
*  But let me, let me get to that.
*  I want to talk to you.
*  But here's the thing.
*  I did that and now I've gotten the nomination again.
*  And don't forget to get these nominations.
*  You go against very smart people.
*  Ron DeSantis was hot.
*  Got to go through him.
*  Nikki Haley was hot.
*  Got to go through her.
*  I went through everybody.
*  Record time, right?
*  Record time.
*  I got three nominations in a row.
*  Won the first time.
*  Did much better the second time.
*  You know, I get millions of votes more the second time.
*  And now I'm doing it a third time.
*  And it's an incredible thing.
*  I never get a good story.
*  I only get bad press.
*  Now, I will say this.
*  It's a lot easier if you're a Democrat.
*  If I were a Democrat.
*  You'd get a lot of positive press.
*  I would get a lot of positive press.
*  Yeah.
*  No, it's a creepy, corrupt business.
*  And the media, to a large extent,
*  acts as a propaganda arm for the Democratic Party.
*  It's not, it's not even believable.
*  Yeah, it's believable.
*  It's bizarre to watch.
*  And most, you know, most young people, I think, are aware of it.
*  I think most boomers still, unfortunately,
*  read the newspapers and believe in CNN.
*  But it's getting younger.
*  Yes.
*  Let me tell you.
*  It's getting for us, for a consumer.
*  And, you know, I don't even, I consider myself a person.
*  It's the Internet.
*  It's because the Internet's giving people information
*  that they're not getting from anywhere else.
*  And they like the very fine people hoax,
*  the Russiagate hoax, all these different things
*  that they've done, they tried to pin on you.
*  That's like, it's a clear distortion of what you actually said.
*  The bloodbath hoax.
*  Yeah.
*  I was talking about the auto industry.
*  Yes.
*  It's a bloodbath because Japan and China are taking our auto.
*  And I said, it's a bloodbath.
*  They said, oh, he used the word bloodbath.
*  You said if you don't win, it's going to be a bloodbath.
*  That's right.
*  Because they're going to take over.
*  That's exactly what you said.
*  It's a terrible thing they do.
*  But that's the problem with propagandists
*  because they take things out of context.
*  And ultimately, what they do is they diminish their own credibility
*  because people don't want to listen to them anymore
*  because they see that they've done that
*  and they recognize what's going on and they feel insulted.
*  They're intelligence is getting insulted.
*  Well, look at the ratings.
*  You know, shows like yours.
*  So I have a son who's very smart and tall, Baron, right?
*  And he knows all about you.
*  He knows about guys I never heard of.
*  He said, Dad, you don't know how big they are.
*  They're big.
*  You know, somehow big.
*  I said, who the hell is he?
*  Like Ross.
*  He said, Dad, he's a great guy.
*  I mean, guys that are doing it.
*  It's a whole new world out there.
*  It's a different world.
*  And I'm on TikTok now.
*  Congratulations.
*  And I've done really well.
*  No, but you know the crazy.
*  Have you seen the numbers?
*  Billions, like billions of hits.
*  It's crazy.
*  TikTok is a wild application.
*  And I've gone up 30 points.
*  A Republican is always down 30 with young people.
*  I'm plus 30.
*  And I'm on TikTok.
*  I think young people are rejecting a lot of this woke bullshit.
*  Young people are tired of being yelled at and scolded.
*  They're tired of these people that they think are mentally ill,
*  telling them what the moral standards of society should be today.
*  And people are upset.
*  There's a big difference now.
*  But even in just a couple of years,
*  I was shaking hands with people.
*  They're young people.
*  The rebels are Republicans now.
*  They're like, you want to be a rebel?
*  You want to be punk rock?
*  You want to buck the system?
*  You're a conservative now.
*  That's so crazy.
*  And then the liberals are now pro-silencing criticism.
*  They're pro-censorship online.
*  They're talking about regulating free speech.
*  And they're regulating the First Amendment.
*  It's bananas to watch.
*  Joe, they come after their political opponent.
*  I always say, you know, I kid, but I'm not kidding.
*  I've been investigated more than Alphonse Capone.
*  He was the meanest of them all.
*  He'd kill you in two seconds if he didn't like you, right?
*  I've been under investigation more than Alphonse Capone
*  only because it's political opponent stuff.
*  And I've won.
*  I won the big case in Florida.
*  I'm winning the other stuff.
*  You win.
*  But you know what they did?
*  They did something that's only done in third world countries.
*  They came after their political opponent.
*  I could have put Crooked Hillary in jail.
*  Well, not only that, but they're weaponizing it by saying
*  that that's what you were going to do once you get in office.
*  Isn't it?
*  Ignoring what they're doing right now.
*  It's crazy.
*  I heard it.
*  Somebody was defending me today.
*  They said, no, that's what you're doing to him.
*  They're going, he's going to put us in jail.
*  He's going to invest.
*  That's what you're doing.
*  That's what you're doing to him.
*  A lot of people say, will you do that?
*  Will you do that to him?
*  If to them, if you win, you know, it's the presidency has tremendous power.
*  I could have put Crooked Hillary.
*  I respected that you didn't because what you said was it would be bad for the country.
*  No, I can't.
*  I couldn't even imagine you have first of all, secretary of state,
*  but more importantly, the wife of the president of the United States of America going into jail.
*  And if you ever saw when I'd say something about her, they're all say I didn't say,
*  I never said it.
*  They say, lock her up, lock her.
*  And I'd always go, take it easy.
*  Just relax.
*  We're going to win this thing.
*  Take it easy.
*  Take it easy.
*  And I'm telling you, I kept it down just the opposite.
*  Now they say, oh, Trump wanted to put her in jail.
*  No, I saved her from going to jail.
*  They had more stuff on her.
*  And Comey had it because when Comey got up and he stupidly because he's a stupid guy, too,
*  he goes, he's a stupid son of a bitch.
*  He got up, Joe, he got up.
*  And instead of saying she's innocent of all charges,
*  he went over each charge and each charge was a killer.
*  And he go, and as far as her doing this, she's innocent and this.
*  And then she's only an unfair prosecutor for it.
*  We go, but every time you heard these charges, they sounded so bad.
*  They were bad.
*  And all it was is he wanted more airtime.
*  If he would have gone up and said, I've thoroughly investigated Hillary Clinton
*  and she's done nothing that we feel is wrong, it would have ended.
*  Instead, he wanted to be up there because he's a PR hound.
*  He's a hog.
*  And he starts going through and you know what he had?
*  They had a huge problem because FBI is great.
*  The people there, not the top people, the people, the real people, the people that work there.
*  It's like the real generals that I told you about that defeated ISIS in record time.
*  The FBI guys are great.
*  I'll bet you I'd be at 95% in the FBI.
*  I bet that's right.
*  Underneath.
*  Yeah.
*  And so here's the thing.
*  So he goes with Hillary and instead of just saying he goes through each charge.
*  Right.
*  And even I was saying, man, those are bad charges.
*  Sounds terrible because this is before I got.
*  Those charges.
*  Don't forget this before I got there.
*  Right.
*  Now he was trying to protect her, but he did her a great disservice.
*  Because he wanted attention.
*  He was stupid.
*  So I want to talk about 2020 because you said over and over again that you were robbed in 2020.
*  Yeah, totally.
*  How do you think you were robbed?
*  Everybody always cuts you off.
*  I'm going to allow.
*  Well, they not only cut you off.
*  What I'd rather do is we'll do it another time and I would bring in papers that you
*  would not believe so many different papers.
*  That election was so crooked.
*  It was the most crooked election.
*  Okay, but give me some examples of how.
*  Well, let's start.
*  Let's start at the top and the easy ones.
*  Okay.
*  They were supposed to get legislative approval to do the things they did and they didn't get it.
*  In many cases, they didn't get it.
*  What things?
*  Anything.
*  Legislative approval.
*  Like for extensions of the voting for voting earlier for this.
*  All different things.
*  By law, they had to get legislative approvals.
*  You don't have to go any further than that.
*  If you take a look at Wisconsin, they virtually admitted that the election was rigged,
*  robbed, and stolen.
*  They wouldn't give access in certain areas to the ballots because the ballots weren't signed.
*  They weren't originals.
*  We could go into this stuff.
*  We could go into the ballots or we could go into the overall.
*  I'll give you another one.
*  Are you going to present this ever?
*  Like, do you think?
*  Let me just give you one more before.
*  Before 51 intelligence agents come up that the laptop was from Russia.
*  It turned out to be totally false.
*  51 former intelligence agents, right?
*  They say that made, I don't believe it's this much, but it doesn't matter.
*  I won by like, I lost by like, I didn't lose, but they say I lost, Joe,
*  they say I lost by 22,000 votes.
*  That's like one tenth of 1% less than that.
*  It's a tiny little thing.
*  22,000 votes spread over.
*  That's spread over this period.
*  So 51 intelligence agents lied.
*  They lied.
*  They lied.
*  They knew it was.
*  It was Hunter's.
*  It was from his bed.
*  It was Hunter's laptop.
*  They said it was created by Russia.
*  Russia, Russia, Russia.
*  It was the Russia hoax.
*  The Russia hoax was a big hoax.
*  It was all a big hoax.
*  So that's clear.
*  That's one example.
*  Well, that's a big example.
*  They say it made a 17-point difference.
*  That's a big example, but that's only one.
*  And you could go into the ballots where they wouldn't give you access to the ballots.
*  You could go into the ballot harvesting.
*  You could go into $500 million for the lock boxes.
*  But just in terms of narrative, so there's two things, right?
*  There's the Russia hoax.
*  There's the collusion with Russia that was never proven, right?
*  That's one.
*  No, it's proven it didn't happen.
*  Right, right.
*  But they talked about it on television.
*  But it took two and a half years to prove.
*  But not only that, but it was a constant narrative on television.
*  That's a constant narrative that gets into people's minds,
*  especially low-information people that just watch the news,
*  that you're in collusion with Russia.
*  So that's one.
*  So that changes the narrative.
*  And then you have the 51 former intelligence agents that work with the original Twitter
*  and get them to remove links.
*  You can't share it on DMs.
*  You cannot share that story.
*  They swept that story because they said it was Russian disinformation,
*  even though they knew it was not.
*  100%.
*  So that's two examples that are real examples.
*  Now, anyone who considers himself a legitimate, objective observer of American politics,
*  if you really want the best person to win, you would want people to not lie.
*  And the only reason why they got away with this lie
*  was because they continually labeled you as this horrible threat to democracy and Hitler.
*  They kept saying you're going to be a dictator,
*  ignoring the fact that you weren't a dictator for the four years
*  where you were actually the president.
*  I was actually the opposite of a dictator.
*  I was a very straight guy.
*  But look, those three things, you take those three things,
*  each one of them by themselves causes the result to be different.
*  Okay?
*  It does.
*  And then you can go into a hundred other things.
*  There are so many.
*  We can't have corrupt elections and we can't have open borders.
*  We need a, we need, you need to have a country.
*  You need borders.
*  You need fair elections.
*  And I'll tell you the other thing you need is you need a free and fair press.
*  One of the things I like about doing a show like this.
*  Can you imagine Kamala doing this show?
*  She could imagine her doing the show.
*  She'll be laying on the floor.
*  She was supposed to do it and she might still do it.
*  And I hope she does.
*  She's not going to do it.
*  I will talk to her like a human being.
*  I would try to have a conversation with her.
*  If she did this kind of an interview with you,
*  I hope she does because it would be a mess.
*  She'd be laying on the floor.
*  Kamala, you'd be saying call in the medics.
*  I think we'd have a fine conversation.
*  I think I'd be able to talk to her.
*  I wouldn't try to interview her.
*  I just try to have a conversation with her and hopefully get to know her as a human being.
*  That was my goal.
*  Having her on, trying to get her to express herself just as I don't know if these,
*  I don't think these formats are good.
*  I don't think that two people, first of all, I hate the idea of the presidential debates
*  because I hate the idea of a time limitation on complex ideas.
*  Also, you have to break.
*  I think you have to have the debates.
*  Right.
*  But the way they do the debates, I think is the wrong way to do it.
*  I think they should have a conversation.
*  I think you and Kamala, you sit across the table with no one in the room but the two of you.
*  Of course, you're not going to shout at each other.
*  Of course, you're not going to insult each other.
*  I mean, it may get, they used to do it that way.
*  Hopefully it wouldn't, but that would be the way to do it.
*  They used to do it that way in the old days.
*  To put cameras on you with no one interfering with checking whether or not it's factual,
*  especially when it's biased because they checked you all those times and they didn't check her
*  with clearly things that were inaccurate.
*  Right.
*  So have two people just have a conversation with those without a time constraint.
*  And also this idea that they cut off the microphone.
*  Well, and no crowd.
*  No crowd.
*  Crazy too because you're good at working a crowd.
*  I would rather have a crowd.
*  Of course you would.
*  You're good at crowds.
*  So they gave me an alternative.
*  I don't think you want to debate.
*  Why did they want no crowd?
*  Because I think they thought I wasn't going to accept it.
*  So I believe what they wanted to do is have me not accept.
*  So they gave me a deal I couldn't refuse and I said, I'll do it.
*  Okay.
*  It's like the mob.
*  Right.
*  I'll take it.
*  So they came to me.
*  They said, we'll debate Joe Biden.
*  You know, that thing got tremendous ratings too.
*  That was crazy.
*  But we'll debate Joe Biden.
*  But you can't have a crowd.
*  They also wanted sitting down.
*  I said, that's the only thing I said, look, you got to, you got to stand up.
*  You can't really sit down.
*  Right.
*  The old days, they did sit down a little bit, but, but he gets tired.
*  You got to stand up.
*  And they agreed to it.
*  It was a very tough thing.
*  It almost killed it.
*  They wanted to, they wanted to have like desks.
*  We, we said, I said, I think we should stand up.
*  And that was the only thing I asked for.
*  I said, we got to stand up.
*  I thought it looked bad for like the public, but they said no crowd and cut off the mic.
*  And I said, I can live with it.
*  I mean, I can live with it.
*  And they thought I was going to reject it.
*  And then they would say he didn't want to debate sleepy Joe.
*  Right.
*  That's what they thought was going on.
*  Well, they tried to say that with you and Kamala as well.
*  They tried to say that you didn't want to debate her as well.
*  No, by the way, with her, number one, I'm leading number two.
*  You know, I didn't, they also said it with the primary.
*  So I had like 10, 12 guys, right in the primary, no stupid guys.
*  I mean, they're governors and they're set in.
*  They're not stupid people.
*  Some are stupid, but not all of them.
*  And all my guys said, you have to be in the debate.
*  I said, why I'm leading by 74 points.
*  The closest guy to me.
*  I'm like 60 points, 70 points higher.
*  Why would I stand there like an idiot for two hours
*  and let every one of them scream at me?
*  I'm going to be the focus.
*  What?
*  Right.
*  And I said, I'm not debating.
*  And it was a very smart thing because, you know, it was, they just killed themselves.
*  The Republican primaries.
*  Yeah, the Republican primaries with, I like debating.
*  I think debate.
*  I think you have to debate, but I like to be, I like debating like the Rosie O'Donnell debate.
*  I like debating when you have a great remember the Rosie O'Donnell.
*  It's very funny.
*  Megan, crazy thing.
*  Megan, that was a hell of a question, man.
*  If I didn't come up with that answer, it was a great line.
*  Well, what it was is, you know, that was we had 28,000 people.
*  That was the Cleveland arena where the Cavaliers played.
*  Right.
*  LeBron James.
*  I'm not a big fan of LeBron James, but he is a good basketball player.
*  But, you know, that was the and when I said that, the place went crazy.
*  And she kept talking.
*  No, she had like 10 of the.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, Megan said you said it to other people and you admitted you did.
*  But it was funny.
*  It was it was a comedic timing moment.
*  It was fine.
*  It was what they wanted to avoid.
*  Lucky I did it because she was, you know, she wasn't fit that question, but she kept talking.
*  To this day, they don't know what she said, but it wasn't positive.
*  So anyway, but we had a good time.
*  It's comedic timing.
*  And that's the reason why to have a debate a debate in front of a large audience.
*  And then they probably thought you would stack the deck.
*  I got very good reviews on that.
*  That was great.
*  Very funny.
*  Very funny stuff.
*  The Tim Wall stuff was very funny to see.
*  It's funny.
*  That's a real.
*  That's a crazy one.
*  She said that she had picked him.
*  And this one question I want to ask her when she was sleep deprived.
*  She said she was suffering from sleep deprivation when she picked him, which is just like,
*  I was maybe taking a nap.
*  So I was.
*  OK, look, let's see how it all turns out.
*  I think we're going to win.
*  I think we're way ahead now.
*  I think we're way ahead.
*  But but can I bring you back to 2020?
*  I think they're going to look at two things.
*  They're going to say they should have had a primary, even if it was a short primary.
*  They shouldn't have picked her.
*  And then she's going to say I shouldn't have picked this guy.
*  She shouldn't have picked that guy.
*  That guy's a disaster.
*  The lying about Tiananmen Square.
*  Everything.
*  Admitted in that.
*  Yeah, the military record, assistant coach versus head coach.
*  She lied too.
*  Little thing.
*  So I did McDonald's last week.
*  I saw that.
*  And I actually got a call from your friends at Google, from Sundar.
*  That's pretty good, right?
*  He said this is the biggest thing we've had in years.
*  You have McDonald's?
*  I had McDonald's.
*  Did you know that?
*  It was one of the.
*  It was funny.
*  Who's a great guy, by the way.
*  But he said this McDonald's thing, I want to tell you, it's one of the biggest things
*  we've ever had on Google.
*  It just hit.
*  But the reason I did it and I actually you never know about this stuff.
*  I thought it was a throw away.
*  I didn't think our conversation is a throw away.
*  But I thought that was I thought I'd walk in and that was only to highlight the fact.
*  And I have a friend who owns like 56 of these McDonald's and he said, do you want to use
*  one?
*  I said, yeah, I love it.
*  So we went there and the crowd was crazy.
*  You know, they had 28,000 people around the whole thing.
*  Did you see the outside?
*  It was crazy.
*  The cars couldn't get through.
*  Secret Service was not exactly thrilled.
*  We had no idea what the hell.
*  But I went into the place and I did the French fry thing and it just hit.
*  But that's like in life.
*  Sometimes you do.
*  I thought it was like a quick throw away.
*  We're going to be there for 15 minutes.
*  Then I said, I've worked here for 15 minutes, which is 15 minutes more than she worked here.
*  She lied about McDonald's.
*  And, you know, that's proven that she never worked.
*  100 percent.
*  She well, McDonald's has no information.
*  She has no information.
*  She says nobody.
*  The manager said she never worked there, you know, is a certain place.
*  And he said they never know.
*  She lied.
*  She's a liar.
*  You know what they do?
*  They'll say like on any one of the questions, take any.
*  They'll say it's the exact opposite of what I say.
*  IVF.
*  He's against IVF, the fertilization.
*  And it's the exact opposite.
*  I came out immediately strongly in favor.
*  And they do ads.
*  I'm against it.
*  It's wrong.
*  On every single topic.
*  And, you know, she changed policies on 15.
*  I've never seen a guy change.
*  Anybody change on more than one.
*  You know, you can maybe get away with one.
*  Her whole life fracking every single thing that she was for the confiscation of guns.
*  She wants to confiscate.
*  Now she's saying everybody should have a gun.
*  In fact, we're going to get her a MAGA cap.
*  I'm going to send her a MAGA cap.
*  But she's changed.
*  And I don't think people are buying it.
*  I don't think people are buying it.
*  Well, some people are buying it because they want to buy it because it's blue no matter who.
*  There's there's a certain percentage of our population that's going to vote Democrat no
*  matter what.
*  That's true.
*  They're pressured.
*  There's their community, their ideology.
*  It's you know, right.
*  I don't understand.
*  Right is evil.
*  I don't understand why.
*  OK, you have a wall or you have a you know, I built five hundred and seventy miles of wall.
*  Everyone said I built a lot of wall.
*  Exactly the stuff.
*  But you have a border.
*  What I don't understand is who would want people to come into our country from places unknown?
*  Like sometimes they'll say about a fighter from parts unknown.
*  Remember, he stacks code from parts.
*  He's from parts under the oldest.
*  Those are the that's even before you.
*  But who would want people to come in pouring into our country?
*  We don't know anything about it.
*  But that's I want to ask you this.
*  Why do you think they're doing that?
*  I think because you think they're trying to buy votes.
*  Do you think they just want cheap labor?
*  Like what is what's the idea?
*  There's a couple of theories.
*  They hate our country.
*  They're stupid.
*  Or they want to buy votes.
*  It's one of those three things.
*  Yeah, they want it.
*  Now, they are trying to get people registered who don't even know what the country is.
*  And they're trying to give people amnesty.
*  People that live here, they're trying to give them a citizenship.
*  And they want to.
*  Well, how about what happened?
*  Think about the amount of money that they've given them when they've come here, the food stamps,
*  the benefits that even our poor people aren't getting.
*  Two hundred billion dollars.
*  And that's a way low number.
*  That's a way low.
*  You know, it's interesting.
*  New York has always been like, you know, sort of like always looking for money.
*  They've spent a hundred billion dollars on this stuff.
*  I don't know where they and they're not getting the money from the federal government.
*  It's crazy.
*  And because the mayor came out and said, we can't live like this.
*  They investigated him.
*  He gets it.
*  I by the way, I called it.
*  I said he just got himself indicted.
*  This group is stupid, but they're vicious.
*  They're stupid people, but they're vicious people.
*  The 2020 elections.
*  You say you have all this evidence that it was rigged.
*  Why haven't you put this evidence in a consumable form?
*  I did.
*  And what?
*  Oh, I did.
*  I have I have books on it.
*  And by the way, books have been written on it.
*  We have an author named Hemingway, who is a great writer.
*  She wrote a book on it, but many books have been written on it.
*  There are books that are.
*  What's happened is judges don't want to touch it.
*  They would say you don't have standing.
*  They didn't rule on the merits.
*  They ruled the merits never got there.
*  The judges didn't have what it took to turn over.
*  And let's talk about the potential vulnerabilities for elections and election fraud.
*  One of them is mail in ballots.
*  The other one is the if someone can break into voting machines,
*  if someone can hack voting machines, those are two huge ones.
*  So, you know, what can be done on Musk?
*  I think he said it publicly.
*  I hope he did, because I wouldn't want to be the winner.
*  But he's a really smart guy.
*  And he's a very good guy with computers.
*  Right.
*  You'd say he's one of the smartest people alive.
*  Anybody that can land that 20 story building and perfect and while he's doing Starlink,
*  while he's talking to me about while he owns Twitter and then he agrees to Starlink
*  and tweets 100 times a day.
*  He's an amazing guy.
*  Yeah.
*  He said to me that unless you have paper ballots, it can never be an honest election.
*  That's a big statement.
*  It's a big statement.
*  We should go to paper ballots.
*  You know, France did.
*  They went the mail in voting and it was all messed up.
*  What can be done?
*  You know the amazing thing with the machines?
*  So we have the machines.
*  They cost 10 times more.
*  Paper ballot would cost 8 percent.
*  And they make paper ballots.
*  They're all watermarked and everything else.
*  Very sophisticated.
*  But if you take a look, paper ballots, 8 percent the cost.
*  And you're done by nine o'clock in the evening.
*  Right.
*  Now we have these sophisticated machine.
*  It goes up to heaven.
*  It goes all over the place and down and around.
*  And they say we'll need two weeks to figure out who the hell won the election.
*  Do you think that's by design?
*  Yeah, I do.
*  I think it's very crooked.
*  That's my opinion.
*  You're allowed to have an opinion.
*  What could let's say you win in November.
*  What can be done to mitigate these problems?
*  What could be done at a you know at the level that the president has power?
*  Well, if I win, that'll be this will be my last election.
*  But I think I owe it to the country.
*  Yeah.
*  But I think I owe it to the country.
*  We have to have fair elections.
*  So how can you fix that?
*  You know, Jimmy Carter was in charge of a commission, you know, that many years ago.
*  And they put him in Scoop Jackson and various senators, you know,
*  distinguished people that were retired.
*  And they came up with a report.
*  And the report's primary finding was you cannot have mail in ballots
*  because if it's a mail in ballot.
*  You know, I went to the voting booth the last time, whatever it was.
*  And I walked in in Palm Beach and I walk in and they know me.
*  They say, Mr. President, could I see your identity?
*  Yes. Boom.
*  Here's this.
*  Here's that everything.
*  And then you sit and you they watch you sign and you really there's not a lot you can do.
*  I mean, if you wanted to be dishonest, it's sort of beautiful.
*  Right.
*  If instead of that, I'm going to send them a ballot.
*  Right.
*  It has to go through the postal services.
*  It has to go through a lot of people.
*  They mail you houses that, you know, the house was demolished and the people have left.
*  And it's so bad.
*  The one thing with Jimmy Carter, he had a very strong commission.
*  It was no mail in ballots.
*  And we're the only one that does elections this way anymore.
*  They've gotten away from it.
*  And this is a ticked up in a big way after COVID.
*  It used to be like soldiers serving overseas.
*  They use COVID to cheat.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, they use COVID to certainly push this mail in ballot.
*  Another thing that's.
*  But they use COVID to cheat.
*  But here's another.
*  The last election was a little bit of a you couldn't even get security guys, big strong
*  guys to watch.
*  You know what?
*  You'd call them.
*  They call them in this session.
*  They were afraid to go out.
*  You know, we were in the middle of COVID.
*  We were in the middle of COVID, right smack in the middle.
*  And they didn't want to die.
*  You know, they didn't want to catch it.
*  It was like in a way it was it was like a ghost town.
*  And the whole thing.
*  But mail in ballots are a bad thing.
*  That certainly is a problem.
*  Mail in ballots are a problem.
*  But every other country, you know, other countries.
*  A voter ID.
*  Voter ID is the most bizarre argument that I've never seen anybody articulate in a way
*  that's convincing.
*  Because they want to cheat.
*  Well, it doesn't make sense any other way.
*  I've tried to straw man it or I try to steal man it rather.
*  I've tried to like look at it from a position like why would you not want people to have
*  ID?
*  And a lot of the ideas are just ridiculous.
*  The idea to get a driver's license.
*  But here's now the next step.
*  Gavin Newscombe, one of the worst governors in the world.
*  And I used to frankly I used to get along but I don't get along with him.
*  Because he's just too, you know, it's just a whole con job.
*  But Gavin Newscombe the other day signed a bill that you are not allowed to ask a person,
*  even ask them whether or not they have voter ID.
*  Now what could be a charitable reason why anybody would want that?
*  Because they want to cheat.
*  That would be the only thing that makes sense.
*  But that's taken it to the next level.
*  Right.
*  Now, you know, you have ID.
*  The Democrat National Convention when they had it the last time I saw, they had a sign
*  like a billboard or the name of the person, where they live, how they live, who the hell
*  their boyfriends are.
*  Every single, it was in a big picture.
*  That's for there.
*  They have an ID, a big ID.
*  It was hanging like you were a prisoner.
*  They had these massive cards, everything.
*  And yet when it comes to the vote, in theory, the most important thing we do, okay,
*  when you go to a grocery store, you give ID.
*  But for a vote, it's supposed to be a sacred thing.
*  And it should be a sacred thing.
*  No voter ID because they want to cheat.
*  Well, it doesn't make sense in any other way.
*  I've tried to look at it.
*  There's no other way.
*  There's no argument that anybody's presented that makes any sense why.
*  You know the funny thing, Joe, the Democrats, the people,
*  they all think you should have it.
*  In other words, you should have it.
*  If you go to the people, Mrs. Schwartz, Mrs. Smith, Mr. and Mrs. Jones, they say,
*  of course, yeah, Democrats, they say, yes, it's the politicians that don't want it.
*  Like Schumer and these guys, they don't want it because they want to be able to cheat.
*  Because you know what?
*  If they didn't have it, okay, who is going to vote for somebody that wants open borders?
*  Who's going to vote for somebody that wants to have men playing in women's sports?
*  You know, I have never had one person come up to me and say,
*  President, you've got to do something to allow men to play in women's sports.
*  Have you ever?
*  Just like I've never been called by a pollster.
*  I told you my little theory on pollsters, okay?
*  I'm getting myself in trouble with some of these things, but I don't really care.
*  Nobody's ever come up to me and said, we want to have men playing women's sports.
*  And you know, I had a funny thing at a property I own in California.
*  I have a woman who's a very good athlete, and she works there as a manager.
*  And Brian Erlacher, the big Chicago badge, great player, you know,
*  10 time All-Star, I guess, Hall of Fame, a great guy, big strong guy.
*  And she said, oh, he's one of my favorite athletes.
*  Can I have a picture?
*  And I took a picture and I said, and I noticed she was the size of his leg.
*  His leg was bigger than she was.
*  And I put it out.
*  Should men play in women's sports?
*  The whole it was just so ridiculous.
*  What's one of the most bizarre and polarizing ideas that's promoted by the left?
*  Who wants it?
*  Now, unless you're going to cheat in elections, you're never going to get nobody wants it.
*  I don't think anybody wants it.
*  I've never I've been told everything you know, you can some people want this.
*  I don't know of anybody that wants open borders.
*  Nobody's ever come up to me and say, President,
*  you got to let the world come into our country.
*  Now, if they won, so they have 21 million, I think it's much harder than that because
*  you've got a ways, you know, got a ways where they just walk in.
*  And the other thing you have is human traffickers.
*  You have traffickers and they traffic in women and they're going wild.
*  Now, we used to you know, we have to look the trunk of cars.
*  Can you believe it?
*  They put women in trunks.
*  They'll put three women in a trunk.
*  These people are savages.
*  They're horrible.
*  The worst people.
*  And they're making the kind of money they make on drugs.
*  They're almost making on trafficking now.
*  And the thing that's made it hot is the Internet.
*  That's what you know, you think of it almost as an ancient thing, but it's the Internet.
*  But who would want to have these things?
*  Who would want to have?
*  There's so many the transgender operations where they're allowed to take your child
*  when he goes to school and turn him into a male to a female without parental consent.
*  Who wants this?
*  Does anybody want this?
*  I've never heard of anyone and I can go into 10 different things.
*  The only way they get them is by no voter ID.
*  You can't have voter ID.
*  They don't want any.
*  They want to cheat.
*  There's only one reason because the voter ID is so basic.
*  It's the most basic thing.
*  It's very basic.
*  Who would want this?
*  They want it so they can cheat because their policies are no good.
*  I'll tell you, they're very smart when it comes to that.
*  They're very smart, although they're not smart in terms of politics in a way because
*  what do they have that people want?
*  They really don't have.
*  They give away a lot of health care, a lot of stuff, but for the most part,
*  their policies are terrible.
*  Their policy on military, she's running on a tax hike.
*  She's going to raise your taxes.
*  You're going to hear this.
*  We are going to raise your taxes and the people clap.
*  But who is going to win with her?
*  All my life I grew up with politicians, lower taxes.
*  She's politic in that we are going to raise your taxes.
*  The idea is you want to raise the taxes to the highest earners.
*  I know, but it really doesn't work that way.
*  They think that millionaires and billionaires are not paying their fair shares.
*  But it doesn't work that way.
*  Well, it's a narrative, right?
*  And it's a narrative that appeals to people that are not doing well.
*  And they're like, yeah, our problems are these rich people are not paying taxes.
*  Well, the problems are the rich people are going to leave
*  and they're going to close up their companies and then the other people aren't going to have jobs.
*  You know, that's what happens.
*  It does happen in other countries.
*  Because you brought it up.
*  I'll tell you what, we just he's doing a very good job in Virginia.
*  Glenn Yonkin, I don't know if you like him or not like him.
*  I don't know.
*  But you know, I'm the governor of Virginia.
*  So we have a case where they found thousands of illegal ballots.
*  A judge just ruled that they have to be able to vote.
*  Just happened today, just before I walked in here, I heard a judge just ruled
*  that you have to keep those people in.
*  They're illegal.
*  They're illegal votes.
*  Now, I think they'll be overturned at the next court.
*  One thing I found because I had a couple of things that they get overturned a little bit,
*  you know, the system because the system you have to hope that the appellate judges are honest.
*  Otherwise, we don't have a country anymore.
*  It's very important.
*  But the whole thing with illegal ballots, it's got to be looked at.
*  You got to have you have to have voter ID and you have to have additional ID.
*  You have to have an ID that shows that you're a citizen of the country.
*  I agree.
*  They don't want that either.
*  I agree.
*  One of the things that I want to talk to you about is the JFK files.
*  And one of the things that you said was that if they showed you what they showed me,
*  this was your quote, you wouldn't want people to know it either.
*  So I opened them up partially.
*  I was met with from good people.
*  I mean, you know, look, I've been good people, people that were well-meaning.
*  Mike Pompeo was one of them.
*  He's a good person.
*  They called me.
*  They said, sir, would rather have you not after and I did open them.
*  But I was asked by some people not to open them.
*  There's a Martin Luther King file, too, by the way, that they'd like to see.
*  I don't know if you know, but there is that.
*  But but JFK in particular.
*  So they called me a lot of good people called me people that I,
*  you know, that you would find reasonable people.
*  And they asked me not to do it.
*  So I said, well, we'll close it for another time.
*  But if I went, I'm going to open them up.
*  I'm just going to open enough.
*  Why didn't you open it up the first time?
*  Because a lot of times the hesitation addresses people that are still living.
*  There are people that are affected.
*  And there could be some national security reason that for, you know,
*  that I don't have to necessarily know about.
*  But some very good, talented people asked me not to do it.
*  I opened it up and then they said,
*  would it be possible for us to do that a different day?
*  How much of it did you read into?
*  I think it's going to be just fine to open it.
*  Let me put it that way.
*  I think it's fine.
*  It's going to be time.
*  It's a cleansing, you know, it's really a cleansing.
*  So I'm going to do it.
*  I'm going to do it immediately, almost immediately upon entering office.
*  Well, the thing when people look at it from the outside and you sort of imagine
*  what could be a reason why they would not release those files,
*  it would be there's people that were implicated in the assassination.
*  Yeah. Well, when there are living people, you generally tend not to want to do it.
*  When people are still living.
*  Living people that formerly work for the government.
*  For the government and living people that were somehow involved in it.
*  And you tend not to do that.
*  But it's time to open them.
*  I can't tell you whether or not they're going to find anything of interest.
*  And I did partially open.
*  I think I've opened 50 percent, but I was asked not to do it.
*  And I thought that was a reasonable ask, but now I'm going to do it.
*  I'm going to do it very soon.
*  There's a lot of interest in it.
*  One of the things that I'm very-
*  There's a lot of interest in the people coming from space, you know?
*  Yes.
*  And I know you're interested in that.
*  Oh, I'm very interested in that.
*  How much they tell you about that?
*  A lot.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  What do they tell you?
*  How much can you tell?
*  How does that work?
*  Is it like super top secret?
*  I think I can tell.
*  Tell me.
*  Well, based on Hunter Biden, I can say whatever the hell I want.
*  Right?
*  But no.
*  But I interviewed a few people.
*  It's never been my thing.
*  I have to be honest.
*  I have never been a believer.
*  I have people that Area 51 or whatever it is.
*  I think it's the number one tourist attraction in the whole country or something.
*  Area 51 in Las Vegas.
*  Do you know that, right?
*  Sure. I know what it is.
*  But it's a big tourist thing.
*  So I interviewed jet pilots that say they saw something.
*  If you saw them, you'd love to have a museum.
*  I've had a couple in here.
*  Commander David Fravor.
*  I had him in who had that sighting in 2004.
*  Very, very compelling with visual video evidence, radar evidence.
*  I interviewed-
*  Ryan Graves.
*  I don't believe his name, but I interviewed jet pilots that were solid people.
*  Perfect.
*  Great pilots, great everything.
*  And they said, we saw things, sir, that were very strange.
*  Like a round ball, but it wasn't a comet or a meteor.
*  It was something.
*  And it was going four times faster than an F-22, which is a very fast plane.
*  And it was round, which is in theory a great shape.
*  So when you were talking to these people,
*  was this something that you were compelled to have conversations?
*  Was this your personal interest?
*  It's not a great interest for me, but it's a little interest.
*  I get that question as much as almost any question.
*  Do you think that we have aliens coming, flying around or whatever?
*  What do you think?
*  There's no reason not to.
*  I mean, there's no reason not to think that Mars and all these planets don't have life.
*  Well, Mars, we've had probes there and rovers.
*  I don't think there's any life there.
*  Well, maybe it's life that we don't know.
*  Well, maybe there was life there at one point in time.
*  This is a speculation about Mars, that Mars had an atmosphere at one point in time,
*  a long time ago that could support life.
*  It also had large bodies of water.
*  But we've had no evidence of even bacterial life that exists on Mars.
*  But the universe is pretty vast.
*  It's not been a big thing for me.
*  I mean, when I looked at what China did to this,
*  they would have never done it with me where they put the balloon up.
*  And a lot of people thought for a little while that that was one of these things.
*  That's a lot of the speculation, too, that some of these drones that hover over battleships,
*  that these are Chinese drones and that they're not UFOs.
*  They could be also.
*  There's some super sophisticated.
*  But I did interview, let's say, three or four guys that, and without tremendous interest,
*  if you had them, as I said, you'd love to have them as your children, solid, beautiful people.
*  They said, sir, there's something there.
*  You know, they've said it.
*  There's something there.
*  Yeah, I've talked to quite a few of them.
*  They're not conspiracy guys.
*  Well, I mean, just the Commander David Fravor thing in 2004 off the coast of San Diego,
*  they clocked that thing going from 50,000 feet above sea level to 50 in a second.
*  They don't know what it is.
*  It's tough to beat.
*  Yeah, they saw something in the water.
*  It was hovering over that something that was making a disturbance in the water.
*  They got video evidence of this thing.
*  Two different fighter jets with pilots in them saw it.
*  There's visual evidence, photographic evidence, video evidence, radar evidence,
*  whatever the hell it is, it moves in a way that would turn a human being into jello
*  if they're inside of it.
*  The G-Force, no one would survive.
*  It doesn't have a heat signature.
*  They don't know what their propulsion system was.
*  When you fly in some of these jets, these pilots have to be in great shape.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  I flew with the Blue Angels once.
*  Yeah.
*  As an example.
*  I guess it's an F-18.
*  And those are older machines.
*  And they're crazy.
*  When you fly in some of these things, it's amazing.
*  Yeah, I can imagine.
*  You got to be special.
*  But these things that these people are encountering are far superior to what we know of.
*  Is it possible that there's some military or government program that you weren't,
*  that they didn't tell you about?
*  I think I had a great relationship with the military basically, but I didn't like certain
*  people. I would have gotten them out if I thought if I were, if the election was different,
*  I would have fired all of them quickly.
*  Most of them I did fire.
*  Biden should have fired every military person involved with Afghanistan.
*  He should have had a lot of firings.
*  If you look at him, he told Israel not to do anything.
*  At least Israel is not going to look at a bomb the way they would have been.
*  Think if they listened to Biden, they'd be waiting for a bomb to drop on their head right now.
*  He's been wrong about so much.
*  I guess you'd have to say that she's been wrong too, because she always said they made
*  the decision together. But Israel didn't follow his advice.
*  And I think it was a very, you know, it's a very, the Middle East is rapidly changing.
*  You know, there are prophets that say the world will come to an end
*  in the Middle East. You know that, right?
*  And we have weapons today that are so scary.
*  When you look, I rebuilt them all.
*  And when you look at the weapons we have today, the biggest threat we have
*  in the world today is nuclear weapons.
*  And we have other weapons too that are devastated.
*  But the nuclear weapons, the biggest threat we have in the world today.
*  And that's what you, I was talking about de-escalation with both China and Russia.
*  I'm telling you, we were going to de-escalate.
*  They were going to de-escalate.
*  You got to be careful. It's a little tricky playing with them.
*  Because they say we're going to do it and they don't do it maybe.
*  But they understood the curse too.
*  It's a curse.
*  It's China's way behind us, but they'll catch us within five years.
*  So let's imagine, let's say you win in November.
*  What do you do differently?
*  And how do you change this course that it seems we are on for World War III?
*  How do you get us out of Ukraine?
*  How do you stop what's going on in the Middle East?
*  How do you put a stop to this?
*  Well, it's a very, to me it's an easy question because I think I can do it easily.
*  But it's a complex question in the sense that the times change.
*  Every day changes.
*  Who's winning?
*  Who's not winning?
*  I mean, Russia is a war machine.
*  Whether you like it or not, it just grinds along, grinds along.
*  You speak to people like Viktor Orban.
*  He'll tell you.
*  It's just a big fat war machine.
*  And that's what's happening.
*  You look at what's happened to Ukraine.
*  If I were there, it would have never happened.
*  But what could you do now?
*  If you get into office in January, what could you do now?
*  Right now, you would get both of them.
*  I know both very well.
*  And again, I do not want to tell you for the purpose of looking smart to five people that
*  say, oh, he was great.
*  Because if I told you exactly what I do, I could never make the deal.
*  All I can tell you is that I would meet with Putin and I would meet with him.
*  And I know exactly what I'd say to each one of them.
*  And I believe that as president-elect, I would get that war stopped and stopped fast.
*  You know, we have tremendous power in the United States, if you know how to use the power.
*  I stopped other wars just by the use of tariffs.
*  I got Macron of France.
*  Good guys, like a friend of mine.
*  But he's a wise guy.
*  And he's a person that likes France.
*  And he was going to tax our companies.
*  I say, and I sent all the smartest guys.
*  I sent Mnuchin.
*  They all failed me.
*  And I said, I'll do it myself.
*  And I called him.
*  I said, Emmanuel, you're taxing American companies.
*  We're not going to allow you to do that.
*  Oh, Donald, I cannot do it.
*  Nothing I could do.
*  It's already been passed.
*  I said, Emmanuel, if you do that, I'm going to put 100 percent tariff when your wines
*  and champagnes are coming to the United States.
*  And you're going to regret that you ever did it.
*  He said, Donald, please, that's not fair.
*  Anyway, within about two minutes, he dropped the whole thing.
*  And it was massive amounts of money against American companies.
*  I have to protect American companies.
*  So why doesn't the Biden administration do this?
*  Because they're incompetent.
*  They don't know how to talk.
*  Look, they met in Alaska with the Chinese.
*  And the Chinese lectured them about how badly we treat people.
*  Right.
*  Okay.
*  I mean, think of it.
*  You remember that day?
*  It was like an American.
*  They didn't talk to me that way.
*  They respected me.
*  They respected our country.
*  They don't respect our country.
*  They don't respect Biden.
*  They don't respect her.
*  They're dreaming about her because she's incompetent.
*  She's not a smart person.
*  Look, she can't put two sentences together.
*  She talks.
*  I watched her two nights.
*  I watched her last night, too.
*  It was the same thing.
*  She's not a smart person.
*  These guys are very smart and they're very streetwise.
*  And they're very tricky and evil and dangerous.
*  And if she becomes the president of the United States,
*  which I can't believe can happen,
*  I don't think this country is going to make it.
*  I don't think we'll ever be.
*  I think just really bad things will happen to our country.
*  And you know what?
*  I look at the outside forces and I say they can all be handled
*  because we have a pot of gold.
*  But we're not going to have that pot of gold to play with anymore.
*  You know, it's a great negotiating thing.
*  I told you I knocked out this massive car company
*  going to take all of our car business from Detroit.
*  I knocked it out just by my rhetoric.
*  Rhetorically, I said they'll never sell a car in here.
*  I'll put tariffs.
*  I don't care.
*  They're 2000 percent.
*  They're never going to build that plant.
*  And it's impossible to apply that same thing to the electronics
*  that we use.
*  One of the things that disturbs me greatly is that all of our phones
*  are made overseas and then some of our phones are made in places like.
*  Yes, and the chips and some of our phones are made in places like Foxconn,
*  where they have nets around the building to keep people from jumping off the roof
*  because they have so many suicides.
*  Like, wouldn't it be better to have an American made iPhone
*  where you know people are paid good wages, they have health insurance,
*  they're taken care of, they can live a good life,
*  where you're not buying a piece of electronics that's cheaper
*  because someone has to suffer a horrible in a horrible way
*  that's not even legal in the United States.
*  It's not even legal to have them work that way in the United States.
*  So they get these people to build them overseas.
*  You do it.
*  But let me just say that chip deal is so bad.
*  We put up billions of dollars for rich companies to come in
*  and borrow the money and build chip companies here.
*  And they're not going to give us the good companies anyway.
*  All you had to do is charge them tariffs.
*  If you would have put a tariff on the chips coming in,
*  you would have been able to just like the auto companies, no different.
*  More sophisticated, but no different.
*  You know, Taiwan, they stole our chip business.
*  Okay, they want us to protect and they want protection.
*  They don't pay us money for the protection, you know.
*  The mob makes you pay money, right?
*  But with these countries that we protect,
*  I got hundreds of billions of dollars from NATO countries
*  that were never paying us.
*  And my biggest fan is Stoltenberg, who just left as the, you know,
*  director general, as a secretary general.
*  Good guy.
*  He said Bush came, he made a speech.
*  Obama came, he made a speech.
*  Trump came, he said, you guys aren't paying, you got to pay.
*  And they said, will you protect us from Russia if we don't?
*  I said, no, you got to pay.
*  If you don't pay, billions of dollars came in to NATO.
*  When I see us paying a lot of money to have people build chip,
*  that's not the way.
*  You didn't have to put up 10 cents.
*  You could have done it with a series of tariffs.
*  In other words, you tariff it so high
*  that they will come and build their chip companies for nothing.
*  In other words, Joe, you put a big tariff on the chips coming in.
*  I say, you don't have to pay the tariff.
*  All you have to do is build your plant in the United States.
*  We didn't have to give them the money to build a plant.
*  Besides that, they're very rich companies, these chip companies.
*  They stole 95% of our business.
*  It's in Taiwan right now.
*  They do a great job.
*  But that's only because we have stupid politicians.
*  We lost the chip business.

*  You can't build it that way.
*  You have to make them spend their money in the United States
*  and those plants would open up all over.
*  And they'll fund them.
*  We don't have to put up 10 cents.
*  And I am in the process of making a huge speech in about a little while.
*  And you and I, how long have we been talking?

*  It's been an honor to have you on as well.
*  I'm going to make a great speech and I'm going to say,
*  and if I'm a little off tonight, I'm going to blame you.
*  Blame me?
*  I spoke to this guy for three hours.
*  Anyway, it's a great honor to be with you.
