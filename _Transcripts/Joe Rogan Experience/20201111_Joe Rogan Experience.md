# Joe Rogan Experience #1562 - Dave Smith
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [November 11, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PrLGhJnO7I)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day.
*  What's up, Joe? Good to be back. Good to see you. Good to see you. What are you doing in town?
*  I came in, I was doing my buddy Scott Horton's show and hanging out with him for a little bit.
*  And you're looking for a place to escape. Yeah, exactly.
*  New York, Schultz told me that New York is like, they just won World War III.
*  People are dancing in the streets.
*  I was there in Union Square the other day, we did a show at the stand, and it was the day they called it for Biden.
*  And as much as I just despise Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, it was kind of nice for the city to just have one.
*  Just to have a day. It's the only day that it's felt happy there since March.
*  Here too, people are honking in the streets. I went to dinner with Tom Segura, he was in town.
*  And we were driving down the streets, people were honking and cheering and people were so happy.
*  I'm happy for people to be happy. Yeah, like that.
*  Even if they're happy for a stupid reason, you're like, at least be happy.
*  It's just, it's too complicated.
*  And you're a guy who knows a lot about politics and the way the world works.
*  But it's too complicated to really go into depth about it for most people.
*  So, so many people just have this sort of cursory understanding of politics and then they follow a narrative.
*  The narrative is Trump is bad, you get him out, Biden's good.
*  And then you go, yeah, well, what about the crime bill? What about the Iraq War? What about this?
*  What about what she did? Nobody wants to hear it. Nobody wants to hear it.
*  All they want to say is the good guys won. Now we're going to go back to being America again.
*  And then Pfizer announces a new vaccine.
*  Well, it would be nice if we could go back to being America again.
*  I think we're still far off from that happening.
*  But you're right that I think most people and this is it's not just politics.
*  It's true with everything in life. Like most people have expertise in very limited areas.
*  And for everything else, you're kind of just trusting what somebody else tells you.
*  Yeah. And especially with politics.
*  So I know very little about it, even though I've read a lot about it.
*  I'm still like, what is all this? You know, there's some fuckery going on.
*  And you know, there's a lot of special interests and there's a lot of money and there's a lot of shenanigans.
*  But it's like to really know how this stuff works, to really understand lobbyists,
*  to really understand how bills get passed, to really understand Congress, to really understand the Senate.
*  You've got a deep dive for years. Yeah. And then you still don't know a lot of it.
*  I mean, you know, you can go based off, say, like what's been declassified that the CIA has been doing.
*  But what do we not know? I mean, there's a whole lot that we don't know.
*  But I think we know enough to go to know that it stinks, that there's a lot of corruption.
*  And in many ways, I think that's what Trump, at least the people who support Trump,
*  saw him as, as the guy who was outside that system, who was kind of fighting for them.
*  I'm not saying that's the truth, but I think that's what a lot of Trump supporters saw in him.
*  Yeah, that was the simplistic comic book version of what Trump was to them.
*  And that's where like that QAnon stuff all comes in.
*  And you know, people thinking that it's really like this plot to stop child molesters.
*  Yeah. Well, and the system is always corrupt enough to give cover to the wildest conspiracy theory.
*  Because they are already like, you could say, OK, well, perhaps, you know, QAnon conspiracy theorists believe some really crazy shit.
*  But then you just go, but look at what happened with this Jeffrey Epstein guy.
*  I mean, there really was this child sex trafficking ring that was covered up.
*  I mean, we have that woman on ABC News who was basically saying, I broke the story and my bosses told me no.
*  I think it was NBC. Was it NBC? Yeah.
*  We broke the story, but you know, they wanted to protect access to the royal family.
*  So we would let a powerful multimillionaire or billionaire child sex trafficking ring leader skate because we wanted access to the royal family.
*  What the fuck, dude?
*  How about that video where the interview where Princess and Prince Andrew?
*  Right. Princess Andrew. Prince. I misgendered him. I'm so sorry.
*  Prince Andrew is on television with that lady and they're asking him questions about whether or not he was there and what happened.
*  And you could see this look in his face like he's never really been questioned before.
*  Yeah. He the fact that he agreed to do is so weird.
*  Like it's almost like he doesn't understand what a trap is.
*  Look, I've never been trapped before. I'm a royal. Yeah.
*  Is he a royal anymore? They kick him out. Something happened.
*  I'm not sure. I'm not sure. They can kick you out. Yeah, they can.
*  They kicked out the the dude who hooked up with the actress. Yeah, he wanted to bail. I think he left.
*  I think he left, too, but he wanted to go back for something. They go, nah, son. You're done.
*  Wasn't there something recent, Jamie? When there's some weird which one's he?
*  Harry or is that a Harry Potter? Am I thinking Harry Potter? I think you're right. It's Harry.
*  Yeah, I think you confuse me with the Harry Potter.
*  I just think it's fucking so preposterous that we literally don't know anything that guy's done other than that he's a prince.
*  Prince Harry saddened and disappointed that his request for Remembrance Day wreath was denied. Oh, no.
*  The Duke of Sussex. You know, we spend a lot of time.
*  Look at that name. Sussex was saddened and disappointed at the decision to snub his request for wreath to be laid out at the National Memorial in London.
*  Man, the level of suffering that he must go through to not get his royal wreath.
*  Prince Andrew did not attend. Yeah, I wonder why. Yeah, I don't think they let him.
*  Decorated war hero. What? Prince Andrew is a decorated war hero? What did he do? That's news to me.
*  High pressed buttons had led to victory. Yeah, I have a feeling the prince wasn't on the front line. They weren't just like throwing him out.
*  He's a Royal Navy helicopter pilot in the war with Argentina to recapture the Falkland Islands in the 1980s and returned as a hero.
*  I didn't even know there was a war with Argentina that 1980s. I remember the Falkland Islands. I remember the name.
*  Yeah, this smells like bullshit to me. I don't believe he's a war hero for a second. I'm a war hero and a royal.
*  I demand a 16 year old girl. Well, when you say it like that, I mean, all right, we'll see what we can get you.
*  It's just amazing that that Epstein guy roped so many people into that shit. It's real weird, man.
*  It's real weird when something that creepy turns out to be true. Yeah, and it's very revealing.
*  I mean, it's like so if you had an honest press, you know, if they weren't every bit as corrupt as those conspiracy theorists think they are,
*  you would think that the fact that, say, like a former president was on his flight logs would have led to a huge scandal where they would really want to get to the bottom of that.
*  You would think right now they'd still want to get to the bottom of that. Like, hey, who else was involved in this? What did it?
*  Now, OK, he was on his plane. We don't know that that means that Bill Clinton was involved in the worst aspects of it.
*  But you would think the press would at least want to find that out. And there's very little interest.
*  No, because the press goes after Bill Clinton, then Hillary Clinton gets somehow or another connected to it.
*  And then that could sink Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. And that's bad for the people that hate Donald Trump.
*  Well, that's for sure.
*  Jeffrey Epstein's Palm Beach, Manchester, to be demolished. Oh, my God.
*  Local real estate developer says he's in contract to buy the waterfront estate and is planning to knock it down and build a new home. That's the smart move.
*  Twenty two million dollar house. Oh, shit. Yeah. Well, it's expensive down there.
*  Meanwhile, it's going to be underwater in like five years, according to Al Gore. Right.
*  I also already left it to a Christian group, which I was trying to find, too.
*  I don't know which one of those two stories. This is in The Wall Street Journal.
*  So I believe that over the he left it to someone.
*  Do you think they just have to knock it down just because it's his? So they kind of have to. Yeah.
*  Do you think it'd be awkward if there was like part of it they wanted to keep?
*  When I was looking at real estate in Boulder, the house where the little girl was killed. What is her name?
*  The little girl who's in the Jomad Ramsey. That house has been for sale forever.
*  They can't sell it. I think they even changed the address.
*  They might have even changed the name of the street trying to sell it.
*  And they just couldn't sell it because I remember we were looking at it like this house is nice.
*  Like, why is it so cheap? It's one of those deals.
*  And then you find out you're like, oh, fuck, because if you can afford a nice house, you'd probably prefer not the one that a little girl was killed in.
*  Nobody wants a house. Yeah.
*  Nobody wants a house. They can do it. The one in New York.
*  It says it's listed at eighty eight million. I'm going to buy it.
*  I'm moving to New York.
*  Moving the show to New York.
*  I'm buying it as long as it comes to the painting of Bill Clinton in the blue dress.
*  I heard it's set up with a lot of equipment, so we should be able to do it.
*  OK, let's do it. Yeah, it streams right to the CIA.
*  You don't even you don't even have to get them to watch you on YouTube.
*  They get a they get a live feed. Yeah, I'm going to buy that house.
*  All right. Fuck it. Why not?
*  It's probably epic. It's probably a really good investment.
*  Probably worth eighty nine million eventually.
*  Yeah. And then 70 or something. So it's already gone up.
*  And then if you try to sell it, it'll be like, oh, this was Joe Rogan's place.
*  It won't have that Epstein, you know, stink on it. Right.
*  I think it's a good move. I support my guy. See if I can make it happen.
*  I wouldn't buy a fucking newsstand in New York City.
*  I don't believe in New York City anymore. I don't.
*  I think that the Blasio guys ruin that place for a solid 10 years.
*  Yeah, I think you're right. I think we got the fans on here. Right.
*  I could smoke the cigar. They were. I'll go double check. OK.
*  Yeah. So that's for sale right now. Gargantuan New York City mansion.
*  Home to Epstein Horrors.
*  Oh, you can rent it. Thirty thousand dollars a month. Yeah. Bam.
*  That's what we need to do. We need to just rent it. Good to do a month of podcast.
*  You know what we should do? We should fill it up with homeless people.
*  And then leave. Just rent it and just let it let homeless people live there.
*  Just tell them we want one room to do the podcast and then we'll have security
*  that makes sure the homeless people don't go in that room.
*  Everything else you do whatever you want.
*  That now that actually sounds like a build a Blasio plan that you're putting into effect.
*  That's more or less progressive. Yeah, it's progressive. Yeah, there you go.
*  Imagine if we did that. They'd probably give you a freaking medal.
*  Build a Blasio would probably celebrate you for doing it.
*  You know, that's not his real name. Yeah, I do know that.
*  It's got a German name. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Very, very weird guy. Oh, he's the weird and really committed to his weird ideology
*  that he wants, you know, like to not just when things get back to normal,
*  they can't get back to the regular normal.
*  It's got to be this more, you know, inclusive normal.
*  And so he's taken it upon himself that he's going to try to remake New York City
*  in his progressive image while the city is going through the worst year
*  it's been through in my lifetime. He's an odd duck.
*  I don't know how he got there.
*  I don't obviously I don't live there, so I don't understand it.
*  But New York City, tell me if this is true.
*  But I'm pretty sure, Jamie, that one percent of the people in New York City pay 50 percent of the taxes.
*  That sounds reasonable. Yeah.
*  The fact that you could piss those people off and still be mayor is hilarious.
*  Yeah. Like how does?
*  Well, they still only get one vote each.
*  So, you know, that's kind of the way it works. That's cute.
*  Well, you just said it's cute. Like it really works that way.
*  It's just one person, one vote. That's it.
*  No one has any additional influence at all.
*  Well, no, but I'm just saying that if you can win elections by playing to the other big to other people
*  and also that, you know, some of those people kind of like the progressive look at this.
*  Look at this statistic. It's bananas.
*  The highest earning one percent of New York City residents generated 43 percent of the city income taxes
*  and 51 percent of the New York state income taxes collected from individuals living in the city as of 2016.
*  That's crazy. So much money.
*  And then you hear all this stuff about paying your fair share.
*  And it's like, so where exactly does that come in? Is that not enough?
*  Well, it's like L.A., right?
*  It's like a lot of people felt like even though the taxes were exorbitant, it was worth it because L.A.
*  pre-COVID was pretty badass.
*  You know, the Comedy Store for us, like obviously I'm comedy centric, but the Comedy Store was open.
*  The restaurants were amazing. There's so much so many things to do.
*  You know, it's just yeah, it's crowded. But the people are cool as fuck.
*  It's like there's a lot of good things. And then as soon as COVID hit, everybody was like, why are we here?
*  Yeah. Like, why am I paying so much?
*  And then they start talking about raising the taxes to 16 plus 16 plus percent state taxes.
*  That's more than I give my agent.
*  Right. You imagine? Yeah.
*  It's crazy. Well, and it's I think that also happened, I think even more so in New York, because when the you know,
*  like New York, it's the same thing. It's like, well, it's expensive.
*  You pay a ton for your rent or to own or whatever.
*  But, you know, it's like the best museums, the best nightlife, the best food, the best all these things.
*  But then all of a sudden, when the lockdowns hit, now people are like locked down in a one bedroom apartment that they could get a house for.
*  Yeah. You know, anywhere else in the country.
*  And a lot of people started to re question, why am I here?
*  And people started looking real pale.
*  A lot of my friends that live there, they would go out very rarely.
*  And when you see them, they'd be like real sunken in and like that is the worst look for your immune system.
*  I mean, you're not getting any vitamin D. Yeah. You're not out there at all.
*  Well, that's the terrible irony of this whole thing, right?
*  Is that it really ended up fucking over so many people's immune systems, because the worst thing you could do,
*  like the best thing you could do for covid is have your immune system in good shape.
*  Yeah. And the worst thing you could do for your immune system is like stay inside all day, be in a constant state of anxiety.
*  Don't get sun. Don't get fresh air. Eat like shit.
*  Drink too much. You know, everything.
*  And have no money. Yeah. Right.
*  Because you're out of work. So the incredible pressure on you. Yeah.
*  And I mean, we may never know exactly what the total human cost of all of that was,
*  but we'll we'll get more of a sense of it over the next few years.
*  Yeah, it's it's it's sort of a disingenuous argument because they're comparing the total cost of the lockdown to the lost lives because of the pandemic.
*  The problem is, if there wasn't a lockdown, the loss of lives would be far greater.
*  And so you're comparing it to a different thing.
*  Well, you know, because it's sure it shouldn't lock down.
*  No one should have ever locked down. But if they didn't lock down, how many more people would have died?
*  It's a real good question. No, it's it's very it's a lot of people like to make this a simplistic calculation.
*  And it's an enormously complicated one because there's many different variables on both sides.
*  So how many lives were saved by locking down?
*  I think it's very debatable. I don't really know that it's a but I don't claim to know.
*  I think for sure it was some quite possibly.
*  But then you'd also have to look just first apples to apples how many lives were cost from the lockdown.
*  And I've read stuff I was reading the other day.
*  It was in England, but I'm sure the same is true here that cancer screenings have like plummeted over the last year.
*  So now there's going to be all types of preventable cancers that are going to we won't know this for years if we can ever really trace it back.
*  But a whole bunch of people die from that.
*  Depression has been way up. You know, suicides seem to be going up.
*  There's all these different costs.
*  And then, of course, what is the cost?
*  The human cost of destroying people's livelihoods.
*  And it's very, very hard to weigh these things out.
*  And as you pointed out, you'd have to weigh it versus the cost of lives without the lockdown.
*  Not necessarily with.
*  But it's a it's like with a lot of these other issues, people like to make it a very simplistic.
*  Well, if you want to prevent the virus, you have to be for the solution.
*  Right. Same with like climate change.
*  If you want to prevent climate change, you got to be for the Green New Deal.
*  But the truth is that the real answer is like, well, what is this going to cost?
*  First, what is this going to cost?
*  And which one is worse? Yeah.
*  Which is sucks because you have to think.
*  Well, it's really important to have lively debate on these things.
*  And one of the things that's going on now is people are trying to shut down debate.
*  They want you to agree with their side.
*  And this is something that social media is really reinforced, right?
*  Like social media echo chambers.
*  They want you to be on their side.
*  And if you're not on their side, they just hit you with a bunch of bullshit about why you shouldn't.
*  Why you're on the wrong side of history and why you're a bad person.
*  And we were talking before the podcast about lists that people are making about people who supported Donald Trump or people who voted for Donald Trump or people who worked in the administration.
*  They're making these lists and like literally blacklists.
*  Like they have no irony about suggesting these blacklists.
*  Like you're you're going to Soviet Russia type shit.
*  Like this is right.
*  And meanwhile, Joe Biden is saying in his acceptance speech that, you know, well, now's the time to bring everybody together.
*  You know, like we all need to be one.
*  Yada yada, which is kind of a nice thought.
*  But it's it's a little hard to take seriously when all of these people in your party and who have been supporting you have been calling everybody else on the other side.
*  You know, white supremacists, Nazis for the last four years.
*  So now that you're claiming you won, say, hey, we all have to come together.
*  Meanwhile, other members of your party are saying we got to create lists of people.
*  So like this.
*  Well, he said it.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  A pretty influential member.
*  Very.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, she's made herself like huge.
*  She's going to be president.
*  I don't know about that.
*  She could do it.
*  She's not very popular outside of her district.
*  I don't know about that.
*  I think with young people, she represents like this this idea that someone like her young, hardworking, out there hustling seriously progressive values that you can get pretty far and certainly in the public eye.
*  Well, you certainly can do what she's doing.
*  I mean, she's proved that like you could go to a very blue district and and primary, one of the most establishment Democrats and rise to national prominence.
*  So she did that.
*  I don't know right now in the country.
*  I think AOC would have a really tough time getting elected on a national level.
*  But maybe she's only 30.
*  That's insane.
*  Yeah.
*  So she's got a lot of time.
*  Boy, when I was 30, I was so fucking stupid.
*  It's kind of amazing.
*  Nothing.
*  I'm not that stupid now.
*  I'm fairly stupid now.
*  But boy, when I was 30, I was dumb.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, she has a little bit of that, too.
*  Well, everybody does.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, Bridget Phetasy.
*  Bridget Phetasy read some of her writing that she wrote when she was 24.
*  She's like, oh, my God, I was basically AOC.
*  She's like, I was such a lefty.
*  I was so delusional.
*  She goes.
*  And now I'm just so much more of a realist.
*  My worry about this Biden thing is that people voted for Biden because they hate Trump.
*  They didn't vote for Biden because he's a leader that they respect and they want and they admire.
*  And he's going to lead us out of it.
*  Like if Obama was calling for unity, if he was the guy that was the president and he was calling for unity, we've got to abandon all these ideas about division.
*  We're all together.
*  And he brought everybody together again.
*  That might work.
*  That might work.
*  People might recognize that this really intelligent guy with this message of unity should be listened to.
*  Well, but that did happen.
*  Right.
*  I mean, that happened in 2008.
*  That's what Obama said when he won.
*  And there was some a decent amount of unity.
*  I think he had over 70 percent approval rating when he first came in.
*  I mean, it wasn't certainly anything like the country is now.
*  Right.
*  But at the end of eight years of Obama, you had a Republican House, a Republican Senate and Donald fucking Trump elected president.
*  So we had that.
*  But it didn't matter because even with such a charismatic guy like Obama calling for unity and saying a lot of the right things, at least at first, the policies and what was actually happening in the country were really fucking over huge numbers of people.
*  And then also things that might have been somewhat out of Obama's control, but not completely out, is that the era of it was like like the Obama recovery.
*  Which was the most like cronies corrupt recovery ever.
*  And the woke lecturing all rose up at the same time in the Obama years.
*  Not all of it his fault, but some of it is.
*  Do you see that Kamala Harris has her gender pronouns in her bio?
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  She's I saw her say that in a CNN town hall when she was still running for president.
*  She came out and just no one even asked her.
*  She just went on Kamala Harris.
*  My genders are she her.
*  No.
*  What the fuck is this?
*  No.
*  What is going on?
*  No.
*  Do you see what Janis Papas wrote?
*  No.
*  He wrote my gender is he her.
*  He's like, I'm going to start a trend here.
*  I recognize his he her.
*  That's great.
*  I might take that on too.
*  I might I might do that.
*  He her.
*  I like it.
*  It's a very strange, strange.
*  There it is.
*  It's in his bio.
*  He her.
*  He her science scientist and journalist, he wrote.
*  Ah, that's fucking great.
*  It's hilarious.
*  I think though people like they if you really did care about unity or whatever, which I
*  think is like something that maybe we should care about a little bit.
*  I mean, not that we all have to like agree on everything.
*  I don't like this.
*  We don't have to all be one and all have the same, you know, attitude about everything.
*  But when you see what's going on in the country over this year, the culture war shit is really
*  scary.
*  And like people should be appropriately concerned about that.
*  When you see what's going on and like was going on in Portland this year where you had
*  like the fucking, you know, like like militias facing off against each other.
*  You have like the Antifa versus the Proud Boys type shit.
*  It's like we're it's like they're playing pretend civil war.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, like it's kind of a game.
*  They're larping.
*  Right.
*  It's like they got shot off.
*  You know what I mean?
*  We got shot and killed.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And there are people on guns staring each other down and for everybody for every sane
*  person should be like, you do not want to see a civil war in this fucking country.
*  I don't care how much fun you think this is right now in the moment.
*  You don't want this to actually come to you holding your buddy's head while he bleeds
*  out and screams for his mom.
*  Like you don't want that.
*  So the idea of toning that down is a good idea.
*  But I think the only way to do that is to understand why Donald Trump was president
*  to begin with.
*  And that like to me, the big story of all of this isn't that Joe Biden looks like he's
*  going to be the president.
*  That's kind of boring to me.
*  It's like, yeah, Joe Biden got elected.
*  He's been getting elected for fucking almost 50 years.
*  Like, OK, the story is still that Donald Trump won the presidency and then it four years
*  later got like millions more votes than he got the first time and almost by the by a
*  hair almost won it again.
*  I mean, that's like pretty fucking crazy.
*  Did you see when he was in Pennsylvania and he drew 53000 people to his rally in central
*  Pennsylvania?
*  And they start off the first like four minutes of it are a chant.
*  We love you.
*  We love you.
*  I mean, like what the fuck is that?
*  What's going on here?
*  And to just kind of dismiss it like the corporate press attitude is like, well, it's racism.
*  I think there's a little bit more failure of the education system.
*  I mean, I always I always agree with failure of the education system.
*  That is always an acceptable answer.
*  But I think a big rejection of looting, it's a rejection of the woke culture.
*  It's a rejection of being called a racist and being called a fascist.
*  That's a big part of it.
*  It's a lot of the what this this call for a radical shift in the identity of America.
*  Well, I think that's a huge part of it.
*  I also think that if you're the woke lecturing is almost like just the insult on top.
*  Like if you're one of these people who lives in these towns, you've seen for decades now
*  like factories disappear, jobs get outsourced, the life expectancy has gone down, suicides
*  have gone up. You know, you're one of these some guy in central Pennsylvania or all over the country.
*  And what you know, you probably lost your job.
*  Now you're working a shittier job.
*  You never really came back from where you were after 2008.
*  Maybe you got a son who's addicted to opioids.
*  You got another son who, like, you know, has never been the same since he got back from one of these stupid wars.
*  And then after all that, the people who sent you there are now lecturing you about your white privilege.
*  And then Donald Trump, all it really took was Donald Trump came in and said, you know what?
*  I'm for you. Yeah, I'm for you.
*  I'm not for the Mexicans or the Muslims. I'm not for this woke shit.
*  I'm for you. And I want you to win.
*  It's a simplistic message. Sure.
*  And that's one of the things that he got across.
*  He boiled down the whole thing to like make America great again.
*  That's a simplistic message.
*  And to people that want to sort of like they really, you know, some some country music songs.
*  By the way, I'm a fan of country music.
*  I like a lot of country music, but a lot of country music I don't like because I know what you're doing.
*  You're just trying to box everything into this real simple.
*  We're going to go down to the lake.
*  We're going to have ourselves a drink.
*  You know, like, you know, I'm saying we're going to take my truck.
*  Everything's going to be great.
*  You know, I miss my grandma.
*  Like, there's like this simplistic, really boiled down worldview.
*  And it comforts people because people are scared of nuance and they're scared of they're scared of the complexity of life.
*  Yes. And Donald Trump was a master at that.
*  Yeah. Boiling things down to a real simple slogan, a real, you know, simple phrase that that people can wrap their heads around and get behind.
*  But there's also that on the opposition to Trump side where they try to boil things down to like, well, it was racism or it was white supremacy or something like that.
*  And you're like, there's a lot more going on here.
*  And I really think that if like they're these people on some level recognize that they've been screwed over by the establishment, forgotten by them, and that they they are hated by by the establishment, which is true.
*  Like they're right about that.
*  And so they wanted someone to fight for them.
*  And I think Trump represents that to them.
*  I don't think he really was that from my perspective.
*  I think he's kind of a con artist.
*  But I do think that he tapped into something that's really powerful and that actually could get a lot worse if there's not some kind of like reconciling with it.
*  Yeah. How does it get better now?
*  That's the real question.
*  Like, because what like how does it get better with Biden and Kamala Harris?
*  I mean, unless people start rejecting, unless people realize that things aren't going to change for the better with them in office.
*  Well, that's I think that is that realization is going to come about a year and a half.
*  Yeah, something like that.
*  Maybe maybe even sooner because things go, you know, things move fast these days.
*  But I do think that one of the things that's interesting with Biden and Kamala Harris is that a lot of these like super progressive people are celebrating right now because Trump was out, you know, and so Trump was defeated.
*  And they feel like they helped get Biden and Kamala Harris in, which is they were certainly a portion of helping them.
*  And then Trump also is the one who is saying like, well, you know, Joe Biden, he's just a Trojan horse for AOC and Ilhan Omar.
*  He's he's a Trojan horse for socialism, which is actually complete bullshit.
*  Joe Biden, if anything, is a Trojan horse for Dick Cheney.
*  Joe Biden is a Trojan horse for the establishment.
*  Warhawks, big banks, corporate elite, tech giants, all of those.
*  Yeah, it's going to be them.
*  He's filling his cabinet with Republicans.
*  But those Republicans, but those Republicans, the ones who basically caused this whole mess to begin with.
*  One of the things that Trump said during his campaign, he's saying talking about how much money that Joe Biden raised, he said, I could raise that money, too.
*  But I'd have to make those deals and then I'd have to be compromised.
*  And when he was saying that, I was like, he's right.
*  He's not wrong about that.
*  He's not wrong about that, because if he decided to play ball with all those guys, like they would have got behind him.
*  And the narrative would have switched.
*  Yeah, that's for sure.
*  And it's interesting.
*  It's a really important question that people might want to ponder.
*  Even people who really hate Donald Trump.
*  And you can really hate Donald Trump.
*  That's fine.
*  But you might wonder why it is that the establishment hates him so much.
*  And I have, like, my guess is that it's not for the same reasons that your left-wing friend hates Donald Trump.
*  Like, I don't buy for a fucking second that the CIA and the Republican establishment hated Donald Trump because he said mean things about Mexicans.
*  I just don't buy that for a fucking second.
*  These are people who will slaughter brown people in third world countries and lose no sleep over it.
*  Like, I don't buy that's why they hated him.
*  I think what they hated about Donald Trump was that he was a wild man who would blurt out things and he'd blurt out a lot of crazy shit.
*  But then he'd also blurt out the truth.
*  And that was something that nobody, you're not supposed to say that.
*  Like, when Donald Trump was running in 2016, you know, he stood at the Republican primary debate stage in South Carolina, Republicans in South Carolina, and looked at Jeb Bush in the eyes and said, your brother lied us into war in Iraq.
*  And everyone was like, what the fuck?
*  Like, you can't say that at the Republican South Carolina and all the pundits, all the media class.
*  They were like Trump's finished now because you can't.
*  These are the people who fought the war in Iraq.
*  And these are the most pro-military people around.
*  And the next day at the at the primary, Donald Trump took 60 percent at all the other Republicans, all 12 of them split the other 40 percent.
*  Imagine if he didn't say a lot of the dumb shit that he said, like the shit about McCain.
*  Like, I like people don't get caught.
*  Imagine he didn't say that.
*  Imagine he didn't say the dumbest shit, the dumbest shit that he said.
*  Remember the Gold Star family, the family where the Khan family?
*  Yes. Yeah.
*  Where he would he criticize the family about some forget what the exact it was.
*  They spoke at the DNC.
*  And then he started trashing them.
*  Yes.
*  And their son died representing this country in war.
*  And everybody was like, well, you can't.
*  That's it.
*  He's done.
*  Nope. Wasn't.
*  Nope. Wasn't done.
*  Imagine if he didn't do that.
*  Well, by the way, when that happened, I remember just screaming about this on my podcast was I was just like the response was right there.
*  And it took him like four days.
*  But eventually he did get it right where he was just like, yeah, they died in a war that Hillary Clinton supported.
*  That's the response.
*  Is this a new one?
*  Trump suggests Gold Star families may be to blame for his infection.
*  I think it was the second thing.
*  Oh, yeah. No, this is a different thing than what we were.
*  This is new.
*  The president who is counting on support from military members and their families suggests that for a second time a week that he that they might have spread the coronavirus at the White House.
*  Also, this is different Gold Star families.
*  Oh, that's the only president.
*  But hold on a second.
*  Is that a real direct quote?
*  The problem is I don't.
*  Yeah, you got to ask New York Times.
*  New York Times has gone full woke.
*  They want to hug me and they want to kiss me.
*  And they do, frankly.
*  I'm not telling them back up.
*  I'm not doing it.
*  But I did say it's obviously dangerous.
*  All right.
*  That's not exactly blaming them.
*  Yeah, that's not the same thing.
*  He just taught telling the truth.
*  Yeah.
*  See, that's the other thing, too.
*  This this quote that they keep is that they keep reiterating this thing.
*  He had disparaged American troops who died in wars as losers and suckers.
*  Is there the but they're saying this in quotes.
*  Yes, because it was quoted by some anonymous source who claims that he said that.
*  Yeah, but that is how do you do that?
*  Multiple sources.
*  See, but you can say that you can say multiple sources.
*  But unless the people go on record, it seems like a very disingenuous thing to say.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, did you see the one the guy who was right?
*  Isn't that my wrong?
*  Oh, no, you're absolutely right.
*  Did you see the guy who revealed his identity, who was the guy who was behind that New York
*  Times story?
*  Yeah.
*  And not a high level.
*  Yeah, anonymous.
*  They said high level executive.
*  And then there were all these people in the media speculating and they were like, well,
*  the New York Times wouldn't do this unless this was a really high level person.
*  It was basically like wink wink.
*  This might be Pence.
*  This might be, you know, Jared Kushner.
*  This could be anybody saying the shit.
*  And then it turns out it's like, oh, this was like some guy who was once a chief of
*  staff at the Department of Homeland Security.
*  Now, I'm not saying that's nothing, but it's not at all what you were kind of making people
*  think.
*  So I think it's a very shady way to do journalism.
*  And that's one of the things that I think is like one of the bright spots of the Trump
*  administration.
*  One of the best things that he was able to draw out was how agenda driven the corporate
*  press is.
*  And you can agree with their agenda on hating Donald Trump.
*  Maybe that's how you feel.
*  But it's still something to everybody knows now that they are agenda driven.
*  They're not here.
*  Like, we just give you the information.
*  They're activists.
*  Yes.
*  That's the rise of the activist journalist is.
*  I understand from their perspective that they feel like they have this platform to do a
*  good thing.
*  But I feel like you do the best thing by telling the cold hard facts and letting people who
*  are actually advocates or actually advocates, activists rather, do the activist work with
*  those cold hard facts.
*  I have no problem with that.
*  If you want to be an activist, go be an activist.
*  But just be honest.
*  As a journalist, though, I think it's very it's real slippery when you do things like that,
*  like those quotes, losers and suckers.
*  Unless you know who said it, unless they're willing to go on record and say, I heard him say it,
*  then you don't necessarily have a story.
*  It's not the same.
*  And how did he say it?
*  Yes.
*  What was the?
*  And particularly if he denies it.
*  So if you know, like if I were to just say, oh, Joe told me this thing last month and you go,
*  I never said that.
*  You can't just run with it and quote that you said it because you have no way of knowing.
*  The grab them by the pussy thing.
*  That's you heard it.
*  Right.
*  Well, that was real.
*  That was there.
*  Right.
*  So anything else that's it's just so strange.
*  I know I understand their position that they're coming from this place where they feel like
*  they can do a lot of good.
*  They can change opinions and they feel like the country is going in a bad direction.
*  And they felt like with Donald Trump, this country is sliding into this horrible fascist state
*  and they want to do everything they can to prevent it.
*  And they have the green light from all the other people that are there.
*  But like all this stuff, these lessons that have been learned in the past about why it's so important
*  to be totally honest and unbiased in terms of disseminating information.
*  Like you have to kind of do that.
*  And then other people are supposed to take that information that you've disseminated unbiased
*  and have these perspectives and debate both sides.
*  That's what's supposed to happen.
*  The problem is when you get this distorted perception from the media that's very biased
*  and that is not objective at all.
*  It's like you're trying to lean towards a very particular conclusion that they think is right.
*  They think it's the good thing.
*  But when you do that, then you don't have you don't have a re like who is the Walter Mondale
*  or who's not Walter Mondale, Walter Cronkite.
*  Who is the who is the unbiased journalist?
*  Who's the one that we trust for information?
*  It used to be the New York Times.
*  The New York Times used to be like brutally honest about basically everything.
*  And now you read something in the New York Times like we did when you're all it's New York Times.
*  So yeah, like that's a weird shift that's happened in the last 10 years.
*  Like less. Yeah.
*  But right. Well, yeah, I mean, it's definitely been like exposed in the last 10 years.
*  But I think that truthfully, I think it's kind of a silver lining that at least people are starting to be aware of that.
*  People are starting to go like, OK, I know that these institutions are not to be trusted because truthfully speaking,
*  they got, you know, it's like I was saying to you before we started where it's like for all the shit that people give Alex Jones,
*  he got all of the biggest stories right over the last 20 years.
*  And I'm not saying he didn't get anything wrong, but really, really big things like should we go to war in Iraq?
*  Should we bail out bankers? Should all of this? He called these as lies and corruption right away.
*  And the New York Times was selling all of these.
*  I mean, they sold the war in Iraq. And so it's to me, it's not the worst thing in the world if people at least recognize that these institutions are completely compromised.
*  And I agree with you that there is a role for objective journalism, but I would at least accept if they were like, hey, listen, we think like what you just said.
*  We think we have this platform and we need to use this to get Donald Trump not elected.
*  At least be honest with it. Don't bullshit me and tell me we're just doing objective news.
*  And every single story is about how Donald Trump is, you know, needs to be taken out.
*  They don't even address it. They don't say they're doing objective news anymore. They just do their thing.
*  Well, they call other news fake news. So they'll say the New York Times doesn't.
*  Well, the New York Times may not. But I'm speaking in the corporate press in general.
*  They'll say like, well, there's fake news out on the Internet.
*  And even the New York Times has done stories about how social media companies need to do more to, you know, combat fake news on the Internet and things like that.
*  But they're talking about like super hardcore QAnon type shit, aren't they?
*  Well, kind of. I mean, it starts with that. And then they'll use that as an example.
*  But then usually they also go to other things like, look, this this this New York Post story about Hunter Biden's laptop was called fake news from the day it came out to the point that not only would all of the corporate press not report on it,
*  but that social media companies were banning the link and Twitter froze the New York Post's Twitter account.
*  One of the CNN journalists on Twitter called it Russian disinformation.
*  Yes. There's a bunch of people called it Russian disinformation.
*  I wonder if it was Russian disinformation. The the photo of the girl giving him a foot job.
*  Yes. Was that Russian? That was all she was Russian and the foot was Russian.
*  It was a Russian foot job. What happened to that?
*  I kind of lost track of what was happening with the laptop, but they like have they shared information of it?
*  Rudy Giuliani sold it on eBay.
*  What's going on at the landscaping thing? Made a killing.
*  At the Four Seasons landscaping thing.
*  I don't know. This this is the thing that's going on.
*  There's almost like too much information is coming at us.
*  Well, look, it's basically been verified that this was Hunter Biden's laptop.
*  I mean, within any reasonable standard for for a journalist to verify something, I mean, number one, the Bidens didn't deny it.
*  Like nobody actually came out and denied that this was they had his signature at the repair shop, which they matched up to his signature.
*  They've had other people on the email chains confirm that they were these were emails between them and Hunter Biden.
*  So it's been pretty reasonably kind of verified that this was Hunter Biden.
*  Now, I don't know about the crazier accusations that were made there.
*  I mean, Rudy Giuliani said that there were pictures of underage girls and stuff like that.
*  I don't know if that's true or not.
*  But Rudy Giuliani did turn it over to the Delaware police.
*  That is true because the Delaware, a spokesman for the attorney general, said that they received the laptop and that they sent it to the FBI.
*  Now, I don't know why they would he would turn this over claiming this stuff was on there and then they would send this to the FBI if there wasn't something.
*  But I don't know. I don't know.
*  But what you do know, right, is that this was a story where they had these emails about Hunter Biden, who is very clearly a swamp creature, who was selling his father's name to rake in money from foreign companies.
*  Now, truth be told, that's a kind of run of the mill scandal as far as politics go.
*  It's normal.
*  Every senator's kid, family, wife, they all do stuff like this all the time.
*  It's a corrupt swamp, you know, but it's a story nonetheless.
*  It may not be the but to but to just make the conscious decision that we are a few weeks out from presidential election.
*  This can harm Biden and therefore we're not mentioning it.
*  We're not covering it.
*  We're not trying to debunk this to a bunch of people.
*  We are trying to make sure people never get their eyes on this.
*  Well, I think they felt the heat.
*  They felt the heat from 2016 from the Hillary Clinton email debate.
*  You know, whether or not she should have deleted those emails and that the fact that Comey then opens up the investigation again in the middle of the campaign.
*  And that was basically what a lot even though she won the popular vote, a lot of people felt like that was that was a bad move.
*  And so this year they said we're going to do everything we can to get rid of Donald Trump.
*  Again, they become activists instead of just journalists.
*  Yeah, that's it's tricky.
*  Well, that's 100 percent what happened.
*  I mean, they felt in a way that they were responsible for Donald Trump winning.
*  X Hunter Biden Associates records don't show proof of Biden business relationship amid unanswered questions.
*  Some Fox News.
*  Well, Fox News has taken a turn, ladies and gentlemen.
*  They are they seem to have made a conscious internal decision to not favor Donald Trump anymore.
*  I don't think Fox News was ever that behind Donald Trump.
*  I mean, there's a few people at Fox News who are hardcore behind Donald Trump.
*  But as an organization, I mean, remember, they were very hostile to him in the Republican primary.
*  He wasn't the Fox News guy.
*  Jeb Bush was the Fox News guy.
*  And he I think a lot of people were very happy are very happy to get rid of him.
*  Let me see that article again.
*  This is interesting.
*  I wonder what that means.
*  X Hunter Biden Associates records don't show.
*  But what does that mean?
*  So they don't.
*  But it's just but listen to this.
*  X Hunter Biden Associates records don't show proof of Biden business relationship amid unanswered questions.
*  That doesn't mean much.
*  No. Well, what he claimed was that and they're saying Joe Biden that he couldn't prove Joe Biden was it's a very confusing title because he claimed that he had met with Joe Biden and Joe Biden was aware of all the dealings that that Hunter was doing.
*  Here it is.
*  Fox News has revealed email reviewed emails from that name.
*  Bobolinski related to the venture and they don't show that the elder Biden had business dealings.
*  Yeah. But see, I could that's that's weird.
*  Like, you know, we could say that Jamie is my business associate.
*  Right.
*  And if I'm involved in some shady shit and Jamie doesn't know about it and Jamie and I are emailing back and forth and they get into Jamie's emails and they say X Joe Rogan's business associate doesn't show any association making the claim.
*  Is that this is the evidence is the emails that they're like, hey, we found some emails and emails say this and now they're sent this file according to Fox News or like that does.
*  That's not what they say.
*  Right. But the emails to who is it to that guy?
*  Because if it's not to that guy, then this is not relative.
*  And then they're playing games with words like I would have to read what exactly they're saying.
*  What exactly he's saying.
*  Part of the problem, too.
*  I've looked a couple of times.
*  I've that's what I sort of just looking again where normally this shit gets leaked.
*  You know, like when all the celebrities got their fucking iCloud leaked, all those pictures hit the Internet instantly and you could find them all over the place.
*  These emails are have like barely been seen by I feel like anybody.
*  Well, these emails were I believe he turned these over to the FBI.
*  So I don't know, you know, where they would leak from, not to say that they couldn't leak.
*  But I think the point of this article is that what he claimed with this Bobolinski guy claimed was that Joe Biden himself was very involved in all the business deals that that Hunter and him were doing and that his emails couldn't prove that because they you know, the thing was they said they had these references to like the big guy and stuff like that, but that they couldn't prove that that that Joe Biden knew about this.
*  But he's claiming whether this is true or not, he's claiming that he's met Joe Biden several times and they've talked about it.
*  And Joe Biden was well aware of what Hunter Biden was doing and where he was making his money from.
*  Again, I think it's kind of run of the mill political scandal that that aspect of it.
*  Yeah. The bigger thing is like that.
*  This goes on all over the place.
*  Right. I mean, all over the fucking place like the the the conflicts of interest, the corruption.
*  You see where Obama, you know, what spoke after he's president, we get like four hundred thousand dollars or something like that for a speech in front of bankers.
*  And he was the guy who like presided over the bank bailout.
*  And then you get out and it's like, oh, here's what the bankers really just wanted to hear Barack Obama speak.
*  I mean, he's a good speaker, but come on, man.
*  Like, what's going on?
*  Hillary got a lot of those, too.
*  Oh, yeah. So bill tons of them.
*  That's where they make the bulk of their money.
*  Right. When they get out of the office, then they do these speeches.
*  Yeah.
*  Which is kind of hilarious.
*  Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton, I believe the ballpark numbers, they left the White House.
*  They were like Net Worth was around four million dollars.
*  And then it was like well over one hundred million dollars by 2016.
*  So they made a lot of money after we just made today.
*  U.S. plan sale of F-35 fighter jets to UAE and twenty three billion dollar arms deal.
*  Trump administration. Yep.
*  They're saying that I was reading today.
*  They're saying he's making a bunch of deals now on his way out.
*  Oh, sure.
*  That a plan to sell 50 advanced F-35 fighters to the United Arab Emirates as a part of a broader arms deal worth more than twenty three billion.
*  That's the weird thing about someone on the way out.
*  They can do so much.
*  Well, I don't know that he's on the way out.
*  I mean, he's you don't think he's on the way out.
*  Well, yeah, he's he's almost certainly on the way out, but he's going to fight it.
*  Yeah. But do you know how insanely difficult it is to prove, first of all, to prove that there's voter fraud and then to prove there's enough voter fraud where they could overturn it?
*  It's it's incredibly difficult.
*  And it's not just that he would have to do that.
*  He'd have to do that in a few different states.
*  And so it's an incredibly difficult task.
*  But it's pretty interesting.
*  This is unlike anything I've ever seen before where you have one president just saying like, no, this was bullshit and I'm going to fight it legally.
*  And another thing that I thought was really weird from the press is that they so there I saw it twice now was on MSNBC and CNN,
*  where he was giving a press conference talent saying how the votes were stolen from him and the system was unfair.
*  And they cut away. They say we will not show this because he's lying.
*  And then just the other day on Fox News, Neil Cavuto cut away from Trump's press secretary saying there was voter fraud.
*  And he goes, well, you know, we can't verify that. So we can't air this on.
*  And it's like, look, man, whatever you want to say, this is a story.
*  Right. The fact that the president is claiming voter fraud is a story.
*  So air this and then debunk it afterward.
*  But what is this thing where you go, no, we won't show people. Right.
*  You can't see this story because the lies could poison you or something.
*  What if it's proven to be true? What if there is voter fraud?
*  Well, there is. It's a question of how widespread it is because there's always voter fraud, which is another secret that they don't fucking like to tell.
*  But there's always fucking some degree of voter fraud.
*  Do you find it odd that everybody insists that it's impossible to vote like safely and accurately online?
*  Yes, I find that odd. I also find it really, really odd that we overhaul the way we do voting in this country and that now it's almost an entirely different process where both candidates are getting way more votes than they would normally get.
*  And it's just very weird. There were a lot of things that were weird about this election, like the actual logistics of it.
*  It doesn't seem like if we can bank online, we should be able to vote online.
*  It doesn't seem like if you could use like Apple Pay or Samsung Pay or something like that and go buy something, you know, you use your fingerprint.
*  Yeah. And it registers your fingerprint. And then you could you could buy a house.
*  Yeah. Right. I mean, if you I mean, how much can you spend on Apple Pay? Does it have a limit?
*  It's not about like that. It's the ease for everyone. Not everybody has that access.
*  They need to get the shit together. Everyone get it together like they had the day of the elections.
*  They were supposed to where I'm from in Columbus, Franklin County. They were supposed to have like registration via iPads or something.
*  And that morning they were not confident that everything got downloaded. So they just scrapped the whole thing, went back to paper.
*  It's like that day. So it's not also a problem with these weird deadlines.
*  Like we have to choose the leader in the free world in 20 hours. Ready? Go. Yeah.
*  Like what? Is this a big important thing? Like do we really want to boil this down to 20 hours?
*  Well, the whole process is fucking retarded. Like the whole thing about it, the whole thing that it's like.
*  So we the system is that we have to basically like 10,000 votes in Wisconsin is going to determine which half of the country is furious and which half is like elated
*  because they get to rule over the other half now. And then hopefully in four years they can be happy and you're miserable because they get to rule over you now.
*  It's so bizarre. Democracy in general is a very bizarre process to have it in a country this big with this powerful of a government.
*  It makes it insane. Like we're going to determine the course of history based off what a few votes in swing states determine.
*  There's got to be a better way. I was reading this thing about Plato.
*  Excuse me about Socrates. Socrates was he was talking about how he didn't like the idea of democracy because Socrates felt like in order to make really important choices,
*  you should almost have to prove your understanding of these issues. And that this if it wasn't the case, I'm pretty sure Socrates. Look, look that up just in case.
*  Thank you. Because he saw the like what we basically have like there's a lot of people that were on the ballot in California.
*  I was like, what is this guy doing? What does he want? I didn't know much about them. And I was like, hmm, does that sound right?
*  I mean, I'm looking at this thing for an hour, right? I've got an hour to go and then I can Google some of these bills. Right.
*  And that's just me. How many people didn't? I mean, I gave a very cursory review of these ideas. How many people didn't at all?
*  This one. Blue all across the board or red all across the board. Oh, yeah. The majority. I'd say just guessing.
*  But I'd say the majority of people just vote their team and just don't even really look into it that much.
*  But democracy was never democracy was kind of considered like a joke before World War One.
*  The idea of I mean, there weren't too many like functioning democracies. And that I think that all changed with like Woodrow Wilson.
*  We're going to make the world safe for democracy. We're going to overthrow all of these monarchs in Europe, which Europe was mostly monarchs at the time.
*  And they and that ended. And then after that, you had the rise of like Lenin and Hitler and later Stalin and, you know, things that were much worse than the monarchies that they replaced.
*  But just in pure philosophy, like the idea that if 51 percent of people vote for something or somebody that then it's completely morally legitimate for them to rule over the other 49 percent is is completely absurd.
*  But what's the what's the alternative? Well, I mean, look, I think the alternative to all of this is liberty, which is the best answer, which is just basically that whether it's the right thing to do,
*  it's just basically that whether it's a democratic process or not, that the government should be so much more reduced, the power should be so much more reduced than what it is now that it's not that consequential who gets in there because they're not wielding that much power.
*  And as long as you have, I mean, look, this is the major source of the culture war to begin with, even before the social media stuff and before the woke lecturing.
*  And the other thing that I think is the biggest source is that the government is so powerful that you have to fight for your side to be in control of it.
*  Otherwise, you're ruled over by the side who you hate.
*  And it's this is in less the only way forward that would solve this problem that would defuse the culture war is accepting some type of libertarianism.
*  Whatever exactly it is, something that says, OK, listen, you have these cultural views in Portland and you have these cultural views in Alabama.
*  You're not going to remake each other.
*  You guys can live the way you want to live and you guys can live the way you want to live and you can peacefully coexist.
*  The idea that you you have to have this five, six trillion dollar a year beast that's controlled by one side or another that hate each other is just going to keep this thing going and getting hotter and hotter.
*  Yeah. And then you have these ideological positions that these huge corporations attached themselves to to siphon money off of.
*  Right. You know, there's Evan Hafer.
*  He's a owner of Black Rifle Coffee and he was on and he was he's a veteran and now runs this huge coffee business and was discussing what he thinks is really going on with Afghanistan.
*  He's like, there's no reason for us to be over there.
*  He goes, I think they're over there to suck money out of taxpayers.
*  And that's what they're doing.
*  And when Trump was interviewing or rather Steve Hilton was interviewing Trump, I've known Steve Hilton for a long time.
*  That's the next revolution. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Yeah, I've met him. He's a good dude. He's a very nice guy.
*  I was friends with him long before he was ever at Fox News.
*  I met him in Maui. Oh, yeah. On the beach.
*  His kids are playing with my kids when they were real little and we became friends and we've gone on vacations together.
*  Like, I know him very well. That's cool.
*  By the way, I know the exact interview that you're talking about.
*  I think it was one of the craziest things I've ever seen when he's talking about the military industrial complex.
*  We got a bit of people. They want to go to war.
*  Military industrial complex. It's real. Eisenhower warned us about it.
*  This is the thing. By the way, that moment, this is why the establishment hates Donald Trump so much, because he is uncontrollable.
*  And he might just blurt out sitting down outside the White House with Steve Hilton that, oh, you know what?
*  There's a whole bunch of people around me who want to go to war because it makes them billions of dollars. Billions.
*  And this is like and this is just the president, the commander in chief saying it.
*  Now, on the other side, Trump didn't end any of these wars.
*  He kept talking about doing it and then he'd always back out at the last minute.
*  Why do you think that is? Well, you know, I don't know exactly, but I know that when he whenever he would make a move to try to end one of these wars,
*  the press would go nuts circling him. I mean, they always were, but they'd dial it up to like 11 and then he'd have people within his administration undermining him at every turn, at every turn.
*  I remember back I was a I was a contributor on a SC Cup show.
*  She's got a show on CNN. I was a contributor there for like a year.
*  And there was one time where it was Donald Trump came out and said that we're getting out of Syria.
*  And he goes, Look, our only goal in Syria is to defeat ISIS.
*  That's all we care about. And they're almost defeated.
*  As soon as they're defeated, we're getting out completely out of Syria.
*  And then about a week later, McMaster's put out this statement where he was saying these are our goals in Syria.
*  And one of them was regime change to overthrow Bashar al-Assad.
*  And then he gets fired like a week after that.
*  And their take at CNN was kind of like, well, isn't this great that at least one of the adults in the room is like, no, no, no, Donald Trump.
*  This is what we're doing in Syria. We're having another regime change.
*  And I was like losing my shit like, wait, hold on.
*  However you feel about this, he's the commander in chief.
*  The secretary of state doesn't get to decide. No, we're fighting a war.
*  There it is. Oh, this is the Steve Hilton one. Yeah.
*  He was particularly orange that day. They want to keep that.
*  You have people here in Washington. They never want to leave.
*  I say, you know what I'll do? I'll leave a couple of hundred soldiers behind.
*  But if it was up to them, they'd bring thousands of soldiers in.
*  Someday people will explain it. Well, this is an example.
*  You do have you do have a group and they call it the military industrial complex.
*  They never want to leave. They always want to fight. No, I don't want to fight.
*  I don't want to fight. But you do have situations like Iran.
*  You can't let them have nuclear weapons. You just can't let that happen.
*  A friend of mine today was talking about the art of the deal.
*  I've never read the art of the deal. He was in rehab.
*  When he was in rehab, he had a lot of time and he read the art of the deal.
*  And he's like, it's remarkably progressive, even by today's standards.
*  He's like, he wrote this in like the 80s.
*  Well, Donald Trump was never that. I mean, he's got flaws.
*  Oh, no question. But the problem is they they overwhelm anything good about him.
*  Where like you get these flaws like the bragging and the craziness and the not telling the truth about things and the the tricky thing with Trump is that if it wasn't for these character flaws or these qualities that are partly, you know, have these character flaws, he'd never be the president.
*  Right. But then once he becomes president, you're like, man, I wish you could just plug up these couple holes and keep saying shit like that, because that would be really awesome.
*  We really do need a guy who's taking on the military industrial complex and pushing to end these wars and exposing a lot of the corruption.
*  But also the other problem is that this was never really what animated Trump.
*  But the problem is that with Donald Trump, I think that a lot of the Trump haters project this this thing onto Donald Trump, like he's literally Hitler.
*  A lot of the Trump lovers project this thing onto him like he's our savior.
*  Yeah. But the reality is it's just what you see. Yeah.
*  He's just that he's the guy who he's he's as shallow a thinker as he seems.
*  He's instinctually brilliant. But in terms intellectually, he really just cares about being the best.
*  I won. I was terrific. Everybody knows it.
*  You know, and that's and so I think served him well his whole life.
*  Sure. The idea that all of a sudden he becomes president, he's going to ban that and become presidential.
*  No, it's not going to happen. But anyone who was a decent gentleman or like didn't have those qualities would never have gotten to where he was.
*  He got to where he was because he was willing to say like he got to where he was in large part because he had a quality that Bernie Sanders didn't have about him.
*  Bernie Sanders is entirely too nice of a guy to lead a revolution.
*  He would always say we're leading a revolution.
*  And then you'd have Joe Biden, who's the epitome of the system that you want to revolt against.
*  And he'd go, look, Joe's a very decent guy. He's my friend.
*  I'm not going to say anything bad about him. And you're like, well, you're probably not going to lead a fucking revolution if you're not willing to lob some insults.
*  Like, I'm not saying you have to lob bullets, but like you got to at least.
*  Do you though? Do you have to at least attack?
*  You have to at least attack what he stands for.
*  I'm not saying you have to call him a fat loser. I'm saying you have to go like you have to go.
*  Listen, you are the epitome of Washington corruption.
*  You've enriched your own family while you're getting other people killed, while you're selling out the country.
*  Yes, I think you have to go for the jugular if you're actually going to beat this system.
*  Isn't it strange, though, that you have to do that?
*  You can't just espouse the merits of your own ideas.
*  Well, you have to attack.
*  But, you know, if you're a real human being, right?
*  Like, let's say what Donald Trump was just saying.
*  And by the way, Bernie Sanders pretty much agrees with him on that.
*  He's talked about how war is big business and how they, you know, we were lied into the war in Iraq and he voted.
*  Bernie Sanders, to his credit, he was one of the very few Democrats in the Senate who voted against the war in Iraq at the time.
*  Very few Democrats in the Senate like actually stood their ground and good for him for doing that.
*  But you're talking about people lying to get real human beings slaughtered that to make people money.
*  I mean, if you talk about that and you don't have some type of outrage about it, that just doesn't seem to make sense to me.
*  Like, that's not how a real human being should feel.
*  No, I totally understand.
*  But I wonder if like in the middle of that, when you're insulting people, you're perpetuating, you're keeping going this sort of system that's been in place for so long where you run, you talk about your merits, you shit on the flaws of your opponent.
*  He does the same to you.
*  Whoever lands the most blows wins.
*  I mean, this is highlighted by the way Kamala Harris is like sort of talked about her debate with with Biden.
*  Right. When when she was on Colbert, she's like, it was a debate.
*  It was a debate.
*  But it's like, that's the only way to do it is the only way to do it to shit on the other person.
*  I think that you have to like I think there's nothing wrong with really running on your ideas.
*  And I think that part, Bernie Sanders dead.
*  You know, and I don't like a lot of Bernie Sanders ideas.
*  I think he's got some that are really good.
*  Which ones do you like?
*  Well, OK, what I love about Bernie Sanders is that he voted against the war in Iraq.
*  As I just said, he was great in the Senate about the war in Yemen and trying to bring that to an end, which is just this godawful nightmare that's still going on that Obama started and Trump continued.
*  I mean, what's happening in Yemen is like one of the biggest tragedies in my lifetime.
*  So Yemen is I mean, Yemen is the poorest country in the Middle East, which is the worst country in the Middle East.
*  Which is saying something.
*  You know, they were already the poorest country in the Middle East before any of this happened.
*  And the Saudis basically went to war with with the Houthis in Yemen and America backed the Saudis under Barack Obama.
*  What Obama administration said to placate the Saudis.
*  Basically, they the Saudis were pissed off about a lot of things and they're a big business partner with us.
*  And so they were pissed off about the war in Iraq.
*  The Saudis didn't want the war in Iraq.
*  They kind of foresaw what would happen, that it would give Iran control of the region and it would be a nightmare.
*  But the Cheneyites really wanted the war in Iraq.
*  Israel really wanted the war in Iraq.
*  And the neocons won and they got the war.
*  And so they were already pissed off about that.
*  And then they were really pissed off that Obama made the Iran deal with Iran.
*  And so to to placate, which I believe was the direct quote, to placate the Saudis, Obama decided to back them in this war against Yemen.
*  And they put a full blockade around the country, which was already the poorest country in in the Middle East.
*  And this led to just to say, I mean, the UN said it was the worst humanitarian crisis in the world.
*  This was before covid. But I think it's still probably up there.
*  There were there were well over a million cases of cholera, which is basically, I mean, curable with I think liquids like I think Gatorade could solve cholera.
*  I don't know. You might need antibiotics or something like that.
*  But it was children and old people just dying in massive numbers.
*  I still don't think they know the exact numbers.
*  It's going to be somewhere on the scale of what the war in Iraq was.
*  Hundreds of thousands of people dead.
*  And Bernie Sanders really led the effort to try to end it in the Senate.
*  And he did a great job on that. Like phenomenal.
*  He also has a great he had a great bill proposed to decriminalize marijuana on a federal level, which I think would be phenomenal.
*  And so there were there were several things like those would probably be the ones I'd pick that I thought were really great about Bernie Sanders.
*  So I think running on issues, probably one of my big criticisms of him is that he doesn't he doesn't really lead with those issues.
*  Like he didn't those aren't the things he talked about a lot on the campaign trail, but he was excellent on all of those.
*  So I think you could run. He could run on his principles, you know.
*  But I think you have to at some point have a little bit of a killer instinct to become the alpha monkey, to become the leader of this country.
*  And I thought that Bernie Sanders could have won the whole election with the tone that he started in the primary.
*  And he didn't. And I think that Bernie Sanders like, look, the corporate press completely came down to try to ruin it for him.
*  Who knows what the DNC did this time? I mean, it was exposed in 2016.
*  Who knows what they were doing behind the scenes?
*  Well, we know what they were doing.
*  We know that that was the reason why Klobuchar and Buttigieg dropped out.
*  Well, that we know.
*  We know that Warren stayed in to siphon votes off of Bernie.
*  No question.
*  We know they gave their delegates over to Biden.
*  No question. We know that much. We know that right now.
*  We don't know exactly who made the phone calls.
*  I think there was reporting that Barack Obama had called a couple of them.
*  That sounds good.
*  Yeah, it sure does.
*  But so that but you're right.
*  So all the competition with Biden drops out right before Super Tuesday.
*  Bernie Sanders competition.
*  Elizabeth Warren stays in till the bitter end.
*  I think it felt like with Bernie, even though there's talk that they couldn't control him.
*  Right. There's also talk that he couldn't win because there are certain key states that he's never going to win.
*  Because even though that message resonated with a lot of people, including me, what resonated with me is, first of all, absolving people of student debt.
*  I know a lot of people that are wrapped up in student debt.
*  And I think it's one of the best examples of first of all, you have essentially children.
*  You have someone who's 17, 18 years old.
*  They're going into school and they're taking on enormous debt.
*  And they don't.
*  I think you could make the real argument that they don't have the intellectual capacity to understand the ramifications of this.
*  Maybe some do. Maybe some don't.
*  But when you're talking about people that are in debt, hundreds of thousands of dollars by the time they get out of school and then they get out of school and they get a job that pays 40 grand a year.
*  Do the math.
*  How long before you catch up? You never catch up.
*  There's people to this day that are getting Social Security, that are getting their Social Security docked because they owe money for student loans.
*  I mean, you're at the end of the fucking game.
*  Are people old enough for Social Security and they have student loan debts like that?
*  Oh yeah.
*  Oh yeah. That's going on right now.
*  Make sure that's true, Jamie.
*  Sounds really good what I'm saying.
*  Pretty sure it's true.
*  Well, that is. And they are victims of a corrupt scheme, for sure.
*  Yes. Well, it's a bad system.
*  And I think if we have all this money to go to Afghanistan and put on these endless wars, the idea that we don't have enough money to provide a reasonably priced education.
*  I'm not saying it should be free.
*  Maybe it should cost a little bit because I think people work harder when they have to work for something.
*  But the idea that you should be hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt by the time you get out in the reality of the economy is that even before COVID,
*  if you got out, the odds of you getting a job that's like going to be able to even put a dent in that debt in your chosen field, they're not that good.
*  Oh yeah. Oh, no question about that.
*  Here it is.
*  Nineteen percent of Social Security payments can be garnished to repay a student loan debt.
*  Your monthly benefit cannot sink below seven.
*  Well, good luck living on 750 bucks a month.
*  And this is also for people who are what, like 35 now when they retire?
*  What's that going to be?
*  So I mean, that's not that long ago, man.
*  If you think about someone who's 65, right?
*  So once once.
*  No, look at this.
*  Are student loans forgiven after 65?
*  There are no student loan forgiveness programs specifically for senior citizens.
*  Elderly student loan borrowers are eligible for the same loan forgiveness programs as other borrowers.
*  Well, that's crazy.
*  It's crazy. It's crazy.
*  If you're that old and you're on a fixed income, you really can't physically work anymore.
*  And we don't if we're a community.
*  All right. And this is one of the things I think about the United States, the idea of a country.
*  We're supposed to be a community, even though we're broken off in these countries and they're broken off these cities.
*  We're broken off by ideologies and we're separated by all these different lines in the sands that we draw.
*  At the end of the day, we're all contributing to this pool.
*  We're putting our tax dollars in and we're deciding what's important and what's not.
*  For me, student loan forgiveness was a big thing because I was like,
*  we've got to stop this cycle of fucking people over economically when they're 18 years old.
*  Doesn't make any sense. Fair enough.
*  But I just think that if like I agree with the spirit of everything you're saying.
*  And I think when I when I said it's a corrupt system, it's just that the fact that you have all of these parties involved
*  where you have like the government who's guaranteeing all of these student loans.
*  And then you have for a while, I think now it's all done straight from the federal government.
*  For a while, you have these financial companies that are giving out the loans and then taking in the interest and profiting off of them.
*  And then you have these universities who are able to raise their their tuition over and over.
*  And there's always a market for it because the loans are guaranteed by the government.
*  So they're just so now you have all of these people just raking in money and the politicians get to brag about all these kids going to college.
*  And then who's fucked is the 17, 18 year old who was told their whole life that, oh, just just take the loan out,
*  whatever you got to do, because this will lead you to a better life.
*  And then the jobs aren't there for them.
*  So those but the problem, if you want to break this cycle, the problem is the government guaranteeing the loans to begin with.
*  Right. Because that's what a lot. Yeah.
*  So this is why college inflates faster than almost any other price in the market.
*  And so I would just think even if we are going to forgive the loans that are out there now, what you need to do is stop the loans, cut them off
*  and let the prices of college come back to something that's more reasonable, like they were in like our parents generation where you could work a summer job and pay off your college.
*  And then you've also got a very interesting situation in college where most professors are left leaning.
*  And most of the shit you're learning is useless. Not all of it, but a whole lot of it.
*  Well, I don't know if that's necessarily the case, but some of it's going to be useless.
*  But let's not concentrate on that because you're supposed to be expanding your horizons and there's there's social growth being outside of your family for the first time.
*  There's there's all sorts of. But you can do that in lots of ways than spending 100 grand to go get drunk at a frat party.
*  You can. But how many of those ways ensure intellectual competition?
*  How many of those ways ensure that you're going to get together with other students and you're going to debate things, you're going to discuss issues, you're going to learn things, you're going to talk amongst yourselves.
*  You're going to also all be forced to take these rigorous courses that demand a lot of you intellectually.
*  That it's very rare. I like that in theory. I just don't know how much that's happening in universities.
*  But I get your point. But let's agree it's the only place where it's happening. Sure. For 18 year olds.
*  Trust me, because I barely spend any time in college. My time in college was three years at UMass Boston and barely paying attention.
*  Right. So these people that are teaching these kids overwhelmingly lean left.
*  Now, I'm not saying they shouldn't lean left. If this is how you feel, you should express yourself.
*  But it is really odd in a country that thrives on this concept of diversity, that there's almost no diversity in the intellectual ideologies that these professors have.
*  Yeah. Like what are the numbers of professors in this country? What percentage of professors identify as Marxists?
*  Let's take a guess. I would say I'm going to say it's in the 20s. Yeah, I probably guess something like that.
*  But then there's also identifying as Marxist and then there's like being influenced by say like postmodernism.
*  Yeah, but we're going as far as we can. This is Marxist. That's as far left as we can get. Right. Yeah, it might be under 20%. I'm not sure.
*  But it's a it's a we can agree that it's a really far left stance. Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's pretty far.
*  So but I'm saying like what percentage identifies the hardest of hard lefts? Very close. What is it?
*  There's an article that says about 18 percent of social scientists in the U.S. self identify as Marxists. Oh, but that's social science.
*  I typed in professors. It says professors in the top. Yeah, because if you're talking about professors and like other, you know, harder sciences.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 80 percent of social scientists. OK. But that's still an interesting. That's a large number.
*  And that's a large number of people that are teaching like, you know, critical race theory and gender theory.
*  And there's a lot of right. So this is where all the woke shit comes from. Right. And this is really destructive.
*  Well, this is where your kids go. Only about five percent who identify as conservative.
*  Isn't that seems crazy. You've got 18 percent Marxist, five percent conservative and a panel discussion was that.
*  That's what I was going to see. I was going to see like titled clothes and people they asked the closed minded campus, the stifling of ideas in American universities.
*  But it's one of those things where it's like what is most appealing to young kids? Compassion.
*  What happens to people when they get older? Realism.
*  What happens to people when they get older and then they're worried about their physical health and then conservatism?
*  I mean, it's like that's one of the reasons why conservatism and even in, you know, libertarianism, when you think about it, when you do this sort of like real narrow minded view of what that means to people for a lot of people, it means cruelty.
*  It means a lack of compassion. It means this like blind faith in capitalism and competition.
*  And that's one of the things that freaks out young people because young people, as they enter into the world and they start learning things and they leave their parents.
*  A lot of times, first of all, they feel suppressed by their parents.
*  They feel like the parents who probably work really hard in order to get them to go to school, you know, to be able to afford their school will probably work really hard in order just to keep the family together.
*  Just in terms of the amount of money you have to have to have a house and two cars and live in American payer taxes and send your kids to college like goddamn you got to work.
*  You fucking have to work.
*  And so if you're a kid and you just live it off your parents and then you're hearing all this like hardcore shit like like, you know, your parents want they want you to be successful.
*  And you're like, Jesus Christ, leave me alone.
*  Then you get to school and you drop acid and you learn about Marxism and you learn about socialism and you're like, we can all just get together.
*  We can just pull all our money together and we're going to be fine.
*  And, you know, there was a discussion.
*  Who is it that was was it on this show?
*  I think it was I was talking to somebody and they were talking about the early days of the United States and then the early days, the United States with wheat production.
*  The initial ideas were that they were going to pull all the all the food together.
*  I think this was actually pre United States.
*  I think this was in the colonies.
*  I think you're right.
*  I think you're right.
*  And then they realized, really, really quickly that this didn't work.
*  And they go, OK, scrap that what you grow, you eat.
*  And they're like, oh, shit, I got to go to work.
*  And then people started busting their ass.
*  There's a diffusion of diffusion of responsibility that comes from this idea that you are an individual and that the government should provide for you.
*  You know, there's so many people in this country and there's so much money.
*  Look at all the trillions they spend on military.
*  Look at all the trillions they spend on infrastructure.
*  Look at all the trillions they give to the fossil fuel industry and all this.
*  They start running all these numbers and they go, why can't the government take care of everybody?
*  Why?
*  You know, and that is one of the like my my position is basically that the government shouldn't do any of this shit and we don't have the money for any of it.
*  We shouldn't rob it from people.
*  But it is a strong argument from like an AOC type.
*  Yes.
*  Where they'll be like, oh, well, we don't have this money.
*  And she can go.
*  Yeah.
*  But every time you right wingers want a war, you always find the money for it.
*  This is where I was going.
*  So you have young people who do have these idealistic perspectives like AOC.
*  And then they go through the university system and they're taught this by people who don't enter the real world.
*  Right.
*  These people, they stay in academia.
*  They they they learn, they grow, they they become professors, they get tenure.
*  They're there.
*  And this is this is their world.
*  And in their world, they get to shape young minds.
*  And they shape you shape young minds who are already open to these ideas of compassion and of being different than their fucking parents who are so hardcore.
*  Your parents had to feed you.
*  You fucks.
*  You pants out there grinding a little bit of gratitude.
*  It's fucking hard.
*  It's hard to get by.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, it's hard.
*  No. So I get I completely get what you're saying.
*  But the other thing about, you know, which I guess just concerns me a little bit about abolishing student debt or forgiving student debt is that well, number one, the first thing I said is that it's like, well, OK, if we don't get the system fixed, then we're going to forgive this debt and then keep perpetuating more people in debt.
*  So something still needs to be done there.
*  But the problem is also that, like, you know, if when you say forgive debt or you have the taxpayer pick any of this stuff up, it's just coming from other people.
*  It's your taxing working people to pay for this.
*  But why something but there's something.
*  But why does it have to be that way?
*  The government already subsidizes it, right?
*  Right.
*  So what what if they didn't do that?
*  What if there was a way to figure out like a reasonable solution to how professors are paid, how students pay for their education?
*  What if there's a reasonable solution that was profitable?
*  I'd be all for that if there was a reasonable solution.
*  I think so.
*  But I think basically the solution is to just get the government out of the business of higher education.
*  If there are higher if there are institutions of higher education that are providing enough value for people like you come here, you're going to be way better in life in that scene, then people are going to want to send their kids there.
*  OK, let them let them survive on their own.
*  But what about Canada?
*  What about the UK?
*  What about places that pay for education?
*  Yeah, I mean, there are like other countries that do that.
*  And and OK, fair enough.
*  Like that there.
*  I mean, I don't know enough about the Canadian university system, but I'll tell you this.
*  They have just as big a problem with what you were talking about with the woke shit, maybe even more.
*  Maybe even more.
*  Well, the president's woke.
*  Yeah, he's not a president.
*  He's a king, right?
*  What is it?
*  I believe he's a prime minister.
*  No, he's a king.
*  You know what?
*  Jamie is true to our king.
*  King brownface.
*  You know, thank you.
*  I also think that, you know, the wolf shit is really that it's really something that has really gripped the country in an interesting way over the last.
*  And it's not just that the colleges are like teaching it like that's almost like the center of it all, like critical race theory in some university.
*  Yeah.
*  But then you see how much it's been jumped onto by like by all the big corporations, politicians.
*  They're all behind.
*  Well, that's why Kamala Harris states are gender pronouns.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a it's in compliance.
*  Do you wonder what it's capitulate capitulating to the woke culture?
*  Right.
*  But it's interesting.
*  Like, do you I wonder oftentimes and I guess there's I don't know how many of of like, like real woke true believers will ever listen to anything that I'm ever on.
*  Like even as big as this show is like they would just be furious by everything you say the way you just drink your glasses like that's white supremacy or whatever.
*  You know, like, yeah.
*  Well, I mean, by my very existence.
*  Yes.
*  Yeah, I'm a white male rich guy with tattoos who does cage fighting commentary.
*  Yes. Very problematic.
*  A lot of problems.
*  Very problematic.
*  But do you ever wonder, like from even from their perspective, which is hard to get into.
*  But to the if you're like out there and you're like, OK, Black Lives Matter and like the hardcore like woke 20 year old.
*  And they're like, I'm against this system because this system is white supremacy.
*  Right.
*  And then you realize that all of Hollywood agrees with you and all of academia agrees with you.
*  And like JPMorgan Chase is running like a Black Lives Matter ads and Kamala Harris, the vice president elect agrees with you and all.
*  And you go, how against the system are you really?
*  If the entire system is supporting what you're doing and what why if the whole system is based on white supremacy and you're here to call that out, why would the system not be reacting to crush you?
*  Why would they be like propping you up?
*  Well, the system is so malleable.
*  Right. The system recognizes trends and we can profit off this trend.
*  Well, we need to sell Black Lives Matter masks.
*  But I think it's more than just profiting off of it.
*  Like my my theory on it is that this is the ultimate divide and conquer and protect yourself strategy.
*  So you see how much the look they don't want true economic leftism.
*  That's what Bernie Sanders represented.
*  And you saw how much the corporate press freaked out when it looked like he might have a shot at winning.
*  They were calling his supporters Nazis and shit like that.
*  Like they were giving him the Trump treatment.
*  The Jewish guy who's the closest to ever being president any Jews ever been is all of a sudden represents a Nazi takeover.
*  But they freaked out and all the stuff you were saying about having the other candidates drop out and that Bernie Sanders was unacceptable to them.
*  They don't like that brand of left wing ideology.
*  They love the woke shit because the woke shit allows them to give up nothing.
*  But like JP Morgan Chase is like fine.
*  We'll send our white execs to diversity training.
*  Good deal. Now are we cool with the left now?
*  Like that's fine. We'll hang a Black Lives Matter flag up.
*  No problem. They're fine with gestures.
*  But Bernie Sanders is like I want your money.
*  I want your shit.
*  I want your profits.
*  No more making like Bernie Sanders is that you know if some like social justice warrior is like you know we have a problem with microaggressions and toxic politics.
*  The JP Morgan Chase is like no problem.
*  That's great.
*  And Bernie Sanders is like there shouldn't be billionaires.
*  And they're like I don't know about that guy.
*  That guy seems like he could be trouble.
*  You know what I mean?
*  So they don't like the economic populist stuff because they've got a nice little system worked out here where they're raping the country.
*  The fucking big bank system that they have worked out right now is that the Federal Reserve prints money out of thin air.
*  Lends it to them at zero percent interest and they lend it out to the rest of us at interest.
*  So they just get money for free and then lend it out and collect the interest.
*  It's a sweet ass fucking deal.
*  If I were them, I'd want to talk about microaggressions too.
*  I'd be like you know what the real problem in our society is?
*  It's these fucking microaggressions.
*  Am I right?
*  That's what's fucking everybody over.
*  White supremacy.
*  They consciously recognize these trends and say we've got to get on board with this and this will help us because we'll be one of the good guys.
*  We'll be a company that's very difficult to criticize.
*  I think there's a lot of forces at work but I think that's a big part of it.
*  They also realize that I think there are people, it's like this kind of, it's like an alliance between the top and the bottom.
*  So there's like the 20 year old who works for some company, maybe some internet music streaming company.
*  I don't know.
*  Some company out there, some 20 year old woke person who is a true believer, a true believer in the woke stuff.
*  And then there is the JP Morgan Chase, Kamala Harris's of the world.
*  They don't believe this for a goddamn second.
*  It's just a ploy.
*  It's just a tactic.
*  And so they're kind of playing off of these people.
*  But my thing is that like to the bleeding heart, young, woke, social justice warrior types is like, look, there's a need for you in society.
*  There's a need for like a compassionate left who's willing to protest shit and shut shit down.
*  But you're focused on all the wrong areas.
*  It's not about fucking, forget microaggressions.
*  Think about real aggressions.
*  We're still in all the longest wars in American history.
*  But protest that.
*  Get out in the streets about fucking Yemen.
*  Try to end that war.
*  Isn't that it almost there's too many things going on.
*  And then those things are out of sight.
*  They're in another place that you're never going to visit.
*  Well, you have to think a little bit about it.
*  But why is it that and maybe it's I don't like have an answer.
*  This isn't like a leading question.
*  Like, but why is it that like the Vietnam War could draw so many protests that the war in Iraq under George W.
*  Bush drew so many protests.
*  So like, why can't why were Trump's wars never like a thing?
*  I think the press covers them differently today than they did during the Vietnam era.
*  Yeah, I think that's true.
*  I think the press during the Vietnam era was very much the press.
*  The ideal view of the press.
*  Probably closer.
*  Much.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I think it's been changed.
*  First of all, there's there's a bunch of factors that happen almost together.
*  They coincide.
*  One of them is the advent of social media and the Internet in general.
*  And then how people are no longer digesting their news through paper.
*  They're not paying for a newspaper.
*  They're getting it on their phone.
*  And you're now in competition with BuzzFeed and Vice and, you know, name it.
*  There's so many choices.
*  There's two Vox and there's there's almost too many different plays.
*  The blaze is fucking you just you can keep going and going and going.
*  There's too many different places where you can go to get information.
*  So if a website is competing with the New York Times, the New York Times now has to do something in order to get your attention.
*  So what do they do?
*  They do at least at least if they don't do click bait stuff, they do provocative things.
*  They they they gear their attention towards things they know are going to get clicks because they're starving.
*  They're literally fighting for survival, whether it's the Washington Post or even the Wall Street Journal.
*  I think a lot of these newspapers are experiencing significant.
*  Well, one thing that led to a big increase in the New York Post subscribers, ironically, is Trump.
*  Right. Trump shitting on them and calling the failing New York Times.
*  But yes, yeah, yeah.
*  Trump calling them the failing New York Times.
*  They started their subscriptions went up.
*  Well, this is and this is true all over the place with corporate media entities that were dying.
*  I mean, it's also true for MSNBC and CNN and a lot of them all saw rating surges.
*  Sure, because people wanted to combat Trump.
*  Yeah, a lot of them.
*  It became the number one focus because if it bleeds, it leads like that's these are the really exciting things that people are going to tune into.
*  And it's going to help our revenue stream.
*  So our idea is that the reason why they're showing us the news is these are the most significant stories that are going to impact your life the most.
*  This is what's most important.
*  Not really the case.
*  What it really is is what's going to get the most attention.
*  What's the most important in terms of like what's going to get the most views, which is going to bring in the most advertising revenue.
*  And for people online that are writing stories, it's they don't call it clickbait for a reason.
*  Yeah, they do rather call it clickbait for a reason.
*  The reason is it's they got to trick you into clicking that thing because that's how they make their money that we've created this rep.
*  So then they've tried subscription models and I subscribe to the Times and I subscribe to the Washington Post.
*  I subscribe to like four or five different publications and I felt like an obligation to do that.
*  I'm getting my news from them.
*  I feel like I should give them some money and that might be the only way these things ever survive is that people get their news via subscription model.
*  But to this day, someone will send me a link and I'll click the link and they'll say to subscribe.
*  I'm like, I'll fuck you.
*  And then I'll I won't read it and then I'll Google it.
*  I'll try to find it somewhere else.
*  Yeah, that works about 50 percent of the time.
*  Yeah, just Google the title.
*  You should be able to just pay for an article like maybe Apple pay you five cents for this article.
*  Let me get a double click.
*  Like to make me subscribe every time I understand that there's journalists and they're doing amazing work and that they've worked for weeks on this expose.
*  And this has been the sole focus of their life.
*  And it's valuable and it's valuable to me.
*  It's valuable to the United States as a whole because this one person's intellectual perspective on a very complex subject.
*  They boiled this down for weeks and weeks.
*  Here, this is what we've learned about X that those are important.
*  Sure. I'll give you a couple of bucks.
*  I'll do but make it fucking easy.
*  Don't make me subscribe and give you my email address.
*  And I got to just make me go to do let me go like that.
*  I'll give you two dollars.
*  Yeah, it's kind of as you say, it's surprising they haven't figured that all out close what Apple has, but it's not quite right.
*  It's like in between what you're talking about.
*  I have that too.
*  Yeah, yeah, I have that.
*  But it's still there's still which is there's somebody curating it.
*  Yes, it's a little, you know, exactly.
*  Exactly.
*  I mean, I would like to be able to go to each individual front page.
*  And I think I don't even have time for that.
*  I think the thing you were mentioning earlier about who you trust is like a bigger factor than ever before.
*  You know, I trust who online people would know people like Jimmy Dore, people like Kyle, loves Jimmy Dore.
*  Yeah, people like the Hill.
*  Dude, if you Crystal and Sager, I like them too.
*  I like that. Their show is great.
*  It's great.
*  But I you know, so it's like and by the way, and the best is like Glenn Greenwald.
*  Yes. Yes.
*  Like he's on and you know where he stands like he's a left wing guy.
*  OK, he still has journalistic integrity.
*  So he's not just going to like you know that him walking away from the Intercept was incredible.
*  And there's and Jeremy Scahill, the other guy who was at the Intercept with him is a great journalist.
*  Aaron Maté, I might be fucking up his last name.
*  Have you had him on?
*  No, he's great.
*  He's writes for the nation.
*  Did a great job.
*  He's on Jimmy Dore show all the time.
*  He did a great job of like just blowing up the Russia conspiracy bullshit.
*  And it was more powerful because it's like a left winger doing it.
*  Who's like, listen, this is all lies.
*  And like I hate Donald Trump, but I'm not going to tell you something that isn't real is real just because I hate him.
*  And so if you're smart or if you're lucky, you know, fortunate enough to find the right people, you can get really good information online.
*  But it comes down to like who you trust to give you the right information.
*  Right. And there's a lot of people right now who it's kind of like, well, these are the few people I trust.
*  These are the few people I trust on both sides.
*  Right. And you could be way off.
*  Like you think you trust this person.
*  Someone come along and go, hey, man, do you know they're they're financed by this?
*  Do you know that this is a part of the reason why they keep bringing this up is there's a directive, you know, that emails have been leaked and it's been proven that these people are supposed to be doing what they're doing.
*  Oh, fuck. Really?
*  That's the worst.
*  Figuring out someone you trust isn't right.
*  Find out the cult master really doesn't speak to the alien behind the comet.
*  Yeah. But this is where we're at.
*  Right. We're in this imperfect system.
*  That's the best system the world's ever known.
*  That's what's weird.
*  What's weird is as good as this like it's hard to say things are great because things are not great for everybody and they're certainly not as good as they could be.
*  Right. So that said, we have to recognize that this system of this experiment and self-government is the best system that's ever been put in place.
*  As far as creativity, artistic contribution, the impact on culture, innovation, like there's some beautiful things that are happening all around the world.
*  Yeah.
*  But there's some wild shit that has happened in America over a period of just 200 years.
*  Yeah.
*  It's pretty fucking crazy.
*  No, it's the fucking it's the greatest country that's ever existed in by many different metrics.
*  So let me throw this out.
*  And it's worth saving because we're on a fucking suicide mission.
*  So it's worth saving.
*  I don't believe this, but I'm just as a thought exercise.
*  What if all this robbery like student debt and even the military industrial complex and even what if all of this activity has to go on in order to have this much thriving in order to have this much economic prosperity and this much freedom?
*  You got to have fuckery. You got to have madness. You got to have lies. You got to have deception.
*  You got to have special interest groups. You got to have people distorting other people's positions on things.
*  You got to have empty pundits. You got to have puppets in various stages of media.
*  You have to have clickbait. You have to have all these things because if you don't have all these things, you don't have resistance.
*  You don't have an enemy. You don't have a battle.
*  You don't have a competition to get these prominent ideas you think are the most crucial in order to maintain this society and maybe even improve it.
*  They don't compete enough. They have to be suppressed. You have to choke people.
*  You got to grab them. You got to shake them like bad babies.
*  Almost like you have to create this chaos.
*  It's almost like you have to create it in order for people to battle this chaos.
*  Well, yeah, I mean, I guess there is like a yin and yang to the fact that without corruption, there could never be noble anti-corruption forces and without anything to fight against.
*  I don't believe there are any bad babies and you definitely shouldn't shake them. That was a bad analogy.
*  That was a bad analogy. But if you're going to shake babies, make sure it's a bad baby.
*  Like a Hitler baby.
*  Yeah, Hitler baby. I think it's okay to shake.
*  When do you think you could go back in time and be justified in killing Hitler?
*  Like if you killed him when he was 10, you'd be an asshole.
*  Yeah, that's bad.
*  Maybe you should just coach him.
*  Yeah.
*  Teach him.
*  Anytime. Yeah, well, that's I mean, once you have the ability to time travel, you'd think you could probably solve this in a better way than killing him.
*  Could you though?
*  Maybe not. I don't know.
*  You have to keep him from steroids and cocaine, right?
*  Because apparently that was the thing they would inject him with testosterone and cocaine.
*  You ever see that video of him at the Olympics?
*  Yes.
*  Where he's like tweaking out.
*  Yes.
*  It's amazing.
*  You imagine what it's like being in his inner circle.
*  It's just like a little thing fucked up or something like that.
*  There's a crazy story.
*  I forget who told it to me.
*  I do too many podcasts, but about Mussolini and that Mussolini was ready to get out of the war.
*  It's like Italy doesn't want to know part of this.
*  And they shot Hitler up with coke and testosterone and they sent him over there and he cornered Mussolini and fucking talked to him for hours.
*  Imagine being at a party with some guy who just spit in your face telling you stories.
*  And he's talking just like his public speeches.
*  It's just like going crazy.
*  And by the end of the fucking conversation, Mussolini is all in.
*  He's like anything to get this man away from me.
*  But was it that or was Mussolini like actually like, fuck yeah, we're going to fight this war.
*  Like Hitler just had this power.
*  He had a needle and a fucking mirror.
*  He's like, come on, do a storm of this.
*  I'm going to fucking hit you with one of those.
*  Woo, are we in?
*  But you know, Hitler was doing all sorts of hardcore amphetamines.
*  By the way, so was Kennedy.
*  Did you know that?
*  Yeah.
*  They were doing that to a lot of people back then.
*  I mean, I'm pretty convinced all of them are on some type of drugs.
*  See, Joe Biden sprinted out to his acceptance speech the other day.
*  They gave him a little something.
*  100 percent.
*  Donald Trump did.
*  Dude, Donald Trump did in back to back days in the last week before the election, five events at five different states where he did close to an hour at each one.
*  Yeah.
*  That means someone if someone told you, dude, we're getting on a plane, you're doing five hours tonight in five different states.
*  You got that's going to be a day, man.
*  Donald Trump is in his mid 70s.
*  He's overweight and he had covid couple weeks ago and he's fucking doing it.
*  And, dude, he loves it like he's just up there and I can just we love you.
*  And he just and by the way, nothing scripted, which is the most amazing part about Trump.
*  He literally just gets up there and just fucking stream of conscious.
*  They got a doctor with a turkey baster filled with testosterone.
*  Oh my God.
*  Shoving it in him.
*  They're giving him some everything.
*  It's not just Big Macs.
*  No, no.
*  There's something else at work there.
*  For sure.
*  There's definitely some sort of stimulant probably prescribed by a doctor so it doesn't seem like it's bad.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, I would never do drugs.
*  There's a lot of people that think that.
*  Yeah.
*  I knew a lady who was like hooked on Xanax, but she hated drugs.
*  I'm like, what do you think you're doing?
*  Yeah.
*  What do you think you're doing?
*  People have weird ideas about drugs.
*  Right.
*  And if you talk to like drug specialists, they I mean, I've had people on that explain that kicking Xanax is actually more difficult than kicking opiates.
*  Xanax addiction is very serious.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a powerful drug.
*  Maybe not more difficult, but it's in the realm.
*  It's like it's an incredibly difficult thing to kick and has all sorts of weird complications with people.
*  You know, antidepressants in general or anti-anxiety medication in general, like benzodiazepine, that's that shit that Jordan Peterson was trying to get off.
*  And he was wrecked for a fucking year for a whole.
*  He's just coming out of the fog now.
*  I mean, how to go do a medical detox in Russia.
*  Yeah.
*  For Benzos.
*  Yeah.
*  I've never. Have you ever done a Benzo?
*  Do you know what that is?
*  I don't know what it's like.
*  No, I mean, I've heard the stories about Peterson.
*  Joey Diaz eats them.
*  Joey Diaz eats them in a bowl like cornflakes.
*  Yeah, but Joey Diaz isn't exactly human.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't think he's ever had them.
*  He can. He might have.
*  You couldn't do anything to Joey Diaz, no matter what you give him.
*  He'll be the same.
*  Well, while he's alive, he's a national treasure.
*  We should protect him with everything we can.
*  You've got him now.
*  That's right.
*  Yeah, he's in Jersey.
*  That's right.
*  Yeah, I'm happy.
*  That was win one for the East Coast.
*  And right when he got there, they legalized weed.
*  Coincidence?
*  Maybe not.
*  It's quite a coincidence, if it is just that.
*  He brought it.
*  He brought the energy.
*  They probably thought about it.
*  And like Uncle Joey's in town, we've got to check that box.
*  I'm glad Joey Diaz is in New Jersey, and I'm glad Jordan Peterson is home.
*  I think the country could use some more Jordan Peterson.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  And also, I think it's probably real important for a guy of his intellectual capacity to
*  explain what it was like to be addicted to these things and try to get off of them.
*  I think a lot of us, especially it'd be easy for someone like me who's never been physically
*  addicted to something, where I had some serious withdrawals, it's probably easy to dismiss
*  that as mental weakness.
*  But when a guy who's as intelligent as him and has spent so much time talking about personal
*  responsibility has a situation like this, it can shine some light in a very unique way
*  that maybe like you or I who have you ever been addicted to anything?
*  Not really.
*  Coffee.
*  I was addicted to coffee.
*  But I really am addicted to coffee.
*  You ever like had not been able to have coffee?
*  Yeah, I've had some headaches.
*  Yeah, it's like I had to give blood or to get blood tests once like a couple of years
*  ago.
*  And it was like you can't drink coffee before it.
*  And it was like at noon.
*  And it was like by the time I was out, I was like, holy shit, like I'm really feeling that.
*  But no, not addiction to like anything like.
*  You get headaches.
*  I bought a 51 ounce French press.
*  It's like it's a big old metal French press.
*  And when I make coffee, if I make French press coffee, I put in way too much coffee.
*  Like you're not supposed to have that much grinds.
*  I'm basically making speed.
*  And then I poured the hot water and I drank the whole thing.
*  So I drank 50 ounces, whatever it is, without the beans.
*  I make it like a couple inches thick on the bottom.
*  Right.
*  It's way more coffee than you're supposed to have.
*  So let's say I drink 45 ounces of coffee and it's crank.
*  And by the end of the day, I was so tired.
*  And I was like, what is why am I so tired?
*  I'm like, oh, you were on speed today, stupid.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, basically.
*  I'm catching up with you.
*  You like the end of it.
*  But before that, I felt so good.
*  I wanted to hug everybody.
*  I wanted to go to work.
*  I wanted to get things done.
*  I got a workout in.
*  I did some writing.
*  I made some phone calls.
*  That sounds pretty good to me.
*  The only negative was you got tired at the end of the day.
*  I was tired.
*  Like when Trump goes to sleep, I'd love to see like a webcam of him when the Adderall dies out and he has to take a sleeping pill.
*  But his whatever it is that he takes, the energy that that guy has.
*  I remember Bill O'Reilly interviewed him.
*  It was like when he first became president and it was before Bill O'Reilly went down.
*  So around when he first became president and he asked him, number one, which was the greatest thing ever was he asked him.
*  He was like, so do you ever look around the White House and just think to yourself like, man, this is like really incredible.
*  I'm the president of the United States.
*  And Trump was like, yeah, it's a nice house.
*  He just seemed so unimpressed with the fact that it's like a shithole where he lived.
*  But that's just Donald Trump.
*  Like it's always like, did you ever have like a serious moment where you thought about your role in history and all this in this house you're in?
*  And he's like, yeah, Donald fucking Trump.
*  Like, I don't know.
*  I live in a lot of nice houses.
*  And Bill O'Reilly asked him how much he sleeps a night.
*  And he said about three hours.
*  And he goes, does that like mess with you?
*  And he goes, I always slept about three hours.
*  Like he was always kind of being this guy.
*  He always loved.
*  It was a big advantage.
*  The celebrity factor for Donald Trump was a big advantage in politics.
*  And a part of that was that like when he would get on those debate stages, you got to think like in the primary debates with other Republicans, a lot of these guys like Marco Rubio or someone like that, he might have been groomed by the establishment, but he hasn't been under these type of lights before.
*  He hasn't had 100 million people watching him before.
*  But Donald Trump stepped right in there like this is exactly where I belong.
*  This is this is my home and was so comfortable.
*  Even someone like Jeb Bush, who's from the most powerful crime family in America.
*  But has he ever been in a spotlight like that before?
*  No, not with a guy like Donald Trump who doesn't follow any of the rules.
*  We can say Jamie, I've heard recently.
*  I don't even know if it's speculation, but like the drug he's taking is not like Adderall or some meth thing, but he's taking like Pro Vigil actually.
*  Hmm.
*  Could be.
*  I just found a tweet from like two years ago that his doctor apparently passes it out like candy.
*  Yeah, well, that will definitely pep you up and keep you.
*  Yeah, I've taken that.
*  I've taken Pro Vigil without a doubt.
*  It gives you a lot of energy.
*  It's great if you have to drive and you're not going to be able to get any sleep.
*  It's amazing.
*  Amazing for staying awake.
*  But yeah, makes sense.
*  I mean, it's not a speed.
*  Technically, it's a different it's in a different class.
*  I've never taken it.
*  Doesn't elevate your heart rate.
*  It's banned from I believe it's banned from Olympic competition.
*  See if that's the case.
*  New Vigil.
*  Look up New Vigil.
*  Is it finasteride?
*  Is that what it's called?
*  Medaphenyl.
*  Medaphenyl.
*  Finasteride is like that's Advil, isn't it?
*  No, that's Viagra.
*  They added it.
*  Looks good.
*  I'm sure it takes that too.
*  It's added to the prohibited substances 10 days before the 2004 Olympics.
*  Yeah, because it does give you some sort of a stimulant effect.
*  But not a stimulant effect.
*  You never had it?
*  I don't think so.
*  It's cool.
*  It's weird.
*  It gives you like this weird buzz.
*  Like you have this like weird.
*  I don't necessarily think it increases your IQ.
*  Like I don't think it increases.
*  I shouldn't say IQ.
*  Cognitive performance.
*  But I do think it makes you appear like you've increased your cognitive performance.
*  Like maybe it makes you think that you're smarter.
*  But it gives you more energy.
*  That's dangerous.
*  See like has it been proved like no bet.
*  See look up no benefit for cognitive performance on Pro Vigil.
*  I might be wrong.
*  I think there's maybe a slight uptick for a lot of people.
*  But for a lot of people I think one of the things that holds them back is they're just not that healthy.
*  They don't have a lot of energy.
*  You know like healthy people that are like really vibrant people that are in good shape.
*  They have more energy for stuff and that would make them think better.
*  Researchers have found the modafinil boosts high higher order cognitive function without causing serious side effects.
*  Modafinil which has been prescribed in the US since 1998 to treat sleep related conditions such as narcolepsy and sleep apnea heightens alertness as much as caffeine does.
*  They're really selling it.
*  Sounds awesome.
*  Yeah it says but do that again click on that again.
*  Does it increase IQ boosts higher order cognitive function.
*  I don't know what that you'd have to take a couple of tests I guess.
*  Right.
*  I don't know.
*  Right.
*  It's interesting from what I understand even though it was prescribed for narcolepsy.
*  I believe it was developed for I think it was developed as a performance enhancing drug.
*  I think they did developed it to they were trying to figure out how to increase cognitive function and then they said well you can't just give a drug out for people that want to get smarter about shit.
*  Well you have to have a reason like a medical condition because the state of our medical system.
*  And so then they said narcolepsy.
*  It'll prevent narcolepsy.
*  It'll help against narcolepsy.
*  But a lot of these drugs are developed like that like they're developed for a purpose completely different than what they end up being.
*  900,000 prescriptions in 2017 in just the US for it.
*  Most of them are me.
*  That's only that makes it the number three hundred and twenty eighth most commonly prescribed.
*  Wow.
*  It's really good.
*  It's almost a billion though.
*  I'm not saying you should get on it.
*  I definitely have.
*  I haven't taken it for years though.
*  But I think you should.
*  But it looks like Trump's doing it and things are working out pretty good for that.
*  Well not right now they're not.
*  Now it's just still like a big baby.
*  Take your lumps sir.
*  But when you I know what the guys are an author who says he can't function without it.
*  And he writes that's what he uses uses that stuff.
*  He said he doesn't have any energy without it.
*  But again it works.
*  I think a lot of people like they're just not that healthy.
*  Right.
*  And they need something to give them a little pick me up.
*  But you know I talked to Tim Ferriss about it.
*  You know Tim Ferriss is into a lot of performance enhancing things and a lot of biohacking type
*  things and he said that he didn't want to put it in his book.
*  It was a four hour body or the four hour work.
*  I don't remember which but which one it was.
*  One of his books one of his sort of like how to beat the system type books because he goes
*  I felt like people just start going to start eating it like candy.
*  And he goes and I feel like there's always a biological like there's no biological.
*  Like there's no biological free rides.
*  There's always some sort of negative aspect especially to abuse of something like that.
*  But when you're 74 and you eat nothing but french fries and you're out there kicking ass
*  you got to go like how much time has this guy got left anyway.
*  Well yeah but some people are just freaks like that you know like some people it's true like some people don't
*  you know what I mean.
*  Like some people who are like are like eat like shit and like still fucking like some people just naturally
*  have better cardio even if they're not like running as much as somebody else they just naturally have it better.
*  Some people can treat their bodies like shit and still function.
*  Most people can't.
*  Right. But Trump is if nothing else he is unique.
*  Well he is different than anyone.
*  So quickly I don't care what drugs they gave him.
*  But it's like yeah but he got access to drugs that we don't have.
*  Okay well give them to everybody give those drugs to everybody and then we open up the country again
*  because of that fat guy who's almost dead.
*  He's 74.
*  What is the average life expectancy.
*  I think he's above it.
*  I think 77.
*  Is it.
*  It's in the neighborhood.
*  It's lower this year because of all the stress.
*  Sure.
*  Let's just say it's 76.
*  So he's two years away from being dead.
*  And you guys gave him these magic drugs.
*  Now he's doing five hours of campaigns every day.
*  Whatever those drugs are you got to give them out to everybody.
*  76.
*  Yeah look at that.
*  Yeah.
*  Eighty one for chicks.
*  The last.
*  Yeah.
*  And they complain.
*  Well the last five years they just laugh.
*  How can I win.
*  It's it's kind of great.
*  I mean I hope this is the big hope right.
*  Biden gets in office the country relaxes all this crazy shit about making lists and everything.
*  People realize there's some that's bad.
*  And then whatever this vaccine is and whatever these treatments are we're allowed to go back to normal again.
*  That would be that would be the best case scenario that I think that Joe Biden does something you know we'll have a national mask mandate or something and then help for we'll do that for two months and then he goes we defeated the virus and we did it because we finally got serious and listened to the science.
*  And but I got to say I'm not super optimistic that that's the way it's going to go.
*  Well explain what you were saying to me before the show.
*  We're talking about governors realizing.
*  Oh well I mean this power.
*  Yeah look I mean I think that what's what's happened over the last year in America is really like unprecedented.
*  I mean the idea that Americans have now accepted to some degree that we could be in a state where we're sitting at home watching our governors on television to find out what we're allowed to do today.
*  Are we allowed to go to the park.
*  Can I see my grandmother.
*  Can I have my family over.
*  Can I go to work like the most intimate basic things that we all talk about.
*  Things that we all took for granted as freedoms.
*  Of course the government could never tell you you can or can't do that.
*  And now the governors have taken this authority and there wasn't major pushback.
*  I mean there was a little but not so much that they couldn't get away with doing it.
*  And I don't know that they're just going to give up that authority now that they've seized it.
*  I mean my my thing what I think about Kobe ultimately the effect that the lockdowns and all this will have.
*  I think it would be something like 9 11 where you know like right after 9 11 you remember there was all that fear that there'd be another terrorist attack like oh my god we're terrified this could happen again.
*  And that's kind of gone away.
*  People don't really live with a fear of another terrorist attack.
*  But the Department of Homeland Security is here to stay.
*  The TSA is here to stay.
*  The wars that we're fighting are seemingly here to stay.
*  The Patriot Act is here to stay.
*  All of these things and then all the stuff that grew out of the Patriot Act with the crazy NSA spying and all that.
*  So my guess is that a lot of these things are going to be here to stay.
*  When you give the government control it's very hard to get it back from them.
*  Yes.
*  And that's a that's a difficult dynamic.
*  Especially when it's for your own good like in a medical emergency.
*  And the problem is we've always lost so many people to so many different medical emergencies so many different medical problems.
*  I mean what if the government changed the way people were allowed to eat because we talked about the money that's like all the heart disease and all the money that is going towards treating heart disease.
*  And we have to put a stop to this.
*  It's become a real issue in this country.
*  We're losing half a million people a year or whatever it is to heart disease and heart attacks.
*  We have to stop this.
*  And so we're going to enforce certain rules and regulations in terms of how you can eat.
*  Once you accept this principle it's there's a lot of different ways that you could you could go down this this line.
*  And the other big one I would say is like climate change.
*  I mean if you accept that covid was this emergency so that we have to lock everyone in their houses and all this stuff.
*  Well OK you have a whole bunch of people who are arguing that climate change is an existential crisis that's going to you know make all things the planet uninhabitable for uninhabitable excuse me for for all living things.
*  Well then by that logic wouldn't that be worth locking people in their homes over.
*  And so this is it's very dangerous once you've set this precedent that the government can do this and they all look around at each other and realize we got away with this.
*  And by the way that's not even if you believe the lockdowns were the right thing to do for covid which I don't.
*  But even if you believe that you'd still have to be concerned about this like authoritarianism that we've kind of like ushered in over this last year it doesn't mean that that's not a danger anymore.
*  You know what I mean.
*  Like even if you think chemotherapy is necessary to kill the cancer you still have to worry about all the other you know like effects of chemotherapy.
*  And so that's that to me is what's very dangerous about all of this.
*  Joe Biden ran on the idea that he's open to another round of lockdowns and I wonder if people realize like how devastating the last round of lockdowns were and how devastating it would be to do it again.
*  I don't know.
*  I hope your version was right.
*  Has it really opened.
*  When you say well like in certain places like L.A. is locked down.
*  Yeah yeah well never really opened.
*  Right right.
*  They opened a few like things for a few weeks like gyms and nail salons and they closed it back down again.
*  Right.
*  So yeah so in some places it is still pretty locked down and then in some places it's kind of quasi locked down not quite as much as it was back in March April May.
*  But yeah no New York City has never been the same and businesses have been destroyed people's lives have been destroyed over this.
*  It's a it's a real it's a real awful thing.
*  New York City has some crazy amount of apartments that are open like it's bananas.
*  People have been bailing on New York City.
*  Yeah like I think the last check was like double the amount of normal apartments that are available.
*  Yeah that makes sense.
*  Yeah people have been moving out like crazy and it's hard.
*  It was hard for a while to get like any numbers on it.
*  But I know like stories I've heard people who work for moving companies saying like you can't book us to move.
*  We're completely booked up like we're moving everybody.
*  They're all going out of the city.
*  You halls were really hard to get triple.
*  Look at that empty empty rental apartments in Manhattan triple hitting nearly 16000.
*  Well and that was October 8th.
*  I bet it's even worse now.
*  Month later.
*  But that's not vacancy rate in Manhattan which is typically 2 to 3 percent is now under 6 percent.
*  Wow.
*  I just saw something about Los Angeles or some counties in California might be getting rolling back now because the numbers are going up again.
*  Oh really.
*  The numbers are going up again.
*  And of course that all this stuff isn't just the lockdowns.
*  It was also all the riots over this summer and the fear that these riots were going to get worse and worse and the looting and the looting.
*  Yeah. Not that it was already pretty bad but the fear was kind of like oh I guess especially when it was a really crazy thing to see the cops step back
*  and just let people loot.
*  Oh yeah. It was basically just like OK you're going to do it.
*  Go for it.
*  Well I believe in Santa Monica the sheriff gave orders for the cops to stand down.
*  See if that's true because people were criticizing her.
*  They were really upset.
*  And even if there's not even if that hasn't been talked about in other areas it was pretty clear that they were given orders to stand down in a lot of places.
*  Well when the numbers get so high I mean the cops had abandoned that Minneapolis police station.
*  Right. And it got to the point where they were overcoming the police station.
*  They let them light the police station on fire.
*  Yeah. Like when I got up in the morning after the the shithead hit the fan in L.A.
*  and I saw this video of these cop cars like on on the highway just lit on fire one after the other covered in spray paint windows smashed in.
*  I was like whoa. Yeah.
*  This is in L.A. This is not in Minnesota.
*  This is not Minneapolis where it actually happened.
*  This is nowhere near it.
*  And they're lighting other cop cars on fire.
*  Santa Monica police chief stepped down a couple of weeks ago.
*  OK. Recognizing that recent events both here in Santa Monica and around the nation have strained community police relations.
*  Chief renowned has made the decision to step aside so the Santa Monica Police Department can continue to move forward.
*  A statement announcing her retirement said I'm pretty sure she told the cops to stand down.
*  It starts off saying that like a man anger over her response to the protest.
*  Yeah. They the idea was that this is the same idea that the mayor of New York acted on that you let them burn out let them get it out of their system.
*  Which is that really sucks if you happen to be one of those people caught in burning it out.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  You know. Yeah. Like that's a that's pretty rough.
*  You also open up the door to the fact that this can happen again.
*  And if it does happen again you're not going to do anything again.
*  Well and it does. And it seems like there's no at this point now it's like if there is an incident that comes out where a cop killed a black guy we're not even going to wait to figure out what happened here.
*  Do an investigation. Was this an unjustified shooting. Was it justified.
*  It's just going to be the first knee jerk reaction is like let's start you know burning stuff down.
*  You know like very disturbing and incredibly destructive.
*  I say that as somebody who's like not a fan of policing in this country and think we do have major problems.
*  But I always write from the very beginning in Minneapolis was like OK this is like completely unacceptable.
*  You can't like support people destroying communities because they're pissed off about an unrelated thing.
*  Yeah. And any more than you can support the U.S. you know invading Iraq because they're pissed off about 9 11.
*  Right. Like you can't just be like hey this guy did something to me so I'm going to go take it out on this guy.
*  And then people give you these like response like so you care more about looting than about human lives or something.
*  And you're like well that's why is it a choice. Like why can't I be against all of it. Yeah.
*  Why. I know it's a weird narrative.
*  Well there was that there's been a lot of the those this year like there was the oh you just want to get a haircut was a big narrative.
*  If you like opposed the lockdowns. Yeah.
*  Well you're kind of like that's do you really think that's all that human life is leaving your home is just getting a haircut.
*  It's not like I don't know you know seeing your family or getting a cancer screening or you know like whatever all of human life pretty much.
*  It's just reduced to you just want a haircut. You being able to make your own decisions.
*  Yeah. Like you being able to if you like one thing you're allowed to do is enter into the protests.
*  So people were protesting and everybody thought that was OK.
*  So you're shoulder to shoulder which I agree with. I don't I don't have any problem with protests.
*  I think it's you have a point you're allowed to it's part of freedom of assembly.
*  It's part of the Constitution the Bill of Rights. It's part of who we are.
*  You're allowed to protest things that you disagree with. Yeah. If you're peaceful I absolutely agree with you.
*  But if you're going to allow people to do that you should also allow them to go to the gym.
*  You should also allow them to go to comedy clubs. You should also allow them to go to restaurants.
*  You should allow them to do whatever they want.
*  And if you say well you have to have a consideration that you're going to get all these other people sick if you get sick.
*  OK. But you have to have that with everything. You have to have that with no one said hey I understand that you want to protest.
*  And I'm with you. But here's the problem. This could spread the disease.
*  Please don't do it. No one said that. No one said that.
*  Like do you remember when it first happened when the when the protests first like started and basically the media and even a whole bunch of like epidemiologists and stuff were like no it's OK.
*  It's OK for the protest. That to me was like one of the craziest moments I've ever lived through. Cognitive dissonance.
*  Like and I've like all the time talk about how corrupt and how the corporate press are all liars and stuff and all.
*  But to actually see that that they would go like it was like OK it was like three months of this complete change of the American way of life where it's like listen we all got to do this.
*  You have to give up everything and stay home because we got to control this disease.
*  And then like they were like oh my god there were 20 year olds at the beach. Oh my god they're going to spread it.
*  And then like two days later it was like no this is totally fine. Yeah.
*  You're like what the fuck is going on. How could you possibly rob everything from people.
*  But then you decide that because they're protesting a cause that we agree like we agree with the cause.
*  Therefore this is OK. That was fucking weird. There's no negative consequences to it at all. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Like that was really bizarre. And then there were things you know I heard a lot of these kind of like anecdotal stories like people would tell.
*  But I mean there were things where like you know I heard this one story that always stuck with me about a guy whose wife was pregnant and they it for she got sick and it looked like they might lose the baby and they wouldn't let her in.
*  They wouldn't let him in the appointment with her. So she had to know they didn't lose the baby. Thank God.
*  And everything was fine. But they like she was going into a sonogram to maybe find out that they had lost the baby and they wouldn't let him be there to like hold her hand through that.
*  Right. And it's just like I don't know what if you could put a value on that or whatever. But that's quite a thing to ask someone not to be able to do.
*  And then to have epidemiologists go like well we think that this protesting is so important that you can go do it.
*  You're like so are you telling that guy that that wasn't important enough. Like that wasn't important for him to be there with an individual.
*  That's a controlled environment. You could test. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*  And so it's just it's pretty and that really did a lot to like undermine people's confidence in like the scientists and you know you want to say follow the science.
*  It's like yeah but this isn't science. That's politics. You recognize that there's a lot of malarkey. This is not all 100 percent straightforward.
*  Yeah. I was talking to a guy who's a very intelligent guy and he was we were talking about one of these recent studies with COVID and UV light.
*  And how it shows that it dies very quickly in sunlight. And he goes well that's why there was no spread after the riots.
*  I go did they stop when it went dark. What are you talking about. There was a spread like there was an uptick.
*  It was going down and then it came back up again. I mean it's all like within a week or two of the riots starting.
*  Like you can you can see the cases. But it's not even like that. He wanted to believe it. Yeah. No I understand.
*  He's not a part of the media and there was no one around but me. Yeah.
*  But sometimes people it's a very powerful thing to start with like an emotional position and then rationalize from there. Yeah.
*  And like we all do that. You know like myself included a thing where you want to come you want to say things and the other person says the same thing.
*  You both agree. You agree to this weird mantra. Yeah. And then you and you reinforce it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*  You just bounced it off each other and so we're both more sure that we're both on the right team.
*  But the weirdest part about it then was that so then they'd go like OK oh my God some kids went to spring break these evil killers like how could these kids do this.
*  They don't care about grandma. And then two days later we're protesting and that's totally fine. We're not going to get covered that way.
*  And then another day later it's like oh wait Trump had a rally. Oh I mean this is going to spread covered like crazy and it's got so bananas that it's like dude like your agenda is showing.
*  It's just obvious way. And you can maybe defend that agenda but that's an agenda. Yeah. That's not science. It's so inconsistent. Yeah. Yeah.
*  It's ridiculous. It's not science. But you know I think also people felt like this is a real chance for change and they're willing to take a risk.
*  You know that these protests were important because they they they represented enough is enough and that people are going to get out in the streets and even if windows got broken and things got lit on fire at the end of the day we're going to fix all that and calm it down.
*  And this was the idea behind it. Yeah. But I think if you really wanted to make a change then they couldn't have done a worse job of how they went about it.
*  And I understand it's a lot of different people so it's not like any one person you can blame. But like if you like if you might my buddy Scott Horton who's fucking genius by the way Scott Horton at the Libertarian Institute and he oh I'm wearing a shirt.
*  Oh yeah. But he he said and I really love this he said when Black Lives Matter first came out he was like and he's like as against police brutality as any human being on the planet he's been writing about this for decades and he's like he goes don't call it Black Lives Matter.
*  Call it accountability for killer cops and just run with that like just run with the narrative that look this is what we want and it's something you can't argue for.
*  Don't insert the racial thing it's going to get played in a million different ways it'll it ends up like creating all these dynamics that aren't helpful to getting to the root of the problem which is we want these five major policy reforms.
*  You know we want to you know accountability for killer cops and the war on drugs and qualified immunity and civil asset forfeiture you know like pick some really important things that would actually save lives and go hard at those.
*  But the problem is that then you have the way the movement goes and then you have the rioting and stuff like that and the looting and then this ends up turning a lot of people off who would maybe be sympathetic.
*  But don't you think that over and over again you see white cop black victim white cop black victim over and over and over again you see this narrative whether or not it's representative of interactions with cops as a whole it doesn't matter because those are the videos that go viral.
*  I think there's probably millions of interactions where nothing goes wrong at all but those don't matter what matters is when they do go viral so many times Eric Gardner this George Floyd case so many times white cop black victim.
*  So they have you have to acknowledge the racial aspect of it I think just by saying it justice against killer cops or get rid of killer cops you're you're not addressing the thing that is maybe most disturbing to many people is that it keeps being a white cop and a black man.
*  I think that there are there are certainly videos where that is the case there's also a lot of videos where that's not the case they don't get the same amount of play in the press but the ones that become viral these big stories but what the question might be why those ones become such big stories and the other ones don't.
*  My point is that if you when you play up the racial like aspect of it what you end up doing is then you so then you start having this conversation we're having we're okay so about twice as many white people are unarmed white people are killed by cops every year than black people but black people aren't half the population of white people so black people are like 13% of the population so for them to be you know whatever it is like 40% something like that of the killings it is disproportionate then you have to take into account where the high crime numbers are.
*  How many neighborhoods are how many interactions they're having with police like I I understand there are these videos that go viral what happened to me in my opinion what happened to George Floyd was like at horrific and people should go to jail over that shit I think what happened to Brianna Taylor was horrific and people should go to jail over that shit it's not clear to me at all that race was a factor in those cases I could be wrong about that I just haven't really seen any evidence to suggest that it was but maybe it is I just think that you you end up going down this route so one of the
*  activists in Minneapolis said this thing and this is where like woke ism comes in to poison this shit from my perspective so he said they don't want to call it call it police brutality anymore they want to call it systemic racism because this is just another form of systemic racism forget the term police brutality and what ends up happening when you look at things that way is what you don't get rid of is police brutality what you end up getting rid of is antemima you know it becomes a distraction
*  of other issues rather than focusing on the major issues that you care about and to my I'm just saying listen I'm just saying if you wanted to be effective I think black lives matter would be better off to share some of those videos of it happening to white people also and go look this isn't just black people's problem this is a cop on civilian problem this is a government authoritarian problem there have been some that went viral the one that was most disturbing to me was the guy in Phoenix shaver I believe his last name was in the hallway yeah crawling they made
*  him crawl and he kept reaching back to pick his pants up as they were falling down he's crying and begging for his life and the guy lit him up on the ground the worst one I've ever seen it's insane because he made the guy crawl to him and then he gunned him down as he was crawling to him and he's screaming at him the whole time yeah screaming at him well you know and he had a toy gun or something like that and they saw him with a toy gun out the window and they called in the SWAT team so they came in geared up and revved up there's been a lot of police brutality videos
*  the Sandra Bland one is particularly disturbing yeah she didn't do anything wrong like he's telling her to put her cigarette out in her car like who the fuck are you to tell her to put her cigarette out? that's the one who died in jail she hung herself or something happened or something happened we don't know that's part of the problem but the racial aspect of it when you're a if you're a person who's a black person or any person of color and you see over and over again a white cop killing a black person whether it's representative I mean you're not gonna think when you see
*  those videos oh well there's a million interactions and most of them are positive you're just gonna know your experiences with cops and if cops have bullied you and fuck with you or maybe you've been a victim of police brutality yourself and then you're gonna think of how many times it's been a white cop doing it to a black person and I think the number is not insignificant it has to be addressed yeah look I certainly understand why that would be a lot of people's perspective I get that completely I'm just saying that from the way I look at it is
*  like I think that for one like really for the first time that I've ever seen I thought leading up to the George Floyd situation that right wingers were really getting red-pilled on cops like they were actually getting really pissed off at the cops because the cops were the ones enforcing these lockdowns and they were against it and there was a lot of like stuff where right wingers would be like can you believe these cops are actually doing this if they'll shut down you know they were shutting down churches that's something that pisses right wingers off and there and so and then when the
*  George Floyd thing came out I think pretty much everybody I'm not everybody but the vast majority of the public was like that is really horrible what happened to that guy yeah and I think there was a lot of energy that could have actually been used for real change and I think that what's happened since then has basically blown it because that you see what happens then when people see rioting and looting who do they who do they want they want the cops yeah they want the cops back it's like it's almost like that was proof like it's almost like
*  you're working to prove the right wingers right about what they thought about the cops to begin with which is that well if we don't have cops this is what we have just looting and rioting and violence well if you don't have cops and then you have civil unrest and also you have a bunch of people that have no money because they've been locked down for all this time and then you have opportunity because you get sheriffs like the one in Santa Monica that tells everybody to stand down then you have chaos yeah that's that's it's a recipe for disaster but it's also it's real easy to break
*  things it's not so easy to fix them it's not so easy to bring it all back together again the way it was 11 months ago like try try getting there right now it's gonna take you 11 years well that's right and and you may never get it you might not know I like one thing that I think that I think people the the ones who really wanted Trump out and I understand why a lot of them did I think a lot of people just had like Trump fatigue like they're like I just can't deal with this bullshit anymore like I just can't but I think they they
*  should realize the possibility that we're never going to a pre Trump world again like never 100% right you know and I think we may never go to a pre covid world again and we may never go to a pre you know Black Lives Matter world again like we might get closer to that than we are now but I don't know that we'll ever go back to that time completely in the same way that we never went to a pre 9 11 world again or a pre Kennedy assassination world yeah yeah there's there's certain events in our our history that they change us forever and this is most certainly
*  one of those events but you probably could have said the same thing about the Spanish flu although I don't think the government or the media was a sophisticated back then and there was a lot more there's a lot more hardship in the world period and and then what happened right after the Spanish flu was the roaring 20s right that was immediately afterwards and then of course the Great Depression there's been a lot of ups and downs and hills and valleys back then but those people got through that and then stop wearing masks so when it's weird when you see the photos from the Spanish flu I never
*  knew that they were wearing masks that people wore masks in public but you look at these old black and white photos it's really kind of interesting like you know oh look at that it's almost like I know they're real pictures but if they weren't like someone's like Photoshop masks on these people and and pretended that there was a pandemic back then that's what it looked like it looked almost fake yeah yeah I know I've seen some of those those photos but I know what you mean where I think like what you said is really the the heart of it that you go life was just so much harder back then it was
*  like oh my god look at this yeah people sitting around looks like they're watching a baseball is a football game look at them they all have masks on crazy but they still want to see the game you hear about the flu being down dramatically look at these all these players have masks on isn't that nuts the football squad has masks on what year is that Jamie I typed in Spanish flu sport football game because I've never seen this picture so it says it's 1918 over on this one too so hmm wow that's nuts so did they ultimately come up with a vaccine
*  for the Spanish flu is that how they're playing baseball with the fucking masks on wow see doesn't that seem fake to you I know it's real yeah but it seems like what I don't I never saw these before like nobody that guy's a rebel he's on parlor he doesn't wear like I also saw something that was like this was not actual they didn't wear a mask but like I couldn't I couldn't I don't know which was actually I think we got to stop people from wearing masks in their Twitter profiles fuck stop that's basically the same thing as your pronoun
*  in your bio it's basically the exact same thing stop letting everybody else know that you're a good person if you want to be a good person just go be a good person some people do podcasts with masks on I've seen that really oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah see by the way this is what I hate all of this shit where it's like how about like and this is one of the things that I hate about like wokeism in general too is that it lets everybody kind of like pretend they're like let everyone else know they're a good person
*  but you don't actually have to do shit did you see Kamala Harris at one of the press conferences wearing a mask while she was talking one of her speeches she had a mask on while she was speaking there's so many things that are so weird about this whole this whole response where you're like that doesn't even make sense even by your own logic no one's near you see when they fuck you're on a podium so they canceled the second debate between Trump and Biden and then they both had live events the night of the debate like they just both had an event that he did one with Trump did one with NBC and
*  Biden did one with CNN you guys so fucking like get on a plane and fucking debate each other like what are you doing well I think the first one was so aggressive like what what Trump did was so disruptive and aggressive that it was a bad strategy yes and I think the second one was brilliant if he did in the first one what he did in the second one I think you would have much more momentum coming into the election or maybe if he had had the the middle one so there were three debates you know like if that one hadn't been canceled he
*  would have had two more opportunities what was the third one that well the third one was the one you're talking about the second one the second one let's just talk about the actual yeah no but I'm just saying like maybe if he had had another debate where he could have handled it the way he did in that second one also maybe if he had two performances like that right helped him a little bit right but I see what you're saying yeah if he just did that in the first without the bad one without the interrupty one that was just so hard to listen to it was like I was like god damn cuz you know that was when there was talk about like Trump was tweeting that he wanted to come on here
*  and have me and him and Biden talk for four hours and I was like what would I do if he was doing that I would have to stop him I would have to say hey man again sir I know I understand you the president Mr. Trump you can't do that because you got to let the guy talk and then don't say anything and then you talk like this is the only way this is gonna work yeah but I think you would have handled it like that in a way better way than than Chris Wallace he's doing the best he could and he's also he's got 90 minutes which is preposterous and they have two minutes to answer questions which is ridiculous
*  these are really important questions like why do you have two minutes like what if after two minutes like I think I got a better way to say that no shut the fuck up stop two minutes are over sir your time is up your time is up like what what kind of why is there a race it's insane it makes no sense at all and that's what one of my favorite things about this show is that you've almost proven I think it's part of the reason why so many so many of those establishment types like resent you a lot for it is that you've proven that their whole model is stupid like this model is stupid well you have a show where people
*  need time to unpack things and have a long conversation if you're talking about really serious complex issues the idea that we're debating who gets to have the nuclear football but we've got to do it in this limited time and you'll have 30 seconds each it's also is
*  retarded they don't know what they're gonna talk about that's important to one of the important things about podcast is there's no no one ever sits down with like okay we're gonna hit this and then we're gonna hit that Alex Jones tried to the producer well he had things that he wanted to talk about that were important yeah he that he felt were important and that's not what you're saying you're talking about more of like the scripted kind of talking about me bringing things up with them like if I said sir your job reform or you know
*  the job numbers and have elevated what do you attribute that to like that kind of shit where they get to prepare if you have enough time to let these guys talk just talk and no pressure whatsoever on figuring out how to answer a sentence or a subject rather coherently you're gonna get a better understanding of who that person is now with Trump everybody thinks they already have a good understanding who he is because he goes in these long rambling self-serving
*  diatribes about subjects but to have just to see that if you get him to calm down a little and see Biden and him talking through things just let him talk let him talk through things let Biden say something about Trump let Trump say something about Biden don't say you only have two minutes don't say any of that shit just let him talk see what that so see what happens I wish that would have happened that would have been fascinating that really would have been and by the way I think Trump because Trump is kind of a master troll
*  I think he knew that Biden would never agree to it and that's half the reason why I did it no he would never fucking agree there's no way that would not have been good for Biden it would be so beneath him to come here to like what are you doing but would it though I mean dude you're fucking ways well yeah I guess I think the corporate press would have lost their shit if they because if they lose that to you then they've just lost everything would you would you have Trump on ex-president Trump it doesn't seem like a smart move at this point but I think all of those like it like in a year I don't know we're talking a year
*  that'd be great dude he's gonna run again if he maybe they boot about office in 2024 he's gonna start running in January and yeah he's gonna run for four years he's gonna talk shit for four years I have a feeling Trump's uh they're gonna really come after him in his post presidency I think he's gonna be off Twitter I think he's gonna get completely like the Alex Jones treatment on social media and I think that there's gonna be they're legally gonna try to come after him I think there's no way you're right they can't just let him they
*  can't just let him be Trump which would be amazing but they can't just let him be Trump he's literally he could set up his own oval office and say I am the real president I'm the real president this is now the oval office and I'm giving the military commands from here they stole it from me didn't you have some wacky painting with like him sitting there and like all the other presidents behind him with like his their hands on his shoulder or something am I remembering this correctly I don't know this I think he had something in the oval office that was like really preposterous
*  where people saw it and like what in the fuck are you doing just so there it is right there I mean they're all sitting around Ronald Reagan's at the table Nixon's there Lincoln Lincoln he's uh he's next to Eisenhower is he the only one that's I know who's Eisenhower's a tie as well no I don't know Roosevelt Roosevelt has a tie yeah Eisenhower's in the yellow Eisenhower's relaxed he's retired it's just Reagan and there's GW in there is that the pain that he has on his wall
*  Trump hangs fantasy painting with other GOP presidents at the White House look at that so he's got this president them all yuck yuck yucking away we're all having a great old time with you oh wow Lincoln's there oh how weird is that imagine they're all looking at Trump when Lincoln's alive you'd be like hey man what was it like in 1776 you wouldn't be talking to Trump that's hilarious him with his red tie
*  they would all be staring at Lincoln going Jesus how'd you get here what's going on man probably you'd be like holy shit Eisenhower's alive holy shit Lincoln holy shit yeah you just pulled Lincoln and Eisenhower aside Eisenhower's speech about the military industrial complex when he's leaving offices to this day one of the most chilling things I've ever seen it's right up there with Oppenheimer talking about quoting the Bhagavad Gita after he detonated the bomb yeah it's like whoa yeah well
*  what is this thing like I am the maker of death or something like that well he quotes Shiva I am become death destroyer of worlds yeah yeah that is that's creepy but Eisenhower's thing I think I could be wrong about this but I believe that Trump went in the clip we played earlier is the second president to ever use the term military industrial complex I don't know I could be wrong about that but I've never heard another president say the term military industrial complex other than Eisenhower and his farewell
*  dress and and Trump and that and it was particularly you know crazy coming from Eisenhower who's the fucking general you know like he's the guy who led the victory in World War two which leads to this creation of really what we know is the military industrial complex and even as he's going he's like listen let me tell you something we've created something here that we got to really worry about because we're not America anymore the way we
*  have been before this now we have a whole industry that's pushing toward war and we got a guard against this power and he specifically he says sought or unsought there's a really interesting way to put it it's like even if they're not trying to there's kind of these natural forces of like you're a weapons company so what do you think yeah you think we should have a bigger military budget or smaller one right probably a bigger one right and then it's like so all of these forces and then the next president after Eisenhower is a JFK
*  who you know some shit went down there so it's wrapped it up real quick yeah so there's just there's a lot of really you know kind of interesting history there but that we let's just say we didn't listen to Eisenhower and we did not guard against power sought by the military industrial complex yeah it's um what it's such an interesting choice too because I guess he had the ability to say whatever he wanted in the nation's address
*  being the president like it seems pretty clear that he didn't have to run that by anyone and you wonder what do they have to run by now when when you have the discussion where people say oh they always lie when they want to get into president into office and then they get into office they don't do shit they don't do any of the things they said they were going to do what happens when you get in there you know is it like the Bill Hicks joke where they show you an angle of the Kennedy assassination and then you know well what's my agenda is that it or
*  is it do they show you a real model of the world that you're not privy to if you're not the president do they sit you down and talk about all the threats and the problems and how it all really works and ties together like what is it it's and and it's you know I don't know but it's also possible that it's kind of somewhere in between where there's maybe they're not you know showing you the Kennedy assassination film like the great Bill Hicks joke but you know look I know that Donald Trump got in there and he ran on
*  we're ending all of these wars and that's it these were now you know from like a Trumpian perspective it wasn't like a Ron Paul you know like these wars kill all these innocent people it was like a Trump like this is bad business you know we're wasting money on these wars so we're ending them like I'm too smart for them Trump is blasting the military industrial complex but he's one of its biggest boosters well that's that's true too that's that's for sure has made the purchase public display and foreign sales of military hardware a major priority
*  of his administration yeah I found two articles that were talking about like he says the stuff about the military industrial complex however his actions say differently like he gave them more money than anybody ever oh yeah no there were increased defense budgets under Donald Trump for sure right but
*  they're also he's he do you think he really actually is trying to get out of these countries though I mean you could do both things right you can increase the defense budget but not do it in an offensive way increase it defensively increase the amount of money that you give to the troops their ability to fight
*  Isis the ability to make new weapons and innovate yeah you could do both things simultaneously right I think that at least from everything I've read that he really is trying to get out of Afghanistan and that he really is trying to work out a deal to end that war here says the idea that Trump is taking on the defense and industrial base is pure fantasy a national security action national security action a liberty advocacy group composed a former Obama administration staffers said on Tuesday all right we're good Jamie shut that off but
*  look I mean there is I will say though to Trump's credit he did avoid getting us in another war and there were some opportunities yeah and he he avoided he flirted with it certainly in Iran and and and really in Venezuela as well but he never got us into that war and there were definitely a lot of people around him who really wanted him to get into those wars and he did avoid that but you know like when he first came in and he was running
*  on like ending all of these wars the guy the military guy who he made his national security advisor was Flynn like that was his guy who was going to come in and lead us out of these wars and what happened immediately the NSA and the FBI targeted Flynn got dirt on him got him removed and then they get somebody else in there so it might be also that they don't necessarily have to like threaten your family or show you the angle of JFK but they could just be like well we're just going to remove all the people from your cabinet who we don't like
*  kind of get our people in there and keep the machine rolling that flinch had a spooky because you think that a guy gets to that level the military he's immune to that not him now and he is from what I've heard like a little bit of a crazy guy but he was not working with the Russians that was just complete bullshit and and they had nothing on the FBI completely set him up it's just so amazing that they can do that what's up Jamie I was just like I'd complete his member he wanted to run that parade where he did actually do it where he brought in all the
*  tanks and missiles and troops and fucking showed off everything we have oh yeah yeah that was a big thing he wanted no Trump was not my cock basically I'll get my giant metal cock out there dragging it down the street that's basically what it all came down to fuck Dave it's so depressing what can you do what do you do to stay happy what do you do what do I do yeah what do you do to avoid just getting sucked into this constant state well
*  I uh existential whoa I got a perfect little two-year-old and uh you know I love my wife so but that's but really that's the best you can do is try to try to like get good people around you in your life be good to them create your own little world as much as you can and then I think that you like the the best thing is to try to keep perspective that even with all the fucked up shit in the world there's always been a ton of fucked up shit in the world
*  and people have always people have persevered through far worse than what we're going through right now and I think that's kind of the best out you know take to have that's what keeps me sane yeah right make your your little circle happy who are you around the people you're around be kind be friendly have a good time be nice to each other enjoy your time together enjoy each other's company yeah just not this you know when you think about what you can do in terms of
*  impacting the world or impacting the country it's real it's a cliche to say start with the people that are around you it really is cliche but it is kind of true because you do have a ripple effect on the way you treat people and the friendships you have and and that how it affects other people and the more good people that you're around the more they affect other people there's really some kind of a ripple effect if we can get more people to adopt it that's where
*  mushroom legalization comes in yeah well that's a that's a that's what they had some good uh they had some good victories for mushroom organs like fuck it do coke yeah yeah organs like look if you're gonna light everything on fire all the time how about do mushrooms do whatever the fuck you want just stop lighting things on fire yeah but you know what it's the it by the way it's great that they did that and it's the smartest thing to you know the the whole the the whole idea of drugs being illegal the war on drugs is so misguided and just awful and just ruins people's lives
*  creates black markets leads to violent crime destroys neighborhoods it's at least i'd say probably 60 percent of the entire immigration problem is just the war on drugs you know they constantly they'll be like uh well there's these gang members who are smuggling drugs over the borders and it's like well yeah why because there's a demand for them and they're in the market and it's illegal so this is where you get it from and yeah of course there's crime associated with that too i mean it's like so it is the and mushrooms is just the idea that it's illegal isn't
*  insane i mean it's like it's first of all you can't get addicted physically i don't think you could get addicted your body will reject it after a certain point of time like you can't it's never made anyone do anything fucking well people okay maybe not that's an overstatement it's not especially broken people it's not a huge problem that people are taking mushrooms and committing violent crimes there's just really no justification for it especially when there's alcohol all over the place yeah come on fucking liquor stores every other corner it's too easy to get some drugs and impossible to get others and the fact that the ones
*  that are super beneficial like there's a study that i posted the other day on my instagram that they show that psilocybin therapies four times more effective for treating depression than than anti-depressants that we're currently using yeah i mean there's the war on drugs somebody wrote an article that the war on drugs was uh that drugs were a big winner in 2020 in the war on drugs because of the elections drugs won in a lot of places like legalize marijuana in new jersey montana
*  portland says fuck it let's go with everything i think uh the drugs have fought a real guerrilla strategy in the war on drugs it's been 40 years of the cops just kicking their fucking ass but drugs never gave up they always hung in there they disappear and then they come back strong like what what drugs have uh gone down in usage what wait what what and during the war on drugs what drugs what drugs have people maybe heroin not even heroin pills like shooting up
*  maybe yeah i mean i i don't even know shooting out quite a lot of things have gone away that were really right but they don't pass yeah but i think it's unrelated to the legality of it i think these things kind of ebb and flow right like there was like crack cocaine came and and kind of left and then heroin like got big again but they were all illegal the whole time it's not like they were gone because they're illegal people who are doing heroin people who are throwing their lives away with really hard drugs are not affected by a law and people who would never do heroin are not going to
*  start doing heroin because it's legal do you remember just say no we we oh yeah you're younger i was young for that but i do remember it yeah i remember i was i believe i was in high school i remember it was around that maybe i was early 20s but i remember seeing that going what in the fuck did you just say just say no oh you fixed it yeah we didn't know there was an option i didn't know you could just say no if only someone had given me this tool there's certain things in the past that are just like you look back you'll what do you remember the yell the codes
*  for like what was the possibility of a terrorist attack word code orange i'd go oh shit it's code orange what does that mean and it was so much just to keep everyone in a state of fear oh did you guys see we went from orange to red today oh that's bad code red what do they know that we don't know that's what california is in now for the covet stuff for like they're in purple whatever like purple is your dick blue balls turned your dick gangrene it won't let you leave the house for eight months but it is it's always like when you've got like a
*  decade to look back at the shit that's when you always see how full of shit the government was like oh they were so full of shit about that they're full that's when you look back and you see you know dick cheney going we're going to find those weapons of mass destruction they're here somewhere and you're like oh he was just lying to all of us this was complete bullshit what was uh the was it colin powell that said the uh the proof might come in the form of a mushroom cloud i believe that was condoleezza rice who said that uh but colin powell went to the un with drawings
*  of saddam hussein's mobile wmd like fucking trucks or something and he was like this is where they go down here and this is where they go it's just all made up nonsense but just like really selling it like really
*  wonder what they told him wonder if he believed it while he was saying it you know because he didn't seem like the type of guy be lying about something like that but then they always he's like the one that they kind of like vindicate later like he's supposed to be the good one
*  he never you know behind closed doors he really never wanted this war it's like but then he went and sold it to everybody wouldn't that make him even worse like i mean look you can resign like that is an option you don't have to just go like well i'm against this but they want me to sell a war based on lies so gotta be a team player and go you know get the country in a war how about don't do that do you think that he ever really did believe it though was there maybe a time where he got the evidence and he was like oh shit this is real
*  i don't know i think that um he was you know he was a part of the first iraq war and i think that there's there my guess is that there might be part of him who really wanted to go fucking takes the dom out as you could imagine if you were leading a military invasion and some of your men were killed by this guy even though not too many were killed but i'm sure you'd have a personal a personal thing and so i think that might have been part of it i think they all you know you can't remove
*  it from the context that george hw bush's you know presidency they fought a war in iraq and then w's in there and now all of a sudden basically was handed a blank check for war like well 9-eleven just happened what do you want what war do you want you got it because whatever one you decide but make it a good one you know and remember how many people were behind it though oh yeah oh my god it was a blind patriotism time folks who don't remember you're too young and in uh 2001 when the iraq war hit
*  before excuse me when 9-eleven hit we were overwhelmed by american flags on cars it was crazy like it was way way different than anything i'd seen before you would drive to work and everyone would have an american flag in their car i was like i remember looking around going whoa this is nuts but there was also this weird feeling of unity like people were letting people in front of them in their lane there was this weird feeling of we're together well it's a really interesting it's really interesting that you say that because you're right
*  it was the most unified we've ever been and that almost is the other part that unity isn't necessarily good like unity can go in some bad places too so you know what joe biden's call for unity now well we had real unity uh after 9-eleven i mean as much as you you could have and what we did was basically get behind george w bush as he ruined the 21st century we thought we were getting behind george w bush because we thought there was weapons of mass destruction in iraq and he was going to go
*  in there and take him out yeah but it's much easier when everybody's unified and behind a leader it's much easier to be persuaded that he's doing this great thing for all of us and yeah i think people were behind him for somewhat noble reasons like yeah we're gonna go get the guys who got us um and by the end of george bush's you know like nowadays looking back at george bush it's hard for people who were like young then or weren't alive then to even imagine that he was a really popular president because by the end he had given us two disastrous
*  wars and the worst economy and he was really popular right after 9-eleven uh-huh yeah like he gave a great speech in new york i loved him then yeah i was in yeah we were all in do you remember we had that mission accomplished banner over that yeah everybody was like what the
*  fuck are you talking about we're still there and we're still there yeah we're still there now mission accomplished yeah what's the mission well i suppose he could say we took out saddam hussein yeah i mean if that was the mission like okay i was watching saddam hussein's trial yesterday oh yeah i watched watched on youtube it popped up and suddenly watched this it was wild he's screaming at the judge he's screaming the judge is one of his guys who works for us in his underwear like like it was so strange and he's screaming at the god that he wouldn't uh that judge that he wouldn't
*  let uh them have a prayer break or do you remember do you ever see that part where he's like we should have a prayer break now and he's like this is a court of law and he's like is this greater than allah and like yelling at it but it's really weird it's crazy to imagine like secular though didn't his administration was well relatively for for that part of the world but he was still you know like i mean it's they're they're all muslims you know and like you but it was really crazy to think this dictator who ruled over this country with an iron fist is now sitting there with a judge you know like
*  telling him what to do and it's just a very weird fucking dynamic yeah but that that war really fucking destroyed the fucking region man yeah it was such a bad idea to fucking overthrow saddam hussein it was like the worst foreign policy decision forget even just like the like oh this is you know evil we're going to kill all these innocent people just the like you are going to destroy this region and just throw it into chaos and isn't it weird that the idea of overthrowing an evil dictator can be a bad idea yeah it's weird right well you see
*  i would say like well you know i don't necessarily agree that we're the police force of the world but i do think that if anybody's going to do it it's going to be the united states right so let's go in and take out this bad guy but it's not that simple not at all not at all yeah no when you and even like supporting a dictator sometimes is like the best option in terms of like the loss of overall life that's the best which is a really weird decision like you have to you have to support someone who you know
*  is terrorizing their people because if you don't then you get what's in libya yeah which is like a failed state yeah it's a crazy place so much worse for the for regular people than it was under gadaffi do you remember the video of them capturing gadaffi when he got shoves a knife up his ass yep and he's just standing there he's in such shock dragging them beating them sodomizing them yeah he realized that they had him yeah and he realized that they had him and he's surrounded by all these people and this just look just full
*  shock the guy shoves a knife up his ass yeah like you see the guy do it and he's standing there like oh this knife goes up his ass like what imagine this country that you've ruled over for decades and then fucking just all of a sudden they've got you he ruled over when i was a kid yeah yeah he was he was the boogie man for a while they put him in place right the united states put him in place i feel like there was something either he or we supported him once he got in
*  place we did we support we supported him at one period in fact we were we were working with him after 9 11 he was really cooperating with the george w bush administration
*  um he was ratting out terrorists giving us the fucking terrorists he turned over all his chemical weapons and stuff he wanted to play ball he saw what the bush administration was doing and he was like okay i'm getting on team america here and uh that didn't do any good for him one of my favorite hillary clinton videos was her laughing after he was dead yeah her her going we came we saw he died
*  yeah it's like hey hillary like one of her handlers has to be like hey we're reminding you you're trying to convince these people you're human yeah there is this guy's is it a stick i don't think so is a knife i think so whatever he's shoving something up is it's a frame by frame breakdown
*  ass and that is a knife yeah that's all that was let me do that again right up his ass like dude i'm gonna be the guy you know how they have that flag is planted in iwo jima all the troops and they're standing there holding up that flag i wonder where that guy lives they got a bronze statue of him with the knife going right up to dom hussein's asshole yeah uh kadafis oh excuse me kadafi yeah i don't think so because the country's completely
*  been destroyed since then so that if they did have that statue it's probably fallen down and been melted and yeah turn into bullets yeah turn into bullets or help the slave trade there in some way they've seen the slave trade on youtube where you could watch the videos from libya yeah yeah insane yeah insane like slave auctions and this was by the way this is uh what this this whole thing we're talking about overthrowing gadaffi destroying the country leading to the open air slave trade markets this was all done under obama's administration with hillary clinton pushing
*  for it with joe biden as the vice president so again just the idea that like oh yay trump's gone and we've returned to normal all right but if normal is you know getting us into wars in uh libya in syria in yemen continuing the wars in iraq and afghanistan there's some pretty uh negative aspects to normal so what let's let's play not even devil's advocate but let's imagine what do you do if you don't help them overthrow libya if you do decide this guy's an evil dictator in
*  the world that has been for decades you want to get him out but what do you do do you fund the people that are trying to get him out if that doesn't work and what if it does work and they get him they get him out and they kill him like they did how do you ensure that democracy gets instituted when it's never been successful anywhere else that we've overthrown is there one place that we've overthrown they're like look at them now they're doing great uh germany and japan uh that would be that would be the examples right in germany and japan however in order to achieve that
*  we had to fight the bloodiest war in human history and straight up target civilians i mean in order to achieve that we had to just straight up be like yeah we're dropping bombs on women and children intentionally not like their collateral damage like we're nuking cities in japan we're doing and that seems like that doesn't seem like it's going to be achieved in the middle east i think the idea that we can do anything to ensure that there's a fair democratic process in libya is just so
*  beyond absurdity we are having trouble doing that here like the the washington dc washington has a huge crime problem these politicians can't even figure out crime in washington dc right the idea that they're going to take on the crime problem in libya is like so beyond absurd i just think like this country was never founded to be the policeman of the world we're not supposed to be an empire even though we are it's empires crumble and die we need to
*  entirely particularly now when we have so many problems at home entirely get out of the empire business it's we can try to like spread good ideas be a city on a hill be like hey guys this is a better way to run society but the idea that we have to get into the the internal politics of whether libya has a dictator or a democracy or a democracy is not necessarily any better of a situation if sixty percent of the people there want to kill the other forty percent democracy in gonna work out very well give everybody a vote who are
*  they gonna vote for so what do you do just hope they figured out on their own i think so but i mean look it's not it's like that's just the way the world works i don't think we i don't think we have a right to impose our will on on other people and i don't think it's effective to impose our will on other people and look at the results we're just wasted trillions of dollars we don't have for all of these post nine eleven wars we don't have one victory to show even anything that's even remotely close to a victory every one of the country's
*  we've been in is worse off now than it was before we got into them afghanistan's worse iraq's worse libya's worse syria's worse yemen is way way worse so it's just outside of libya and yemen can is it possible to say that the rest of the world is better off the way iraq is and the way afghanistan is today uh... that they're not overrun. Iran is better off for sure. Iran is better off they've taken over complete influence of that region so the enemies
*  of our enemies are our enemies. And now they're our enemies again. Now that's the problem that basically that's the problem that since the end of the bush administration all through the obama administration and into trump is that now their big problem is you know
*  iran just has all this influence in the region what are we going to do about that it's like well maybe if you didn't fucking fight a war on behalf of iran then they wouldn't have so much influence so there are there are winners like to all of this stuff honestly you know the big winner is the biggest winner of all of this says this is osama bin laden
*  he got exactly what he wanted
*  he drew america
*  into these fucking conflicts this was literally his plan was we could never destroy america but we could lure america
*  into the middle east and make themselves spend themselves into debt
*  you know like unravel their whole extend themselves way too far militarily this is how you get empires to collapse this was his plan. Well that was how they got rid of the soviet union right? Yeah and our cia taught him how to do it
*  yeah when he was with the mujahideen yeah when the soviet union was occupying afghanistan and they couldn't figure it out and they were like we got this we'll figure it out and do it right
*  yeah it's it's just no one ever no one ever gets it right after you get rid of a dictator like we don't have any examples other than hitler right?
*  yeah well it's i mean i'm sure there are a lot of people who are going to get rid of the soviet union
*  but usually it has to come from the people kind of like you know like realizing they want something better but of us getting rid of someone
*  is there any time that the united states overthrew a dictator and then everything got better?
*  yeah i mean i guess japan if you consider the emperor or whatever to be a dictator but
*  didn't he just bow down right? didn't he just surrender? yeah ultimately. was he still in charge? no and i don't know that he ever was really in charge
*  the different culture though. yeah it's a very different culture it's a different circumstance and also but look like the thing you were saying the problem with overthrowing a dictator is that
*  and it's something that people should consider in a lot of these situations that things can be worse you know like if you're going to get rid of a dictator
*  and you're going to get rid of a dictator you're going to get rid of a dictator you're going to get rid of a dictator you're going to get rid of a dictator
*  it can be worse you know like i mean maybe sometimes it couldn't be much worse you know what i mean? yeah. okay you're not going to get much worse than hitler or stalin
*  i mean i guess but it's hard to imagine but they would say like we went to war in world war one with the you know the precursor to nazi germany
*  you know there's that and it's not to say that there weren't any problems in like the prussian empire or in the german monarchs or anything like that
*  but you could go well look they're a bad guy we're going to get rid of them it's like okay well look at what you have now
*  it's really amazing that we've only dropped two nuclear bombs the two atomic bombs have gone off you want some of that? yeah
*  it's kind of amazing that no other country's ever done that
*  well it's also because then the soviets figured out the nuclear bomb and then ever since there was more than one country the only time nukes have ever been dropped is when only one country had nukes
*  and so there is something there about like the fact that people are scared to death of someone else also using nukes
*  and we've also never been to direct war with a nuclear armed power we don't fuck with people with nukes
*  no mutually assured destruction is real it really does make people act in a certain way
*  which is really you know in some ways counter intuitive because you think oh there's more nukes in the world there's going to be more nuclear attacks in the world
*  but actually it turns out that the elites of this world have a lot more in common with each other than they do with me or you
*  and so they kind of all have this gentleman's agreement where it's like look we'll have our soldiers go out and kill each other but let's not do anything that like
*  this is like when even in the cold war they'd be like we'll fight it out in Vietnam but like no one's going to Russia no one's coming to America
*  we're not going to actually you know do something where we could get fucked over
*  what I was getting to is I wonder if that's always going to be the case because here we are you know obviously 1947 that was when they dropped the bombs
*  45
*  45 so it's quite a while ago
*  yeah
*  but not in terms of like the age of the earth
*  not at all
*  in terms of history you know in historical times if you look back on 1745 versus 1820 it's not that big of a difference
*  it's not that when you go to 1545 to 1620 in your eyes it's like the same time
*  yeah
*  like how that's so long
*  there's World War II vets who are alive right now
*  1445 to 1520 like that ain't shit that's nothing
*  yeah
*  so it could happen again
*  oh yes
*  the way we look at COVID now the way we look at a pandemic now having just gone through it we could be looking at a nuclear holocaust the same way
*  we could be looking at someone detonating a bomb in Chicago
*  yeah
*  we could be looking at the possibility that we are really locked down like there really are draconian measures to ensure safety and security
*  because they have detonated a nuclear bomb in an American city
*  yeah
*  right now that sounds like horse shit
*  yeah but the idea of World War II or World War I
*  would have sounded crazy to people before it happened and then it really all happened and then not only did they go to World War I
*  then they did it again
*  20 years later they just went oh we're doing it again
*  which is for us the year 2000 which is like yes yes
*  that's right
*  yeah so it really never stopped
*  yeah that's right I mean it's like even when you think about like the beef with Iran or something like that and they'll be like the CIA overthrew their government in 1953
*  and then in 1979 they overthrew that government and they've basically hated America ever since you know
*  and you're like but 1953 to 1979 that's like Bill Clinton to now
*  yeah
*  like I remember Bill Clinton's presidency
*  yeah
*  it's like you know it's a while ago but it's like no if someone like just some other government overthrew Bill Clinton
*  I'd still remember that right now I'd be like yeah these motherfuckers came in and like overthrew our government
*  yeah it's just so easy for us to get used to what we're used to
*  yeah
*  did you ever hear the Albert Einstein quote which I might butcher but it was something like he said he goes I don't know what weapons will be used to fight World War III
*  but World War IV will certainly be fought with rocks and sticks
*  yeah
*  there's something like that I might be butchering it a little bit he's basically like at this point we're at a place where we really can't war
*  it's war is endgame I mean war with like Russia or China or anyone like that
*  that's even like when people are like oh we got to get China back for what they did with this virus it's like okay but our options are limited
*  yeah
*  when you got countries with a whole bunch of H bombs your options are limited as to what you can do
*  Putin, World War III was wipe out civilization, Putin warned adding World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones
*  oh he's a hack
*  did Putin just steal Einstein's quote
*  I think he's probably quoting it
*  that'd be kind of great if Putin was just like I just thought of that
*  maybe he's doing that like in an homage to Joe Biden
*  oh yeah
*  Biden's been busted plagiarizing a bunch of times
*  oh yeah
*  I think our version of what's possible is based entirely on what we've experienced
*  I mean just like we never remember those photos of those people with masks on in 1918
*  you know our version of reality pre-COVID has been forever altered now that we know that COVID exists
*  and there's so many other things that could happen to us
*  this is the thing we're so fragile we always hear about these comets that are whizzing by and these asteroids that get really close to Earth
*  one of those motherfuckers could slam into us
*  and I've had some people on that have studied their whole life
*  versions of these scenarios where civilization has been forced to repeat itself
*  because of the fact that we were hit
*  and that this has probably happened multiple times over the ascension of human civilization
*  and that it's one of the reasons why you have these ancient structures in Egypt that are very different
*  in the way they're constructed versus the ones from Cleopatra's era
*  versus the ones from the time when they built the Great Pyramid of Giza
*  right and isn't there like, because I remember reading about this like a decade ago
*  so I might not know that much about it
*  but isn't there stuff about like the water erosion on the Sphinx or something like that
*  where they can't figure out how this lines up with the time period
*  because you're like this is from like way older
*  you have that great bit about it in Talking Monkeys in space
*  but that whole thing is like, yeah, but in all seriousness
*  it does seem like there's pretty strong indications that civilization is much older
*  than the official history books of like it starts in ancient Sumer or 6000 years ago
*  Graham Hancock has spent a giant chunk of his life talking about this
*  and he brought in Dr. Robert Schock who's a geologist from Boston University
*  and John Anthony West who's a late great Egyptologist
*  I've had on the podcast a couple times
*  and they are all committed to this idea that it's very likely
*  that what we see in Egypt in terms of things that they can date to 2000 BC
*  this is just one era and that there's likely multiple eras before that
*  and the big one, the big piece of evidence is the water erosion in the temple of the Great Sphinx
*  because they know that they cut these stones out in order to create the Sphinx
*  but there's massive water erosion on these rocks
*  and the last time there was significant rainfall in the Nile Valley was 9000 BC
*  so instead of 2500 BC now it's 9000 BC
*  and then they have to think, well, this is thousands of years of rainfall that caused this erosion
*  so we might be talking 10,000, 11,000 BC
*  so they don't really know when all this happened
*  but they do think that it coincides with the end of the Ice Age
*  and the end of the Ice Age there's a dramatic climate change
*  it's somewhere around 12,000 years ago
*  which would put it around 10,000 BC
*  somewhere around 12,000 years ago this is where Randall Carlson
*  and Graham Hancock and a bunch of others have really gotten into this younger dryest impact theory
*  and that is somewhere between 12,000 and 10,000ish years ago
*  and it might have been multiple occasions
*  we were hit and that this was essentially a restart of civilization in a lot of areas
*  and an end to the Ice Age in a lot of areas as well
*  and Randall Carlson's work is fucking spectacular
*  when he shows you these images that indicate massive melting of ice
*  over a spectacular landscape in a really amazingly short period of time
*  like a couple days worth of water pouring through
*  like fucking trillions of gallons
*  permanently moving the landscape, changing it, moving stones
*  and he has all these images
*  and what's even crazier is he got this idea when he was looking at this one area on acid once
*  and he was like, what happened here?
*  and he got this idea, he was like, what is this?
*  and then he starts researching the end of the ice age
*  and he starts researching common impacts
*  and then they start finding all this corresponding evidence
*  when they do core samples
*  so he's doing core samples and they find all this iridium
*  and all this nuclear glass, impact glass
*  they find all this shit around the same area around 12,000 years ago
*  and they're like, oh my god
*  and so he starts, he's a brilliant guy
*  and he can talk about this forever
*  and they think that it's highly likely
*  that there was not just here
*  but in many parts of the world
*  there was massive impacts
*  that probably didn't kill everybody
*  but probably basically shut down all progress
*  for who knows how many hundreds if not thousands of years
*  and then what you're seeing when you're looking at 2500 BC
*  and all their amazing structures
*  is the knowledge they had left
*  and a lot of that was lost to the Library of Alexandria getting burnt down
*  so the stuff that they built later is spectacular
*  but they had been building pretty amazing shit
*  for most likely thousands of years before we thought they were
*  yeah, maybe we're due for a reset
*  well that's the scary thing, right?
*  you see some of the fucking really retarded shit
*  that people are saying out there
*  maybe that's the right thing
*  maybe we're due for a nice old fashioned reset
*  who I had on the podcast said that when civilizations start crumbling
*  that's when people get obsessed with gender
*  and I said really?
*  and he goes yeah, it's in ancient Rome and ancient Greece
*  there's a lot of transvestites
*  and a lot of people swapping genders
*  it's almost like a dissolving of all classifications and barriers
*  and all the things that we took for granted as a society
*  when society really starts falling apart
*  they start questioning every last fiber of what it means to be a person
*  what it means to fit into the culture
*  I became politically radicalized from Ron Paul's campaigns
*  that's really when I got interested in politics
*  it was around 2007, 2008 when he was running for president
*  and I still to this day love the guy
*  I think he's the greatest hero ever
*  but he would always talk about how
*  look, we're on basically this path toward national suicide
*  my words, not his
*  but he'd be like we're on this unsustainable path
*  we're spending way more than we can afford to spend
*  we're way too extended militarily
*  and this is how nations collapse
*  it's going to happen if we keep going this way
*  so I always kind of had that view in my head
*  and then to see what's happened with all the cultural stuff
*  over the last 10 years
*  while all of that other stuff is going on too
*  and you're like this really feels
*  like the end of an empire
*  like a collapsing empire
*  it really feels like that
*  well they taught us that in school
*  that all empires eventually collapse
*  whether it's ancient Greece, ancient Rome
*  all these empires
*  British Empire
*  they all controlled everything
*  and they all eventually fell apart
*  and it's under very similar circumstances
*  like they're extended too far
*  they spend themselves too far into debt
*  they can't maintain it anymore
*  the culture kind of collapses
*  like decadence and all this other shit
*  it does seem like we have a lot of that
*  oh yeah
*  but that isn't necessarily bad
*  like sometimes empires collapse
*  and it's actually okay for the people in that country
*  I mean it was okay for England
*  when the British Empire collapsed
*  I mean World War II was bad
*  but afterward there's still an okay country
*  for the Soviet Union
*  that collapsing was the best thing that ever happened
*  you know that's weird
*  those arguments are always strange right
*  because that's the same argument they used about Genghis Khan
*  opening up the path for trade
*  you know
*  he killed 10% of the population
*  well yes
*  in the long run, look
*  but you got a new rug
*  yeah, that's good
*  you can get a nice statue
*  you know who would really love this rug?
*  ah, he's dead
*  whoops
*  forget it
*  does Rand Paul share most of Ron Paul's ideas?
*  I don't know
*  I mean I think probably a lot
*  you know, he is his son
*  I know Ron Paul made him read all the right stuff
*  of growing up, you know
*  but he definitely has some areas of disagreement
*  and he's also just a different
*  I think he's a different person
*  and has different, you know, strengths and weaknesses
*  and wasn't quite as a...
*  charismatic
*  wasn't as charismatic
*  wasn't as much of a happy warrior
*  Ron Paul was really
*  he really enjoyed going out there
*  and telling people the truth as he saw it
*  and talking to people
*  and he didn't really care
*  if, you know, it was always kind of like
*  Ron Paul would say things at the Republican debates
*  and it'd be like
*  hey look, you guys might boo me out of the arena
*  and that's fine
*  I'm gonna go home to my family
*  and I told the truth
*  it's the truth
*  whether you like it or not
*  and that's fine
*  you can do that and I'll leave
*  and Rand always
*  I think it bothered him a little bit more
*  and um
*  but you know, Rand is
*  I think for
*  to me like one of the best senators
*  and I think he's done a lot
*  he did a lot to really push Donald Trump on um
*  uh, the criminal justice reform
*  uh, he's tried his best to push him on ending the wars
*  I don't know how successful he's been at that
*  but uh
*  but I don't know that he's gonna inspire people in the same way
*  his father did
*  I hope he does
*  mmm
*  someone has to
*  but isn't that what we're always looking for?
*  we're always looking for a hero
*  when really we need a decentralized government
*  well yeah, but that doesn't
*  that doesn't mean you can't have leaders
*  or somebody who like kind of
*  we're done with leaders
*  inspires you
*  we're done with leaders, Dave
*  tried it out, it doesn't work
*  well, but I don't mean
*  there's a difference between leaders and rulers, right?
*  like you don't want a ruler
*  right
*  but there's people who inspire you
*  who you learn from and stuff like that
*  you want a leader that doesn't want to be a ruler
*  yes, exactly
*  that's what Ron Paul was
*  yeah
*  but isn't that the problem though?
*  the problem is
*  they get into power
*  like this is one we're seeing with low level people like
*  like governors
*  like the worst governors
*  they just
*  they're, you know
*  there's all these lawsuits against Newsom
*  and he lost one of them recently
*  because he's an autocrat now
*  he's telling people what they can do
*  he's writing legislation
*  did you see when Tucker Carlson had Governor Murphy
*  from New Jersey on his show
*  and he
*  and it was like right at the height of COVID
*  like I think it might have been in May or something like that
*  but it was still like, you know, pretty new
*  no, I didn't see it
*  and so like everyone's
*  no one's given
*  I hadn't seen one tough interview
*  with one of these governors
*  like every time they came on some news show
*  it was just like
*  oh my God, you're going to be the next governor
*  it was just like
*  oh my God, you're saving all these lives
*  and you're wonderful
*  and thank you for all of this
*  and then they'd have their press conferences
*  they'd take some questions
*  but it wasn't
*  Tucker just starts grilling this guy
*  and he asked him at one point
*  he goes, okay, so recently there was like a church service
*  that you shut down
*  and you arrested four Jewish people for being at temple
*  and he goes
*  what right do you have to do that?
*  he goes, I mean, in the Bill of Rights
*  it's very clearly defined that the right to religious
*  you know, expression is, you know
*  so where do you get the authority
*  to shut down a place of worship?
*  and he goes
*  he goes, well, you know
*  we weren't thinking about the Bill of Rights when we did this
*  we're just trying to keep people safe
*  and then he goes
*  he was like, yeah, but where do you get the authority?
*  and he goes, well, that's above my pay grade
*  you're like, no, that's
*  you're the governor
*  that's exactly your pay grade
*  that's exactly what you're paying
*  but so that's just
*  like that's the mentality that swept over these people
*  it's a lot
*  it reminds me a lot of the George W. Bush mentality
*  mentality of like, you know
*  instituting torture and all these other things
*  it's like, well, what about laws against this?
*  it's like 9-11, man
*  I don't know about laws and rules
*  but fucking we're here
*  and so we're
*  you know, like we
*  they feel like because this thing happened
*  I don't kind of worry about silly little things
*  like the fucking Bill of Rights
*  who's got time for that?
*  we got to be careful that don't pass an act
*  and give it a good name
*  like the Patriot Act
*  exactly
*  like you can't be a non-patriot
*  you piece of shit
*  pass the Patriot Act
*  if they come up with something like the Safety Act
*  let's keep Grandma alive act
*  they do this all the time
*  I know, but for this one
*  did you see about the anti-lynching bill?
*  there was like an anti-lynching bill
*  and they would
*  blast people for being like
*  so and so was against
*  so and so
*  Rand Paul, he was one of the ones
*  he voted against the anti-lynching bill
*  and you're like, okay, wait
*  first of all
*  what else was in there?
*  isn't lynching already illegal?
*  like so
*  explain to me what exactly was in there
*  and then it turns out
*  that Rand Paul's problem was that this like
*  he goes, this like really broadly defines
*  what a hate crime is
*  and now it seems that like
*  if someone were to like get in a bar fight
*  you could like give them like 20 years
*  under like some hate crime legislation
*  he's like, let's slow down on that
*  that seems a little crazy
*  like but
*  and then they're like
*  you're just for lynching
*  and it's like, wait
*  this is really weird, dude
*  you can't just name a bill something
*  and then say if you're for
*  but you know, Patriot Act
*  all this shit
*  yeah, that's what it all is
*  they should not be able to name bills
*  provocative names
*  they should just have numbers
*  yes
*  you know, and that's it
*  you only get a number
*  you can't get a name
*  names have a lot of shit attached to them
*  yeah, absolutely
*  especially anti-lynching
*  but there's, and there's all
*  but even like
*  you know, they call Obamacare
*  the Affordable Care Act
*  everything they put is like this nice thing
*  that nobody could possibly be against
*  why would you be against affordable care?
*  yeah, what do you hate people?
*  come on, bro
*  do you hate people?
*  that's it though
*  what's wrong with you?
*  yeah, Dave
*  listen, I think we fucking covered it all
*  we fixed everything
*  did we?
*  no
*  where was that?
*  was it like around a half hour?
*  20 minutes ago
*  20 minutes?
*  that was the exact moment
*  we nailed it
*  everything went good
*  we just did like 3 and a half hours
*  how long did we do?
*  oh, you guys were talking before we started
*  oh, okay
*  3 hours?
*  3 hours for the show
*  3 hours, bro
*  you lose all sense of time
*  yeah, it flies by in here
*  I just know when I really have to pee
*  we should probably wrap it up
*  let everybody know your Twitter or Instagram
*  all that jazz
*  my Twitter is at ComicDaveSmith
*  the podcast is part of the problem
*  and the Legion of Skanks, of course
*  and Twitter, I mean Instagram
*  they just started me an account
*  at the problem DaveSmith on Instagram
*  at the problem?
*  or the problem DaveSmith
*  you're a problem?
*  is that what's going on?
*  I think so
*  I don't run it
*  but they put clips out of shit
*  some of the gas digital people started it for me
*  because I'm retarded and don't have an Instagram in 2020
*  yeah, how did you not have an Instagram?
*  I don't know
*  I'm just like, I can't do any more social media
*  I get it
*  you know?
*  well, that's why you're so good at these fucking conversations
*  because you're actually paying attention to shit
*  I spend too much time on Twitter as it is
*  the problem DaveSmith
*  8,000 followers
*  I got no followers on there
*  well, we just started it
*  we'll pump you up
*  there you go
*  follow me on Twitter
*  I got a little bit of followers on there
*  Twitter's dying
*  the president's going to kill it on his last days in office
*  that's what I heard
*  really?
*  that'd be something
*  now it's just a war of who can kill who first
*  Twitter or the president
*  he just makes Twitter illegal
*  his last few days in office
*  his car's more harmed than good
*  it's over
*  but then Twitter blocks his tweet saying that it's illegal
*  so no one knows
*  it's just a war of jackdaws
*  they just stay open
*  fuck you
*  you're on the way out
*  Biden's like, I support Twitter
*  and I'm going to wear a mask in my profile
*  but he's like, someone tell me what Twitter is
*  my profile, my, my, my, my, I'm hee haw
*  my pronouns
*  alright Dave, thanks brother
*  I appreciate it, this was fun
*  goodbye everybody
