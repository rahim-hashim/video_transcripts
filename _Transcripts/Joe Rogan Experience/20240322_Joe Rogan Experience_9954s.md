# Joe Rogan Experience #2123 - Gary Clark Jr.
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [March 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCsMmwMpAXk)
*  So how much of a relief is it to have the album done?
*  You've been working on this for a while, huh?
*  Yeah, it would be a relief if I got a chance to chill out.
*  I just kind of mixed it, mastered it, mastered it again.
*  It took a little while.
*  I was supposed to go on vacation.
*  I was going to take a trip and go chill out and think about it.
*  That didn't end up happening.
*  So I just turned my phone off for two or three days.
*  And then it was, let's go talk about it and break it all down.
*  So it's a relief.
*  It's finally done.
*  But it just kind of kept going.
*  So I haven't had a chance to chill on it.
*  Those breaks are important, right?
*  Just vacation breaks, just shut your brain off breaks?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, I really wanted that one.
*  I really, really wanted that.
*  Looking forward to those margaritas.
*  I needed it.
*  I just wanted to go be by myself, just camp out in the woods by myself.
*  Oh, really?
*  Yeah, just be completely solo.
*  Just chill out.
*  I just made 40.
*  I just wanted to go chill out and go, wow, reflect and be like, wow,
*  this first 40 has been pretty cool.
*  Like, what's going to happen in the next?
*  And it was like, boom, New York City, Tonight Show,
*  Questlove looking at me.
*  I was like, this is not what the plan was.
*  Sometimes you got to force the plan and all those other people.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  You have a lot of people to make happy.
*  Absolutely.
*  But I'm also excited to do it.
*  Sometimes if I get too comfortable, I get comfortable just being
*  comfortable.
*  Right.
*  And then nothing gets made.
*  I kind of like to get out there, get the nerves going,
*  blood going a little bit.
*  Yeah.
*  Get out in front of folks and figure it out.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, that's a little bit of a vacation from the creative process
*  of making it, right?
*  Because the process of making it, I mean, I know you were locked up.
*  Yeah.
*  You locked yourself up.
*  You do it.
*  When you do it, you go all in.
*  Well, I think I still care about this shit.
*  You can tell.
*  I really care.
*  People are like, what the hell are you making a whole album for?
*  It's about singles.
*  I'm like, I still like listening to a full record, putting a record down,
*  having the needle scratch the thing and playing it and then flipping
*  that other side and seeing what's happening.
*  I still like listening to a record from top to bottom.
*  If there's anything that I've ever learned, it's that do what you like to do.
*  It doesn't matter what the trend of the business is.
*  Just fucking do what you'd like to do.
*  Yeah.
*  You like albums?
*  Make a fucking album.
*  Yeah, sure.
*  And so yeah, that's what I did.
*  I was locked in.
*  A lot of it was by choice, too.
*  It was like, I just love being in a spot.
*  I built a studio.
*  I was like, well, why not fucking use it?
*  Yeah.
*  So that's what I did, kind of to a fault.
*  My wife was like, you've got to get out of there.
*  Trying to hang with you, get me out of the house, socialize me and stuff.
*  But I was just locked in, just nerding out, trying to make noise,
*  organize noise.
*  But the end is beautiful.
*  The end result is beautiful.
*  Thank you.
*  There's so many layers to the music, man.
*  I got it last night.
*  They sent me a link, but then the link needed a passcode
*  and I couldn't get a passcode.
*  And then last night they sent me the link.
*  So while I was writing last night when I came from the store,
*  I listened to the whole album.
*  Awesome.
*  Man, there's so many.
*  The music, the sounds, like right off the bat, there's so many layers.
*  It's like, you know, it's very...
*  You could tell there's so much thought into it.
*  There's a lot of smoke in the air.
*  Yeah.
*  A lot of mezcal.
*  A lot of Vino flowing.
*  Yeah, it was just...
*  And there was nobody saying...
*  You know, usually it's...
*  For me, people expect a certain thing.
*  And I have talks, like no strings on the album,
*  stay away from singing falsetto stuff because your core fans don't like it.
*  And I was like, I just don't give a fuck.
*  Like, I didn't care.
*  It was in the middle of COVID.
*  So everybody was locked down and I was just like...
*  My phone was down, nobody was talking to anybody.
*  I just got...
*  I got weird, man.
*  To me, that is so crazy that anybody is around you that gives you that kind of advice.
*  Well, it's folks that are in the business and, you know, I guess people...
*  I've been told that I'm not...
*  I'm a hard act to put on a shelf.
*  You don't know where to put me.
*  So they don't know how to market or sell this confused kid who plays power chords
*  and listen to Nirvana, who also loves Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre,
*  who thinks that Thelonious Monk is one of the baddest dudes on the planet,
*  who wants to play harmonica like Sonny Boy Williamson.
*  They're like, what the fuck are you?
*  So...
*  You're Gary Clark Jr.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  Exactly, exactly.
*  But it's a weird time, you know, like just people want to be able to call you something.
*  And so they tried to do the whole next Jimi Hendrix thing,
*  and that didn't really work out.
*  I kind of rebelled on that.
*  They're like, oh, fuck now.
*  So here we are.
*  You know what I mean?
*  But, you know, there's no reason not to try shit.
*  All my favorite artists tried shit.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, that's why I like Prince.
*  Like unapologetically, Stevie Wonder.
*  Yeah.
*  That's also why I like hanging out with you motherfuckers,
*  because y'all just be trying shit.
*  You know where the wall is when you hit that motherfucker.
*  And you go, oh.
*  Well, the thing about our thing is we have to do it in front of people.
*  Yeah, right.
*  So it's me stoned in front of a computer going, oh, this is so crazy.
*  Write shit out, put it on my phone, and then going, all right, let's see.
*  Let's see what other people think.
*  See how it comes to life.
*  But you can create all kinds of magic alone.
*  That's a different thing.
*  Well, I might think it's magic, and you never know until the thing drops.
*  So we'll see what happens.
*  But yeah, I feel good about it.
*  Thanks for listening, man.
*  Oh, my pleasure.
*  You know I'm a fan, dude.
*  I don't know what your thing kicks off our fucking night almost every night
*  at the mothership.
*  Woo.
*  When we get in that green room, we get in that green room,
*  we want to get things popping.
*  I don't know what your thing is.
*  That's a work of art.
*  That's a classic.
*  It's just kind of a rude, fuck y'all, I'm here.
*  Yeah.
*  It's awesome.
*  It's awesome.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, congrats on one year, man.
*  Thank you.
*  One year.
*  Yeah, it's crazy.
*  It's awesome.
*  Flew by.
*  Yeah.
*  It feels like we just opened.
*  Yeah, I've been doing it, man.
*  The word on the street, y'all are taking over.
*  It's game changing.
*  It's fun.
*  For real.
*  We got so many guys moved here now.
*  Oh, I know.
*  They're my neighbors now.
*  Way out in the country.
*  Well, that's the smart way to live, man.
*  I tell everybody.
*  I go attack it from the outside.
*  Yeah.
*  Tony Hinchcliffe, he likes living in the city.
*  I'm like, that's great, everything like that.
*  But you're going to go crazy.
*  You want to be outside.
*  Get that balance.
*  When I lived in LA, I lived way outside of LA in the hills
*  with coyotes and mountain lions and shit.
*  I'd worry about hawks.
*  Those are the things that I would think about.
*  I'd like just that quiet, just quiet.
*  And then get into the crazy, and then get back to the quiet.
*  It's a choice.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a choice.
*  The way you're doing it, it's perfect.
*  Live in the country.
*  Just relax.
*  When you get outside and drink a cup of coffee in your porch,
*  you're in the middle of the hill.
*  Just birds and shit.
*  Just beautiful grass and trees.
*  I become such a fucking nerd, bro.
*  I've been sitting outside and walking around my house.
*  I've gone to the camera store.
*  I spent way too much money on camera gear
*  trying to capture the perfect clip
*  to send National Geographic of the Mexican eagles
*  in my backyard.
*  You had Mexican eagles in your backyard?
*  I've been out there with the crazy zoom lens.
*  Oh, yeah?
*  Just quiet, stalking them.
*  Trying to get this shot.
*  Yeah, I spend way too much time out there.
*  But it's.
*  So you got one of those big crazy nature lenses?
*  I'm that guy.
*  Oh, wow.
*  I think I might quit music and try and get a gig doing that.
*  Really?
*  I'd get off doing that.
*  Like, I'm just, I get, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a Mexican eel?
*  Wow, what a cool looking bird.
*  Yeah, man.
*  It's got a toupee or something on it.
*  Let's take you all the way down.
*  Crested caracal.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Is that how you say it?
*  Caracara?
*  Caracara.
*  Caraca?
*  Caracara?
*  Mexican eagle, what a fucking beautiful animal.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  You have those in your yard?
*  Yeah, there's like, there's a family of like three of them.
*  They swoop down and hang out all the time.
*  I had a hawk try to sweep in on my chickens the other day.
*  I had the chickens in the backyard,
*  and all of a sudden the chickens start going,
*  bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah,
*  flopping their wings and running around.
*  And I look, I'm just this hawk coming and circling.
*  You got to watch out for those motherfuckers.
*  I saw a hawk swoop up a kid, and I didn't think about that.
*  I moved out into the, this is on video or something.
*  I don't know if this was fake.
*  Oh, it's probably an eagle.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, but I was like, I didn't even
*  think about having to look out for that in the country.
*  Because the hawk came down and swooped up, or swooped down,
*  and got one of my chickens right in front of my boy.
*  He was like five at the time.
*  He was like, what is that?
*  I was like, woo, that's the world happening.
*  That's nature.
*  That's nature.
*  That's how it goes down in the real world.
*  Exactly.
*  Not this weird thing that we've constructed
*  to insulate ourselves from it.
*  And think that we're the most powerful.
*  I mean, when you sit out there and you see a hawk swoop down
*  and grab another sizable animal and just take off with it,
*  you're like, OK.
*  You know, OK.
*  It's not that safe.
*  I mean, I walk around out there on my property.
*  And there's been a couple of times
*  where I've almost stepped on a rattlesnake.
*  My wife and kids just stepped over a rattlesnake
*  getting out of the truck right there in the driveway.
*  And those little baby rattlers, they had no idea.
*  Looked down, stomped on his head.
*  I was like, you don't have to think
*  about crazy things like that.
*  Going fishing, my daughter caught a water moccasin.
*  Oh, shit.
*  Yeah.
*  She was all excited.
*  Daddy, I got a snake.
*  I was like, yo.
*  Not that one.
*  Not that one.
*  That is not the one you want.
*  Wow.
*  On a hook?
*  Yeah, on a hook.
*  It was like one of those little kid poles.
*  It's like Elsa or one of those little princess poles.
*  You know, reeling in Godmouse.
*  Wow.
*  Like nothing.
*  Country.
*  I didn't know they bought on the line like that.
*  They'll attack bait.
*  I didn't know that either.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  So come get some of that if you want to step out of the city.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  But I love it, though.
*  Yeah, I did, too.
*  I love getting into the madness.
*  I don't want to hate on it.
*  I mean, I love wandering in.
*  I love wandering around downtown with the camera,
*  popping into certain spots.
*  I check in on y'all, go to the blues spots,
*  and catch the madness.
*  And got excited myself to shake it up a little bit,
*  and then just take it back home and get the zoom lens out,
*  and nerd away.
*  Well, it's a good balance of different things.
*  And if you want to go see live shit,
*  this town is so good for that, man.
*  There's so much live performance going on.
*  There's so much comedy.
*  There's so much music.
*  Yeah.
*  You know?
*  Yeah, it's great.
*  I like seeing the musicians.
*  I like seeing the musicians watching the comics,
*  and the comics watching the musicians.
*  I like that.
*  I love watching music, because I have no talent.
*  I love watching a thing where I have no talent in.
*  I've never played anything.
*  So I watch, and I'm just like, you're doing magic up there.
*  Look at these guys doing magic.
*  I brought a guitar for you.
*  And at least we're going to teach you how to play an E
*  chord before I get out of here.
*  OK.
*  I'll try.
*  Yeah?
*  I'll try it.
*  I've never even tried it.
*  That's the problem.
*  Is that the problem?
*  No, the problem is, here's the problem.
*  OK.
*  I know my brain.
*  I have a dangerous brain.
*  My brain can't get interested in things,
*  because then it's all in.
*  And then it's like, fuck eating.
*  Let's do this all day.
*  So I've learned through all my years
*  how to keep that wolf in a cage and not to let it out.
*  So that's why I don't play golf.
*  Gotcha.
*  Because I'm addicted to pool.
*  It's a real problem.
*  I can play like a hair under professional speed when I'm on.
*  When I'm really on, I've been practicing for several hours.
*  I could run.
*  I ran three racks the other day.
*  Three racks in a row.
*  That's big.
*  Four and a quarter inch pockets.
*  Yeah, see, that's the problem.
*  I get like that with music.
*  I would get like that with anything.
*  I'd get like that with golf for sure.
*  I see Jamie.
*  He's a full on junkie.
*  He's a full on junkie.
*  He's got a simulator out there.
*  And I'll come here, and when I pull the car up,
*  he's driving balls into the simulator
*  and mapping it out on a fucking computer.
*  Obsess.
*  Obsess with his club speed.
*  He's got a fucking killer drive too.
*  You like set up to the whole sensor thing.
*  And I don't have all that yet.
*  It's coming.
*  Yeah.
*  He says, yeah.
*  I've got some cool stuff on the way, I think.
*  I've watched it get you, though.
*  That's what's interesting.
*  Like when we first met, you were not into golf.
*  How many years ago did you get into golf?
*  When we got here.
*  When we got to Austin.
*  So four years ago.
*  So in four years, he's become a stone cold junkie.
*  Got you.
*  So is Hinchcliffe.
*  Stone cold junkie.
*  Ron White.
*  Ron White's a junkie.
*  They also call a lot of people that whatever the pandemic did,
*  the golf bug went around.
*  It was the only things you could do then.
*  That's not what I was playing, but it was.
*  It seems to me like it's one of those things that once you do
*  it, and you do it, and you start getting better at it,
*  you just fucking love it.
*  And then everybody becomes an addict.
*  I know very few people who dabble in golf.
*  A lot of people, they'll play pool a little bit here and then,
*  but they don't get fully addicted.
*  Golf people get just addicted.
*  I don't get that.
*  I'm scared of that, too.
*  I get that now.
*  Understanding your own brain.
*  I don't gamble.
*  That's it.
*  I don't play golf.
*  Yeah.
*  Any of that, because it's over for me.
*  It's already a problem with these stupid cameras.
*  My wife is like, you're not a fucking...
*  What are you doing?
*  But yet you are.
*  Yeah.
*  You are.
*  You are whatever the fuck you want to be.
*  I'm obsessed.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't like people telling you what to do.
*  That drives me nuts.
*  When I hear people telling you what to do and giving you
*  advice on music, just shut the fuck up.
*  Everybody shut the fuck up and just market whatever he does.
*  Yeah, well, yeah, right.
*  I did it.
*  You sell it.
*  But the thing is, it's not people telling me what to do.
*  It's meetings and suggestions.
*  So I'm translating it as people tell me what to do.
*  That is what it is, though.
*  Suggestions.
*  It's as much as they can do.
*  As much as they can tell Gary Clark Jr. how to make music,
*  they're going to give a shot.
*  Well.
*  You know?
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  It's just annoying.
*  Exists in comedy, too.
*  They're always telling comedians, do this, do that.
*  Dress nice.
*  Do this, do that.
*  Stop talking about COVID.
*  Stop talking about this.
*  You know, you'll lose 5% of the audience when you do this.
*  And 10%...
*  Shut the fuck up.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Yeah, I was in a conversation the other day in New York
*  talking about the set list.
*  And you should put this in this order and do this.
*  And I was like, you know what?
*  Y'all talk about it.
*  I don't talk.
*  I don't want to...
*  I'm leaving this conversation.
*  I'm going to go up on the roof.
*  I'm going to put some smoke in the air.
*  And then I'm going to do my fucking show.
*  Chill out.
*  Shut the fuck up.
*  Tell you how to do a set list.
*  It's funny.
*  It's a funky business.
*  They're all like that, Gary.
*  They're all like that.
*  TV was like that.
*  When I was on News Radio, it was maddening.
*  Because here you have this guy, Paul Sims,
*  this brilliant writer from the Larry Sanders show.
*  All these amazing cast members.
*  This incredible writing staff.
*  And then you have the network.
*  It's like, you need a wacky neighbor.
*  You know?
*  You needed this.
*  You needed that.
*  You know, we need to have a hot girl that Dave's interested in.
*  There is always something.
*  Like, stay the fuck out of this.
*  Stay out of this.
*  But they can't help themselves.
*  And you have to listen to them because they're the executives.
*  They're the people that have the money.
*  Right.
*  OK.
*  And you love doing the art.
*  Exactly.
*  So it's this weird relationship.
*  That's one of the best things about comedy
*  is you don't really have that relationship
*  with anybody anymore.
*  We used to have it with TV, but now that's all gone.
*  Yeah.
*  You guys can do whatever you want.
*  I was telling a couple of guys, when I show up to the comedy
*  spot, you guys are nice enough to give me free drinks.
*  So I take advantage, and then I start to go on up.
*  Man, you guys are the real fucking rock stars.
*  You can just do whatever the hell you want.
*  Nobody can tell you shit.
*  Just go.
*  You just go.
*  But I mean, it is true.
*  You guys got a freedom in a creative space
*  to say whatever you want at any time.
*  And that's cool.
*  It's inspiring.
*  It's fun, especially at that place.
*  Because that place is made for us, by us.
*  It's all ours.
*  We're the only ones who own it.
*  Nobody owns it but us.
*  Everybody else has to listen to us.
*  That's never been the case.
*  It's always been there was an owner,
*  and the manager is hired by the owner,
*  and they give you the rules.
*  So the rules are now, I go in the green room.
*  What do you guys think?
*  And everybody just starts giving off opinions.
*  I think this, I think that.
*  I'm like, OK, we'll do it that way.
*  That's cool.
*  We all agree?
*  OK, we'll do it that way.
*  That's amazing.
*  So because of that, we've been able to just have it
*  like a real safe haven.
*  It really is like a mothership.
*  Because everybody there goes and travels and does the road.
*  But they come back home to home base.
*  They come back to the mothership.
*  That's how you build a community.
*  That's a prime example.
*  And it's just like everybody who comes here
*  is looking for that too.
*  And so then when they get it and they realize,
*  oh, this is real.
*  This isn't just like everybody wants that thing.
*  I wish there was a place we could go.
*  We all just hang out together and every night just do shows.
*  And everybody's creatively inspiring everybody.
*  And then once you actually have it, you're like, oh, my god.
*  It can be real.
*  It can be real.
*  Because we had it a little bit at the store.
*  We had it a lot at the store in LA.
*  But we also had owners who were great.
*  We had managers.
*  We had Hollywood agents would come.
*  There's always people's managers hanging around.
*  There was all these, there's a lot of other stuff
*  out there.
*  And then there's also the Hollywood feel,
*  which is a different feel.
*  Because what percentage of those people out there
*  in the audience are in the business?
*  Like a giant chunk, at least half.
*  At least half those people out there in that audience
*  are actors or writers or producers or executives
*  or someone who does something that has to do
*  with the business.
*  Out here it's just folks.
*  Yeah.
*  It's just folks.
*  Yeah.
*  It's better that way.
*  It really is.
*  It's just people who just love the shit.
*  Yeah.
*  It's just fans.
*  Just comedy fans who just have all kinds of different jobs.
*  All kinds of different things they do with their life.
*  And they just wanna come out and have a good time.
*  It's awesome.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's just, it's magical.
*  It's very cool.
*  That's for me the absolute best thing
*  that came out of the pandemic.
*  Number one, moving here.
*  Number two, being able to set that place up.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, I mean, as a fan, I think that's one of the best things
*  that come out of the pandemic too.
*  So here's, cheers to you, man.
*  Thank you.
*  Yes, indeed.
*  Yeah.
*  It's exciting.
*  We thought about doing one somewhere else,
*  but I was like, you know what we really should do
*  and we should do one for like the summer in Montana.
*  Just find some fucked up town in Montana,
*  have people fly into it, just do a mothership in Montana.
*  Montana would be amazing.
*  I love Montana.
*  Montana's amazing.
*  Montana would, yeah, that would blow up.
*  Yeah, Tony's like, don't fucking do it.
*  Don't go to, I'm not going to Montana.
*  I'm like, come on.
*  And Duncan was like, I'll get a house in Montana.
*  Let's go.
*  Montana's beautiful.
*  Duncan's thinking about doing mushrooms in the fields,
*  staring at the stars.
*  I'm with Duncan on that.
*  I'm with that 100%.
*  So yeah, that'd be cool.
*  You thinking about expanding?
*  Just, that was the only thought.
*  Like just buy some land in Montana,
*  some weird town, Montana, just put a mothership up.
*  Drop the mothership in the middle there.
*  See who comes.
*  It'd get interesting, man.
*  Montana's got some funky, cool folks out there.
*  It does, but you also have a lot of people that travel.
*  That's what's interesting too.
*  That's one of the things we found out about this spot.
*  It's not just like people in Austin
*  that are coming to these shows.
*  It's people traveling from all over the world.
*  So it's like, you could make,
*  it's almost like a little Vegas residency type deal.
*  It's becoming a destination.
*  Yeah.
*  It's about a...
*  I'll give you that small funky town in Montana.
*  If you only have like 120 seats,
*  you could get a lot done.
*  Make it better.
*  Yeah.
*  Huh.
*  Well, I'll be there.
*  I'll be out there trying to learn how to fly fish
*  and I'll drop in on you.
*  Fly fish is kind of fucked up
*  because they let those fish go most of the time.
*  Well, which is a little weird.
*  The hippie in me gets that.
*  I get that too, but the hippie in me says,
*  well, why catch them then?
*  The hippie in me is like,
*  you're just fucking with these fish.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like, you're just trying to get the juice,
*  that feeling that you get when you catch a fish.
*  Yeah.
*  That wild feeling.
*  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
*  I'm guilty.
*  Oh, God.
*  Me too.
*  I've done it.
*  I've done catch and release.
*  Yeah.
*  Especially bass fishing.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, everybody catches and releases.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  I got a little spot out of my house
*  and we catch and release every now and then.
*  We fillet them up, catfish or whatever.
*  Yeah.
*  And stuff like that.
*  For the most part, it's just hanging with my kids
*  and learn how to be patient.
*  Trying to teach them how to just chill out.
*  Yeah.
*  Wait for something.
*  I know.
*  When is a fish gonna bite?
*  Yeah.
*  When is a fish gonna bite?
*  When you shut the fuck up.
*  Yeah.
*  Chill out.
*  Yeah.
*  Then they'll calm.
*  But yeah.
*  Yeah, that's my next quest that I'm probably scared of
*  because a buddy of mine, Jacob Skiba,
*  he's a guy I work with in the studio,
*  producer, engineer.
*  While we were recording, he went out
*  and has gone on a couple of fly fishing expeditions
*  and he's kind of hooked.
*  And so he's like, you gotta come out there with me.
*  And I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  And then next thing you know, I quit playing guitar
*  and I'm the guy fly fishing with the big zoom lens
*  out there in Montana waiting for the mothership to open.
*  Yeah.
*  That's the thing is like when people say that they get bored,
*  I'm like, how can you be bored?
*  There's so many things to do.
*  There's so many things to do in this life.
*  Absolutely.
*  There's so many things to get interested in.
*  How could you be bored?
*  To me, it's like, my problem is the total opposite.
*  I just can't have more things that I'm interested in.
*  Yeah.
*  I like to get to a feeling where I'm bored
*  or feel like I have time to be bored
*  because I can invest my time in certain things
*  like photography or gave me an outlet
*  to go chase something down.
*  And for better or for worse, I feel fulfilled
*  like I'm learning a new skill.
*  I'm challenging myself.
*  I'm never satisfied.
*  There's so much to know.
*  Right.
*  There's so much to do, but I'm like a hands-on guy.
*  So it's like, if I'm bored playing guitar,
*  I'll try and figure out something on piano.
*  If I'm bored playing piano, like I have bagpipes.
*  I don't know why I have bagpipes,
*  just in case I get the time to get bored.
*  Maybe I'll figure out how to play bagpipes.
*  Yeah.
*  Just weird shit.
*  Well, it's something about learning a new thing
*  that excites a part of your mind
*  that doesn't get excited any other way.
*  Because once you already know how to do something,
*  then you're just kind of practicing that thing
*  that you already do and you're very comfortable with it.
*  It's a normal thing that you do.
*  But when there's a new thing, it's like,
*  how does this work?
*  What's this lens?
*  What happens when I turn it left?
*  Oh shit.
*  Yeah, right.
*  And they're like, okay, what is the aperture?
*  What does that mean?
*  What's exposure time?
*  So at nighttime, you set it different.
*  What the fuck is that?
*  And then you start getting into the books
*  and into the weeds.
*  I got like that with archery.
*  I nerded out hard with archery.
*  So I know so much shit about archery.
*  But there's so many layers to that too.
*  There's people that, like my friend John Dudley,
*  I'll talk to him about that.
*  I don't even know what the fuck he's talking about.
*  He's talking about torque lean and torque setting bows
*  and like what?
*  Torque tuning, what?
*  I've got a, my brother-in-law is really into bow.
*  I think I hit you up when I was over there in Australia.
*  He was like, hit up Joe
*  and ask him what kind of bow he's using.
*  But yeah, he's really into that.
*  My mom's real into archery.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, my mom, I'm gonna put you out there.
*  My mom doesn't mind being in a smoky room.
*  She started playing drums and she's into archery now.
*  So yeah.
*  Wow.
*  She's out here getting it.
*  Playing drums and shooting bows and arrows.
*  Fuck yeah.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  It's really badass.
*  That's badass.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah, archery's an addictive thing too
*  because at the moment when you're aiming at the target
*  and you're at full draw,
*  it's impossible to think of anything else.
*  It requires so much concentration that the world goes away
*  and you have this insanely narrow focus.
*  The insanely narrow focus is the place
*  where you want that arrow to go.
*  All these different things have to be in order.
*  Your scapula has to be aligned.
*  Your elbow has to be high.
*  Your right arm has to be pulled back.
*  Your left arm has to be locked and stabilized.
*  You have to release your hand
*  so you're just pushing with the palm of your hand.
*  No movement of your hand whatsoever.
*  And then you have to relax the shoulder somehow
*  while extending fully.
*  And all the while you have to fight anxiety.
*  You don't wanna pull it quick.
*  You wanna make sure you just get it locked in there.
*  So when all that is going on,
*  there's nothing else in the world.
*  Like if I'm, I got a lot of things on my mind,
*  I'm too busy, I'm too this, I'm stressed out.
*  I'll just go out there with some arrows
*  and then within 20 minutes I feel great.
*  It's like, shoo.
*  Yeah.
*  My only time to think about other bullshit
*  is while I'm walking over to the target and get my arrows.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Pulling the arrows out and then back to what I was doing.
*  Start sprinting to that motherfucker.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, if I could just keep firing to never have to go
*  get the arrows, there would be no thinking at all.
*  I get that.
*  I can kind of relate that to playing guitar in a way.
*  You can't, in order to, you know,
*  it's kind of a precision that your hands
*  gotta work in sync and coordination
*  and you gotta be precise with it
*  or else it kind of all falls off the rails
*  and you can't really think about anything else.
*  It's not like you can be on the phone
*  and play guitar or something.
*  You can send emails back and forth.
*  You can't really be in conversation with people.
*  You just have to be locked in to execute.
*  Yeah.
*  You know?
*  And you know which shots are better than the others.
*  You know which chords are played stronger than the others.
*  You know which notes are gonna sting, you know what I mean?
*  That's like, that's the note, you know?
*  Bullseye, motherfucker.
*  Yeah.
*  I can kind of relate in that way.
*  You can't, you can't,
*  it's like flow state.
*  Yeah.
*  Check out.
*  You know, you gotta be there.
*  You have to put in 100% or else you're not gonna be great.
*  I think that's a lot of things in life.
*  I think there's a lot of things in life
*  that people gravitate towards
*  because I think there's a great value
*  in having a thing that takes the rest of the world away.
*  That thing could be golf, look at this for Jamie,
*  it could be anything, whatever it is.
*  But there's a real value in having a thing
*  that takes the world away.
*  I think so.
*  I think so.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  My name would have been,
*  I would have had a lot longer rap sheet
*  if I hadn't found guitar at a young age, I think.
*  You know, just being lost, confused.
*  So many people out there.
*  Mm-hmm.
*  Yeah, if I hadn't found martial arts,
*  oh, God damn.
*  I have no idea what would have happened to me.
*  Hmm.
*  It was the only thing that I had ever done
*  that made me feel like I wasn't a loser.
*  I was like, all of a sudden,
*  I found a thing that I know that I can do,
*  and if I just go all in.
*  That's why I have this problem with getting addicted
*  to things, because that was the first one
*  that I really got really addicted to.
*  Then it just sort of transmuted, it changed
*  just the way I interact with everything.
*  Did you have a good experience off the bat?
*  Did you notice that you were a winner immediately?
*  Not immediately, but pretty quickly.
*  And that was the kind of drive you back in?
*  I was aptitude for it.
*  I understood it.
*  I understood distance, I understood how to hit things hard.
*  And it was the exciting thing about it.
*  There's moving targets, they're moving at you,
*  you're moving at them.
*  Solving this puzzle of human reflexes and instincts
*  and flinching at them and fainting them,
*  getting them to react and then gauging
*  what that reaction is gonna be.
*  Different ways to set things up.
*  It's so multi-layered and multi-faceted.
*  And when you're young, you're so fast.
*  Like you can move so quick, it's exciting.
*  And you learn so quick too.
*  So it's just, you see instantaneous reward.
*  Because if you're learning something
*  while your body is growing, it's the best.
*  Because your body grows into these movements.
*  So your body has a built-in way of doing these things.
*  From it's, literally from the ground up.
*  Once you're a grown man,
*  and you try to teach a grown man kickboxing,
*  that's like, oh, okay.
*  You're just so accustomed to doing
*  certain things with your legs.
*  You get these grown ass 30 year old man legs,
*  and I'm gonna try to teach you
*  how to throw a spinning back kick.
*  I was like, okay.
*  Yeah, that's why I haven't signed up yet.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  It's worth doing it just for fun though.
*  Sure.
*  And that's another thing.
*  When you're doing that, you ain't thinking about,
*  if you're sparring, or if you're doing jujitsu training,
*  you're not thinking about anything else.
*  You cannot think about anything else.
*  You're just fully locked in to this thing that you're doing.
*  Yeah, that makes sense.
*  Man, I wish I had grown into my body
*  while playing basketball.
*  Because I'm six foot four, and a whole waste of space.
*  I have no skill.
*  I have a 15 foot jumper that I'm pretty confident in,
*  but I have no handles.
*  I'm like, you know, I just, it's a waste.
*  People ask me, you play basketball?
*  Nope, didn't get that.
*  And I tried, man.
*  I tried, I had friends who had the shoes
*  where you could build your calves for jumping,
*  and I was out there doing drills,
*  walk around with weights and all that shit.
*  I was really trying to get there, man.
*  Like, I got no hops, no court awareness.
*  It just wasn't my thing, bro.
*  All my deer and headlights on the basketball court,
*  it's embarrassing, bro.
*  But yeah, so I try and get out there with my kid now.
*  He plays basketball, and I'm struggling.
*  My knees are popping.
*  I don't know.
*  I'm like, damn.
*  40 year old reality.
*  Yeah, man, like, damn.
*  I didn't, yeah, that wasn't my forte.
*  But hey, you can't be everything.
*  No, you cannot be everything.
*  And if you try to be everything, you'll be nothing.
*  I agree.
*  Yeah, you just, it's not, you gotta pick lanes.
*  Sure.
*  You can have a couple lanes, but you can't have too many.
*  And each lane will take away from the resources
*  that that other lane has available.
*  I agree, I agree.
*  That's why I try and tell my wife all the time.
*  I can't focus on that right now.
*  Yeah.
*  Trying to stay in my lane.
*  People, though, don't have to do that, don't understand it.
*  Like, sometimes people come to me with, like, business stuff,
*  and I'm like, this is not, I can't talk right now.
*  I've got shit going on.
*  Sure.
*  I'm busy.
*  Yeah.
*  Let's talk about this when it's absolutely necessary
*  and never a minute before.
*  That part.
*  Yeah, say it again loud for the ones
*  that didn't have the volume up.
*  Yeah, eventually we could talk about this, but not now.
*  Seriously, man.
*  They'll try to talk to you about important shit
*  right before a show.
*  This is so crazy that you're doing this.
*  Like, you don't even understand what you're doing.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Yeah, yeah, really.
*  Yeah, that's one of my biggest issues with doing shows.
*  And there's like some sort of business element involved.
*  Because when you're out just on the road
*  with your touring crew or whatever,
*  there's not those conversations, it's not those talks.
*  Everybody kind of gets it, reads the room.
*  Then you have folks that come in and go,
*  hey, I was thinking about this idea with this company.
*  That's like, the tour manager comes in and goes,
*  it's five minutes, and I'm trying to get my monitors on,
*  I'm trying to talk with my boys.
*  And they're just selfish.
*  Yeah.
*  You're a captive audience.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  It's like, man, get the fuck up.
*  I finally got you a loan,
*  I wanna talk to you about this cryptocurrency.
*  Yeah, right?
*  No thanks.
*  But yeah, it's part of it, I guess.
*  It's just weird and kind of funny if you think about it.
*  It is kind of weird.
*  What's all these different personalities
*  that are interacting with each other?
*  You have the creative personality
*  and you have all the business people
*  and the people that are support team.
*  Yeah.
*  It's an odd relationship.
*  Yeah, sure.
*  Whenever you mix business and art,
*  there's just two totally different mindsets.
*  Yeah, it's north and north.
*  Yeah, that's why people get real suspicious
*  if an artist gets real business oriented.
*  If it's opening up a bunch of businesses
*  and gets all businessy.
*  People are like, oh, what are you doing?
*  I want you to be an artist.
*  Yeah, right?
*  Yeah.
*  That's what I like about you, dummy.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Yeah, that's what I like about you.
*  I like that you don't know anything.
*  I like that you're out there just being wild.
*  Have a good fucking time.
*  Just have a bunch of people that do that shit for you, man.
*  Don't get involved.
*  That's the scary part.
*  When they start saying, don't worry about that,
*  just be an artist.
*  I'm like, nah, motherfucker.
*  I'm gonna be at your office tomorrow,
*  early in the morning.
*  Let me see that spreadsheet.
*  What's going on?
*  Yeah, well, that's a true,
*  that's a story as old as time.
*  The artist has been ripped off.
*  Didn't even know they were getting ripped off.
*  Yeah, yeah, it's definitely true.
*  It's, you know, there's things that I've had to learn
*  in the business, you know, not to get into too much,
*  but yeah, there's definitely things
*  that you aren't looking for or looking out for,
*  and people don't necessarily tell you
*  because you're not able to be in those rooms
*  to have those conversations.
*  So things kind of slip by you.
*  It's like you and your homies trying to figure this out.
*  You know, it's like your boy who's an attorney,
*  who went to UNLV,
*  but doesn't know anything about entertainment law.
*  It's like, you know, doing your contract.
*  It's like, oh, you know what I'm saying?
*  It's like, ugh.
*  Yeah.
*  So there's just things that you gotta figure out,
*  but you just gotta keep your eyes and ears open
*  and ask questions.
*  The worst one is when someone has a legit manager
*  and then their friend is like,
*  bro, I can be your fucking manager.
*  Uh-huh.
*  And you're like, yeah, man.
*  You know, you're like a brother to me, man.
*  I trust you.
*  Right, right.
*  Yeah, that's it.
*  That one goes sideways 50% of the time.
*  That's it.
*  Five zero, you got one, one out of two chance
*  of that thing going completely sideways.
*  Yep, absolutely.
*  And so many guys go that way.
*  You know, oh, Mike's managing me now.
*  I got a new manager.
*  Yeah, right.
*  That's my wife, my wife's manager.
*  I'm like, what?
*  What are you doing?
*  Mm-hmm.
*  Get a professional.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  Get someone who knows what the fuck they're doing.
*  Absolutely, man.
*  All that bro shit, you know,
*  that, you know, things start to get funny.
*  Mm-hmm, yeah.
*  That relationship starts to get funny, but yeah.
*  That's also how dudes develop entourages.
*  That's a wild one.
*  Man, speaking of entourages, I had to talk,
*  I had to just tell him, my dad is going crazy.
*  Oh no.
*  I love my pops, but I mean, he shows up to my shows
*  and this dude all of a sudden is sitting courtside
*  at Spurs games.
*  He shows up to my shows with like 30 folks, 30 deep.
*  He's got a table at the Moody Theater.
*  He's living his best life.
*  He's just squatted up around town.
*  People talk to me about him all the time.
*  My dad is out here getting in in Austin, Texas.
*  It's pretty funny.
*  Wow.
*  But yeah, he's like, my pops is a superstar out here.
*  That's awesome.
*  Yeah, that's good.
*  He's having a good time.
*  Just having fun.
*  Yeah, enjoying it.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, it's definitely enjoying
*  having a kid who's known around town.
*  Yeah.
*  That's good.
*  Oh man, he must be so proud.
*  But yeah, he's getting a little bit ridiculous.
*  Showing up 10, 15 deep.
*  Entourage.
*  Hit me up.
*  Hey man, can you get me into this?
*  How many people you got?
*  Oh, a couple.
*  When Dave rolled, when Dave Spell came to the mothership,
*  he came with three SUVs.
*  He's got, he had like three escalates filled with people.
*  How do you fit anywhere?
*  Oh man, he's got family, he's got friends,
*  he's got fellow comedians, musicians.
*  Like he just travels with people.
*  He loves it.
*  It's like a party everywhere he goes.
*  I get that.
*  Yeah.
*  I understand that.
*  He hasn't managed well.
*  He has good people with him.
*  He knows what he's doing.
*  But it's like the way he's got it set up is,
*  it's pretty fun.
*  It's all just, every day's a good time.
*  Get a IV, vitamin IV drip.
*  Yup.
*  I was around for that.
*  I was around.
*  Yeah, we actually, yeah.
*  Yeah, I was definitely around for some of those fun times.
*  It's good hanging with that crew.
*  Yeah, that's a dude that was entourage.
*  That's entourage.
*  I get that.
*  Yeah.
*  I get it.
*  Yeah, I could never be that guy.
*  I like to roll solo.
*  I like to just kinda be on my own.
*  I can make my own decisions.
*  If I wanna pivot, go left, I can go left.
*  If I wanna go right, I can go right.
*  Yeah.
*  It don't necessarily have to, maybe that's selfish of me.
*  Kind of a lone wolf.
*  No, it's probably smart because it gives you time to think.
*  I think the problem with Dave is he's so famous.
*  He can be alone.
*  Oh yeah, yeah.
*  He can't just show up somewhere.
*  All of a sudden, he won't be alone.
*  There'll be a giant crowd of people like,
*  oh my God, Dave's about to just go crazy.
*  Absolutely.
*  I can't believe you're real.
*  I get that.
*  Can I take a picture with you?
*  I get the every now and then dude who plays guitar.
*  He's like, man, I've been watching you for,
*  since I was a kid.
*  Or the really drunk older lady who wants to kiss on me
*  while I'm hanging out,
*  waiting for some to-go food or whatever.
*  That's kinda my, that's my interaction.
*  That's good.
*  That's a good level of interaction.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  At a certain level, like a Dave Chappelle level,
*  I think it becomes unmanageable.
*  Like I was having a conversation with Cat Williams about that.
*  Like I asked him to come to the club.
*  He's like, I don't do clubs.
*  Like you guys are getting nervous
*  being around all those people.
*  Like they're too close to me.
*  I was like, you got too famous.
*  Yep.
*  You got too famous.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  He has to have an entourage.
*  Yeah, I mean, I get that.
*  I get that.
*  That's a perspective that I don't know anything about.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm just speaking from a dude who,
*  a small community of music folks.
*  Yeah.
*  I can move around, but.
*  It's perfect.
*  Yeah, it's pretty good.
*  The way you ask perfect.
*  I know, it's good.
*  But I want these people to buy millions and millions
*  of records and fill up arenas.
*  You know?
*  At the same time.
*  Right, exactly.
*  I think I've kind of fucked myself.
*  I was like, I should have gone like the Gorillaz route
*  or like Daft Punk or something like that
*  where you're in a mask or, you know what I mean?
*  You could just show up anywhere.
*  That's true, right?
*  Gorillaz can just hide.
*  Yeah.
*  KISS had that forever.
*  Sure.
*  You know?
*  I remember when KISS took their makeup off,
*  everybody was like, oh!
*  What year was that?
*  Like the 80s, I think.
*  Yeah.
*  I think it was the 80s.
*  It was KISS unmasked.
*  Couldn't imagine, like, oh my God.
*  They used to be able to go around town.
*  So they would go out and like, they would like,
*  I remember Gene Simmons was dating Cher
*  and he would go out and he'd put a bandana on
*  like he's during COVID times.
*  All right.
*  Yeah.
*  So everybody's like, oh!
*  We almost got a picture of him.
*  So it was like half blurry pictures
*  of someone's side of their face with their hand up.
*  That's all you got at KISS forever.
*  That's cool.
*  I kind of miss those days of that mystique.
*  Have a comic for it?
*  Does that really look great?
*  Yeah, see how he's wearing the bandana?
*  That's how he used to go around town.
*  He used to wear a bandana.
*  You know how ridiculous that is?
*  It's 1980.
*  Yeah.
*  I think that's cool.
*  I was like going into high school when they did that.
*  Oh damn.
*  What a crew, man.
*  What a, wow.
*  They didn't get the love that they deserved
*  because people had already thought it was corny
*  to have makeup on for some reason.
*  They didn't have real hit records that were like,
*  their songs didn't play on the radio that much.
*  If they played on the radio, it was rare.
*  You don't think so?
*  Well, I kind of grew up as KISS being a household
*  name already.
*  Yeah, well they were huge.
*  They sold millions of records.
*  They sold out arenas,
*  but they weren't getting love on the radio.
*  It was just fans.
*  And there was a thing that people would be embarrassed
*  to be a KISS fan.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  You'd be embarrassed.
*  Other kids would make fun of you.
*  Why?
*  Because you're like those idiots with makeup on.
*  What the fuck is wrong with you?
*  Boy, bro, KISS is the shit.
*  That doesn't even seem like a thing now at all.
*  Now it's not.
*  You have to realize in the 1980s it was a thing.
*  Right.
*  Yeah, people would mock you if you're in a KISS.
*  Damn.
*  And then they became cool again.
*  They became cool again somewhere in the 90s
*  when they started going on tour again with makeup.
*  Right.
*  So they were gonna do one last final tour they decided,
*  but that was bullshit.
*  They just kept going.
*  Everyone does a last tour.
*  Last, last, last, last.
*  That's those marketing guys.
*  I'll tell you what, Gary.
*  This is your final tour.
*  This is what I'm saying.
*  He doesn't have to be on the final tour,
*  but we'll sell it as your final tour.
*  We're gonna milk the shit out of this.
*  People are gonna love it.
*  They're gonna be very excited to go see the last time.
*  Gary's gonna become a photographer.
*  He's just really gotten into photography
*  and we're gonna have to respect that.
*  Yeah, we're gonna have to respect his wishes.
*  But this is his last tour.
*  Gary, don't quit.
*  Don't go into pictures.
*  Don't go.
*  Don't go into photography, Gary.
*  Don't do it.
*  But it's just.
*  Kiss, so Kiss came back in the 90s
*  and I went to see him with Kevin James.
*  Me and Kevin James went to see Kiss when they came back.
*  We were like, this is amazing.
*  Is that in Hollywood?
*  I think it was.
*  I think it was in LA.
*  That must have been crazy.
*  It was incredible.
*  It was incredible with the makeup on, all the shit.
*  Fire.
*  Man, those guys really turned rock and roll
*  into entertainment.
*  Yeah.
*  You know what I mean?
*  It was every single aspect of the show,
*  from the costumes to the pyro,
*  the timing, the crazy antics,
*  the just, I mean, and then selling it,
*  like this big, huge thing with the merch
*  and the dolls and the crazy shit.
*  It was like, I mean, it was,
*  they made it known that Kiss was a fucking thing.
*  And they had the fans, I guess, to push it.
*  But that's.
*  They had a one hour long TV show.
*  I don't know.
*  Where it was like a movie,
*  like a made for TV movie.
*  It was Kiss and the Phantom of the Park.
*  And I was like, this is,
*  and in the middle of it,
*  like three quarters of the way into the show,
*  the fucking power went on at my house.
*  I was like, no.
*  I can't believe this.
*  I can't believe it's shut off.
*  It's just the power shut off.
*  I was like, this is so fucked.
*  This is Kiss and the Phantom of the Park.
*  It was like a real corny made for TV movie.
*  How long were you waiting for this?
*  Well, when you were a Kiss fan, first of all,
*  you had to find out from like the newspaper.
*  Like, how did you even know?
*  Or you had to read the TV guide.
*  Like what?
*  Kiss has got a movie?
*  And it was maybe the dumbest movie
*  that's ever been made.
*  It's pretty dumb.
*  It's so dumb.
*  I need like, look at this.
*  Look at it so corny.
*  I mean, I might have to go back and watch it now.
*  It's so corny.
*  It's literally so ridiculous.
*  It's so bad.
*  So they're out here whooping ass?
*  Oh yeah, they were superheroes.
*  They became superheroes for a while.
*  I did not know this.
*  Easy, cat man, they are serious.
*  And they've got guns.
*  This is ridiculous.
*  It is ridiculous.
*  Oh, it was so ridiculous.
*  It was one of the dumbest movies that's ever been made.
*  My favorite shit to watch is the dumbest shit.
*  This is the dumbest shit.
*  This is the dumbest shit.
*  This is the dumbest shit.
*  So I would enjoy this.
*  This is so dumb, it might've been made by the Chinese.
*  They might have done it to subvert American institutions.
*  They might have done it to try to ruin young minds
*  and just lower the standards of what is acceptable
*  to the point where they could invade.
*  I mean, that's a power move for sure.
*  That's what they're doing right now.
*  That's a power move.
*  That's what they're doing right now with TikTok.
*  Man.
*  I firmly believe that.
*  Russia and China are just fucking us sideways.
*  I'll tell you right now, man.
*  I've been having conversations about music
*  and sharing music and the way to be on this TikTok.
*  It's the way to get everybody to this crazy,
*  fucked up weird place.
*  It's nasty in there.
*  Well, it's something that people are not designed to manage.
*  They don't know how to manage it.
*  They don't know what that experience is.
*  It's new to the human anatomy
*  to have some thing that you're staring at,
*  that you keep in your pocket
*  that carries 20 hours of battery life
*  and just flipping through things all day long,
*  just giving a little tiny drip of dopamine every time.
*  Beep, beep.
*  Beep, beep.
*  Not much, just enough to keep you interested.
*  And just flipping through that fucking phone all day long.
*  It's changing the way people view things.
*  It's changing what's acceptable.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  I've noticed that it changed me
*  when we were sitting down for a little while
*  because I was just in my phone.
*  That was the only way that I was getting information.
*  I wasn't hanging out with people.
*  Yeah, it changes your anxiety levels.
*  That's what I realized.
*  It changed my anxiety levels.
*  I was not sleeping.
*  I was drinking a lot more than I normally would
*  just because I was overthinking shit.
*  Yeah.
*  You know?
*  That was COVID too though, the isolation.
*  I'm not saying that this is what they did
*  but if you wanted to do that,
*  if you wanted to turn a population
*  into a bunch of cowards,
*  one of the best ways is to isolate everybody.
*  Isolate everybody, get them scared,
*  give them one solution to get out of this thing.
*  Everybody else, against that solution is the enemy
*  and they're gonna stop us from getting back to normal.
*  Oh, absolutely.
*  And you could do that through social media,
*  especially through Twitter.
*  Better than you can with anything.
*  And it's just, it's a weird way to get information.
*  I broke my phone once, I was in Hawaii
*  with my family and I dropped my phone
*  and it just started making phone calls.
*  Just, I would go, look at this.
*  I was showing my wife, I go, look at this.
*  I hang up, call someone else.
*  Hang up, call someone else.
*  Just calling people.
*  Wouldn't stop calling people.
*  So I had to shut it off and I had to get a new phone
*  but it took three days for the phone to get there.
*  So for three days I had no phone
*  because every time I turned my phone
*  I would just start calling people.
*  So for three whole days I had no phone
*  and it was, I was like, ooh, I feel so much better.
*  And then part of me was like, you know what?
*  Fuck phones.
*  You just have a phone and have nothing on,
*  nope, went right back to it.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Right back to Instagram, right back to Twitter,
*  right back to YouTube, right back to Google.
*  I know.
*  Right back.
*  I know, I did the same shit.
*  One person sends me a meme, oh shit.
*  Yeah, it's over.
*  Yeah.
*  It's over.
*  Yeah, you're back in the game, man.
*  Someone sends me a funny video,
*  I gotta sign back up for Instagram.
*  All right, let me see this.
*  Oh shit.
*  Yeah, I got your same problem.
*  I got your same problem.
*  I gotta just, I have to consciously just leave it.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, I have one phone that has nothing on it.
*  I have one phone that has no apps,
*  doesn't have anything on it.
*  So if someone sends me,
*  I gotta send a link to my other phone.
*  Nice.
*  And most of the time I don't click that link.
*  There's the hack.
*  That's the hack.
*  It at least has cut me back about 30% for sure.
*  30% of paying attention to shit.
*  Unless someone says, you have to see this,
*  this is insane.
*  No, okay.
*  I can use that 30%.
*  I'll use it on my 30% now.
*  I'm gonna use that.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  That way also you can cut down
*  on the amount of people that have your phone phone.
*  You got your phone, then you got your phone phone.
*  Yeah.
*  And the phone phone is like,
*  this is the one that like 20 people have.
*  That's the way to go.
*  Yeah, I was doing that for a while.
*  When I lived in New York, I was doing that.
*  And then I just got, I was wearing skinny jeans
*  and I couldn't do the skinny jean two phone thing
*  and my wallet and my keys.
*  It was ridiculous.
*  You didn't accept the fanny pack in your life.
*  Well, look.
*  Ah, the satchel.
*  I've showed up with the satchel.
*  I'm converted.
*  The satchel is the artist version of the fanny pack.
*  The fanny pack is saying, I don't give a fuck.
*  I'm not.
*  The fanny pack is like, I'm a nerd, I'm a loser.
*  I don't care.
*  I do not care.
*  I'm not ready for that yet, Joe.
*  Well, in Texas, you see people carrying fanny packs.
*  A lot of those fanny packs have guns in them.
*  Especially those big ones.
*  Oh yeah, I know where I'm at.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  You definitely know where I'm at.
*  There's a reason, you see that dude
*  with the fucking Bass Pro Shop hat
*  and the fucking flannel t-shirt on.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Yeah, that guy.
*  Yeah.
*  With that fanny pack?
*  Mm-hmm.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, yeah, don't try.
*  Origin boots on.
*  Yeah, that dude, there's something in that.
*  That's a heavy fanny pack.
*  I just see them cats and I just go, hey.
*  Howdy, good day.
*  That's why I see people out here getting,
*  I saw some dude getting road rage the other night
*  at South by Southwest.
*  Bro.
*  Bro, this guy jumped out of his car,
*  ran to the car in front of him,
*  started yelling at the driver.
*  I was like, do not do that, sir.
*  I do not want to watch you get shot.
*  You gotta, they gotta be from out of town
*  because you can't do.
*  South by Southwest.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  You can't do road rage shit, bro.
*  No.
*  You cannot.
*  No, it goes south too quick.
*  People don't fuck around out here.
*  They don't fuck around and they also don't know you.
*  They don't know, they watch too much YouTube too.
*  They're watching too much Instagram too.
*  They're seeing all the fucking riots and craziness
*  and people getting pulled out of their cars.
*  Everyone's seeing those videos of someone getting fucked up
*  in some sort of a road rage situation.
*  Yeah, any sense of a threat people are,
*  yeah, hair trigger like real quick.
*  Road rage in particular because everybody's,
*  people don't understand, I've said this ad nauseam
*  but I'll say it again.
*  When you're in a car, you're hyper alert
*  because you're going fast,
*  there's all these things around you
*  and you always have to be ready.
*  So your brain is at a seven already.
*  So when someone cuts you off, it's like motherfucker.
*  That's why like on the street,
*  if someone gets in front of you on the street,
*  it means nothing.
*  Because you don't have to worry about crashing.
*  There's no fear of this person stepping in front of you.
*  It means nothing.
*  Like I have no worry that I'm gonna crash into this man
*  in front of me and we're both gonna die.
*  But when you're in a car and some guy changes lanes
*  in front of you like motherfucker dude,
*  what are you doing bitch?
*  You rolled down the window, you fucking idiot.
*  And then you see him at the stop sign,
*  you jump out of your car.
*  Oh dude, don't do it.
*  Yeah, I'm guilty of, yeah, I'm yelling at people in my car.
*  As long as you stay in the car.
*  But yeah, I will motherfucker somebody with the windows up.
*  Yes, that's fine.
*  But normal, that's normal behavior.
*  And then I get to the light and I just give them a look.
*  Like you know I saw what you did.
*  I'm just acknowledging that I'm not down with the bullshit.
*  I just want you to know that I saw you.
*  I don't want no problems, but just check, check.
*  Come on man.
*  It's a come on man.
*  And if it's a reasonable person,
*  that person's like what the fuck did I do that for?
*  If it's a reasonable person.
*  My favorite though is when they just keep looking forward.
*  I know you can feel this.
*  I know you can feel this.
*  Well it's interesting watching the Texas culture
*  get invaded by the California culture.
*  You can see it in how they drive.
*  Yeah.
*  People that are cutting people off
*  and rushing to nowhere.
*  You see it in how they drive.
*  I notice it.
*  I avoid certain streets based on that.
*  So I'm like where the fuck did y'all come from man?
*  Well that was South by Southwest.
*  South by Southwest basically like LA comes to Austin.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I stayed away for the most part.
*  I had a couple of events during South by,
*  but I love my city.
*  But that shit has just gotten crazy man.
*  Those festivals are nuts.
*  It's wild.
*  Yeah.
*  I used to have this one parking spot
*  that people thought was a handicapped spot,
*  but it wasn't.
*  It was like right on the line.
*  And I figured this out from years
*  of spending way too much time
*  wandering around on Sixth Street.
*  And I remember one year they took that spot away
*  and I was driving around for like an hour and a half
*  looking for parking.
*  Fuck this place man.
*  This ain't my city no more.
*  I love you Austin, but yeah I was like,
*  ah man the game has definitely changed.
*  While we were driving to the club last night
*  we looked up we saw five skyscrapers being built.
*  There's five skyscrapers being built right now.
*  I know all those folks who are building on that stuff.
*  I know them.
*  They're like my neighbors and shit.
*  So they like come blow the city up
*  and then come back to the country.
*  Yeah.
*  But there's so many apartment buildings being built.
*  It's happening.
*  Yeah it's wild.
*  I've never seen the city grow like this.
*  I haven't either.
*  I haven't either.
*  But I think it was inevitable.
*  I mean I think it was just one of them things.
*  What's too good?
*  It's just too much of a gem.
*  I blame you a little bit.
*  A little bit.
*  I'm responsible.
*  I know I'm responsible for at least 20 or 30 comedians.
*  Yeah no absolutely.
*  Which is amazing because that's my favorite shit
*  is you guys being down the street.
*  I don't come hang.
*  But yeah the city has grown in a way that
*  is somewhat unrecognizable to me.
*  Like everything that I kind of grew up on,
*  grew up with is all my spots I used to hang out
*  and are gone now.
*  And I saw I was saying something to my old man
*  the other day and he was like man shut the fuck up.
*  He's like I've been here my whole life.
*  And what do you think that I think?
*  What do you think that I've seen?
*  It's just change is inevitable.
*  If you look at pictures from 1836 it's not the same spot.
*  Right.
*  You know what I mean?
*  So it's just what's happening right now.
*  It's a crazy time to be a part of it and see it up close.
*  Because I'm watching my little town,
*  seeing familiar faces all of a sudden.
*  It's like there's new energy.
*  There's new folks around.
*  There's new business.
*  There's a new business sense here.
*  It's cool and funny and funky.
*  It's just change happening.
*  I'm in the middle of watching it.
*  Yeah.
*  I was hanging out with Elon
*  at the very beginning of the pandemic.
*  Whenever I was scared to be inside.
*  I was telling him my plans to open up the club
*  and all that stuff.
*  And we were just talking about Austin.
*  He was like Austin's gonna go supernova.
*  Yeah.
*  He was right.
*  Yeah, he was right.
*  Called it.
*  Yeah, he called it.
*  But it's still manageable.
*  It's still like the traffic is nothing compared to LA.
*  Man, I like it.
*  I like that there's new shit here.
*  In the city that I grew up in
*  and you're looking for some excitement.
*  It's like it comes to you.
*  You don't have to go look for it.
*  Just get in my car and come see some new shit.
*  It's exciting for me.
*  It's all my favorite stuff happening around here too.
*  I think it's good.
*  I think it's overall good.
*  And also I think that the people that are moving here
*  are embracing this new life.
*  They're embracing like it's a new city.
*  It's a new vibe, new way of behaving.
*  People are more friendly.
*  People adapt to that.
*  When people move to an environment,
*  they adapt to that environment.
*  They move to this town.
*  They sort of take up the energy of the town.
*  And this town already has an established energy.
*  Yeah, I'm still concerned about the driving though.
*  Because they're getting aggressive?
*  Yeah.
*  They're different.
*  They drive different.
*  It's a little different.
*  It's a little different.
*  But yeah, I mean, you move to a place
*  that you love the energy at, I suppose.
*  It takes a little while to adapt.
*  I mean, I'm just watching it happen.
*  I'm watching it happen.
*  It's cool to me.
*  The tech people I worry about more than anybody.
*  Because they're not artists.
*  Like the tech people moving here,
*  what they've done to San Francisco.
*  Those people with that, those wacky, woke ideas.
*  I'm not even thinking about that, yeah.
*  That scares the shit out of me.
*  Because there's a lot of them.
*  I mean, look at that giant ass fucking building
*  that they built.
*  Google building, right?
*  Or a Facebook building?
*  Which one is it?
*  Which one's the sale?
*  That cool sale?
*  Google.
*  Google.
*  They put a giant ass building right on the lake.
*  I don't even know if I noticed that.
*  It's a giant ass building right on Cesar Chavez.
*  But then they just fired like 15,000 people.
*  So I think that place is mostly vacant.
*  Did they just overshoot?
*  I think they overshoot.
*  That's it.
*  Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah.
*  That's a dope building.
*  That's a dope building.
*  So I think they overshot.
*  And I also think the reality is AI is coming.
*  And there's so many people that are working in tech
*  that will not have a job in five years.
*  The job will be nonsense.
*  They'll be like asking a person to make steel beams
*  in his backyard with a fucking hammer and a pot.
*  No, why would we do it that way?
*  That's a stupid way to do it.
*  We have steel mills, stupid.
*  Why would I let you make your own girders?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  That's dumb.
*  It's dumb, it doesn't make any sense.
*  What we can do now, AI is gonna be able to do better,
*  more efficiently, much quicker, cheaper.
*  No hiring people, no worrying about insurance
*  or any of that shit that you have to worry about with people.
*  401K plans, all that shit's gone.
*  And this is something that Andrew Yang was talking about
*  when he was running for president in, I guess it was 2020.
*  He was talking about that.
*  And he was right, he was right.
*  That there's some things that are happening.
*  Was that 2020 or 2016 with Andrew Yang?
*  I don't remember.
*  16.
*  And he was very concerned even back then.
*  So this is eight years ago.
*  He was saying like AI is coming.
*  And that's why he was pushing for universal basic income.
*  Sorry, 2020.
*  2020.
*  So that's why he was pushing for universal basic income.
*  And he was saying, look, there's gonna be so many people
*  that there are no jobs.
*  If you're a truck driver, you have 10 years.
*  In 10 years, everything will be automated.
*  There'll all be those giant electric trucks.
*  They'll all be run by a computer.
*  They'll never get in accidents.
*  And they never get tired.
*  And then you never have to worry about them doing meth
*  and picking up hookers or going crazy,
*  falling asleep at the wheel, driving into a fair.
*  That's what makes the best cops episodes.
*  That's a world, huh?
*  That truck driver world.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a world of wild folks.
*  Well, you know, we tour on buses
*  and we got to fuel up at the same places where they do.
*  And yeah, it's a funky world out there.
*  It's a funky world.
*  A lot of dudes on amphetamines doing 12, 13 hour runs,
*  just wide eyes, huge pupils,
*  just listening to fucking conspiracy theories on the radio.
*  We had one of them drive us.
*  Did you?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Crash the bus.
*  Oh no, really?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Well, not crash the bus, but like kind of ran the bus into a...
*  He ruined the bus.
*  He was all doped up and super drunk.
*  Oh no.
*  Yeah, we didn't realize he was going through
*  any of this talking stuff.
*  So we were leaving a gig one night and sure enough,
*  he pulled the bus and crashed it into the gate.
*  I had to grab this motherfucker.
*  So he was fucked up at the gig?
*  Yeah.
*  So he got fucked up while the show was going on?
*  Yeah, I think he'd just been going for,
*  I guess maybe a bend, we had a couple of days off, I think,
*  in a certain city.
*  Dude was just gone, I guess he just got into it
*  and said, fuck it.
*  He just hit the fuck it button.
*  It was like, man, fuck all this shit, I don't care.
*  Yeah, that's a danger, right?
*  Because you just trust in this dude
*  and it's not like you're gonna drug test him every day.
*  No.
*  He's a driver, you trust him, he's a professional.
*  Yeah, he's got a resume, people have recommended him
*  for years and years and years.
*  He does his job, you do your job,
*  how you doing, Frank?
*  You wanna sit down on the bus?
*  Yeah.
*  Meanwhile, Frank is just gone.
*  We didn't.
*  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.
*  Yeah.
*  Frank is on Coke and tequila and ah!
*  Yeah, I've been at the hotel lobby bar just going after him.
*  All day long.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah, shows up, like, hey, Ryde's here.
*  Oh boy.
*  And he's like, I got this, I got this.
*  We just met him, I guess at the wrong time.
*  Yeah, you could've caught him a month earlier,
*  everything would've been fine.
*  Been cool.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a balancing act for a guy like Frank.
*  But I think about those truck drivers, man,
*  and bus drivers who drive at all funky weird times at night.
*  Mm-hmm, it's a lonely life.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  It's a lonely life.
*  If you have a family too, you're sad.
*  Sure.
*  Your family's at home, it's 12 hours of driving
*  to get back there.
*  Mm-hmm.
*  And then you're only there for a little while,
*  you gotta go back again.
*  Yeah.
*  Man, that's what kind of has been my problem with touring,
*  the way we've been touring, is being gone.
*  Yeah.
*  Multiple times.
*  Yeah, for long periods of time during the year.
*  I only did that once.
*  I only did the month thing once.
*  Me and Charlie Murphy and John Heffron,
*  we did this Bud Light Real Men at Comedy Tour once.
*  Mm-hmm.
*  Well, we did 22 dates in 30 days.
*  Sure.
*  And we were just out basically every night
*  and wake up in a hotel room, where am I?
*  Yeah.
*  Where am I?
*  I forgot where I am.
*  And after that, I was like, I'm never doing that again.
*  I, like, Tom Segura, that crazy fuck,
*  he'll do like 60 dates in a row.
*  He'll be gone for two months,
*  where he has a show almost every night.
*  Yeah.
*  And he's just going all over the place.
*  His name, the name of his tour was I'm Coming Everywhere.
*  Yeah.
*  It's just brilliant.
*  Brilliant.
*  Yeah.
*  Brilliant.
*  Yeah.
*  Brilliant.
*  Yeah.
*  But, you know, that's what he was doing.
*  Yeah, literally.
*  Everywhere.
*  Yeah, everywhere.
*  Everywhere.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I get that.
*  I would love to do just weekend fly dates,
*  do stuff like that, but I got a whole band in production
*  and my band is getting bigger.
*  And so, you know, that's like, I've got to do it.
*  But I decided this time,
*  I'm just going to bring my family with me.
*  And just, you know,
*  have them grow up out on the road instead of.
*  You did that for a while, right?
*  You took your son when you were in Europe.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Yeah, I took him out there.
*  That's got to be a great experience for him.
*  Yeah, it was great.
*  It was great for him.
*  That little motherfucker just,
*  he didn't want to play guitar though,
*  until he saw Slash.
*  I think I told you.
*  He's like, man.
*  But yeah, so I think I'd rather have them
*  come out and hang with me this time.
*  Yeah, that's safer.
*  It's like more fun.
*  You don't get sad and lonely and they don't feel weird.
*  And for them, it's an experience like,
*  wow, I get to see what dad's doing.
*  This is crazy.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Instead of just like FaceTiming them.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  And picking up weird lingo
*  from their funky ass friends at school.
*  What the fuck did you just say to me?
*  Yeah.
*  Did you just call me bruh?
*  No.
*  No.
*  No, you're coming with me.
*  Yeah, my kid started saying cap.
*  Cap and no cap.
*  I was like, what?
*  What is that?
*  What does that even mean?
*  Do you know what that,
*  where'd that come from?
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know either.
*  Times are a-changin'.
*  Yeah, times are a-changin'.
*  But yeah, it's.
*  That's a better way to do it.
*  But it's a different thing with a band.
*  You got a whole band.
*  You got a bunch of other people.
*  Like, the crazy thing, we were just talking,
*  I was talking to Shane Gillis
*  and he was talking about his experience
*  hosting Saturday Night Live.
*  And he's like, Saturday Night Live only pays you $5,000.
*  It's like, you host it for a week.
*  It's $5,000.
*  We're like, that's crazy.
*  But then I talked to Pat from the Black Keys
*  and he was telling me, he's like,
*  you wanna hear it even crazier.
*  He was like, when you do a late night show,
*  it costs you money.
*  Cause you gotta fly everybody out there.
*  You got a band, you got hotels, you got this, you got that.
*  Like, it costs you $50,000 to do a late night show.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, absolutely.
*  I just did that a couple times.
*  Yeah.
*  Catch me on such and such.
*  Yeah.
*  Watch them shits.
*  Buy the album.
*  Yeah.
*  It's funky, like the whole promo thing
*  and to do late night television.
*  How effective is it now?
*  Debatable.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know how effective it is.
*  It's not what it used to be.
*  I don't think so.
*  I mean, from my experience,
*  TV promo, like certain ways that were,
*  I guess the only way to move,
*  it's not moving the needle as much.
*  Maybe it's just for me as my personal experience.
*  I think it's for everybody.
*  But it's not really moving like it used to,
*  but it is still important in some capacity.
*  I don't understand it, you know?
*  But I'm a fan, so I like to go play the late show
*  with Letterman, to go play the tonight show.
*  It's like, that's a dream to me as a kid.
*  Right.
*  You know, like I love to be able to do that,
*  to be able to step in that building
*  and play Saturday Night Live.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like, it's a thing, but it's,
*  you're investing in something
*  where you're not really quite sure on what the return is.
*  Right.
*  But still, you're doing it because you just wanna do it.
*  It's a cool milestone.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  And also, in a record business,
*  people aren't really, you gotta be everywhere.
*  Right.
*  You know?
*  And you gotta do that and also be your own promotion
*  on social media, which is a wild thing, you know?
*  Yeah.
*  And people are leaning on TikTok.
*  I mean, I have meetings with folks about,
*  you know, what's the plan, what's the strategy,
*  what are we doing?
*  Well, we gotta get traction on TikTok.
*  We gotta do this.
*  So I caught myself a couple times
*  doing some goofy ass shit for TikTok.
*  And I'm like, I don't like this, man.
*  Like, I don't, this doesn't feel good to me.
*  Right, it feels whorish.
*  Yeah, it feels whorish.
*  It feels, it's not in my character.
*  It's not in my, it feels fishy.
*  It feels reachy.
*  It feels gross.
*  And it's like, well, this is kind of what's happening
*  in the business.
*  And I'm like, well, I don't know if this is,
*  you know, and these are these debates.
*  Well, this is what is going on.
*  I'm like, that's why I'm gonna go be a fucking photographer.
*  You know, it's like, it's,
*  it doesn't feel like it should feel to me.
*  Right, it doesn't feel authentic.
*  Not at all.
*  Yeah.
*  And then, and everything is,
*  you can't film sideways anymore.
*  Everything's gotta be vertical for the algorithm.
*  I'm like, what the fuck are we talking about?
*  Right.
*  Let's talk about some music.
*  I felt like James Brown in it.
*  Fucking.
*  Isn't it weird that the shape of the phone
*  dictated the way you hold it?
*  It's wild to me.
*  And that's what we're talking about
*  in music business meetings.
*  That's funky.
*  Because remember, before TikTok became huge,
*  Andrew Schultz had that thing that he was doing on Instagram.
*  It was like, turn your phone sideways.
*  So he was telling everybody, hey, turn your phone sideways.
*  They turn their phone sideways,
*  and then he had it that way.
*  Simple. Simple.
*  Simple.
*  Yeah.
*  But now it became all about the reels,
*  and you gotta be able to flip up from one reel to the next,
*  so now it has to be vertical.
*  And then it just keeps you going,
*  it keeps you going, it keeps you going,
*  it keeps you going, it keeps you going.
*  What's gonna happen if those foldable things
*  get adopted by everybody?
*  Because I went into a rabbit hole last night,
*  I got into foldables.
*  Because I have one, I have a Z Fold Flip 4,
*  whatever the fuck it is.
*  What is that?
*  Never used it.
*  It's a Samsung foldable phone.
*  I was like, this is gonna be great.
*  I'll be watching YouTube videos, much larger,
*  but then you're carrying this brick around your pocket,
*  and it folds, it's weird.
*  The whole thing is weird, but eventually,
*  I know a lot of people that have adopted those
*  because they don't wanna take a laptop with them.
*  So they have to answer an email to open up the fold
*  so they can have a laptop set up, basically,
*  in this 10 inch or eight inch thing.
*  Yeah.
*  And they've got this little thing, and then folds it,
*  and it's the size of a regular phone.
*  So what are they gonna do then?
*  If that becomes, if Apple releases a fold phone,
*  that's when it's gonna take off.
*  Because right now, it's only Android phones have that now.
*  And that's only a certain percentage of the people,
*  especially people that are,
*  most of the social media platforms are,
*  they're made better on iPhones.
*  Like, their apps are better.
*  They're optimized for iPhones.
*  So if they start doing an Apple foldable phone,
*  I wonder if it'll be a different thing.
*  You gotta hold, yeah, now you have to hold it sideways.
*  Because everybody's doing sideways now.
*  I don't know, that's beyond my-
*  But that thing is, if a thing organically becomes viral,
*  like if you have a song that you put out
*  and organically becomes viral, there is no better promotion.
*  There's nothing better.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  Because everyone can share it.
*  I go, oh, check this out.
*  I'll share it to friends, they'll share it to their friends,
*  they'll put it on Instagram, they'll put it here,
*  they'll put it there, they put it on Twitter,
*  and then next thing you know.
*  Yeah, but you never know what it's gonna be, right?
*  You can't.
*  There's no way to know.
*  Yeah, no way to know.
*  You have no idea.
*  Yeah, it's a lottery.
*  It's crazy.
*  Like, some things hit and you're like, how?
*  And then other things don't hit and you're like,
*  how did we miss this one?
*  There's a song that we play all the time,
*  can't play anymore because of YouTube,
*  now we're on YouTube, this is dude Johnny Thunder.
*  He wrote this song, I'm Alive, from 1969.
*  You ever heard this song?
*  Bro, we'll cut it out, we'll cut it out.
*  Jamie, play this song.
*  We'll cut this out so the people of YouTube,
*  just go look up Johnny Thunder, I'm Alive.
*  So this is a 1969 song.
*  What the fuck did they do to Johnny Thunder?
*  How did that happen?
*  What did they do to Johnny Thunder?
*  I've never heard that.
*  How did he not become a superstar?
*  That's everything right there.
*  It's everything.
*  That's rock and roll, baby.
*  It's amazing, and it's 1969.
*  That is rock and roll.
*  And Johnny's not with us anymore, he's gone.
*  So how did you find that?
*  Brian Simpson.
*  Brian Simpson came into the green rooms,
*  I do, you gotta hear this fucking song.
*  Oh no, it was just written by someone else.
*  Wow. Written by someone else.
*  It was released by Johnny Thunder.
*  Yeah.
*  It's also on a Mountain Dew commercial right now.
*  Wow. 1968 it was released.
*  It's in a Mountain Dew commercial.
*  Mountain Dew's been listening to this podcast,
*  guarantee.
*  Thank you for sharing that, man.
*  That was incredible.
*  How good is that song?
*  That's like hearing Hendrix for the first time.
*  Right, like that's a superstar.
*  Like that's not just good, that changes your feeling.
*  Your skin gets goosebumps.
*  Yeah, I was going through it.
*  Woo!
*  I was going through a lot.
*  I heard it a thousand times, I still go through it.
*  That was powerful.
*  It's powerful.
*  That guy should have been a superstar.
*  Damn.
*  Johnny Thunder should have been the fucking man.
*  That's like my new shit.
*  Is this another one?
*  Tom Jones.
*  Oh, this is the other version of it.
*  Is that okay?
*  Oh, I'm cool on this.
*  No disrespect, but.
*  No disrespect.
*  The other version.
*  I want that, I want the other version to be resonating.
*  That other version is fine,
*  if I didn't know that Johnny Thunder existed.
*  But the thing is, if a guy can make a song like that,
*  if Johnny Thunder can make a song like I'm Alive,
*  how is he?
*  I feel like you just gotta get the right songwriters,
*  the right people with him,
*  and you got a fucking superstar.
*  How did they fuck that up?
*  If I heard that once,
*  if I was a music producer or an executive,
*  and I went to see this guy live and I heard that,
*  I'd be like, sign him.
*  Sign him.
*  He's the one, man.
*  Twice.
*  He's the one.
*  That dude's out there.
*  He's out there.
*  And no one knows.
*  And no one knew.
*  And this is.
*  I forgot we found this Bob Dylan quote before, I think.
*  What did he say?
*  Bob Dylan, who heard Thunder's I'm Alive on radio,
*  was asked for Rolling Stones yawn winner that year.
*  If he was impressed by anything in the rock music scene
*  and pointed to the song.
*  Never heard of it either, huh?
*  Well, I can't believe it.
*  Everyone I've talked to, I've asked them,
*  and they've heard that record.
*  It was one of the most powerful records I've ever heard.
*  It's called I'm Alive by Johnny Thunder.
*  Well, it was that sentiment truly expressed.
*  That's the most I can say.
*  If you heard the record, you'd know what I mean.
*  Yeah.
*  Meanwhile, no one fucking knew.
*  Samsung used it in 2015.
*  Samsung used it in their advertisement
*  for the Galaxy S6 Edge in 2015.
*  It was also used in the soundtrack
*  to 2018 film American Animals.
*  Since the 1960s, Thunder's has continued to tour
*  internationally, but has regularly appeared
*  on luxury cruise ships.
*  Wow.
*  In the Caribbean and elsewhere.
*  He's dead though, right?
*  No, he's still alive.
*  Oh, I thought he wasn't around anymore.
*  Gil Hamilton.
*  His name is Gil Hamilton, he's 91 years old.
*  Wow.
*  Okay.
*  Okay, I was under the impression,
*  someone told me he wasn't around anymore.
*  Bro, let me tell you something, that don't make any sense.
*  That doesn't make any sense.
*  That's like a comic like Kinnison doing that thing
*  about a starving children ad on television.
*  You ever see that bit?
*  Kinnison had this bit about starving children on TV.
*  Like you're at home, just making your food,
*  sitting down in front of the TV,
*  and Sally Struthers is on TV, won't you please help?
*  Yeah, right.
*  And he goes, instead of sending these people food,
*  send them something like me.
*  Someone's gonna go there and go, hey,
*  we just drove 5,000 miles where your food is,
*  and we realized.
*  What's that?
*  This is the only other recording that he might have that,
*  or there might be a few more,
*  but this is doing a children's nursery rhyme
*  he was convinced to do, like his first thing
*  as Johnny Thunder.
*  Hold up a minute and watch me now.
*  Here we go loop, loop, loop, loop, loop, loop now.
*  Here we go loop, loop, loop, loop, loop, loop now.
*  That's interesting.
*  Hmm.
*  All right.
*  Yeah, edit that out.
*  Don't hit quite the same.
*  No, I was hoping for something.
*  No, that doesn't hit the same.
*  No, I'm Alive was the song.
*  You just need to get the right songs with the dude.
*  But if he could do that, like that's,
*  he got magic, it's in a bottle.
*  Now you gotta figure out how to, what's the formula?
*  Like get some writers, get some really good songwriters,
*  sit down with that dude and let him go.
*  Yeah, yeah, sometimes you just catch one.
*  Sometimes you just catch a wave and you just go, man.
*  Yeah.
*  And you can't, you keep trying to chase that thing
*  and it's just never the same.
*  That is the craziest thing, the one hit wonder.
*  That is the craziest thing,
*  cause sometimes those hits are bangers.
*  Right.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  It's just one.
*  Absolutely, you just catch it.
*  I feel like if Johnny Thunder knew the right people,
*  he would've been huge.
*  He needs a better PR team or something.
*  But even Bob Dylan in Rolling Stone was talking about him
*  and that wasn't enough.
*  What year was that article?
*  It said that year.
*  90s?
*  60 year.
*  I'll see if it's funny.
*  It was that year.
*  Oh, it was that year?
*  Yeah.
*  Wow.
*  I don't know, was that a race thing?
*  Well Hendrix popped.
*  Oh yeah.
*  You know, there was James Brown popped.
*  That's true.
*  It just doesn't make sense that that guy's that good.
*  That feels like that's transcendent music.
*  That transcends everything.
*  That transcends culture.
*  That's something that everyone will listen to.
*  Maybe it was a little ahead of its time.
*  How?
*  How could that?
*  Because it just, it didn't, it maybe.
*  But doesn't it sound like a hit?
*  It sounds like a hit now.
*  God damn it, it had to sound like a hit back then.
*  But it probably sounded like,
*  what the fuck is that coming through the radio?
*  I don't know man, if you listen to Peace Frog,
*  that's like the same time with the doors.
*  You know, there's like a lot of wild funky music
*  that comes from back then, you know?
*  Did that hit radio at the time?
*  Oh yeah, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know, I don't know.
*  Some things are just a miss.
*  One of my favorite artists who I think
*  doesn't get the light that they deserve
*  is a guy called Arthur Alexander.
*  And this guy was like Americana, songwriting,
*  blues, country, all of it.
*  You know, all of them.
*  Never heard of him.
*  I've never heard of him.
*  He's got songs, great songwriting, cool funky voice.
*  What's the song we should listen to?
*  There's a song called Anna,
*  there's a song called Go With Him.
*  Try Go With Him.
*  Let's try that one.
*  I think it's the same song.
*  Yeah, let's cut it out again.
*  That song's a flex.
*  Think about what he's saying.
*  It's a total flex.
*  Go with him.
*  Go.
*  If he loves you more, hey, I love you,
*  but if he loves you more, that's a flex.
*  Bye.
*  I know girls like that.
*  That's a very needy girl, and she's never gonna be happy.
*  And you just have to say, hey, whatever you wanna do.
*  Go ahead.
*  I think you're awesome, but whatever you wanna do.
*  I think you're awesome.
*  Nasty though.
*  There's some that you just can't hold onto.
*  You have to recognize that.
*  It's true, that's the blues right there.
*  Go ahead.
*  There's another one too, Shuggy Otis.
*  I don't know if you know Shuggy Otis.
*  No.
*  Yeah man, Shuggy Otis was one of them guys.
*  He's like psychedelic rock, funk, soul, dude.
*  I found these guys on the same trip.
*  My buddy Jay Moeller, who was touring with me at the time,
*  was listening to this stuff.
*  Like I said, psychedelic ahead of its time,
*  I think maybe 60, 70, 71.
*  He put out a record called Inspiration Information.
*  And it's just like maybe a chocolate, couple of bowls.
*  Sit back and you're going.
*  Yeah, great artist.
*  But I mean, not as powerful as Johnny Thunder.
*  Like that, I'm alive is.
*  That's a classic.
*  Damn.
*  Yeah man, Shuggy Otis.
*  You get this mostly just from other artists
*  that just tell you about stuff?
*  Yeah, a lot.
*  Yeah, that's kind of why I like to move around a little bit.
*  I'm still of old school, hang out at the bar.
*  Hey, what are you into?
*  I've been checking this out, check this out.
*  I still go into record stores
*  and just go ask what do y'all like?
*  What are y'all listening to?
*  Like just turn me on to something.
*  I don't care.
*  So they'll be like, hey, try this.
*  So I'll try it and either I love it or I don't.
*  But yeah, I'm just curious.
*  Well, those bar conversations are underrated.
*  Absolutely.
*  Yeah.
*  They're the best.
*  They can be the best or the weirdest.
*  Yeah.
*  It's all of it.
*  It's an experience.
*  It's an experience.
*  Wow, that's what you have going on in there?
*  I'm sorry I asked.
*  My problem is I go to bars
*  and everybody wants to talk to me about conspiracies.
*  They want to corner me.
*  Yeah.
*  Tell me about the government.
*  I bet.
*  Ooh.
*  How do you, do you shake out of it?
*  Sometimes I just get in.
*  Yeah.
*  I just jump in with them.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Let's go.
*  What do you think they're doing?
*  How come Trump didn't release the Kennedy assassination files?
*  That's the big one for me.
*  Yeah.
*  I got a couple of people around me who get in deep with that
*  and I just have to, my brain hurts.
*  I have to get out.
*  That one's crazy.
*  Smoke break for me.
*  That's the time it is.
*  They killed the president.
*  Absolutely.
*  And they got away with it.
*  And one of the guys that probably killed him
*  was on the Warren Commission.
*  Alan Dulles.
*  He's probably one of the guys that involved
*  in the whole conspiracy.
*  There's so many people involved in that conspiracy.
*  They wanted him gone.
*  See, I don't follow that.
*  You don't want to.
*  Don't do it.
*  Yeah.
*  That's probably one of those things.
*  Goff.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  It's worse because it affects everything in the world.
*  And you realize that the world is run by psychopaths.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know if I want to know all of it.
*  No.
*  Well, you know, it's like a balancing act.
*  You should probably know a little bit.
*  Of course.
*  Just so you don't get sucked into the bullshit.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  Absolutely.
*  I mean, like I said, I got folks around me
*  who keep me kind of in the loop a little bit.
*  Mm-hmm.
*  It's like that.
*  You need a dedicated conspiracy analyst.
*  Just one.
*  Just one dude.
*  It can't come from, it's just one source.
*  Just one dude is just scouring the internet.
*  All right.
*  You know?
*  All right.
*  Well, if you find somebody, send them my way.
*  Alex Jones.
*  I'll send him your number.
*  All right.
*  Just call him up and just let him go for a while.
*  This is what's going on, Gary.
*  Thanks.
*  This is a very scary time.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  If you do go too far down that rabbit hole, though,
*  there's no end to that hole.
*  That hole goes to the beginning of civilization.
*  And that's what's terrible.
*  Absolutely.
*  You know, the idea of what human history really is
*  versus what human history, what actually happened
*  and what actually motivated all the things that happened.
*  It's fucking terrifying.
*  Well, yeah, I heard what you were talking about
*  a few pods ago about, you know, the real history
*  and kind of going deep into that.
*  I mean, it was just, it kind of blew my mind.
*  I was like, okay.
*  Yeah.
*  That's, there's things that I've heard about
*  but never really gone deep into or done research on.
*  You don't want to.
*  Yeah.
*  Don't go down.
*  Just, bar talk's fine.
*  Let someone spit it at you at a bar,
*  you go home a little freaked out.
*  Yeah.
*  You get too deep into it, it's just, it'll ruin your life.
*  Yeah, I remember being a kid in bars.
*  There was a few guys in particular
*  who I don't know why they found that talking to me
*  about this stuff was the thing,
*  I guess they were trying to get the message to the youth.
*  But I remember in these smoky bars and going up back
*  or standing out front and these guys telling me
*  about all kinds of crazy things that I'd never heard of.
*  They're coming after you or they're doing this
*  and such and such, they did this.
*  And I'm like, I'm 15.
*  I have to get up and turn in a school project tomorrow.
*  I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
*  Well, you do it at a bar at 15.
*  I was playing shows.
*  Really, at 15?
*  Yeah, I was playing shows.
*  When did you first start playing live?
*  98, I was 14.
*  Wow.
*  15.
*  Yeah.
*  How did that happen?
*  Well, I was in a boy band with my buddy Robbie.
*  We were going to be R&B superstars, we thought.
*  Then he moved to France.
*  My friend Eve was playing guitar.
*  We did a talent show in eighth grade, won like 25 bucks.
*  And we were kind of hooked.
*  Went to a blues bar for her 15th birthday.
*  Played at a blues jam like an open mic, you know?
*  And they invited us back and we just kept going.
*  I started booking gigs pretty soon after.
*  As a teenager, I was like this duo,
*  like the Gary and Eve show.
*  And it was like me and this girl playing blues.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah, so.
*  14.
*  Yeah, 14.
*  Wow.
*  What do you have to be blues about when you're 14?
*  My girlfriend left me for the lifeguard
*  that she was working with during the summer.
*  Name Raul.
*  That was my first.
*  All right.
*  Isn't it crazy that we dismissed the pain of the youth,
*  but the breakups when you're 14
*  are the hardest ones you ever experience in your life.
*  Yeah, you don't know what to do.
*  You have no idea what this is.
*  All of a sudden your world's gone.
*  Right.
*  It all ended.
*  And everybody in your world knows that your world is gone.
*  Yeah.
*  Walking through the hallways.
*  Look at that sad motherfucker.
*  She's with Mike now.
*  Yeah.
*  No.
*  And your boys are telling you, man,
*  we just got such and such tongue kissing over there
*  by the gym.
*  Right?
*  You just gotta sit and take that math test,
*  go through it.
*  Meanwhile, she don't feel nothing.
*  Nothing at all.
*  She's gone.
*  Out of there.
*  Bye.
*  Yeah, out of there.
*  I don't wanna be with you anymore.
*  Bye.
*  That's it.
*  That's it.
*  But somebody told me when I was a kid,
*  what do you know about singing about the blues?
*  And you really don't know anything.
*  Or at least I didn't.
*  When it came to just how complex people are,
*  how big the world is, certain struggles.
*  Your little bullshit doesn't really mean anything.
*  It doesn't carry any weight compared to this,
*  compared to that.
*  Right.
*  But yeah, man, that still hurts, man.
*  Yeah.
*  That still hurts.
*  Yeah, people take their life.
*  They take their life.
*  And they get broken up with it.
*  14, 15 years old, they take their life.
*  That's true.
*  It happens.
*  That's true.
*  It's crazy.
*  Your whole life's ahead of you.
*  It's such a mistake.
*  We definitely lost a couple at a young age
*  because of just emotionally being broken.
*  Yeah, especially if you're already fragile.
*  Sure.
*  You know, maybe this is the only thing
*  that you ever had in life that gave you happiness
*  was this girlfriend.
*  Man.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a lot of people.
*  Like they were depressed.
*  And the only thing that gave them happiness
*  is the love of another person.
*  And you thought you were gonna be with that girl forever.
*  Forever, right?
*  This is it.
*  We're gonna have kids.
*  We're gonna be together forever.
*  Nope.
*  Six months later, she's tongue kissing behind the barn.
*  Ha ha ha.
*  Some other dude's fingering her, no.
*  No.
*  She likes it.
*  She likes it.
*  She loves it.
*  She's so excited.
*  She doesn't think about you at all.
*  Not at all.
*  God damn it.
*  Not one bit.
*  Get over it, Mike.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  Ooh.
*  Ooh.
*  You're alone in your room listening to sad songs.
*  In the fetal position.
*  Curled up, sad and shit.
*  But if you can come out on the other end of that,
*  you'll understand.
*  And then the next time, it's a little easier.
*  The next time, it's a little easier.
*  And then you get it.
*  Yeah.
*  And then you write a song like that.
*  Like, if he loves you more, go ahead.
*  Yeah.
*  Ha ha ha.
*  Ha ha ha.
*  Ha ha ha.
*  Because there's some ladies that you will run into
*  in this life that you are never gonna hold onto.
*  Absolutely.
*  And if you can't accept that,
*  I mean, maybe you can 10 years from now.
*  Maybe they'll change and you'll change
*  and you'll meet up and it'll be better.
*  But right now, she's on a path.
*  Mm-hmm.
*  And that path, you gotta let her go.
*  Mm-hmm.
*  You know, I love you, you're great.
*  But if he loves you more, ta-ta for now.
*  Ta-ta for now.
*  Ha ha ha ha.
*  Enjoy it.
*  And that's a flex.
*  That song's a flex.
*  It kinda is.
*  Yeah, if he loves you more, go ahead.
*  Uh-huh.
*  Huh.
*  Yeah, it's a good flex too.
*  Because they don't know what to do with that one.
*  They don't.
*  Like, oh my god.
*  They don't.
*  How did he say that?
*  He said, if you love me more, I could just go with you.
*  Shooketh.
*  And then that guy's at home,
*  the new guy's like, that bad motherfucker.
*  Ha ha ha.
*  I can't believe that's what he said to her.
*  He has her forever now.
*  Yeah, now he feels stuck.
*  Yeah.
*  Because eventually, this newness
*  that comes from this new relationship
*  with the guy who loves her more,
*  eh, it's gonna fade into like,
*  why are you always leaving your shit laying around?
*  And how come you're always late?
*  And you know, you said you were gonna call five.
*  You didn't call till 6.30.
*  What happened?
*  What's this?
*  What's that?
*  You check your phone.
*  And then next thing you know,
*  she's thinking about that dude who said,
*  look, if he loves you more, I love you though.
*  And then she calls him.
*  What are you doing?
*  Nothing, great to hear your voice.
*  Ha ha ha.
*  You know where I'm at.
*  You know what it is.
*  You know, I still love you.
*  Yeah.
*  But, you know, some dudes could've used that advice.
*  Like, if he could give that advice to a lot,
*  that's a strong move in certain circumstances
*  to preserve your sanity.
*  Mm-hmm.
*  You know?
*  Oh, absolutely.
*  Because just because some people are fun
*  doesn't mean you're supposed to be with them forever.
*  That part is very important.
*  Very important.
*  Just because you have a good time with someone
*  doesn't mean they should be your one and only.
*  Because that might ruin everything.
*  Absolutely, I agree.
*  And we all know dudes who've got
*  just hitched to the wrong caboose.
*  Mm-hmm.
*  And they lost everything.
*  Their life fell apart.
*  And a big part of it is the complex interaction
*  between two people.
*  And some people just,
*  the combination of you and them is not good.
*  Absolutely.
*  And it'll ruin everything.
*  I agree.
*  I've had those, you know, it's like, this is fun.
*  It's a lot of fun.
*  But that's it.
*  This is dangerous.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  But the dangerous ones are sometimes the most fun.
*  Unfortunately.
*  For a short amount of time.
*  But you don't want them raising your kids.
*  Not at all.
*  Not at all.
*  No.
*  Yeah.
*  If he loves you more,
*  ta-ta for now.
*  Out of here.
*  This thing is falling apart.
*  Cigar, this is a real one, man.
*  This is from Havana.
*  Yeah, it is.
*  You can tell.
*  Yeah, buddy, I went to London.
*  Well, actually, my tour manager, Daniel,
*  we were hanging in London.
*  I had a few days off to just hang.
*  Started hanging in the cigar lounges.
*  Yeah, I've been kinda hooked ever since.
*  It's one of those few places like a barbershop.
*  Or like a bar.
*  Where guys can get together and just talk.
*  Yeah.
*  Absolutely.
*  Sit around, shoot the shit, smoke a Stoge.
*  Mm-hmm.
*  Talk some shit, have some laughs.
*  It's fun.
*  Yeah, so it's kinda been my,
*  my new thing.
*  I'm trying to get off these cigarettes too,
*  if I'm being honest.
*  Yeah?
*  Yeah, man, I gotta do it.
*  Got to do it.
*  You don't wanna die that way.
*  Just a sad, I always said I would never smoke.
*  And then I saw, speaking of heartbreak blues, man,
*  I was sitting by Southwest, pissed off,
*  all these motherfuckers in town,
*  and I saw this girl that I was into,
*  and she was hand in hand with some other dude,
*  walking down the street, having a good old time.
*  This person I was sitting next to,
*  I was like, give me one of them smokes.
*  Next thing you know.
*  Next thing I know.
*  Yeah, I am.
*  Yeah.
*  It gives you a wild head rush though.
*  Yeah, it is, the tingly feeling,
*  the fingers and toes and stuff.
*  The excitement of your central nervous system,
*  the brain gets fired up from a cigarette.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  Different than any other form of nicotine.
*  Like different than cigars, different than zins,
*  different than anything.
*  Well, it's not just tobacco.
*  Yeah.
*  But even if it is, it's like one of those natural spirits,
*  is that what they're called, American spirits?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Yeah, it's just tobacco.
*  Even those.
*  But if you get like menthol or something like that,
*  it's like, woo!
*  Mm-hmm.
*  The fuck is happening here?
*  Oh yeah, I gotta quit that shit.
*  How many are you smoking?
*  I only really do if I'm having a conversation
*  before a show that I don't wanna have.
*  Oh really?
*  So it's like an anxiety thing?
*  Yeah, like before TV or before something like that.
*  That's not too bad.
*  It used to be maybe a half a day, a half a pack a day.
*  Not crazy, but I used to back on rolling them up in my herbs.
*  Yeah, and so I get my tobacco that way.
*  But there was a while where I was doing like a pack a day
*  and sometimes maybe more, just stress.
*  I think getting into this entertainment business
*  and eyes on you and pressure and all that type of shit
*  is just like a nervous thing to just remind myself
*  to just breathe, take a moment and just chill out.
*  Also, something about the cigarette
*  that gives you some weird relief.
*  It's just like a pshh.
*  Yeah.
*  The head rush thing that you get out of it
*  is like a weird little escape valve.
*  Sure.
*  It's like a release valve.
*  Just, oh.
*  Right, yeah.
*  When I don't have them though, I don't really miss them.
*  So that's kinda good.
*  That's very good.
*  Yeah, I got into Blunts from Charlie, Charlie Murphy,
*  when I was on that tour with him.
*  Cause he would only roll Blunts.
*  And he's like, it's the combination
*  of the nicotine and the weed.
*  I was like, oh my God, he's right.
*  It is good.
*  It's a better combination.
*  It's good.
*  That's a good combination.
*  Like pre-show combination, there's nothing like a Blunt.
*  Yeah, I'm right there with you.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm right there with you, but.
*  A Blunt and some music.
*  Let's go.
*  Man.
*  We've been getting hyped up to,
*  Stro Elliot does it for us every time.
*  He's a member of the Roots crew, the legendary Roots crew.
*  And he puts out these albums.
*  May I?
*  Yeah, get in there.
*  He puts out these albums where he mashes up
*  like old school music and like his big fat ass funky beats
*  and some sounds and stuff.
*  And that's been the stuff that we listen to backstage.
*  That's our hot music.
*  Do you have a hype soundtrack?
*  Yeah, we did for a while.
*  It goes anywhere from,
*  I guess, Rolling Stones to Chaka Khan.
*  Chaka Khan?
*  Yeah. Wow.
*  To, yeah, like Stro Elliot to Anderson Paak, you know?
*  So it's kind of all over the place.
*  Kind of get everybody who's got their certain types
*  of music and the mood and keep the crowd hype
*  and keep them interested, stuff like that.
*  But John Dee's backstage, he's the guy.
*  John Dee's on keys.
*  He's part of the Kill Tony band.
*  He plays on the road with me.
*  He's always got the Bluetooth speaker
*  and he's always jamming something unapologetically.
*  It doesn't matter how close we are to anybody.
*  He's like biggie loud as fuck.
*  He doesn't walk into the stage,
*  through the office at the venue.
*  But yeah, we had a good time back then.
*  But there's something about that,
*  like walking with the music.
*  Walking into a place, bringing the music with you.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  I think that's the Buffalo New York in him, though, too.
*  Big boombox, unapologetic.
*  Tim's on, New York hat.
*  Nice.
*  Don't give a shit.
*  But yeah, what do y'all listen to backstage?
*  Well, when we do arenas, I always make a point
*  to walk into I'm Your Boogie Man.
*  KC and the Sunshine Band, I'm your boogie man.
*  That's what I am.
*  Like when we're getting ready to do a show,
*  when we walk into the arena, it's always I'm your boogie man.
*  That's your walk on song?
*  Yeah. Nice.
*  And if we're getting a police escort to the venue,
*  it's protect your neck.
*  It's always protect your neck.
*  That's a flex.
*  Yeah. That's what's up.
*  Man, what's that feel like?
*  I've only had a police escort
*  while opening for The Rolling Stones.
*  And I was like, damn, this is so tight.
*  It's bizarre, because you're driving through a crowd
*  that's there to see you.
*  Yeah.
*  The first time I ever realized what was going on,
*  I was with Ian Edwards,
*  and we were doing a show in Dallas at an arena.
*  And this was like one of the first arenas we did.
*  And as we're driving, I go,
*  what is all this fucking traffic?
*  This is ridiculous.
*  We gotta be there in a half an hour.
*  And then I go, oh, they're here for us.
*  This is our traffic.
*  Wow.
*  And then we started laughing like, this is wild.
*  Wow.
*  This is our traffic.
*  Y'all did that.
*  Yeah. We pulled up to the venue, I'm like, this is bananas.
*  It's gotta be cool feeling though.
*  It's pretty wild.
*  So the police escort is to try to get you through that.
*  Of course.
*  When you get swarmed.
*  Or miss the show.
*  Or miss the show.
*  Yeah, but there's just so many people.
*  It's just something about doing shows
*  with that many people.
*  It's a totally different experience.
*  It's so alive, it's so electric.
*  The music, like having a green room playlist,
*  I learned from Dave.
*  Dave used to come to the comedy store,
*  he had two boom boxes.
*  And he'd have them synced.
*  And he'd put one on one end of the bar,
*  one on the other end of the bar.
*  He had ones that had like LED lights,
*  they'd glow and flash and shit.
*  Like Dave brought the party.
*  And he was like, this is my socializing.
*  So I always just have music with me everywhere.
*  I'm like, that's the way to do it.
*  Cause we would just hang out in the green room and just talk.
*  But talking with music going on is way better.
*  Absolutely.
*  Yeah.
*  Way better.
*  That's right.
*  When I saw Dave at the Moody Center recently,
*  he had the glow lights going on the Bluetooth speaker.
*  The whole vibe's gone.
*  Yeah, he puts red light bulbs in his green room.
*  You go in his green room, it's not like bright white light,
*  like flooding light.
*  It's like the soft, cool, like speakeasy vibe.
*  I respect that, man.
*  It sets up the vibe.
*  It brings the club energy to like a fucking arena.
*  He gets it.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  He set it up right.
*  It's the way to do it.
*  It's the way to do it.
*  And if you're touring a lot,
*  I saw that with Tommy Lee once too.
*  I went backstage with Tommy Lee.
*  I got a story.
*  My friend John Rollo was Tommy Lee's security guard.
*  John Rollo's a big giant dude.
*  And he goes, hey man, can you meet Tommy?
*  Tommy once talked to you about something.
*  I'm like, okay.
*  So I go to the show, catch the show, meet Tommy.
*  And Tommy wants to fight Kid Rock.
*  Tommy's like, I want someone to train me
*  to fight Kid Rock.
*  I was like, what?
*  What are you talking about?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Because they were both just squabbling over Pamela Anderson.
*  So he wanted to fight Kid Rock.
*  So he was like seriously coming to me to ask me
*  how he could get a fight set up with Kid Rock.
*  And he wanted to get trainers
*  and all these different things involved.
*  What happened?
*  I wanted to tell him, I think Kid Rock will fuck you up.
*  Kid Rock is one of those wild Detroit white boys.
*  You don't want to fuck with Kid Rock.
*  I absolutely would have to agree.
*  You don't want none of that?
*  No.
*  No, listen to me, Tommy.
*  That's a mean dude.
*  That's the dude that shot up Bud Light
*  and cost him $26 billion.
*  He shot the shit out of that beer, didn't he?
*  He went crazy.
*  He cost them so much money.
*  They would have never lost that amount of money
*  if Kid Rock didn't shoot that beer.
*  Man.
*  Just watching those bullets,
*  every time those bullets hit that beer,
*  that was like a billion dollars.
*  I don't know how many times I watched that on repeat.
*  That was good.
*  Yeah, but that's what I'm saying.
*  You don't want none of that, Tommy.
*  No, just go with it.
*  Stay away from that, dude.
*  Just sit down.
*  Just, if he loves you more than me,
*  ta-ta for now.
*  Yeah, just Arthur Alexander, that shit.
*  Big dog.
*  Yeah, learn how to just let it go.
*  Again, same thing.
*  Some gals, you never really have them.
*  You just gotta accept it.
*  Enjoy your time.
*  Enjoy your time with them.
*  Exactly.
*  But don't go having a cage fight
*  with Kid Rock in front of the world.
*  What's up with everybody wanting to fight in public?
*  Well, it is up with that.
*  It does seem silly.
*  Well, I think some people,
*  it's just like they don't have any money.
*  And someone comes along and says,
*  hey, you want to do a celebrity boxing match?
*  And you're like, all right,
*  you know, they're gonna pay you a million dollars.
*  Now you got money.
*  So you're just like, I'll just do anything
*  because you don't have nothing going on.
*  So there's people like that.
*  Didn't Aaron Carter fight Lamar Odom?
*  Oh, I believe so.
*  Lamar Odom's like 10 feet tall.
*  Yeah.
*  Aaron Carter looks like he never worked out a day
*  in his life and he's been living on a steady diet of pills.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, that just.
*  He's not with us anymore, right?
*  No, no.
*  RIP.
*  Yeah, that's the thing.
*  If you get famous when you're young, good luck.
*  Good luck, good luck.
*  Nobody, there's like three people
*  that have ever gone through being famous when they're young
*  and not been crazy.
*  Yeah, I don't understand that.
*  I don't understand.
*  It's just, it's fucking sad, man.
*  You eat some raw childhood
*  for other people's entertainment.
*  It seems like when you're a kid watching other kids on TV,
*  it seems like a good time.
*  Right.
*  You know, it seems like, oh yeah, I wanna do that.
*  That'd be amazing.
*  And so it's been kind of strange to watch
*  these young folks kind of go through it.
*  Well, the ultimate is Michael Jackson.
*  That's the ultimate.
*  That's the ultimate.
*  That is the greatest worst story ever told.
*  When you see young Michael Jackson,
*  when he was with the Jackson Five,
*  when he did like ABC and they were doing that stuff on TV
*  and he's dancing and singing,
*  he's the lead and he's the little kid.
*  That right there. Oh my God.
*  Killin' the best. Oh my God.
*  This clip in particular is the one
*  that got me into wanting to be a musician.
*  In the Ed Sullivan show, and how old is he then?
*  10, maybe. 11.
*  Geez, 1969.
*  Oh my God.
*  So good.
*  Oh my God.
*  He was so good and he was so little
*  and then he became so crazy
*  because he just never had a real life.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  That's sad to see.
*  It's crazy, but it's just that old expression.
*  The star that shines twice as bright last half as long.
*  You know?
*  I mean, it's just like, and in that circumstance,
*  to have that much talent and that much success
*  and that much love when you're a baby,
*  he's a little baby there.
*  He's 11. 11.
*  I couldn't imagine.
*  He's a little tiny little fella
*  and he's up there just bolting out beautiful songs.
*  And then the rest of his life is just chaos.
*  I didn't realize that.
*  I think as a kid, I was such a huge Michael Jackson fan.
*  Huge Michael Jackson fan, probably like crazy kids fans
*  that I didn't realize everything that was happening.
*  Nobody knew.
*  You know?
*  Nobody knew back then.
*  Right.
*  I mean, back then there's no internet, right?
*  And so like, if it wasn't,
*  Barbara Walters didn't talk to him about like,
*  why do you have so many kids over your house?
*  Like there would be no conversation.
*  No one would know.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah. It's just,
*  I don't, what do you think that is?
*  I mean, like, what is it?
*  Like, is there a,
*  just like a sense of like powerlessness,
*  not having control?
*  There's a bunch of factors.
*  You never face real adversity like a normal person does.
*  You're never not loved.
*  And I think people have to learn how to,
*  you learn how to get people to like you,
*  by you realize like, oh, if I'm a nicer person,
*  it feels better for me.
*  It feels better for them.
*  It's good for everybody.
*  And then one time I wasn't nice and then I felt bad.
*  And I went home, I gotta think this through.
*  And now people don't like me, shit, I'm sorry.
*  And then you get better.
*  And it's like a process of learning how to interact
*  with human beings that's completely subverted by fame.
*  Where you don't ever have to prove yourself.
*  Not only do you not have to prove yourself,
*  you're loved above and beyond a regular person.
*  So you're treated like you're, like a God,
*  like royalty as a child.
*  And everyone around you is kissing your ass
*  and everyone around you is giving you advice
*  and everyone around you is trying to take your money.
*  You know, and then you've got women and you've got networks
*  and you got, you know, that guy, the Colonel
*  that was with Elvis, you know.
*  Oh man.
*  Those kind of characters that are running your life
*  behind the scenes.
*  Elvis is another case.
*  Too much fame.
*  Nobody had navigated those waters before, it's too much.
*  I remember trying, being young and people trying
*  to approach me for deals and stuff.
*  And I was always weird with those folks
*  just because of the stories that I heard.
*  And my mom was my manager for the longest time.
*  Was, you know, helping me with printing up CDs
*  and, you know, doing a real ground work.
*  Family, my little sister was boxing CDs.
*  Oh wow.
*  And helping fold t-shirts and do all that.
*  It was a real family thing.
*  And folks started to come around and saying,
*  hey, you know, we could help you with this.
*  We could help you with this.
*  And I was just always like, no, no, no, no.
*  I've heard so many stories of that.
*  So I was really scared of the business, you know,
*  and wanting to even pursue it or the idea of fame
*  or any of that.
*  I was just like, nah, just, I don't wanna deal with that.
*  Whatever comes with that, I don't think is really me.
*  So I'm kind of fortunate that I didn't really get to,
*  I didn't really move around in that kind of scene
*  until I was 27, 28.
*  How old were you when like numb?
*  How old was that?
*  I was mid-twenties, 25, 26, 27.
*  That would be when things started getting weird, right?
*  Like, right, like big city.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  All that.
*  But I was a grown person, so I'd had experiences where,
*  you know.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, so, yeah, I think if that had happened to me
*  any earlier, it would have been a little bit different.
*  Oh yeah, yeah.
*  But yeah, it was strange, you know.
*  Just how life can kind of flip people's perception
*  and perspective of you kind of flips.
*  The whole world changes.
*  People have like, people you know
*  kind of look at you different and it's like, whoa.
*  That's weird, that's when it gets weird.
*  People have known you for years
*  and now they get nervous around you.
*  Like, why are you nervous around me?
*  Yeah, right?
*  It's like, hey, yo dog, chill.
*  What's up?
*  You have the same dude.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  You remember you crashed in my house six months ago.
*  Well, I think, don't you think that's why
*  a lot of famous people hang around
*  with other famous people?
*  Because they're like, these are the only people
*  that are gonna understand what it's like to be weird.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Yeah, I was talking to Tony the other day
*  and he was like, man, you need to get out more.
*  I was like, I know.
*  He's like, you need to be with the folks who get it.
*  Yeah, I know, I've just been in the Hermit in the studio
*  trying to get it right, but yeah.
*  Dude, calm down with the mothership any night you want.
*  Come hang out.
*  I definitely, I'm definitely going to.
*  It's a great hang.
*  I know.
*  That green room cleans the soul.
*  Yeah, I missed you a couple times I've been there,
*  but yeah, it's definitely a vibe.
*  I, yeah, I have a good time every time I'm down there.
*  But yeah, it's true.
*  You gotta be able to hang around like-minded folks who,
*  kind of the weirdos.
*  There's a different perspective.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, you gotta be around other weirdos.
*  And it also is like, you feel like you're okay.
*  Like, oh, I'm not that fucked up.
*  I'm just like these people.
*  This is a different kind of person.
*  Like, they get it.
*  All my friends know me.
*  They get it, they get it.
*  We're all just different kinds of weirdos.
*  Absolutely.
*  But it's a special kind of weirdo,
*  a weirdo who makes stuff.
*  Right.
*  Yeah, weirdos always creating things.
*  And then people go to see those things.
*  And they listen to those things, they hear those things,
*  they watch those things.
*  It's a different life.
*  Completely.
*  You can't hang out with accountants.
*  They're not gonna get it.
*  It's different.
*  It's funny, like going to kids' birthday parties.
*  Yes!
*  It's like, I don't know what I can say here.
*  I know.
*  It's like-
*  I never know what parents are gonna ask me about.
*  Cause like too many parents listen to the podcast.
*  Oh, yeah, yeah.
*  It's so weird.
*  Right.
*  They wanna talk to me about guests
*  and conspiracies and shit.
*  And some parents are like, I took ivermectin too.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  This blown out birthday canvas.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  There's a lot of dads who wanna talk about UFC,
*  which is easy.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  That's easy.
*  Yeah, that's cool.
*  Hey man, that was really cool
*  when everything was shut down
*  to go to the UFC with you guys.
*  That was fun.
*  And hang out.
*  I never, I realized how intense that was
*  without the crowd.
*  Yeah, it's wild, right?
*  On the building.
*  Yeah.
*  Like hearing somebody get kicked in the face
*  in a quiet room.
*  That shit is different.
*  It's different.
*  It's my favorite way to see it to this day.
*  I like to see fights at the Apex,
*  the Apex in Vegas.
*  Yeah.
*  Like where we went.
*  It's just like, there's no crowd.
*  Yeah.
*  It's incredible.
*  It was cool.
*  And then when we went down there
*  and everything was totally shut down.
*  So they were like world-class fights.
*  Like right now they do at the Apex,
*  still have world-class fights.
*  But a lot of times it's like guys on the come up,
*  guys who are making their way through the rankings
*  and they'll have like contender fights and good fights.
*  But there was a world championship fights in that arena.
*  Like Francis Ngono beat Stipe Miocic in that arena.
*  I was there for that.
*  Yeah.
*  That was crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  When you see Francis Hammerfist, an unconscious man,
*  after he knocks him out cold
*  and then fucking drops a bomb on him
*  and just walking around the cage, like, woo!
*  And there's no one there but us.
*  Yeah.
*  There was like 20 people in there.
*  That's incredible.
*  It was amazing.
*  It was incredible hearing the coaches talking back and forth
*  in their language, all that kind of stuff.
*  Yeah.
*  I was like.
*  What a weird time too, right?
*  Even when you went to restaurants,
*  like, we're in a restaurant.
*  Yeah.
*  We're sitting down inside.
*  This is crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  Walking through the mask on.
*  Yeah.
*  You could still have a walk in with the mask on
*  and then take it off and you sat down.
*  It was so stupid.
*  As long as you sit down, you can take your mask off.
*  Oh, when you go to the bathroom,
*  you gotta put your mask back on.
*  Oh, okay.
*  Okay, whatever.
*  I'm just happy to be out.
*  Yeah, hell yeah, me too.
*  Yeah, the COVID bubble days were strange.
*  But yeah, I'm so happy the UFC did that.
*  They kept the sport alive.
*  Yeah.
*  Are y'all doing the Sphere out there?
*  Yeah.
*  They're doing an event at the Sphere
*  for Mexican Independence Day.
*  Amazing.
*  Have you been out there for that?
*  I have not.
*  I've seen it.
*  I've drove by it.
*  It's incredible.
*  I mean, they have it look like the Earth.
*  They have it look like space.
*  They put designs on it.
*  The whole outside is a giant screen.
*  It's an incredible building.
*  That's wild.
*  And they're gonna make a show that uses the Sphere.
*  Dana said he's only gonna do it once.
*  He's gonna do one show there,
*  because it's too crazy,
*  but he wants to do a show there
*  just because it scares the shit out of him,
*  because it's so challenging.
*  Well, of course, that's kinda, he just,
*  yeah, he has to.
*  But you might have been watching highlights on the ceiling.
*  That'd be crazy.
*  The ceiling is filled with a giant screen
*  that shows you replays.
*  That would be incredible.
*  Yeah, that's, I can't even,
*  because it's blowing my mind
*  when I see video of the band U2 in there.
*  It looks crazy on your little phone screen.
*  I couldn't imagine what that was like being in there.
*  Bert Kruscher went and saw U2 there,
*  and he said it was insane.
*  He said it was insane.
*  It's like it's the greatest show I've ever seen in my life.
*  I was crying.
*  Because it's like accentuated by the building itself.
*  It's the only time where a building
*  makes the experience way better, like way crazier.
*  What was the, who came up with that idea?
*  What the hell?
*  That's a good question.
*  Like who even?
*  Super rich dudes.
*  Because it costs some insane amount of money.
*  How much does a sphere cost to run?
*  It's something bananas.
*  Like just for one night?
*  Yeah, just for one night.
*  Like every year, it's like,
*  it's fucking hundreds of millions of dollars just to run it.
*  I wonder what the,
*  what else is gonna be in there?
*  Just music, I guess.
*  I guess you could have the rodeo.
*  You could have whatever you want in there.
*  A rodeo would be fucking nuts.
*  That would be wild.
*  That would be wild, a rodeo
*  with all the highlights on the screens.
*  But to be able to watch fights like that,
*  have the highlights on the ceiling,
*  it's probably the best way to do it.
*  If they could keep doing it that way.
*  I mean, if it works, and then they decide, you know what?
*  Fuck it, we're gonna keep doing shows here.
*  I wanna go to one.
*  Yeah, I wanna go too, just to see.
*  Yeah, the one that's on Mexican,
*  when is that one, Jamie?
*  September, I think right now.
*  Yeah, that's gonna be nuts.
*  That is gonna be a nutty experience.
*  I think that's September 16, right?
*  Am I correct?
*  Okay, hey, September 16th.
*  You hear that, touring squad?
*  Let's end up.
*  Let's end up in Vegas that night.
*  End up in Vegas, the night off.
*  How long are you touring now?
*  Are you from here, when the album's out,
*  are you gonna just go?
*  So we're doing a US leg, just kinda kick things off in May.
*  And then we're gonna do Europe,
*  August, September, I think.
*  I try not to look, but I'm sure dates will fill up
*  in between, that's, you know,
*  once it starts going, it starts going.
*  But yeah, just for now,
*  we're gonna be doing the States in May.
*  We're doing some stuff with Eric Clapton
*  down in South America.
*  Oh wow.
*  And that's always cool.
*  Yeah, that's, I mean, that's a lot of people coming out.
*  It's a, you know, 60,000, 70,000 folks.
*  Wow.
*  So we're gonna get to jump in front of that
*  and make some noise for a little bit.
*  Bro, they came after Eric Clapton hard during the pandemic.
*  Oh yeah.
*  They came after him, cause he said though,
*  he got injured by the vaccine.
*  Yeah.
*  And they came after him hard, how dare you?
*  How dare you, you piece of shit.
*  Right.
*  They tried to find every terrible thing he's ever said
*  his entire life, taking out contacts,
*  and sticking in front of everybody.
*  Yeah, folks came after me and was like,
*  what do you think about Clapton doing that?
*  Well, the crazy thing was he got injured by the vaccine
*  and they were mad that he was,
*  it was like a coordinated effort to attack him
*  cause he was gonna cause vaccine hesitancy
*  by telling the truth.
*  Right.
*  And now we all know it's the truth.
*  So now no one's mad at him anymore for that.
*  But it was like, during that time,
*  they were trying to destroy Eric Clapton.
*  Yeah, if you brought anything, you said anything,
*  you were kind of out of there.
*  Yeah.
*  At that time.
*  Yeah, that must've been wild for Eric,
*  cause his whole life he was beloved.
*  I mean, he was an icon.
*  Yeah, I mean, he still is.
*  Yeah, he still is.
*  But yeah.
*  But to have that experience happen,
*  like all of a sudden he's attacked.
*  Like the LA Times, you know,
*  and all these different newspapers
*  were just coming for him.
*  I was like, this is crazy to see.
*  He's telling you he got injured by experimental medication
*  that the whole world is being forced to take.
*  You don't think you should listen to him?
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Looking back, it seems absolutely absurd.
*  It does.
*  That somebody's telling you the truth
*  about this thing that's affecting the whole world.
*  And they go, nope, nope, nope, nope.
*  No, he's a piece of shit and an anti-vaxxer.
*  Yeah, and look at this, and you did this,
*  and you did this, and let's pull this up.
*  What'd you say in 76?
*  Yeah, man.
*  Wild time.
*  Wild times.
*  But we got through it.
*  Yeah, we did.
*  I don't think it'll ever happen again.
*  You don't think so?
*  I think people will be too wise to it now.
*  Yeah, there's too many people that push back now
*  that let it happen back then,
*  because they believed it.
*  They thought two weeks to stop the spread,
*  that'd be good.
*  They thought all those things were gonna be good.
*  They believed the World Health Organization,
*  they believed the CDC, they believed everybody.
*  They believed in masks, they believed in social distancing.
*  They believed in all that shit we turned out to be bullshit.
*  Now people know it's bullshit.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  I remember going to Australia twice.
*  We had to quarantine twice.
*  Australia was nuts.
*  Police escorts.
*  I was going there to do a film.
*  I went there to do Elvis, and I was like,
*  put a police escort to the hotel,
*  like military escort up to the hotel room,
*  and you're just there.
*  They give you milk, sandwiches, juice,
*  some fruits every day or whatever.
*  You can't go nowhere.
*  No, you couldn't go anywhere.
*  And if you were to step out to put your trash outside,
*  a military guard or police officer would be there
*  with the weapon, turn the corner, just checking on you.
*  I was like, yo, what the fuck, man?
*  How crazy is that?
*  Yeah, for two weeks you had to be there.
*  How crazy is that?
*  And you weren't even sick.
*  Wasn't sick.
*  Which is crazy.
*  And just 40 floors up in some crazy hotel,
*  you can't go anywhere for two weeks.
*  The military making sure you don't leave your room.
*  Yeah.
*  That's what happens when there's no guns.
*  When people don't have guns.
*  That's right.
*  Yeah, that wouldn't happen.
*  The only people that have the guns is the army
*  and the police, and everybody else is unarmed.
*  And then the people with the guns start pushing people
*  around, arresting people for not wearing a mask outside,
*  throwing old ladies to the ground and handcuffing them.
*  Nah, that shit has not happened in Texas.
*  No.
*  Gary damn T that.
*  No.
*  You said what, motherfucker?
*  Yeah, shut the fuck up.
*  But even in California, there was lines around the block
*  at the gun store.
*  It got sketchy.
*  It got real sketchy.
*  That was the eye opener.
*  Yeah.
*  For so many people seeing lines at the gun store
*  for the first time, like, yo, this is getting real.
*  This is getting real.
*  I heard about that.
*  Yeah, it was weird to see it in LA.
*  I drive by Burbank and this gun shop that I know.
*  It's a fucking giant ass line around the block.
*  People trying to buy a gun.
*  Yeah, well, y'all got them problems down here.
*  No, there's no problems down here.
*  Nope.
*  There it is, ID.
*  Yep, here you go.
*  Use your receipt.
*  Exactly.
*  Good luck, sir.
*  What's even crazier is that I can just give you a gun.
*  Oh yeah.
*  If I have a gun, I'm like, Gary, take this gun.
*  And that's your gun now.
*  You don't have to do any paperwork.
*  No nothing.
*  No, you have my gun.
*  I kind of really fuck with Texas though.
*  I love Texas.
*  Once you feel that freedom, and it's not just the gun thing,
*  it's kind of everything.
*  Once you feel that freedom, except abortions.
*  Once you feel that freedom, you're just like, whoa,
*  this is how you're supposed to be.
*  And then you go to California,
*  they don't want you to have flavored vapes.
*  You're like, what are you doing?
*  What are you doing?
*  I don't understand why that is.
*  They think it's gonna stop kids from sucking on vapes
*  if they're not flavored.
*  So adults can't have them.
*  Adults can't have them.
*  You can't get flavored Zins in California.
*  I went to a gas station to buy some Zins.
*  I'm like, what flavors you got?
*  They go, we don't have any flavors.
*  I go, what?
*  Yeah, California doesn't allow you to have flavors.
*  Because it attracts kids.
*  You think the kids are gonna,
*  they're gonna puff on the original version anyway?
*  Yeah, what are you talking about?
*  They're still smoking cigarettes.
*  That's so stupid.
*  That doesn't do anything.
*  I don't get that.
*  That don't make no damn sense to me.
*  It's communist.
*  The government deciding what you can and can't do
*  and doing it for your own good.
*  And that's the slippery slope of communism.
*  They'll do that with that.
*  Next thing, they'll do it with your car.
*  Next thing, they'll do it with your consumption,
*  your carbon consumption.
*  They'll try to get you to be on a carbon consumption tax.
*  They try to get you to be on some sort of an app
*  that shows how much carbon you're using.
*  Anything they can do to try to control you.
*  And they'll do it under the guise
*  of making it safer for others.
*  Just like they did during the pandemic.
*  See how quickly they shifted from vaccines
*  to climate change.
*  It was just like, it was a beautiful passing of the ball.
*  It was like, run with climate change.
*  Run with CO2 production.
*  Run with, stop eating meat, drive an electric car.
*  Run with that.
*  Right. Yeah.
*  That's true.
*  One thing after another.
*  It's just control.
*  The number one thing about it is control.
*  And then all without a doubt,
*  there's a bunch of people making money.
*  There's a bunch of industries that are designed,
*  that function around this idea
*  that you have to do certain things.
*  And they're gonna profit immensely from you complying.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, you could kind of see that
*  in the way that the city changed around here
*  with the, they shut down certain spots,
*  mom and pop shots, spots kind of went.
*  And it's like, all right,
*  bullet, get you up out of here
*  and make you comply a little bit.
*  Uh, uh, uh.
*  Yeah, now you gone.
*  Now Target makes more money.
*  Yeah, here we go.
*  Well, they crushed LA.
*  LA is not, it is a shadow of itself.
*  I always say that LA is like a girl used to date
*  and she was really cute.
*  And then you go see her now and she's on meth
*  and she works for the cartel.
*  Damn, what happened?
*  Damn. That's LA.
*  You know?
*  Yeah, that's, I haven't spent too much time out there.
*  I mean, I only go out there when I absolutely have to.
*  It's sad.
*  I need to.
*  I was just in New York.
*  New York looked kind of Euro now.
*  It's got all the cannabis shops up everywhere.
*  It's kind of comical.
*  It is.
*  A little bit.
*  It was so illegal in New York for so long.
*  Yeah, you had to get it like super low key.
*  Yeah, man, you could get busted.
*  There was undercover cops selling people weed in New York.
*  Yeah, New York was weird with weed.
*  It was weird for the longest time.
*  Yeah, it's not a problem at all anymore.
*  No.
*  It was really strange to be there.
*  It's kind of like Amsterdam looking.
*  Mm-hmm.
*  I'm kind of surprised that it hasn't hit Texas yet.
*  I'm surprised they haven't let legal weed here yet.
*  It seems so stupid to stop people from doing something
*  you know they're already doing and it's not hurting anybody.
*  Yeah, that's my only beef with Texas at the moment
*  as far as that goes.
*  Well, it's decriminalized air quotes here.
*  So?
*  What does that mean?
*  Nothing, just let me pull up to a store.
*  Yeah.
*  I can get a receipt and enjoy my day.
*  Yeah, I'll pay taxes.
*  How about that?
*  Right.
*  You're missing out on billions of dollars in tax revenue.
*  You dummies.
*  Sure.
*  Because in Colorado, they were smart.
*  They said, we'll tax it like 39% or something crazy.
*  And everybody's like, OK.
*  No problem.
*  Yeah, go ahead.
*  Do that.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  Because it's so cheap in comparison to alcohol anyway.
*  It's a beautifully run business in Colorado.
*  They figured it out.
*  It's like going and buying a pair of shoes.
*  But for the longest time in Colorado,
*  they had to employ mercenaries.
*  They had to employ like fucking Blackwater type people
*  to guard the cash because the banks wouldn't fuck with them.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  So they weren't allowed to use credit cards.
*  So at any point in time, they had hundreds of thousands,
*  if not millions of dollars in cash around.
*  That's right.
*  And so they had to get a guy to take that cash to the bank.
*  So they basically were like a scene from Heat.
*  That's right.
*  I remember going out to Venice Beach at a certain point.
*  It was a little funky out there.
*  Well, I used to go to this place called the Englewood Wellness
*  Center in the 90s.
*  And that was when there was medical weed in California.
*  And all you have to do is go to a doctor and go,
*  I've got a headache.
*  Yeah.
*  And they'd go, here you go.
*  Oh, you definitely need this medicine.
*  They were trying to hand out those things.
*  It wasn't hard to get a medical license.
*  Not at all.
*  And one of the only medical dispensaries
*  was in Englewood.
*  So we'd go down the hood to buy weed.
*  And then the dude that sold me the weed got shot.
*  He got shot there like a week after I was there,
*  two weeks after I was there.
*  Oh, no.
*  They robbed him and shot him because you had to pay in cash.
*  And they had cash laying around.
*  And everybody was scoping it.
*  And they were watching.
*  They knew what was going on.
*  And he would have given them the money, too.
*  That's right.
*  They just fucking shot him.
*  That's right.
*  Yeah.
*  Wow time.
*  So I was like, OK, time to go back to weed dealers.
*  Yeah.
*  Mm-hmm.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  It all made me happy, man.
*  You know that.
*  Like we used to.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  The weed dealer thing is funny because then you
*  get those sketchy people in your life again.
*  Those dudes that are willing to sell weed.
*  Those are always people that are just a little unbalanced.
*  I feel fortunate that folks used to hook me up
*  for all these cute girls.
*  That's amazing.
*  Yeah.
*  How'd you get that?
*  Just being me, bro.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, that's a way better situation.
*  I used to deal with a dude named Jake the Snake.
*  Well, there you go.
*  Jake the Snake was my friend Eddie's buddy in LA.
*  That's how we'd get our weed.
*  Yeah.
*  But he was always a weird dude.
*  Nah, it was always cool.
*  It was like cool hippie chicks.
*  That's perfect.
*  Yeah.
*  That's perfect.
*  Cool, sit there, show you what the guy.
*  You can try a couple different kinds.
*  Get on their bike or whatever the fuck and get out of there.
*  Bye.
*  Sun dress flowing in the wind.
*  Yep.
*  Yeah.
*  Fucking sunflowers all over their outfit.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, so I didn't really deal with too many shady characters.
*  But the shadiest characters that I knew were the motherfuckers
*  that I actually really knew that I grew up with.
*  And I was like, ah, yeah.
*  I was warned about you, mother.
*  Yeah, well, you have some dudes that are shady when they're
*  like 14, just a little shady.
*  And then by the time they're like 22, they're full shady.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  But you're still hanging with them.
*  Yeah, I've seen a couple of them.
*  There's a magazine around here.
*  I don't know if it's still here.
*  It's called Mug Shots.
*  And you see whoever got arrested that day or that week.
*  I've seen a couple of folks I grew up with on the cover.
*  And I was like, yep.
*  Saw that coming.
*  That pans up.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  But hopefully, Texas will come around.
*  And you can just kind of do what you want to do with that.
*  Yeah.
*  I feel like if Republicans just embrace that,
*  it would be a lot better for everybody.
*  Just the people that don't want it, they're just ignorant.
*  They just don't understand.
*  It's stupid.
*  It's a stupid thing to stop.
*  That's not being stopped.
*  Yeah, it's not being stopped.
*  Also, you should probably fund some studies,
*  find out why some people go crazy.
*  Let's find out what's going on.
*  Because everybody knows one dude who smoked too much weed
*  and went schizophrenic.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  How many do you know?
*  I know one in particular.
*  He's a great, great friend of mine.
*  And yeah, I kind of feel semi-responsible.
*  Because I was kind of, he was just, dude,
*  I've known since I was in first grade,
*  we played basketball together.
*  We did all this stuff together.
*  And started rapping together, started playing music,
*  making beats together.
*  And I think one puff too many and listening
*  to that Slim Shady Marshall Mathers album,
*  you got him, bro.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I know two dudes.
*  One dude seems to have bounced back, but one dude's gone.
*  He's gone.
*  Well, I actually know three dudes.
*  I know one dude who bounced back, too.
*  The dude who I know bounced back,
*  he doesn't fuck around at all anymore.
*  But at one point in time, he thought
*  the government was listening to everything he said.
*  He thought helicopters were flying over his house.
*  He thought people were listening in the walls.
*  He was going nuts.
*  And that's marijuana and dudes?
*  Yeah.
*  For him, it was.
*  And I knew him before that.
*  I knew he was fine.
*  But he was just waking, baking every day.
*  It was every day.
*  He was just getting obliterated.
*  He was getting obliterated all day long.
*  And I think he just fried normal life out of his brain.
*  Ooh.
*  Yeah.
*  I've gotten stoned to the point of a panic attack.
*  But I've always come back.
*  But when you come back, you feel better.
*  I feel a lot better.
*  Hey, fuck yeah.
*  Everything's going to be OK.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Some people don't come back.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  Yeah, there's been books written on it.
*  Alex Berenson wrote a book about it.
*  That's why I've never taken acid.
*  My dad told me a long time ago that an uncle of his
*  had maybe took some good acid and never came back from it.
*  So I've always been spooked.
*  But I mean, I have no problem with psilocybin.
*  Yeah, psilocybin is more manageable, I think.
*  Absolutely.
*  Also, acid is being made in a bathtub
*  by some Grateful Dead fan.
*  So I'm like, who's making that?
*  Where are you?
*  How did this get to me?
*  He looks just like Jerry Garcia.
*  It's going for it.
*  It's just the circular glasses on, tinted lenses.
*  Just selling you the good stuff.
*  I mean, there's only a handful of people
*  supposedly in the country that know how to make acid.
*  How many people are trying, though?
*  Yeah, right?
*  That's the scary part for me.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like, oh, my buddy Billy just got him
*  a little thing in the garage.
*  Let's try it out.
*  Well, Ari was telling us about they had these tests
*  that they would do.
*  These dudes were heavy partiers.
*  And they brought tests with them so they could
*  test all the different drugs.
*  Like when you say heavy party, like experimental?
*  Yeah.
*  Trying to go.
*  They were going out there.
*  So they were taking Mali and all kinds of shit.
*  And so they did a test on the acid they had.
*  And none of it was acid.
*  All of it was mescaline.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, they were getting these tabs.
*  And they thought these tabs were acid.
*  And they tested.
*  There was zero acid in it.
*  It was just mescaline.
*  So how do you get away with that?
*  You get away with it because people don't have tests.
*  So you're just selling this stuff.
*  Mescaline will make you trip.
*  You think you're on acid.
*  Is it the same type of deal?
*  I haven't done it.
*  But it's peyote.
*  Right.
*  That's what mescaline is.
*  I'm scared of that, too.
*  I had a friend of mine that swears to God
*  that he saw a dude in a window in Manhattan
*  when he was on mescaline.
*  And the dude was 400 yards away.
*  And he could listen to every word that guy was saying.
*  So he could hear every word he was saying
*  when he was on mescaline.
*  Like through glass and walls?
*  He just heard.
*  He just was looking at the dude.
*  So he could see him.
*  He was watching him.
*  And he could hear him talk.
*  He swears it.
*  He's a financial guy.
*  OK.
*  Yeah, he's not a crazy hippie.
*  He's a guy that when he was in college,
*  he took mescaline in New York City.
*  And he was looking out the window.
*  And there's a guy way far away.
*  He was looking at him through the window, his window
*  and that guy's window.
*  Bomp, bomp.
*  Sounds of the city.
*  Fuck you.
*  Through all that, watching that guy, he could hear him talk.
*  Is it some cross-dimensional type shit?
*  Who knows?
*  Probably.
*  Probably.
*  It's probably like a frequency that you could tune into,
*  that we're all tuned into all the time.
*  Sort of like when you know someone's talking about you
*  and then the phone rings.
*  It's them.
*  Right.
*  Like you know they're thinking about you or you know something.
*  People dismiss that.
*  Oh, that's just chance.
*  That's just luck.
*  Maybe.
*  Maybe.
*  Or maybe when you're just thinking about someone
*  for no reason and then they call you,
*  maybe there's some connection there.
*  Maybe there's something going on.
*  Yeah, I agree with that.
*  Yeah.
*  I have moments like that where I feel like it's just,
*  that's the universe, just universe
*  and just trying to get you back to where you need to be.
*  Yeah.
*  I think there's something to that.
*  I think there's something to fate.
*  There's some strange element of it that seems to be true.
*  I think that free will is probably real.
*  There's probably issues with, there's
*  choices you make that determine how your life goes for sure.
*  But there also seems to be some strange element of fate.
*  Every now and then things come along and go,
*  oh my god, this is what I have to do.
*  This is what I have to do.
*  This is what I'm supposed to do.
*  Absolutely.
*  And you might resist it.
*  You're like, god, I don't want to do this.
*  But parties like this is what you're supposed to do.
*  You can't shake it.
*  Yeah, you can't shake it.
*  It's not like the universe hits you
*  with this frequency, this signal that lets you know this
*  is the path you're supposed to take.
*  Some people are way better at following that.
*  Some people are really good at following that feeling.
*  What's your, how do you think you resonate on the scale
*  of being good with that or not?
*  I'm pretty fucking good with that.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm pretty confident with that.
*  Good.
*  I know.
*  Yeah, I'm pretty good.
*  I'm pretty good with recognizing shady people.
*  I'm pretty good.
*  Pretty good.
*  Not 100%, but I'm 95%.
*  I got you.
*  I'm pretty fucking good.
*  I'm pretty good knowing which path to go,
*  when to take a chance, when to just go.
*  When I moved out here, I moved out here
*  in the middle of the Spotify deal.
*  And they were like, what the fuck are you doing?
*  And I was like, I'm telling you, this is the place to go.
*  I'm just going to do this.
*  This is the thing to do.
*  Did you already see what's happening now happening?
*  No.
*  No, no idea.
*  No idea.
*  Not a chance I would even have imagined
*  that Austin would become like the comedy scene that it is now.
*  I never thought that.
*  I just wanted to exist in a place where
*  people weren't fucking with me.
*  And then when I got out here and I realized people
*  weren't fucking with me, and then Dave and I were
*  doing those shows at Stubbs, that reignited my desire
*  to do comedy again.
*  Then we started doing live shows at the Vulcan.
*  And then Ron White got fired up about it.
*  And I was like, OK, we got people out here now.
*  And then other comics were moving here
*  because you couldn't do any shows in LA.
*  And they'd see us doing shows out here.
*  And they were like, hey, man, fuck this.
*  I'm just going to go.
*  And a bunch of them came.
*  And we didn't even have a club then.
*  So then I felt like, OK, I talked these dudes
*  into coming here.
*  Now I have to just build it.
*  And then we just did it.
*  But it was just all following instincts.
*  It was like, this is the path.
*  This is what you're supposed to do.
*  How long did you think over this move?
*  Not very long.
*  No, my instincts were to get out.
*  When I saw those cop cars on fire on the 10,
*  I was like, OK, I see where this is going.
*  Yeah, uh-uh.
*  You know, I got here just after the riots, just
*  after the riots.
*  That's when I, or LA, rather.
*  I got there in 94, just after the riot, the Rodney King
*  riots.
*  And it was weird.
*  Like, the city had just recovered.
*  So I remembered.
*  And then I watched all those videos of the chaos
*  that happened when the police lose control of the city.
*  And it just becomes madness.
*  And I was like, oh, we got to get the fuck out of here.
*  But back then, there was no defund the police talk.
*  In LA, it was all defund the police, defund the police.
*  I'm like, OK.
*  Yeah, that's what it.
*  I was like, yeah.
*  I'm over here.
*  I was like, nah, we got to.
*  You got to keep cops.
*  What the fuck are you talking about?
*  I need to call the motherfucking cops.
*  What are we talking about?
*  You cannot.
*  That, to me, was like, all right.
*  We've lost sight of it.
*  Can't everybody just do whatever they want,
*  whenever they want all the time, have
*  it be their way all the time?
*  There's got to be some order here.
*  There has to be some order.
*  There has to be a line that it's important, please, please,
*  because this is all I know.
*  If that goes away, then what the fuck?
*  You got chaos.
*  And I don't want that.
*  No.
*  I don't think anybody wants that.
*  Just before you.
*  That's a crazy statement.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, the wildest thing is having those people
*  now later call for more police.
*  Since some of them got, like there's this one politician.
*  And she was like, let me be clear.
*  My goal is dismantle and defund the police.
*  And I was like, yay.
*  And then recently she got carjacked and pistol whipped.
*  And so she's got blood pouring out of her head.
*  And she's saying, we have to fire these people
*  and prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law.
*  With what?
*  With no police?
*  Because you defunded the police?
*  What?
*  Who's going to go get them?
*  Are you going to go get them?
*  That guy that pistol whipped you?
*  You going to go find him and take his gun away?
*  Right.
*  And say, you are going to go in a cage now
*  to make the world safer?
*  Yeah.
*  No, police do that, stupid.
*  Right?
*  That's that part of the police.
*  The important part.
*  Yeah, the part that keeps you safe, you fucking idiot.
*  This idealistic perspective that so many people have.
*  Just such virtue signaling bullshit.
*  You just don't even know what you're saying.
*  Yeah.
*  Man, I had to get out of there, man.
*  I was lost in that shit for a while.
*  Yeah.
*  You hated LA.
*  What's that?
*  You hated LA, huh?
*  I really hated LA.
*  No, I didn't hate LA.
*  I just couldn't.
*  I didn't know how to do LA.
*  And the people that I resonated with in LA was comedians.
*  I would just only hang at the store.
*  Yeah.
*  That was my social life was that spot and another spot
*  where my buddy would give me free drinks
*  and I could smoke cigars down in the lounge.
*  That was it.
*  I didn't know how to really move around.
*  I didn't understand how to mix and mingle in a music space.
*  I knew how to hang with the weirdos.
*  Yeah.
*  The cats who were just off and didn't take themselves
*  too seriously.
*  Yeah.
*  You know?
*  But I remember very clearly when you moved back here.
*  Yeah.
*  Because I remember you saying, oh, man, this is so much better.
*  This is just what I like.
*  Yeah.
*  I remember I met Ron White.
*  I was hanging with him.
*  And he's like, yeah, I'm going back to Texas.
*  And I spend more time in Texas.
*  And I remember running into Post Malone out there.
*  And I was like, what's there to do in LA?
*  He's like, I don't know, man.
*  I'm getting the fuck up out of here.
*  So I was like, everybody that I was connecting with
*  at that certain time was like, I'm out too.
*  So I was like, let's just go back to Texas and do that.
*  Yeah, you talking about how great it was to be back here
*  and Ron talking about how great it was.
*  Ron came first.
*  Ron was the guy.
*  Because when he was out here, he was out here
*  before the pandemic.
*  And I was like, you really love it there?
*  He's like, I fucking love it.
*  I love it.
*  He goes, this is the best place, easiest place to fly out of.
*  Yeah.
*  Fly anywhere in the country.
*  It's in the middle.
*  It's like it's a great fucking town.
*  Everybody's cool.
*  It really is.
*  It really is, man.
*  Gary, that guitar's just sitting there.
*  Huh?
*  That guitar's just sitting there.
*  All right, well, here we go.
*  You need to bust that guitar out.
*  How about if you?
*  I'm going to teach you.
*  Oh, wait, I'm going to teach me.
*  Hey, this is for you.
*  This is a guitar pick that's made from mammoth ivory.
*  Mammoth ivory?
*  Yeah, that's from a mammoth.
*  That's from my friend John Reeves.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  He's got a place up in Alaska called the Boneyard.
*  That thing that you have in your hand
*  is probably 10,000 years old at least.
*  And you want me to?
*  Fuck yeah, that's yours.
*  You want me to throw my guitar out with it?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Or do I put it in a case?
*  That's what it's for.
*  No, no, no, no, no.
*  You play with that.
*  I got another one here.
*  Break it.
*  I have a second one here.
*  All right.
*  What should I play?
*  Anything.
*  What do you want to play?
*  What do you feel like playing?
*  Oh, I don't know, man.
*  I feel like...
*  Do you feel like playing new shit or old shit?
*  Let's play some new shit.
*  Let's play some new shit.
*  Let's play some new shit.
*  I've never played this new shit like this with an acoustic.
*  I got a little backstory on this guitar.
*  I did an event with Joe Walsh, Vetsaid,
*  and he and his wife were playing the guitar.
*  And he and his wife, Marjorie, gifted me this beautiful guitar.
*  It's one of my favorites to play around with at the house.
*  Should I tune this thing?
*  Whatever you want to do, man.
*  You think you're right?
*  You tell me.
*  Oh, man.
*  Again, this is what I love about music.
*  I don't know what the fuck is going on.
*  You know what?
*  I don't know either.
*  So you tune it with your phone?
*  There's a tuning app on my phone.
*  I can just use it.
*  That way I don't have to bring a box of stuff.
*  How does it work?
*  Just use the note.
*  You set it to standard tuning.
*  It'll get you right to where you need to be.
*  And it's all just tension on the strings?
*  Tension on the strings will get you to the note you want to be at.
*  Right now, this one is, the string is sharp,
*  so you got to release some tension so the note goes down.
*  See, so you're trying to get it in the green.
*  Say.
*  It's reading the hertz, the wave frequency.
*  Wow.
*  There you go.
*  Too high or too low and you try to match the perfect.
*  And that's how you explain it like a professional.
*  Well, not quite.
*  Just trying to help.
*  You actually went to school for that.
*  Yeah, I didn't and that's why I was not like an idiot talking.
*  It's crazy there's an app for that though.
*  That's amazing.
*  Yeah, this is one of my favorite things about having the technology for this.
*  I can make music on this phone and transfer it over to files.
*  I'm a big rig at the studio and incorporate them into records that I make.
*  Wow.
*  What a time.
*  Yeah, right?
*  As much as I bitch about it, I use it all the time.
*  So what a time to be alive.
*  What a time to be alive.
*  Indeed.
*  Speaking of.
*  What is this?
*  Just self tunes.
*  Cheers.
*  More time.
*  Thanks for having me do it.
*  My pleasure.
*  Thanks for coming here.
*  We're going to get on that double date.
*  Let's do it.
*  I'm free Saturday night.
*  Want to go on Saturday night?
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  Let's do it.
*  Saturday night.
*  My wife's in town finally.
*  Beautiful.
*  Let's go.
*  Let's go.
*  So many good places to go out here too.
*  Yeah, that's one thing that I realized is I don't know shit.
*  I've just been in the house and in the studio.
*  So my time to come up and figure out what's going on in the world is that ship has sailed,
*  my friend, until the album drop day.
*  I want to sleep for like a good day and a half, turn my phone off.
*  What is album drop day?
*  Which day?
*  March 22nd.
*  Oh, that's tomorrow?
*  Tomorrow.
*  As you're listening.
*  Today.
*  Today.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Here it is.
*  Here we go.
*  So cheers to that.
*  Cheers to that.
*  I'm just going to go ahead and down this thing.
*  Okay.
*  Because that's how I feel right now.
*  No, actually never mind.
*  I'm not.
*  So let's play some music.
*  Let's play some music.
*  And then after this you're going to learn an E chord.
*  Okay.
*  Some new shit.
*  It's called habits.
*  While I talk about downing a glass of whiskey.
*  I've got habits that I just can't break
*  But when I think about it I start to shake
*  I've been feeling like this for a while
*  And I always hide behind my crooked smile
*  And I keep crawling and searching
*  Chasing my tail
*  And I've lost my purpose
*  I need some help
*  I've had good days and I've had bad
*  And I would have traded for the time that we had
*  White lies, oh white lies
*  White smiles on a crying eye
*  And I keep crawling and searching
*  Chasing my tail
*  He looks good on the surface
*  And I need some help
*  Cause we've only got one shot
*  From the moment we started
*  Gotta stay nobody
*  I don't talk it
*  I've got everything I need
*  More than I wanted
*  But it means nothing when you're gone
*  Gone
*  Gone
*  But it means nothing when you're gone
*  Gone
*  I know nothing is for sure
*  I know nothing is for sure
*  I know nothing is for sure
*  Nothing is for sure
*  What do I have to do?
*  Can you pull up at E chord?
*  Like fingering?
*  Finger placement?
*  Are you lefty?
*  No, right hand
*  Yeah, don't
*  Like this?
*  Guitars are supposed to be banged up a little bit
*  Don't be scared of that
*  Okay
*  What do I do?
*  Yeah
*  Oh boy
*  There we go
*  Let me get one of these picks
*  I got one
*  How cool are these things?
*  That's amazing
*  Which part do you hold?
*  Do you hold the fat part?
*  The fat part
*  Some people hold the
*  It's kind of whatever
*  But this
*  Kind of gives me the sting that I need
*  Okay
*  As far as tone goes
*  I keep hitting this guitar
*  Alright, so I'm putting
*  This finger on the third
*  Yeah
*  And then this one on the fifth
*  And this one right below that
*  Yeah, you got to slide them in the same spot
*  Slide them in the same spot?
*  Yeah, they got to be in the right
*  What am I doing wrong?
*  Those two bars
*  Oh
*  Tighter
*  See if there's a little
*  All three of them are in the same spot?
*  Two of them are in the same spot
*  See that little spot there?
*  They got to be in that little spot there
*  Yeah, I got fat fingers
*  It's alright
*  This red volkart
*  Is one of the baddest dudes to play a telecaster
*  Okay, I think I got it
*  I think I'm on the right one
*  No
*  Almost
*  That one
*  Right?
*  Is that it?
*  And then where do I hit it?
*  Am I doing it right?
*  Push it more?
*  Down
*  Down?
*  Like that one?
*  There you go
*  The 12 string guitar might not be helping the most
*  Right there
*  Right here?
*  Yeah
*  Okay
*  You got to strum the strings now
*  There you go
*  It's not
*  It's close
*  Pretty close
*  There it is
*  Yep
*  There you go
*  You're on your way to the best volk song anybody's ever heard
*  That's it
*  Ready for some crazy E minor
*  You can do a second chord
*  Just release one finger
*  Yeah, just release the first finger
*  Release your pointer finger
*  Put it back in the same spot
*  Okay
*  Put it back down
*  You can go back and forth between two chords
*  There it is
*  Yeah
*  You almost got a song
*  Album coming soon
*  Album coming soon
*  I can see how this is going to get very addictive
*  This could be a real problem
*  See
*  This could be a real problem
*  Right?
*  Yeah, I'm telling you man
*  Yeah, I'm telling you man
*  Like once I first played an E chord on a Fender Stratocaster through a Fender Twin Redknob
*  1980s, 1990s amp
*  It was over for me
*  I quit caring about everything
*  I can see how this could be very addictive
*  You want me to take it away?
*  Yeah
*  It seems like it would take forever to get good at too
*  Nah, I think with a guy like you who's like disciplined
*  A guy like you, discipline is no problem
*  Right?
*  Yeah, it's a problem
*  It's a problem that I have too much of it
*  It's obsession more than discipline
*  Well then you'd probably be good at that in probably about a year and a half
*  Uh oh
*  And you'd be out here kicking ass
*  And I'd have to go sit down somewhere and I'd be settling in my photography job
*  Damn
*  Somewhere in Montana
*  I might have to learn how to play guitar
*  Man
*  That was fun
*  Yeah
*  I get it
*  I get it now
*  Right
*  Wow
*  Don't think too hard about it
*  But now I'm thinking too hard about it
*  Because I'm thinking about all the different positions on the guitar
*  That's one
*  We were listening to both Hendrix and Stevie Ray Vaughan's Voodoo Child
*  The different versions of it last night
*  And you know, it's like
*  Stevie Ray Vaughan is the only dude that doesn't offend me when they cover Voodoo Child
*  Yeah
*  You know, like Voodoo Child, Slight Return, Hendrix, 67, 68 was so fucking good man
*  It's like anybody covering that is like, what are you doing?
*  But Stevie put like his own weird flair on it
*  Yeah
*  And I'm thinking about all the different positions of the fingers and the sounds and the thing
*  And you are singing while you're doing that too
*  You're not just doing that
*  You're also manipulating your voice
*  Yeah
*  Yeah
*  But as far as Voodoo Child goes
*  Who's engineered that? Was it Eddie Kramer?
*  I don't know
*  With the panning and the psychedelic back and forth
*  Oh my god
*  And the shakers
*  It's
*  Oh my god
*  It is otherworldly man
*  It's so good
*  That right there is
*  You can't recreate that
*  Standing next to a mountain, I chop it down with the edge of my hand
*  I gotta say, I got asked to do a cover
*  And I've always been hesitant about doing covers of Hendrix or Stevie
*  And I did it
*  And I was like yeah, that's the reason why I've never done it
*  Well let me tell you something man
*  I know that you and Suzanne were
*  I know you were either talking or actively tried to do a version of Midnight Rider
*  Because I was there
*  How many years ago was that?
*  When you guys did that downtown in LA
*  Oh I don't even know
*  It was a long time ago
*  Almost a decade maybe
*  Somewhere around a decade ago
*  I brought my oldest daughter
*  And we saw you guys live
*  And it was insane
*  And it was like a Monday night or some shit at midnight
*  In some weird bar in downtown LA
*  Yeah
*  It was like an alcohol company put that on right?
*  Yeah, we were in business with an alcohol company
*  Which we soon got out of
*  Because I didn't think that they really liked us
*  Why would you send somebody that much alcohol?
*  They'd really like them
*  They'd like you too much
*  But they sponsored this thing
*  So it was a very small gathering of people
*  But you guys did a cover of Midnight Rider
*  It was fucking amazing
*  It was fucking magic
*  I never played that song before
*  Suzanne was just like come sit in
*  She didn't play it before either
*  She had to read the lyrics off her phone
*  That's right
*  You're trying to put something together
*  You gotta cover that
*  It was so good man
*  It was so good
*  Because it was Midnight Rider
*  But with your flair to it
*  This is from my Instagram
*  Can you play this?
*  Deadass this one has gotten us flagged before
*  Oh that got us flagged before?
*  That was so good though
*  That was such a fun night
*  That was back when she was with Honey Honey
*  Damn that was a decade ago
*  Isn't that crazy?
*  He's a bad motherfucker
*  2016, close to a decade ago
*  8 years ago
*  Wow
*  You guys have to cover that
*  Did we try? Did we do it?
*  I can't even remember
*  I haven't heard it
*  Nobody sent it
*  I haven't seen it
*  Maybe it was a dream
*  I think you guys were in talks
*  I remember Suzanne was saying you guys were going to do it
*  I've done
*  I think we did it
*  But I think I did it
*  In the middle of one of my sessions
*  So when I was in my
*  Mode
*  I remember
*  I think we did it
*  I feel like she said you guys were going to do it
*  Until no
*  It's done
*  Somewhere it's done
*  It should be done
*  I think she has it
*  That's crazy that I don't even know
*  I don't know what that says about my brain
*  You have a lot going on
*  That's what it says
*  Something that would be a milestone for some people
*  Is just a part of
*  Every day of your life
*  I'm pretty sure we did it
*  I feel like she told me you did it
*  But I'm not positive
*  I felt like she said something
*  Like you were going to do the music first
*  And she was going to sing over the music
*  I don't remember
*  I think she did the record
*  Damn that's fucked up
*  She had to do it with you
*  No no
*  I think she actually did the track
*  As far as recorded with her band
*  Oh really?
*  Dude that's so crazy
*  That's just like a blank spot in my mind
*  That night was a fun night
*  That's one of those nights
*  Where you get to see something
*  Where very few people get to see it
*  I saw the fight at the UFC Apex Center
*  And there's no one there
*  You're like wow I'm so lucky to be here
*  But you know
*  Susanna's a special artist
*  She's really kind of a powerhouse
*  I remember the first time I met her
*  She was doing Honey Honey
*  This funky sessions thing in LA
*  And just the voice man
*  The songwriting
*  She can play anything
*  She plays violin
*  She plays guitar
*  We got cuts on this album
*  That we're not releasing
*  But going to be used for something else
*  Where she plays amazing violin
*  On some stuff
*  She sings over it
*  She's incredible
*  When you work in the studio
*  You realize how genius she is
*  She's not playing around
*  No she's really good
*  She's a studied
*  I have a friend of mine who's a musician
*  We did an end of the world show
*  On December 21st 2012
*  Because that was when the Mayans thought
*  I remember I was watching
*  I was freaked out
*  I was ready to go with y'all
*  So we did an end of the world show
*  And I said let's put together a real fun show
*  So it was Dan Hope, Joey Diaz, me
*  Honey Honey, I think Duncan was on the show too
*  So we did the show in LA
*  And my friend who's a musician
*  He saw her
*  He goes yo, that girl is fucking talented
*  He goes dude
*  She can play anything
*  Look at her
*  Her voice is incredible
*  She plays a violin, this is insane
*  She's a badass guitar player
*  Badass writer
*  She does everything
*  And she's cool as fuck
*  She's so fun
*  She's hilarious
*  I feel like if shit went down
*  Yeah, you'd want her on your side
*  In the apocalypse
*  She'd figure it out
*  Absolutely, yeah
*  Much respect to her
*  Much respect to you too
*  Congratulations on the new album
*  It's beautiful, it's awesome
*  Thanks for listening and hanging
*  Thanks for the cigar
*  Yeah, no problem, I got you
*  Let's go out, Saturday night
*  Alright, that's it, bye everybody
*  Thanks for watching!
