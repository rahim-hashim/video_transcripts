# Joe Rogan Experience #1479 - David Pakman
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [May 22, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf93nfm2U2o)
*  Coming to us live via technology from the other side of the continent, David
*  Packman, ladies and gentlemen. So good to be back with you. Good to be with you too
*  and I love your facial hair as I was saying before. I say stick with it all
*  the way, maybe get some kind of a cult leader guru thing happening. I'm actually
*  five days from a man bun and I want to see what you thought about that. The man bun is the starter kit for a cult leader, right?
*  The man bun is like I'm trying to get people to listen to me more and take me more seriously.
*  I'm spiritual. I need like a gimmick of some kind. I think your gimmick is just being a nice guy
*  and smart. How about that? That's rare. Nice to a fault. Oh yeah? You're nice to a fault?
*  I don't know. I get emails from people who are like you don't have to kowtow to the dumb part of your
*  audience. Like you don't have to say stuff like listen I want to apologize in advance for using a
*  slightly off-color phrase but people are like you just don't you just shouldn't do that. It's
*  better for the show for you just to say the thing. I love that you listen to those people. I think you
*  should be yourself and if you feel like you need to say that I feel like you should just say that.
*  It's nothing wrong with it. It doesn't hurt my feelings when you say things like that. You know even
*  if I understand what you're doing it's not it's no big deal. I feel like there's too many opinions
*  and it sucks for the people with opinions and I think it's one of the problems with what we do
*  and one of the reasons why people get so angry at us. So if you and I are having a conversation
*  and we maybe perhaps we agree on something but someone listening is like fuck that this is what's
*  wrong with that idea and they want to say it but they can't. And so the comments are almost
*  inherently angry because it's really so much of it is just people who want to say something but
*  there's no forum for them. They only can say it in the comments. They can't they feel like they're in
*  on this conversation that they want to jump in on and interject. I got an email today from someone
*  who said I love everything you've been doing for the last six years but yesterday you used the word
*  anti-vaxxer and I just that's it. That was it when you used that word. That was it for the David
*  Packman show and it's like I you can't win with that. You can't win you know. But it's the same
*  thing. It's like they're angry right and this is the way to get you to listen like oh you're leaving.
*  Wait a minute. They're being completely unreasonable. Can you imagine if there was a show that you enjoy
*  and the guy said one thing he disagreed with and it's especially something like calling someone an
*  anti-vaxxer and you're like fuck this. It's over. My relationship with you is over. That purity standard
*  is impossible to achieve especially when you're doing something like what you and I do where
*  you know we're basically just talking with a very I mean I'm sure you have like some bullet points
*  of things you want to cover but you're ad-living all the time. You're what we call free-balling
*  all the time and that's a it's a crazy standard to try to hold to ask someone to not say anything
*  that you're going to disagree with or I say things I disagree with. You know I'll listen to it a half
*  hour later. I'll think about it a day later. I'm like why did I even say it like that? I don't.
*  I have videos from seven years ago where you know it's not that my like my foundational values
*  haven't changed but I do look at it and I say you know if I had known then what was going to happen
*  four months later I never would have done it that particular way. Yeah there's a well there's a lot
*  of things that happen in the news that force you to sort of shift your opinions and go oh that kind
*  of stuff does happen. Oh I've been naive. I've had this perception of you know whether it's the
*  government or the intelligence agencies of being like beyond reproach and now I find out oh
*  all right now I gotta go and revisit a lot of things that I was saying were nonsense.
*  A lot of things that I was dismissing openly now I gotta go oh well we like to think that
*  when it comes to like governments and intelligence agencies we'd like to think that there's some
*  level of whether it's government or military there's some place that you could reach where
*  you're like a super person where you're not going to make any of the mistakes that we'd attribute
*  to people based on greed or ego or pettiness or or or short-sightedness that when you get to that
*  point you're a proven commodity and that you are you're what we're looking for as a leader and you
*  have to be upheld you have to uphold these very strict standards at that spot and we assume that
*  there is an actual thing like that and I think it's one of the reasons why people get so frustrated
*  at Trump is because he doesn't even try to pretend he's one of those things he he behaves the same
*  way he used to. Well one of the things that I was kind of in a battle with in with my audience
*  during the primary was I would get emails from people who would say the only person who can beat
*  Trump is Bernie for example and then I would get people people who would say the only person who
*  could beat Trump is Tulsi Gabbard everybody else is straight up a bad person and I my message was
*  always listen we shouldn't deify any of these people these are just people you've met a lot
*  of them they've been in your studio that we're just talking about people you're not going to agree
*  with them on every policy position you're not going to agree with everything they've done
*  personally and where I think it gets dicey is where they start movements it's a cult of
*  personality really where a movement is built around the person as an idea and they can do
*  no wrong and that's where you're there's no way to talk those folks down about issues or about
*  practical decisions that we have to make. No I think you're 100% right and I also think that
*  the position itself the the world has grown too large for the position I feel like if we were if
*  we left from all parts of the land and all parts of the world and found an empty continent well
*  obviously the United States wasn't really empty but if we found a place where we resettled and
*  we tried to restructure government from scratch we would we would take that into consideration
*  now I think our founding fathers they were just dealing with this archetypal structure
*  of one person that sort of runs thing but in this case it would be a person that we all agreed to
*  and it was a much better step moving forward than kings right but I think now that we've kind of
*  done that for a while we realize well yeah that might be great when it's a hundred thousand people
*  or a million people but once it gets to 320 million people and complicated things like
*  international business and like trade agreements and the environment and nuclear power versus
*  solar and wind and like one person is going to be responsible for all these insanely important
*  decisions that seems crazy and to blame one person when any one thing goes wrong seems crazy as well
*  it's just I don't think we would do it this way I think we would have some sort of a council of
*  wise people or something along those lines you know what's interesting to me about that I mean
*  we're like diving headfirst right into you know a bunch of stuff here but what's interesting about
*  that is when you think about who to vote for for president and I know that you know we we're going
*  to get we'll get into this stuff I'm sure you're not just voting for the person you're voting for
*  who are they likely to have working for them what is likely to happen in courts what is likely to
*  happen regulation wise and so of course you want to think about who it is that the person is but
*  you also want to think about who do they bring with them and for me that's a lot of how I see
*  voting in November at this point yeah most people have made that concession and it's an interesting
*  concession right because it's not a concession we had to make if it was Tulsi Gabbard or Bernie
*  Sanders or Amy Klobuchar or Pete Buttigieg or you know go down the line there's a lot of very
*  credible candidates that would have made like interest like maybe this person could be the next
*  great president maybe this person could be a great leader but now we're in this position like oh god
*  okay so listen we're voting for the cabinet like Biden is so he's whether or not he's having
*  moments that are related to cognitive decline which you could speculate or whether or not
*  this is just his reaction to the most extreme amount of pressure he's ever faced in his life
*  and that does happen with people we know people lock up I would imagine that a guy who's been in
*  the spotlight as long as he has for so long probably would be able to handle stuff but
*  I think running for president is a whole different ball game I think everything gets turned up by 10
*  and I think it gets turned up in this society that we're experiencing today it gets turned up
*  even more so because of social media like no president other than Trump has had really had
*  to deal with this kind of wave of social viral you know feedback online with Twitter and Facebook
*  and YouTube and all the stuff that we're experiencing right now they didn't Obama didn't
*  have to deal with that really in his first term maybe a little bit in his second term but then
*  Trump's the first guy to tackle it head on and he's you know in a lot of ways he's showing you
*  what can come at you and I think that when Biden is running through these steps to try to become
*  president he's experiencing a wave of attention and scrutiny that he's never experienced before
*  and that could also exacerbate what am I a doctor here I'm exam I'm trying to figure out what's
*  wrong with his head but that could also exactly are you um are you have you taken a position on
*  the Biden cognitive stuff that's something wrong something's wrong if he was my friend he was
*  fighting I'd ask him to retire I mean if I'm looking at that way I have friends um that
*  I've seen their cognitive decline from fighting um I'm not saying that Biden's the same because I
*  don't really know him from you know I don't know him over a long period of time I don't know him
*  at all personally but something's wrong the way are any of your friends that are they close to 80
*  any of them no no the guys who are experiencing cognitive decline are younger guys have been
*  hitting the head um yeah the when you when you get to 80 uh I have known people that have had
*  problems and it's it's very unfortunate um I don't think he's there where would I you know because
*  he could still talk to him like if if that was just a guy that you knew and he was like and he
*  said something like we've all been endowed by uh you know the thing you know that one famous you
*  wouldn't say oh Jesus what's going on with Ray you would say oh he had him he locked up he had
*  a brain fart he had a mental lapse which I've had doing podcasts all the time it can happen but in
*  that moment in front of those people to do it that way while he's running for president and why he's
*  had a few of those before you could be dealing with anxiety too there's probably a lot of shit
*  going on but I would be concerned yeah I mean listen so I I don't have any I don't my view is
*  just based on actual professionals that I've talked to and people that have been in a room
*  with him because I've I've I'm not a professional and I've not been in the room with Biden so Andrew
*  Yang was on with Sam Harris recently I don't know if you saw it and this topic came up and Andrew
*  Yang basically said listen he's 78 years old if you compare a video of Biden debating Paul Ryan in
*  2012 to Biden a month ago obviously it's different and to some degree you that's normal when someone's
*  78 years old yeah but Andrew Yang's perspective was that he didn't see anything that he would call
*  dementia or cognitive decline beyond that so that's like one it's just one data point it doesn't
*  tell us anything definitively you know the other thing is I've interviewed a few people and I think
*  you and I maybe have even messaged about some of them neuroscientists neurologists and mental health
*  professionals who are very concerned about Trump like the oranges of an investigation the where he
*  he seems to sort of like lock up when his shoulders sort of you know this thing that he does where his
*  shoulders kind of uh I haven't seen that weird way I haven't seen those yeah I got video of that
*  you know he's not just be an injury you think it's a neurological thing I don't know that's the thing
*  so it could be neurological mental health side effect of medication there's a whole bunch of
*  stuff it could be could it also be an injury maybe yeah maybe I mean if he's doing some of his back
*  or shoulder well it's weird because he when it happens he has a verbal mistake that he makes
*  and it coincides with this shoulder thing and then it's almost like there's a half second gap and then
*  someone hits the reset button and he'll get back on the teleprompter or whatever it's weird there's
*  like 10 or so examples I need to see this I need I need to see this while I'm talking to you um
*  so Jamie's gonna search for one so what would he search for um I think if you if you went to
*  search.twitter.com and just searched in videos the way you can do and you put like Trump brain
*  glitch I'm guessing that some of these would uh would come up but the the gist of what I was
*  getting to was some of these same neurologists and mental health folks when I asked them privately
*  about Biden and say do you are you seeing like the same type of thing they all say no so again it's
*  like it's not my view they're hardcore Democrats I don't know if that's my man he's had these
*  moments where for sure something doesn't look good right I agree totally agree so why would
*  they say any differently they've got to be Democrats they've got to be hardcore party
*  loyalists I think that to assume that absent any evidence is maybe unfair yeah it is but I'm an
*  unfair guy in some some respects but here's my thought on this right now so like what let's
*  imagine that Biden's having a real problem right let's imagine it's absolutely for real
*  uh I'm still voting for him over Trump right I mean like so I I think last time we talked you
*  mentioned you were pro-choice do I remember that right oh yeah yeah so I am but I feel like it's a
*  it's a controversial subject for a reason fair fair yeah if Donald Trump gets to pick the next
*  Supreme Court justice it will be someone who would love to overturn Roe v Wade I mean there's not even
*  a chance he said it right this is what Trump Trump has said that he is uh that he's pro-life
*  and that he would pick someone that would or it's just by virtue of picking conservative
*  there's it's it's actually it's there's two parts to it one is Donald Trump was pro-choice almost
*  his entire life he became pro-life when he was I think 68 because he met a kid he liked and he
*  imagined if that kid wasn't born no I'm serious I believe you it's just hilarious it's crazy it's
*  like an ABC after school special let's imagine that that's true that he had an awakening at age
*  68 after being pro-life his whole life yeah he said he would pick justices that were recommended
*  to him by I forget which conservative group you're only going to get you know pro so-called pro-life
*  justices from these groups on the other hand Joe Biden will absolutely pick a pro-choice justice
*  so if I was pro-choice like you are how do I justify voting for the guy who's gonna replace
*  potentially Ruth Bader Ginsburg with someone who would want Roe v Wade overturned like I couldn't
*  do it in good conscience that's that's a good point well I'm gonna get into it in a second but
*  Jamie just pulled up this video of Trump and I'm gonna get to watch him have this weird twitch for
*  the first time okay hit me with it Jamie okay so he's talking
*  I'm watching it is that it that little move that he made oh this is hilarious and silly
*  Trump neurologically malfunctions with a full spasm no he's talking he just went like this
*  people do that that's silly maybe it's just maybe that video is silly there's a dozen of yeah I
*  don't know I couldn't hear that I think a better a better thing is something that you showed me on
*  your show a better example when there was real problems with him enunciating words and you know
*  there was speculation like was he falling was he sick was there was he on a sedative was was
*  something something going wrong it almost seemed like his tongue wasn't working correctly right
*  yeah like he was wrestling with with a paralyzed tongue your perspective matches mine but I think
*  I really for me it's like this stuff we're not probably ever going to really get an answer to
*  this and I don't know that it's imperative to know the answers for me to know who it is I'm going to
*  vote for I guess is the point I'm trying to make it's it's fascinating that pro-choice is such a
*  hardline issue on left-wing people and right-wing people it's um it really is that it's this line
*  in the sand and people are willing to so they're willing to make concessions in favor of going in
*  that direction as because they recognize the slippery slope of limiting people's rights and
*  the dangers of going in the other direction you're not going to stop abortions you're just going to
*  stop legal abortions it's going to be very dangerous for the women it's going to be it's
*  it's it's almost you know it's it's almost a black and white issue in that regard but what's not a
*  black and white issue is abortion itself right like there's a time in the baby's life or the fetus
*  when it's inside the woman where everyone gets uncomfortable whether it's five months in four
*  months in three whatever it is for you where you're like oh Jesus that's a baby now and to deny that I
*  think is is very odd that's a weird thing that we do because it's so uncomfortable what it is is so
*  uncomfortable it bothers us so much that we we just draw these lines and we've got this opinion
*  in a box and it's this and this here we go we got this bulletproof right-wing box and you can never
*  have an abortion okay what if your daughter gets raped by some robber you think that your daughter
*  should have to carry this man's child like if they know about it immediately when it's a bundle
*  of cells really you think that like that to me is insane right now if you knew that it was conceivable
*  that trump would put someone on the court who has that view that'd be pretty scary wouldn't well it's
*  scary in a lot of ways it's scary in a lot of ways um i think the more control government has over
*  your body and the more it can dictate what you can and can't do the scary things get and then it
*  gets scary in that this is a subject that you know it's so polarizing and if you you move in the
*  direction of limiting it you run the risk i always feel of shifting even like the consciousness of
*  the public shifting the way people approach things like this accepting control that the
*  government has control over your body as like one of the the idea that they can come and decide
*  what you what you have to do for the rest of your life now based on maybe something that wasn't
*  even your choice that to me is crazy but that's not the only thing that's going on there's so
*  many other issues it's one of the reasons why picking a president and picking a party is so
*  crazy it's so crazy that we let one person and then his group that he gets with him shift the
*  consciousness of the public or shift the direction of the country one way or the other it's just
*  it's a really weird choice that we make in even making a president and then doing it every four
*  years and having all these checks and balances that you have to follow i mean i think it's a
*  it's a great system for the time when they invented it is i mean it's amazing how well it holds up
*  from 1776 to today it's incredible it shows you how amazingly wise they were but just think about
*  what we know now in 2020 about just the nature of communication like what you and i are doing
*  i mean this is going to affect millions of people and their opinions if if you knew that today in
*  2020 and someone asks you to make rules based on what was going to be in place 300 years from now
*  you would be like i'm not qualified to do that it's really it's incredible how well they wrote the
*  constitution and the bill of rights back then i mean it's really it's one of the most amazing
*  things ever if you really think about like all the the different times that it's come up and then
*  you you think about how long it's been that it was created i mean it's really an astounding
*  piece of human work it is your argument though is really one for having to update the infrastructure
*  that we bait right so like as you're saying if in order to change the way that we govern the country
*  as you're saying you know one person making all these decisions with all of these different areas
*  that they're responsible for if you want to change that you do have to change that document that you
*  just said i know it's kind of crazy right it's like we don't want to update windows 95 like i'm
*  comfortable with it i know where the icons are but windows 10 is like hey you know come come make the
*  switch we've got a better system we figured it out better we we don't have a windows 10 of government
*  you know we still we're still working with 95 we you know we still have the older versions of
*  apple's software we don't have osx 10 whatever the latest version of it is we we are in this
*  weird place where you know we we have this system that's better than anything that we could see
*  anywhere else but yet it really it doesn't necessarily work perfectly for the complicated
*  issues that exist in managing just the 330 million people and all their problems what is your sense
*  of i mean is there like is there a particular issue where when you think of trump and biden
*  you're on the trump side in terms of the political position hmm like what political positions see
*  my opinions on political positions especially like the really scary ones right like the possibility
*  of war um the environment things along those lines i i wish i was more informed i wish i knew
*  exactly what you know like when when there's some negotiations in these trade war deals with china
*  for instance like i wish i understood that better i wish i really knew what was at stake and what
*  china's actually trying to do and whether or not uh like in particular like when you think about
*  china china and the military and their their engagement with the companies the reason why like
*  i was i never understood why they were trying to keep huawei out i was like why they keep that
*  doesn't make any sense to me like shouldn't they show that they've done something bad and but it's
*  a company that they feel is inexorably connected to the to the chinese government so that's like
*  negotiating with them and that kind of like for me to say that i think that this person's doing a
*  better job or i like the way biden would handle it better like do i really know what the fuck i'm
*  talking about i don't you know i really don't and that's the case with a lot of issues i mean social
*  issues i think there that's what i was going to say i feel like there's low hanging fruit
*  we're just from listening to you it's like you know when when you said that you were mostly
*  sort of a bernie guy that in the primary you you seem to i don't want to put words in your mouth
*  but that bernie would be your primary the person in the primary that you would lean towards or
*  support um if you pick environment just for one example bernie's big on green new deal and we
*  could debate how practical is it is it just a framework is it something that could literally
*  be made law or whatever the case um trump thinks climate change was a hoax created by china
*  whereas biden supports the green new deal as a framework it's like if you're coming from if we
*  start with bernie you can see that there's a grand canyon size gap between the two options and so
*  that's where i'm kind of interested in because you know i get out i'm sure i don't know if you see
*  them or not but there's all these articles about joe rogan is a left right center whatever you and
*  i have spoken enough now where you've made it clear that your actual positions on social issues
*  environment they're pretty left and you're all left but yeah bernie is really who aligns with me
*  okay biden is not bernie for sure but it's it's it's closer and so that's where i'm interested in
*  where there's really anything you can identify where you're like i just don't agree with biden
*  on this um well when you talk about bernie and why i was interested in bernie what bernie
*  represented to me was someone who wanted change at like a societal level wanted to help people in
*  a way that wasn't going to make anybody any money it wasn't something where he was clearly
*  doing this because of the special interest groups that put him in a position think this would
*  ultimately be more profitable when he's talking about things like eliminating student loans student
*  and making school free for everyone when you say that i go first of all that's not making anybody
*  any money right that's one of those things you're only doing because you think it would be better
*  for humans better for our culture better for our our civilization i'm all for that those those are
*  the things eliminating these catastrophic health care bills that people get when they get sick and
*  they go bankrupt that to me is crazy that we have this community that's what's supposed to be right
*  the united states is supposed to be like almost like a giant team and we would let others just by
*  simple misfortune we would let their life completely fall apart because they got injured
*  and they come up with this bill that literally changes the whole course of their life if you're
*  a person who makes fifty thousand dollars a year and you know you're doing fine and then all sudden
*  a catastrophic injury comes along and you get hit with a bill a medical bill that's in the hundreds
*  of thousands of dollars you're fucked like your your life you don't have enough time to make that
*  up unless you do something significantly different in terms of earning more money so you're stuck
*  you're in a bed that's to me crazy and that doesn't make any sense like as a person who
*  values community as a person who values like we can help and it makes everybody feel good if you
*  can help someone who came upon some bad fortune they feel better you they feel protected and loved
*  you feel better for being able to use your you know your privilege or your fortune to help these
*  people that's what we need more of that is what stood out for me about Bernie Sanders now the
*  argument against that is the pro-business argument right the pro-business argument is the stronger
*  the business is the the better business does there's a trickle-down effect and the whole
*  society will rise up because the economy is stronger and and you know yeah there's going
*  to be some ruthless capitalism going on but ultimately it benefits everybody and that's
*  I don't think you have to have one or the other there I mean I don't think that this is these
*  are mutually exclusive that you can't you can have capitalism but you could also have compassion
*  and we could we could work together as a community and and and try to take all these problems that we
*  have that that are really clear right like these inner cities that never get any better they never
*  show any improvement unless they get gentrified everything stays fucked right why is that that's
*  not an unsurmountable problem like if we can fly across the planet and and try to fix countries
*  that we've blown up in war why can't we try to fix the inner cities that our our our kids go to
*  school in like that doesn't make any sense to me that people are forced to live in that's why I
*  was interested in Bernie Sanders that's what he means to me the health care example is an
*  interesting one because it really comes down to what is the main point of of the health care
*  apparatus right if the main point is to get people as healthy as possible so that they can
*  live the longest most fulfilling lives that they want or are able to that gets you one set of
*  policies if the perspective is health care is just an industry like any other where the participants
*  just are there to make money that's a totally different policy prescription and regulatory
*  infrastructure it's it's night and day yeah it really is it really is night and day and it's
*  it's one of those things that I think people are probably going to be more interested in hearing
*  about now after this pandemic and they realize hey through no fault of your own you could be broke
*  through no fault of your own you can lose your business through no fault of your own so all these
*  ideas that like I know people that are pretty right wing that would give me a hard time about
*  call me a socialist and a commie because I'm really into Bernie Sanders a lot of those very
*  same people are now wanting to get that stimulus check a lot of those very same people now
*  understanding why I supported Andrew Yang and his concept of universal basic income because his
*  concept is based on his understanding of technology and his knowledge of AI and the potential
*  possibility to just take millions of people out of the market out of the workplace like that almost
*  like this like a virus of technology that removes diseases excuse me removes jobs instead of removes
*  your health and I think that more people probably would be better off if we shifted our ideas about
*  what socialism means and what democratic socialism means I think that the word is so toxic maybe we
*  should just call it community support you know that we should we should think of these really key
*  things like student loans I think we both agree about this it is insane to start your life at 21
*  years 22 years old just getting out of school with hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt that's
*  insane and if you go on to get a PhD ah it keeps going it keeps going and you get to this point
*  where you're you're just you have this weight over you everywhere you go there's this big ass weight
*  and you're carrying it around and that care you're carrying around this debt that even if you go
*  bankrupt you have to pay how did that happen how are businesses able to pollute the environment
*  make terrible mistakes go under go bankrupt and they're absolved of their debt but a kid who
*  wanted to learn something goes to a school and winds up you know you're 22 you're not even a
*  fully formed human yet and you're in debt you're fucked you're starting out of the gate crazy crazy
*  behind the line well you're completely right of course about the toxic nature of the word socialism
*  yeah back to that for a second I think that that hurt Bernie in 2015 I was saying Bernie may well
*  have been a socialist in the 1970s he may still be one but he's really running on on social democracy
*  which is what they have in northern Europe it's a type of capitalism and this is what I think Andrew
*  Yang actually did well I don't know if it was like people centered capitalism that he called
*  what he was doing or or what phrase he used but I do think in my postmortems about what happened
*  with Bernie because it wasn't by a little bit that Bernie lost I mean but even before he dropped out
*  he was down like 1.8 or 2 million votes to Joe Biden like this this was really not close I do
*  think that the continued use of that word socialism was not helpful and I know people will hear me say
*  this and they'll say David either way they were going to call him a socialist what difference does
*  it make if he embraces the term or says it's not the right term or whatever sure that that applies
*  to some people but I failed to see what the advantage was to using a term that didn't really
*  describe what his campaign was he was he's talking about capitalism where you say like you're pointing
*  out we can't let people drop too low we need to ensure some basic level things happen that aren't
*  people's fault it's not just about you're going to do as well as you want to do there are
*  circumstances people are born into injuries pandemics all this stuff yes so I I do think that
*  whatever your opinion is about socialism quote-unquote there was really no advantage
*  to Bernie Sanders from using or or at least to some degree allowing that term to continue being
*  used well he wanted to redefine it and when he came onto my show he actually did try to define it
*  and just describe the difference between the concept of socialism which a lot of people
*  connect to communism and what he calls democratic socialism you know and what he was showing a more
*  a more tamed down version of this this concept that you know a lot of like real young lefties
*  like my friend uh my friend uh Bridget was on the podcast the other day Bridget Feticey she's a
*  hilarious writer very funny comedian and she was talking about how she found some stuff that she
*  wrote when she was in her early 20s and she read it and she's she's more center today I would say
*  it may be left on many issues politically socially rather but she was like AOC she said she said
*  she's reading this stuff and she was like like a radical when she was young and I think that
*  happens to people you do I'm sure Bernie was probably a full-on socialist at one point in his
*  life but like what did that mean back then versus what does it mean now and even the term socialist
*  like the term like when you when you look at the term conservative or the term socialist you're
*  talking about a spectrum you're not talking about a one or a zero it's not an it's not you can't
*  have a no one has the same number factor of conservativism there's a lot of people that are
*  conservative that they you know they're very liberal on a lot of social issues but yet they
*  still vote red and I think there's a lot of people that consider themselves like a socialist but what
*  at what does that at what level you know if you're pro fire department I think you're kind you you
*  embrace some socialist values right if you're pro a lot of the services that we use that are a part
*  of your tax dollars like we're combining our money so that the world is better for all of us it's not
*  just a dog eat dog fight we recognize value in community and society and a civilization where
*  we all work together we just don't want to work together too much we don't want people leeching
*  off of it and I'm on that side as well because I know that although there are more and we're seeing
*  these more than we've ever seen in our life that multiple circumstances beyond your comprehension
*  totally out of your control that fucks up your life but yet we also see people who are lazy and
*  who keep fucking up their life and you keep enabling them and helping them it doesn't help
*  anybody either both those things are true it doesn't just because you agree with one thing
*  that we need to help each other doesn't mean you deny the fact that there's a real problem
*  psychologically to giving people free money and to giving people free room and board and taking
*  away incentive for them to survive there's something for whatever reason that a lot of us need this
*  sort of like inner drive this knowledge that you're you're responsible for your own destiny and you
*  have to go out there and you have to put in the work you have to get out of bed when the alarm
*  goes off you have to do the things you're supposed to do and there's people that don't do that and
*  yet they still want to be rewarded they still want money they still want their check they still
*  they still want the thing they feel society or government owes them that's not good either see
*  both of those things are not good it's not good to let people who are sick rot and and and and
*  live their life in a compromised position because they don't have enough money for the medical care
*  that's sick too it's not it's not a good person it's not a good society it's not a good model to
*  have people starve it's that's not good if there's money in food and we could distribute it more
*  evenly especially to people that are unfortunate but it's also not good to let people just camp out
*  on the sidewalk where you can't walk through it los angeles is filled with tents now especially
*  now because of all this craziness in the pandemic it's gotten way worse there's areas where you
*  can't go anywhere you literally you can't walk under underpasses there are these campgrounds
*  like that's not good either you know and now we're dealing with mental health problems i'm sure and
*  a lot of other issues i mean there's a lot so okay you mentioned the areas where even right wingers
*  tend to be okay with sort of like socializing certain services so fire department's an easy one
*  who does the road those are those are all really easy but i think that there's some more pernicious
*  ones that the right is less eager to own like for example it's all about free market capitalism
*  for profits make a business build up the business etc even when that business is built on
*  law enforcement that's socialized to protect your offices law infrastructure that you count on to
*  protect your intellectual property it's so put that aside for a second but then they're okay
*  socializing the cleanup or the fixing in many cases so with the drilling and fracking companies
*  great great examples capitalism for the profits look at me capitalist i figured out how to do
*  this drilling how to how to extract this energy from the earth i bought the land i bought the
*  equipment i'm hiring employees look at me you know pulling myself up by the bootstraps something goes
*  wrong people downwind you know get sick whatever now they are going to say let's socialize that
*  cleanup cost though you're right because you know we should do this through
*  taxation let's make sure that we're cleaning this up at the state level we want state funded
*  we want state funds to get this all cleaned up so that is an area of hypocrisy that's more
*  difficult than just like we mostly all agree the fire department should be socialized a few people
*  will say no if you call and there's not really a fire you should owe money or so that's like a tiny
*  percentage it's an easy one the the ones i'm talking about are a little bit tougher and you're
*  going to get a lot more pushback i think if you were to focus on those well i think you got a
*  really good point with the environmental cleanup like something like the bpu oil spill that's a
*  really good point and that's a weird one it's like you don't want to it's almost like it's such a
*  catastrophic event you don't want to leave it in the hands of someone who is so they i mean they
*  fucked up in the first place to make this happen i don't trust them i don't trust the way they do
*  business i mean they they maybe it's just something that happens when you drill under the ocean and
*  you pull oil out occasionally things go wrong but i don't want to trust them to fix that i want to
*  have some sort of environmental cleanup crew that's in place and maybe give them the bill
*  i mean i don't know what did it cost how much did it cost bp to to have that and isn't it still
*  leaking hasn't it been proven that that it's still polluting the ocean i don't know over the last
*  year i i honestly don't know what's going on videos of when it was coming out of the ground
*  oh yeah it's crazy like the the world's ending like it's a high pressure it's just the high it's
*  just open for days right i mean i don't even remember how long it was just open them but
*  that's the point if you don't so this is where it starts to get tricky because it sounds like
*  you might trust them to monetize it but then if it gets messed up hey we don't we shouldn't
*  trust them to clean it up someone else should do it which maybe i agree with and you're right
*  we should give them the bill but that's the role the role of regulation to begin with if they were
*  better supervised we could have prevented this from the start i mean with the bp oil spill
*  i'm going back like 10 years now but there was some 500 000 dollar valve i believe that was not
*  required i'm i i'm going from memory so i hope i'm getting this 90 right there was some regulation
*  that was removed where they were no longer required to have this 500 000 safety on these rigs which
*  would have prevented it and obviously the 500 grand they didn't want to spend up front but it
*  would have been way cheaper than what ultimately happened jesus you know when i see those rigs
*  outside like um there's a place that i love to go to in santa barbara that they have these offshore
*  little oil rigs i always look at them like that one day in the future we're going to look back
*  and go why the fuck did we ever let them put those there these that is so crazy any other business
*  like first of all that's not even our land right no one even owns that it's like if you're an oil
*  company and you're in texas you have to have either a lease on the land or you have to have
*  rights to the land it has to be yours in order to dig into the ground and get oil but out there in
*  the ocean you're just kind of doing it on public area you're doing it in the the world i mean once
*  you get a certain amount of miles i forget how many miles it is offshore it's international waters
*  right so you just we're making agreements we're letting these companies go into the ground and
*  we're not profiting from it at all all the money goes to them and they're sucking it out of the
*  ocean and at any moment they it could go wrong it could be an explosion and the beaches are ruined
*  for the rest of your generation yeah i couldn't agree with you more there i don't know if it's
*  going to be like in 50 years or 200 years or you know however however many years at some point
*  we're going to look back and there will be you know the the books will say we used to pull this
*  stuff out of the ground and then refine it and then burn it and then the it would and people would
*  say you you guys did what what how did that how did that work how did you even get away with that
*  do you drive an electric car i i don't currently you son of a bitch plan to get what i have a
*  lease which is up in three months okay and the next car will be electric yeah um once you get
*  one other cars feel stupid i mean i really not just stupid because of the environmental risk like
*  i have a tesla model s it's the craziest thing i've ever driven it literally doesn't make sense
*  they're so fast it's it's like it's violating physics it's so strange it's like you see this
*  enormous screen where the navigation's on you're like why did anybody ever have like a little
*  screen when you can have one of these things you know what you can see it's like having a map open
*  in front of you they're incredible now do you um if you do a long trip i don't bring it on a long
*  trip i don't trust it okay i was gonna say you are you are you planning ahead of time where you're
*  stopping to charge it i have friends that have driven many many you know like across the country
*  even with teslas and they you know there's a little supercharger map that's built in to the
*  software it's amazing you can do it but i don't want to wait around in some town for 20 minutes
*  while my car charges to 80 and look around for weirdos like what if some shit's going down man
*  what if what if you're in you know if you have like 14 miles left on your charge and uh all
*  of a sudden a building explodes half a block away like you got to get out of there i like i like to
*  be able to if i'm if i'm taking a road trip and i'm going across the country i want options
*  maybe if they have like a little engine they could get you by just a little tank of gas a little
*  engine to get you by in case you run out of batteries they're gonna i guess it's gonna be
*  solar eventually you could also just always not go below 50 right and then you would know if the
*  shit hits the fan you've got 50 at least yeah yeah you could do that yeah you could do that but that
*  would be annoying you know you drive uh you know the 50 is like 150 miles if you're on a long trip
*  you go to 150 miles and pull over and then you gotta wait there for whatever amount of time
*  they're getting better at it though they're getting faster but the point is like it's such a
*  clear leap in the evolution of technology that once you drive one of those you're like oh it's
*  game over like he told me that when elon was here he told me that and i was like oh you're saying
*  that because it's your product and we're joking around about it but then when i drove one i'm
*  like oh okay yeah i mean it's like it doesn't even make sense there's so much better than
*  regular cars because it's instant acceleration there's no no gears it's one gear it's instant
*  torque and it also is so quiet like like oh i don't i can think i can just drive around this
*  thing and think and total peace and quiet is really appealing to me and i'm looking i'm in a few in a
*  few weeks i think right now the model threes are like 10 weeks out so i'm probably going to put it
*  in order and you know four or five weeks so i get it right right when i need it but as far as the
*  elon musk tesla stuff so i was uh i i bought tesla stock a long time ago years years ago i don't
*  remember exactly when and obviously it did really well for a really long time and i don't remember
*  when it was if it was a year and a half ago or two years ago but when elon smoked pot on your show
*  and the shit hit the fan i panic sold half my stock and and and the thing is i always say i
*  don't know anything about stocks i invest in mutual funds you just let it ride long term reinvest
*  the dividends don't think about it but i have like five or six stocks that that i actually chose to
*  buy and this is exactly why i don't invest in stocks because i was convinced that after that
*  incident horrible things were going to happen and i was like i'm selling half and obviously i regret
*  having done that at this point do you smoke do you smoke pot dave i don't i don't smoke anything i
*  just think inhaling any smoke i i just don't think is good and so it's nothing i've not done it well
*  there's definitely better ways to do it than inhaling smoke but inhaling smoke is very
*  effective but uh you know eating sugar it's not good either you know i'm sure you do that
*  right i i try to limit it certainly you're worrying that much about what would happen in the market
*  i i get it if you don't smoke pot if you smoke pot you're like oh just relax everybody because
*  it seems like a drug but we were drinking whiskey it wasn't the smoking pot was the reaction to it
*  it was what happened with i think it was around the same time where he said i might have found
*  someone to take the company private yes and sec got involved and i just panicked and i was like
*  i'll keep i'm up so much i'll just sell half so it's not the end of the world i'm hedging my
*  bets here um he has two qualities that i would never bet against and the first one is an insane
*  work ethic his work ethic is insane it's insane i mean that guy will work 16 hours a day seven
*  days a week he just keeps going he was when he was trying to get the model three production out
*  he was sleeping on the floor of the factory i mean he's a maniac and he's weirdly intelligent
*  like weirdly some like when i'm talking to him i feel like i'm talking to someone in the future
*  like this is what you know if i if i had to go back in time and uh have dinner with a neanderthal
*  you know uh i i feel like it'd be real similar to when i sit down and hang out with elon how he
*  feels because like i think he's like another another level of human being i think that that
*  that is a natural course of progression for evolution that we are going to eventually
*  find people that are where they're they're getting smarter they're going to get it's we're not going
*  to stay in a static state forever right just like we didn't stay as an australian pithecus we became
*  human beings over you know natural selection and evolution all that good stuff that's going to keep
*  going and if it's going to keep going you're especially when it's integrated with this insane
*  access to technology the kids have today and insane access to information you're going to
*  have smarter people it's going to be a different thing and they're you know maybe they're going to
*  i mean he's a he's a person he's a human being so he does make mistakes just like human beings make
*  like when he called that guy a pedo guy and that kind of shit but when it comes to his ability to
*  allocate resources and do things and get things done like he's so smart they just let him drill
*  tunnels under la they're like okay go ahead they're like how many people would be able to go to the
*  you know the the city of los angeles and go i've got an idea i want to put a tunnel go all the way
*  to vegas they'd be like this guy's on coke get him out of here but with elon they let him try
*  it's i think he's a really important person for our culture really important like probably one of
*  the most important people where are you on i mean i guess at some point coronavirus is a topic where
*  where are you on what's going on with him reopening the factory and saying arrest me and i mean i like
*  i've been following it to some degree it's really complicated right it's like who should be able to
*  decide when you can or can't go back to work it's not it's not straightforward it's not cut and dry
*  because if you say the people should be allowed to make their own decision
*  you run into the very real possibility that especially if you have to go to work at that
*  factory and you can't not work and you do get sick and you do go home and you do spread it to your
*  family a loved one could die that's that's real on the other hand the government doesn't really
*  seem to have any sort of straightforward plan as to how people can economically bounce back from this
*  they i mean there was one of the weirdest quotes i think it was trump that said this
*  we're talking about businesses and restaurants that they'll be open maybe not with the same owners
*  but they'll be open again did you did you see that quote no i don't i don't i didn't see that but it's
*  like what does that really mean does that just mean like a different business will be created
*  that's exactly what it means it means that he's just being pragmatic and maybe cold whoever made
*  that quote that is probably how it's going to go down is it trump says restaurants who may come
*  back just maybe with new owners yeah i mean that don't that does not make me feel good man if i'm
*  a restaurant owner you know and there's a few restaurants that i'm always shouting out on the
*  podcast uh that like are owned by friends of mine that are these businesses are hurting so bad
*  there they they went like that to no customers or a very small percentage of customers who were to
*  take out when they were you know they had dine in every night and they have these bills and they had
*  their business set up in a way that you know you have to make x amount of money in order to stay
*  open and they were successful and they're doing well and one of the toughest businesses to be
*  successful in and then all sudden the rug gets pulled out so what's the solution should people
*  just be able to go to restaurants and everybody works there as a waiter or a cook or they just
*  maybe get sick and then more people die boy that doesn't sound good to anybody either so what is
*  the solution i don't know but i don't think that in our particular case i don't think our governor
*  has the answers um one of the things he's been criticized for is he's decided to open up production
*  for television and films but not churches you know there's another thing they've done that's
*  really nuts that my friend adam curry turned me on to they closed alcoholics anonymous meetings
*  but liquor stores were an essential business that is not that's not good government it's not good
*  thinking this this there's so many things where they've put into place these lists of what's
*  approved and not approved and i don't i just don't think that it's an i don't first of all i think
*  the information's constantly changing and i think that they're they're going off this old information
*  they haven't made adjustments and then on top of it i don't think they're qualified to i don't think
*  they're qualified just like we're talking about a president like one person who's involved in
*  the economy and environment all these different things i don't think one governor can really be
*  smart enough to know a what kind of impact is going to have economically to close all these
*  businesses down and b which ones get to open up and what is essential and why and it's just it's
*  very frustrating for all involved and it highlights one of the reasons why you know the way we do
*  government is it's you know it's not perfect it's it's not it's definitely better than a lot of ways
*  a lot of places in the world but it still there's a lot of holes in it yeah i share your i share
*  your frustration with the constantly changing messages uh you know what is essential in one
*  state versus in another state the issue of churches is a big one i mean on on the other hand
*  um the the in massachusetts churches were included in the first phase of reopening and a lot of public
*  health officials say that doesn't make any sense and the suspicion is that it's there because of a
*  lot of pressure and that it probably should have been you know in phase two or maybe even phase
*  three but i think it's hard to really talk about the state by state without acknowledging the
*  disastrous response from the federal government and i don't know where you stand on you may
*  totally disagree with me on that and i think that there's a lot of straw men that are being
*  put in place to argue that trump handled it beautifully to use his term but i think if you
*  start with the idea of the coordinated federal response we could have had a lot of these other
*  issues that we're having now just wouldn't be issues and i'm glad to get into it more if if
*  you want i don't know if you've talked about that a lot yeah i think it'd be really interesting to
*  talk about this because what do you think they could have done differently like what do you think
*  the government should have done differently the federal government got it so here's here's
*  there's the narrative has been a lot of two sides that are arguing people who just vaguely say
*  trump failed he didn't do enough and he was slow without like really giving specifics which i will
*  give and then on the other hand you've got a lot of people who are just reflexively defending
*  hey he shut down travel from china really early and he took it seriously and we've done the most
*  tests which is a whole other fiasco uh tiktoking point that we can get into but for the most part
*  i think that the the critiques and the praise is just not tied to real dates so in january we had
*  our first case january 20th i think it was and south korea had their first case january 20th
*  we then often skip over february so a lot of people will defend trump by saying you're not
*  going to shut down a country when you've got one case and i i totally agree you're not going to
*  shut down a country over one case we're not going to shut down a country over 15 cases there was
*  this point where we had 15 and trump said we've got 15 and soon it's going to be zero i don't think
*  that it was logical at that point to say shut it all down but just to like pick a date and then we
*  can work around it march 5 okay march 5th china had 80 000 cases so we already had proof that like
*  this was this was going to be big italy had 4000 cases so this is this is march 5 so we already
*  had proof that it'll travel really far and it'll get bad far from china and we had 221 cases on
*  march 5 it would be very reasonable on march 5th for trump to say this is a problem fdr-like
*  delivery i i know hard to imagine trump doing that but we've got to work together this is going to
*  be difficult we're going to do a 30 day i need all 50 governors to to help me on this let's do 30 days
*  of stay at home he probably would have then on april 5th have had to ask for another 30 so we
*  would have done like 60 days march 5 to may 5 and where would we be right now we'd be in really
*  really good shape so it's really easy to just say dude you're not going to shut down a country with
*  five cases i don't i i agree but we had the information on march 5th march 10th march well
*  right at any one of these points if we did a real shutdown we'd be in such good shape first of all i
*  think that the support for a shutdown that early would been almost zero i think you would have a
*  really hard time convincing people that this was going to be that big of a deal and that there
*  wouldn't be something they could do to stop i think a lot of this is monday morning quarterbacking
*  right we're looking at what happened factually like we're looking at it in the past this is when
*  where there was this amount of cases when it was happening live there was a lot of confusion first
*  of all the world health organization as recently as january was saying that according to china this
*  is what they wrote on a tweet on a tweet it's not it doesn't get transmitted from person to person
*  so this is in january right in march they were saying you don't need a mask this is there's been
*  a lot of confusion it's not like there was like real straightforward clear advice it's hard for
*  us it's so easy for us to sit back here we are in late may and say oh he should have done this and
*  if he'd done that everything would have been great the support for shutting down the whole country
*  for 30 days at the beginning of march was zero i don't think anybody would have agreed with that
*  so no question and i i also i think i do think we want to be careful though if we if we write
*  any retrospective analysis off as monday morning quarterbacking it's all then it's not even worth
*  discussing right because we could just say throw it out it's monday morning quarterbacking i mean
*  you're right you're right yeah no it's it's definitely of look it clearly wasn't perfect
*  so there's always going to be room for critique but like what the idea that we could have shut
*  everything down boy that is such a hard sell remember when Cuomo was saying that they're
*  not going to shut down new york it'd be too hard to shut down new york and de Blasio share i mean
*  that they're they're not you know they're democrats and trump's a republican i don't care about that
*  i mean certainly there there's no doubt that Cuomo and de Blasio are deserving of some blame here as
*  well in one other example there was a period we'd have to look at covidtracking.org to get the exact
*  numbers but there was a period in either late march or early april where south korea remember
*  south korea had their first case the same day we did within out within like six or eight hours it
*  might have been january 1920 or vice versa but there was a point in late march or early april
*  where south korea had as many positive tests in a day as we did tests total so this is really
*  important to understand the discrepancy here there was a day where we like tested 800 people
*  in the united states and they did so many tests that they had 800 positive cases and so the the
*  slow testing response is a disaster and the proof is you know we can say it's monday morning
*  quarterbacking but south korea got it right taiwan got it right in terms of places in europe
*  greece did really well new zealand did really well so we may be looking at it retrospectively
*  but there were examples of countries that were on the ball with testing and it made a huge
*  difference yeah it did there's no doubt about that and david maybe you would know the answer to this
*  wasn't there there was some sort of a pandemic department that was uh people were moved out of
*  that department and it sort of was absorbed yes so there's so so there's video of this it's so
*  funny because trump was asked about this at a press briefing a couple months ago this was when
*  anthony fauci was still allowed in public and when the question when the question was asked why did
*  you shut down the pandemic response team trump turned the videos out there trump turned and said
*  i don't know anything anthony do you know anything about that there's video of from 2018 bragging
*  about shutting that down oh my god to get back to our cognitive decline thing is it possible trump
*  literally had no memory of that when he was asked about it a couple months ago maybe yes there is
*  here's why here's why i think that my brain my memory is going to shit and i think one of the
*  reason why my memory is going to shit is i do too many things i have too many podcasts going there's
*  too many subjects i'm researching too many different topics for future guests and and i
*  i really feel like you can only have so much data in your head i really you know what that um
*  what dunbar's number is yeah it's it's related to it's some number of items right that you can
*  keep track of simultaneously humans that you can have some sort of a by name relationship recognize
*  their face people that you know are going to be in your circle of humans you interact with
*  it's your dunbar's number and it's somewhere around 150 and they think it's based on how we
*  evolved in these small tribes and we you know we've evolved to know the people that are around us
*  and that's all the database you needed you know you didn't need a full terabyte for people's names
*  and addresses you just needed 150 of them i think that's the case with everything and i think when
*  you see a guy like trump and he's got fucking towers all over the place with his name on it
*  and how many different businesses is he juggling and all these different deals going on and he's
*  cheating at golf and all this different crazy shit i mean there's so much data and then on top
*  of that he's supposedly not doing it like as far as they've told us he hasn't been involved in his
*  businesses for three and a half years you're saying he still got he must have something to do with it
*  there's i mean i believe that like this has been something that people say to me like hey i'd love
*  you to get involved in this business and i would say i don't have any time they go well you wouldn't
*  need the time well it doesn't matter i would need the time because i'd have to think about it if i
*  give you money now i have to think like oh what's that money what's happening over there that's one
*  more thing it's one more unit of the mental bandwidth that you have this fucking guy's
*  taxed out he's taxed out with just the arguments that he's getting with the press just think about
*  how much that's how much real estate that's taking up in his head right and then you think about the
*  disease you think about restarting the economy you think about he very well might not remember
*  bragging about disbanding the pandemic team it's very possible maybe he doesn't to your question
*  there was this pandemic response team he disbanded it in 2018 and he sort of bragged that hey you know
*  we're we're not going to do stuff where we don't need these people we just they're not really doing
*  much so we just we don't really need them so he did do that whoops this thing this thing about
*  the press though um you know and he's busy with between the press and the virus and reopening and
*  all this different stuff i don't know if you saw the reports that he often gets into what we would
*  call work like at noon or later after watching like five or even more hours of tv and tweeting
*  it doesn't strike me that he's that busy with actual work i think he is and he isn't i think
*  he it's still taking up bandwidth in his head but look it is so american that he does that you know
*  i'm saying i mean in not the best way possible but it's so we're so comical in so many ways
*  that our president he's eating junk food and watching tv and tweeting angry tweeting at people
*  while he's watching fox news it's so so okay here's the point i want to make about that okay
*  one of the things that scares me about the way that this president is sometimes covered by
*  um sometimes it's people who call themselves centrists or sometimes it's people who say i'm
*  just i'm just reporting facts and not giving an opinion or whatever one of the things that really
*  scares me is that this is being treated like a normal presidency when as you're pointing out
*  it's really not a normal presidency and the the analogy that i would sort of apply to it would be
*  like imagine that you're doing ufc commentary and i'm really i'm going this is like me going out on a
*  limb because i this is not my area of expertise but let's see if the analogy will work imagine that
*  one of the fighters comes in and he at one point tries to light his opponent on fire and you as a
*  commentator say this is an unusual strategy that's very aggressive you're treating it like it's within
*  the realm of normality right this is a destruction of the system right like what it's not an aggressive
*  strategy this is crazy right that's and that's what scares me it scares me because i see you know
*  so i i like to use the term enlightened centrist and it's a little bit pejorative but it's someone
*  who believes themselves to be above the fray of the of the bias of the left right stuff where
*  they'll say you know listen yeah trump kind of has a different way of talking about politics but i
*  think he's pretty good on trade it's like what are you talking about and that really scares me
*  because there's like a normalization going on that's that's crazy to me well there's also a
*  thing that we desire as humans that's for our leaders to exhibit virtue and and and dignity
*  there's there's like a thing we expect them to be a statesman or a stateswoman right you expect them
*  to like tulsi gabbard's an excellent example that to me of someone who who speaks like someone that
*  i would appreciate addressing the nation in some sort of a disastrous state like if something was
*  going wrong i would want someone who speaks the way she speaks talking about it you know there's
*  there's a certain cuomo has it there's a certain characteristic that you would want from someone
*  who is in a position of leadership like i get a certain amount of calm out of listening to him
*  break down the current situations and what they're doing to remedy and mitigate all the problems in
*  new york and when you think about it new york got hit harder than anywhere in the plan excuse me
*  anywhere i guess anywhere on the planet right it turns to a city i mean yeah i think so yeah so at
*  this point it's anywhere on the planet i mean he's done a remarkable job of exhibiting all the
*  characteristics whether or not you think his decisions were correct or not because there's
*  some real arguments especially with the early days of letting uh old people go back to nursing
*  homes when they had tested and that's obviously horrible um but the way he communicates he
*  communicates like a guy that you would feel comfortable he's going to make good decisions
*  that got that he seems like a president yeah and i think that this is why you know a lot of mistakes
*  have been made during this and a lot of it came from like you're pointing out we had incomplete
*  information right masks are good then they don't work it's transmitted through droplet versus how
*  much is happening via surfaces and it's you know dangerous for this group versus a lot of mistakes
*  because of lack of information but not everybody was saying stuff like 15 cases will soon be zero
*  anybody who wants a test can get a test it'll wash through by april and we're not going to have cases
*  by the that stuff that that has a very particular effect on people who basically want a license to
*  go out and act however they want to act regardless of what the facts are and that's why it's been so
*  dangerous to see that stuff well it also is dangerous because people dismiss some of the
*  things that he said when he was talking about like using a uv inside the body as a disinfectant or
*  using lysol as a maybe a cleaning he was saying one of the problems that came out of this i don't
*  know if you're aware of this there was a publicly traded biotech company that had a concept for uv
*  light that would go in through when someone was intubated you would go in through the same tube
*  and they would use that uv light and it would kill the virus from inside that is something that
*  uv light actually does work to kill bacteria and viruses in fact i at my house i have a cell phone
*  cleaner you put it in there you close it and it uses uv light to kill all those things i mean this
*  is something that they've they've had forever in steripens a steripen is something that backpackers
*  and hikers use you can take water out of a creek and you take this light bulb it's like a long
*  wand and you wave it for a certain amount of time in the water and that uv light kills all the
*  bacteria yeah um so this company had this product that was going to use that uv light through the
*  tube and they got pulled off of twitter they got their their account got banned because it looked
*  like something that was aligning with what trump said even though it's legitimate science and okay
*  it was real that was a real issue so so let's uh there's a bunch there and i i want to get to
*  the twitter stuff because i i know about i saw the when you talked to bridget over the weekend
*  about the regulation of social media and i want to talk about i don't know the this one so i can't
*  say too much about it but so so trump mentioned in that wondering aloud he said what if you hit
*  the body with heater light and what if you put the disinfectants that were up on the tv behind him
*  inside the body so we got like four things four things that he mentioned right so uv light heat
*  and i think isopropyl and bleach were the four elements so to speak to use his term that were
*  up on the screen behind him after the fact it was there there were these couple papers about this uv
*  technology and a couple people on twitter started saying this is the stuff trump was referring to
*  and it's like no he wasn't trump said i don't know anything about this i'm asking you right is
*  this something we might look at he was winging it he was winging it he was completely winging so
*  that's number one after the fact that's monday morning quarterbacking going through a pub med
*  and saying here's something i found with uv light i'm sure it was what trump meant when he said hit
*  the body for sure right yeah so that that's number one but in terms that this is kind of an example
*  of like that was a wacky statement that was an out of control statement that i can't imagine
*  almost any other politician wondering aloud about but there is nothing that this guy's defenders
*  supporters won't defend like he could it doesn't matter it doesn't you know that's the scary thing
*  that is a scary thing and that was that was one of the weirdest ones to try to justify yes i think
*  the correct response was he was winging it he obviously didn't know what he was talking about
*  and he he was like asking questions he was throwing some questions around they just weren't good
*  ones right and it like say if you or i like i don't know much about um you know internal combustion
*  engines i don't really understand them that much i kind of know their spark plugs and there's
*  you know fuel injection but i don't really know what the fuck's going on if i had explained it
*  to somebody like how the gas gets converted into energy and how the pistons go up and something
*  what's right i don't i would be doing so i goes i was probably you got to get the gas in there
*  and the fire and then it's exploding and uh you know it would be similar to the way he was
*  describing using disinfectants on people but one of the things that i think he did say was something
*  about getting light in the body i think he did say something about getting light in the body
*  yeah he listed it and said is that something you can look into yeah he got stuck he got stuck
*  rambling and he just kept going and and it's probably pretty safe to assume he enjoys some
*  kind of stimulant and i don't know what it is i don't know if it's legal or illegal and i think
*  you know if he was taking all that ephedrine that he had in his uh remember in that famous picture
*  where he was eating the uh taco bowl so someone wrote to me and said that it is true there's this
*  picture where trump tweeted he loves hispanics i don't know if you remember that tweet that was
*  after he had said crazy shit about mexicans possibly coming over here to rape and murder
*  exactly exactly and there's a picture where if there's an open drawer over his left shoulder
*  and there's a bunch of uh sudafed packs in yeah exactly come on if i was gonna like get people
*  to like i would hold on let me open up this drawer real quick all right now take the picture
*  like just to fuck with people just like let's let's put a needle and a baggie and a spoon in there
*  just don't say not someone wrote to me though and said that that version of sudafed which is i guess
*  the uk version yeah doesn't contain the same stimulant that the american version has i don't
*  know the truth but i want to make sure we're careful about yeah we should be careful i like
*  talking shit though so let's keep going yeah i wonder if the uk version is stronger do we even
*  know is that possible for you to look right now no jimmy's i thought it was the opposite of that
*  i thought it was the opposite as well i thought the uk version was stronger yeah interesting yeah
*  that's what i had heard but i've done zero research yeah so no listen i mean you you and i have talked
*  about the tongue thing where it looks like he's essentially like his tongue is is attacking him
*  it was like his tongue was weak and it bernies and he was moving that fucker around in his mouth
*  trying to keep talking um there's the stuff where he's like or he seems to struggle with s's where
*  it's like a sound yeah and there was speculation that it's dentures but rich guys don't have
*  dentures you know they they and they they have dental implants unless you're super old school
*  yeah i guess i don't know and then there's pictures of him having really dilated pupils even under
*  like tv lighting which is weird because tv lighting is really really bright um i don't
*  really but are those real pictures that's the problem i've seen some pictures well i don't i
*  guess we have to look at them one by one but well dilated pupils is usually a response to some sort
*  of a drug right uh some people get that with mdma they get that with uh certain amphetamines
*  you know um to be fair i think that the most sort of like uh innocuous explanation would be
*  sometimes it's like the very high key trump very agitated trump talking fast and sweating yes and
*  then sometimes there's this like depressed trump where he's talking really really slowly
*  and he has a totally different delivery he looks depressed and sad it's possible that for either
*  some medication that he's actually prescribed or just like his energy cycle during the day i mean
*  we all to some degree have it maybe there's times a day where he's up and sometimes when he's down
*  like it's not necessarily stimulants i guess maybe but he's also a guy who's willing to take
*  hydroxychloroquine in preventative doses yeah let's think he's taking it yes i know i know many
*  doctors who are taking it and have asked me if i want it prescribed to me to take yeah because
*  they're taking it in very small doses and i said but my friend had it when he was my friend michael
*  yo was hospitalized with covet 19 and he was in a terrible place and he said when they gave him
*  hydroxychloroquine it had a terrible effect on his body he said it was devastating and my doctor said
*  there's a giant difference between the dosage and the response to the dosage of a a dose that
*  you would get if you are sick with a disease versus a preventative dose and he said there's
*  many many doctors that are taking preventative doses of this hydroxychloroquine and that this
*  stuff has been around for a long time as a malaria medication of course and dr drew did a whole
*  video segment that i watched recently about that as well saying basically the same thing
*  i think that anyone though who's willing to just start taking hydroxychloroquine i mean maybe take
*  stuff you know i'm saying like as long as your doctor procribes you so do you remember that
*  article i think you and i had discussed this um there was a uh journalist that claimed they found
*  the very same the right pharmacy that prescribed trump speed that where trump would pick up this
*  stuff that he would get this amphetamine for a metabolic condition do you remember that i don't
*  remember that one okay but if your doctor prescribes you something like i have friends
*  that take adderall and they take adderall the doctor prescribes him adderall and they take it
*  and they don't think there's anything wrong with it because the doctor prescribes it they don't
*  even think that they do drugs i'm like you're on a hardcore stimulant all the time and it's really
*  really really common so if he's a guy that's willing to take hydroxychloroquine which i mean
*  maybe it's a good thing to take and he's around a lot of people and it is possible that it has some
*  sort of a preventative effect obviously i don't know but if you're if you're the guy who takes
*  things you probably take things to go to bed you take things to wake up i need a little pick me up
*  i need it you know there's a lot of people out there that take stuff there's a type of person
*  who's just into trying stuff and seeing what it does for them yeah that's me i'm into stuff
*  but i don't take i don't take medication though like that like that seems to me like
*  whoa like what about the immune system like how much do you trust your immune is there
*  things you could do to boost your immune system so i like to talk to legitimate you know clinical
*  researchers and and and nutritionists that understand the body's effect and what what
*  what nutrients you're putting in and heat shock proteins from sauna and things like all kinds of
*  different stuff that you can do i mean making sure you get enough sleep and making that's a giant
*  factor all these factors that we're not getting discussed in the news when we're hearing all these
*  things about social distancing and covering your face and it would be really nice if the exact same
*  amount of effort was put to let's all use this time to make healthy choices and to understand that
*  there's a real benefit to having a healthy body and a healthy immune system and this is the best
*  example of it we could ever possibly face is a pandemic that worth some people they brush it
*  off like it's nothing and i know many people that have had it like that and then i know other people
*  that got it and they got it really bad i had two friends that were hospitalized one who was on a
*  respirator he was there for over a month he's an older guy but the the situation for them was
*  terrible but there's a bunch of factors nutrition body being run down being exhausted too much travel
*  alcohol there's there's all these different things like we need more education about that like there
*  are preventative measures that we can take it's not just as simple as put a band-aid on it cover
*  your face use hand sanitizer that's that's good advice too but better advice is both of those
*  things together yeah so on hydroxychloroquine i my understanding of the randomized controlled trials
*  right now is that it's essentially been tested as a treatment when someone is already sick yes and
*  it doesn't seem particularly effective and there can be serious side effects there is a study going
*  on i think in the uk looking at the low dose prophylactically i have no you know i get emails
*  from people who are like you're against hydroxychloroquine because trump's for it
*  i've been talking about hydroxychloroquine longer than trump i talked about it 10 days
*  before trump ever mentioned it along with seven other things that we're looking at i don't care
*  i want you know what works that's that's my only priority yes the reasons i doubted whether trump
*  was really taking it were that he mentioned he seemed confused about how long he had been on it
*  and what kind of dose he was getting like at one point it wasn't clear whether he was getting the
*  weekly dose which is how it's taken for malaria or a small daily dose he seemed confused and then
*  the letter that his doctor put out didn't actually say he was taking it it was one of the weirdest
*  letters i don't know if you saw it where there's one paragraph which just says we talked about this
*  drug and determined the potential benefits outweigh the risks or something like that maybe the doctor
*  did that because it's off label because it is an off-label drug so if he is prescribing it to trump
*  it's not fda approved who's going to get in trouble it's the president i mean i think that's
*  why they would write the letter was weird is the point it didn't it said everything other than
*  trump is taking it which is if it's a letter to prove trump's taking it you would think it would
*  mention that well maybe the doctor hesitated and said it's controversial maybe trump asked for it
*  we're going way out on the speculation limb here these are thin branches maybe maybe he said i want
*  the doctor's like wow uh that's uh i mean there's some downsides he's like look i'm going to get it
*  either way and so he gets it from another doctor it could be that i know a guy don't worry about it
*  i'll call a guy i'll have it tomorrow ask for the letter the point is after he mentioned it and people
*  said is he really taking it clearly the white house directed the doctor put out a letter proving i'm
*  taking it and the doctor writes a letter doesn't say trump's on it well maybe the doctor was like
*  came in why the fuck did you say that i mean i don't know i don't know it's uh there's a lot
*  of speculation i don't think you would outright lie about that because the reason being is that i do
*  know people are taking it and i do know doctors and i've just discussed it with doctors and i've
*  even been offered it and uh i just i think people are willing to if they really think there's a
*  possibility of getting ahead of this thing and some sort of a preventative measure they'll take
*  it and especially if you're a type of person who takes things so do you think that there's going
*  to be a period where wealthier folks with connections will be able to buy a vaccine
*  before it's available i think that's a possibility for sure right don't you think if there's a small
*  quantity that's always going to be the case i mean one thing that people are getting upset at me uh
*  in the early days of the pandemic was that i was testing everybody that came into the podcast studio
*  and like where are you getting these tests well i'm just buying them i'm paying for them there's a
*  concierge service in los angeles they come to you um and they the doctor will administer these tests
*  you just have to pay for it and i understand that people don't have that money that that sucks
*  but i'm not going to not do it if i can so this is a similar situation like i can understand what
*  people would be upset but if you had money and someone came up to you and said david we have this
*  perfect vaccine it's absolutely been proven however only one percent of the population is
*  going to be able to get it um but if you get it and you and your family can have it and we'll
*  make sure you're safe would you not take it because you wanted other people to have access to it i
*  think a lot of people who have access to it would probably say listen i have to do the right thing
*  for my family i'm going to try to help people get it i'm going to try to spread the word and
*  hopefully they'll be okay but i have to take care of myself right now yeah i i don't disagree with
*  that i don't disagree with that it's unfortunate that anybody would ever have to choose that
*  yeah and how it'll go down i guess is a question mark like how will you how will how will people
*  in the know be made aware that this is now something they'd potentially be able to buy
*  are you aware of i mean look how many different there's a bunch of different trials going on
*  right now where they're trying to figure out how to make a vaccine but there's so far no coronavirus
*  vaccine has ever been successful right there's not one that they can use as a model is that correct
*  there is so there are there's coronavirus vaccines that have worked in poultry from my
*  understanding which can be modified potentially so i think at least one or two of the vaccine
*  candidates are modified poultry coronavirus vaccines to that could potentially be used
*  in humans and the other unique thing about this vaccine potentially as i understand it is that
*  this would be if i understand correctly it would be the first vaccine of its type that instead of
*  having like a weakened version of the virus instead it would be a compound that triggers the body to
*  create certain proteins if i'm understanding that correctly that it would be innovated in that sense
*  as well yeah that was explained to me by alex jones i had a long conversation with him about
*  it last night where he was it's an mrna virus uh vaccine yeah mrna vaccine it's a but there's
*  never been one of those that's successfully been used on humans right this is a new thing
*  um well i don't know that there's been now all of a sudden we're both biologists
*  so yeah from what i've read there's not been an opportunity like this where the technology would
*  be near enough where we would try to make that type of vaccine versus the traditional kind is
*  my understanding dude that one sounds scary i'm gonna wait i don't want to be an early adopter
*  of that one especially if there's something yeah especially if this is something that for a giant
*  percentage of the population is in terms of the virus itself uh it's not deadly um i would want
*  to wouldn't you want to know if there's a new thing that's never been tried on people before
*  wouldn't you want to know like what the long-term ramifications of taking that are just on anything
*  any kind of medication anything with anything i mean i think what is important to remember is
*  even if phase three of the trial is shortened that would only lead to maybe a question mark
*  as to how long the immunity lasts but before you even start testing it to see whether it generates
*  immunity it's safety tested and by the time it's available even to like buy it as as a wealthy
*  person i think that the safety piece of it will be widely established and it might just be a question
*  of like does it give you six months or 12 months of immunity that doesn't really scare me it seems
*  like six months is still better than zero yeah if it works yeah and if it if it is really safe for
*  sure look if it works and it's safe we'd all want to take it real simple right the real question is
*  if this is a totally new thing and obviously i'm grossly unqualified to be talking about this but
*  if it is a new kind of vaccine like what what are the possibilities of this going wrong and what
*  could that mean to people that do have an adverse reaction to it so i want to be really careful not
*  to say things i'm not sure of but also not to allow false fears about the vaccine to be perpetuated
*  that this would be the first widely used mrna vaccine for a human virus does not mean that it
*  would be the beginning of the research into using these types of vaccines in humans and my understanding
*  is that it's been decades that this has been researched and that it's been under development
*  generally speaking and now it's being used specifically for coronavirus so i want to make
*  sure that i'm not like in any way implying that i have any broader concerns about the type of
*  vaccine because i don't and i'm not saying that somebody might not present one of those concerns
*  but i'm not aware of any of those concerns but that's a well well-worded way of describing it
*  yeah i mean obviously we're all hoping that it works we're all hoping that everyone's going to
*  benefit from this and that we'll have a cure so we can go back to as normal as possible but you
*  know again like i said i think we really more than anything we're under under appreciating the value
*  of the immune system and i think that's something that is really driving me crazy about the
*  short-sightedness of this response is that it's all about sanitation and avoidance and and all
*  these different factors and very little of it is about strengthening the immune system and keeping
*  the body healthy and and making a shift of recognizing that you know hey we're all very
*  vulnerable here we're all very vulnerable and we we've had a wonderful goldilocks sort of time
*  between world war two and now where things haven't really been nearly as bad as they've been all
*  throughout human history and we kind of have to recalibrate what's possible in terms of things
*  could go wrong and when things go wrong and we're grossly unprepared we find ourselves in the
*  situation that we're in right now yeah for the i've seen some really scary numbers about for the
*  younger serious cases like under under 50 maybe even under 60 obesity is extremely prevalent
*  that's really scary there's some correlation studies about vitamin d but there's really a
*  lot of question marks about whether it's a causal thing and whether the infection itself can reduce
*  your vitamin d like it would be delightful to learn that if you just if you have low vitamin d
*  you supplement it and it protects you yeah but there's a correlation and it's really not clear
*  what what the deal is with that because vitamin d is so cheap i mean it's free from the sun and
*  it's one of the cheapest it is but you know that 70 percent of the united states is deficient in
*  vitamin c it's a giant in c or d d did i say c you said c yeah i meant d it's it's some enormous
*  number of people do not have sufficient vitamin d and as many as i think it's uh i had dr ron
*  di patrick on the podcast a couple of days ago to discuss this it's more than 20 percent have
*  insufficient vitamin d to the point where it's dangerous where they can you know it's vitamin d
*  apparently is a hormone as well as vitamin the best way to get it is out in the sun but you can
*  supplement it and in supplementing it it changes uh so many things about your body about your body's
*  ability to recover it's it's for muscle development it's for a lot of different
*  there's a lot of different factors if vitamin d benefits you in and most of us don't have enough
*  of it it's really it's kind of a crazy thing zinc has also been connected to uh recovery from covid
*  and then one of the things they were speculating about with hydrochloroquine and zinc that you
*  they would use the two of them together and there's been some speculation that maybe it wasn't in
*  fact the hydrochloroquine that was really benefiting these people it was possibly the zinc
*  and that zinc in in combination with hydrochloroquine was what was helping people
*  yeah i mean we're just spitballing here but on on the zinc thing what i saw was
*  it seems to only be useful for recovery from viruses and colds if you are deficient but that
*  if you have a normal level of zinc that it doesn't really seem to do that that much so the best well
*  it's probably just like vitamin d the best move is to keep your body at a good state and and so
*  few of us ever do get your vitamin levels checked it's really an important thing and supplementing
*  i feel very very strongly about this it's been dismissed by some people as being not necessary
*  if you have a balanced diet the reality is most people don't have a balanced diet and particularly
*  when it comes to getting a wide range of nutrients that we know are beneficial i mean you really
*  should kind of vary what you eat to try to get as much of that stuff in as you can from natural
*  sources but uh man especially in times like this it's just very important to keep your b12 high c d
*  zinc all those things keep your body in a great state drink a lot of water you know and
*  we're not hearing again i mean i'm beating a dead horse but we're just not hearing enough about this
*  yeah i got a vitamin d and b12 at home test a month ago because i was just curious what are my
*  levels i live in boston you don't go outside that much in the winter and it's only starting to be
*  spring now and they were both fine but had my d been low what i would have supplemented it's so
*  cheap and and why why not you know yeah we're very fortunate i mean it's really easy to get some
*  vitamin d and it can you know make a giant difference in in your body um are you changing
*  anything about your lifestyle or your your your act obviously you're stuck at home but are you
*  changing anything in terms of like going okay i need to make some corrections to make myself
*  healthy or or corrections to get better sleep or not really because i mean i felt pretty good
*  about what i was doing before obviously my gym's closed so i'm running outside and riding my bike
*  and working out at home um do you feel weird when you run past people and you're real close to them
*  because you're like okay so so i'm i'm wearing a mask anytime i go anywhere inside like i go to
*  the grocery store i'm wearing a mask if i have to go to the post office although i'm trying to avoid
*  it i wear a mask from what i've read 90 of the contagion is in four places home offices public
*  transit and large gatherings the other 10 is happening mostly indoors in other situations
*  the outdoor contagion from what i'm reading is like almost zero unless you're doing something
*  really stupid so i don't feel like if i go running i need to wear a mask but i do it to avoid dirty
*  looks to be totally honest with you it's terrible breathing through that thing isn't it while you're
*  running terrible your bad breath coming back at you i went out on my bike and i thought you know
*  i'm outdoors like this nobody's really getting this outdoors if you're not in a group of people
*  and i didn't wear my mask and three bikers coming the opposite way were swearing at me so i was like
*  all right just to avoid that situation i guess i'll wear the mask even when i'm just walking around
*  i think there's a lot of unhappy people that are looking to yell at people and this is their new
*  way to do it they see you with no mask on running i don't know why though it wouldn't be spread
*  through the air outside that logic doesn't make sense if it's spread through the air inside why
*  if you're passing someone and you're breathing out heavy because you're running it would make it seem
*  to me that that would be a better way you walk right into it if it's in the air i mean it's
*  particulate matter it's in the air and you're breathing it out well this is why i'm wearing
*  the mask but from the studies i've seen there were these really scary looking images where it
*  was like black where the particles were different colors i saw that yeah and it was like you know
*  you could be 20 feet in front of someone on a bike and you could sneeze and the wind could bring the
*  droplets directly back and they could breathe in at that exact moment i don't deny it all that
*  it's physically possible but every single study that's coming out where it's possible to sort of
*  figure out like where are people getting this i'm just not aware of it being a real risk on a six
*  foot wide bike path to run past two people like it's got to be one in 10 million right um no i don't
*  think so no why if you're breathing it out if you're running right if you're if you're breathing out
*  you got spit there's stuff that comes out of your mouth and then someone's going this way
*  it's just makes sense okay yeah all right i mean listen i'm wearing the mask i just am
*  unsure how much of the contagion is happening out there yeah oh right now uh jamey just pulled this
*  up uh joe biden asked amy klobuchar to undergo vetting to be running mate wow breaking news
*  david packman how you feel is that the only person who's being vetted i don't know but she's she's
*  she's one of them democrat of minnesota has been asked by joe biden to undergo a formal
*  vetting to be considered vice president of running mate one of several potential candidates
*  now being scrutinized by his aides right okay so she's just been announced as being one of them
*  senator jean chaheen oh that said something about jean chaheen there as well did it what is that
*  yeah jean chaheen democrat of new hampshire who's running for re-election this year
*  declined biden's invitation she said no son uh senator maggie hassen other new hampshire senator
*  has agreed to be vetted so he's deaf it's interesting that he's definitely like he wants
*  to have a woman yep like that's uh do you think that's a political ploy or do you think that uh
*  it just it makes sense like why do you think he would do that i think that the timing of when he
*  made that call was calculated to be advantageous i don't remember exactly what was going on right
*  when he said it um but i think that it was a calculated move at the time i think honestly
*  unless you pick someone who's going to actively damage your campaign i don't think it matters that
*  much you need someone who's essentially going to stay out of the way not cause any kind of new
*  scandal like tim cain with hillary clinton i don't think he did anything for her one way or the other
*  like he was just kind of out of the way until you just brought his name up i forgot right right and
*  i think that really what you just want to avoid someone who's going to cause a problem like palin
*  for mccain was such a that was a little bit of a problem it was a problem exactly so you just want
*  it's like you just want to avoid a problem i think and i think you know elizabeth warren is
*  probably up there kamala harris is probably up there amy clobeshaar now we know for sure
*  it's it's just funny when you say i'm going to have a specific kind of person like uh what
*  what are the big speculations i'm going to have a woman of color like that he needs to have a woman
*  of color very specific i wish i wish he had like it would be hilarious if someone said i want a
*  chinese lady period mainland chinese lady that's going to be my running mate i'm going to i'm going
*  to like heal this nation and china together just only chinese ladies i don't care how good you are
*  if you're some white guy you can fuck off like it's kind of hilarious you know that we yeah i
*  would want the best person that he could possibly get especially when you consider his physical
*  state mental state's been questioned he doesn't look that great i would want someone who i really
*  feel like could make the cut yeah i don't i'm not big on this type of of identity politics
*  i mean listen last time i was on we talked about that time where that this we won't even say her
*  name but where this woman tried to get me fired from my teaching gig because i said saying you
*  will not consider a white or male candidate is that's that's not okay but i do think that
*  when you think about all of the people that have been president so it's like almost all white men
*  and then obama who was half black there would be something pretty powerful for a lot of of young
*  women and women of of all ages to see that oh okay there's a woman in this position vice president
*  sure president like i don't want to minimize that but you i mean you and i have talked before
*  for me categorizing people in these ways is not like my first instinct yes but it's also we're
*  recognizing that there is racism and sexism in the world like it's not a fake thing it's a real thing
*  we would love it if there was none if there was none there would be no consideration whatsoever
*  towards image because no one would care no one care how good would it look to have a woman in
*  there no one would care if there was zero sexism and there was and no one would care if it's a woman
*  of color if there's zero racism but there is some so we go well there'll be a great thing i get it
*  it would if there was a woman president like it's one of the reasons why i thought tulsi gabbard
*  would be amazing if she ran for president became president and you're talking about a woman who's a
*  veteran who's served overseas twice who's been a congresswoman for six years i mean that would be
*  that would be great for everybody like a really qualified woman who's the president that would be
*  great for everybody just happens to be a woman if your kids maybe they have asked you but if they
*  said how come there's never been a woman president like how would you answer that question
*  that's a good question it would depend on which kid and uh yeah um i would i would probably say
*  uh that our society up until first of all until the beginning of the 20th century women weren't
*  even allowed to vote and so there's a lot of catching up to do and then women weren't really
*  even in the business place in terms of working alongside men in offices and in in industry when
*  did that start well there was a big push towards that in the period during and after world war two
*  so the trying to stimulate a lot of new industry and get you know just get more people working and
*  producing stuff yeah so what i would say is that men in terms of public positions of leadership
*  have had this massive head start and that we're changing the way we look at what a leader is
*  and that we we used to look at a leader as being like the alpha chimp that uh you know leads us to
*  battle i mean for you go back in time 10 000 years ago that's essentially what a leader was
*  and now we look at a leader as someone who can navigate the treacherous waters of the environment
*  and industry and unions and all the different things that the president has to deal with and
*  it's it's not it doesn't require someone who's male or female it requires someone who again i
*  hate to keep bringing up tulsi goward but i think she's great she seems like a leader right that's
*  what you're looking for you're looking for someone who's going to make good decisions someone with
*  good ethics and good morals that's going to sort of guide you in a way that the the country will
*  be better off with them doing that job than it would be without them so that and but again
*  if i was talking to my kids about it that's it's a complicated discussion and you would you would
*  be a long discussion and i think you'd really have to go back to how different human beings are now
*  than they were even in you know i've talked to my kids about my grandparents my grandparents
*  came over from italy during the early days of the 20th century and they had a hard life and
*  when my grandfather used to talk to me about living on a farm and coming over here from italy and you
*  know how hard it was a struggle and what their life was like it's it's almost unimaginable to
*  my kids today when i describe it to them you know and when i tried to describe what life is like
*  today versus life was like for them in 1920 100 years ago it's it's you're talking about a totally
*  different world and i think that that's what we're dealing with too when it comes to the reason why
*  there has been no woman president it's it's not just that there's never been a woman president
*  because society is weird but it's moving in a better direction it's just been humans are changing
*  we're we're we're changing what we find acceptable we're changing what we find to make sense and what
*  doesn't make sense and we're readjusting things all the time but i think one of the things that
*  you said that is an important point was that if a woman becomes president it does send a message
*  that this is possible and it gives people hope and i think in a lot of ways barack obama did that
*  and when barack obama was in office we're like hey if if people even if people are racist even if
*  they're are racist there's such a small amount that you can get this guy to win the popular vote and
*  become the president of the united states while he's black this is amazing this is amazing for
*  everybody that it shows that a guy who's the son of a single mom can make it as far as the highest
*  office in on the planet earth the elected office the the commander in chief of the greatest army
*  the world has ever known so there's there's great value in image and this is where i think a lot of
*  people are correct in their their anger about trump even people who are trump supporters
*  the value of the the way a person conducts themselves in that highest of high offices
*  it's important for the morale of all of us you know and when someone says ridiculous shit or attacks
*  you know some reporter and the kind of the way he kind of goes about it it's so petty it's so
*  it's so unbecoming of what we would hope for in terms of like someone who gets to that spot we
*  want that person to be better than us we don't want you to do things that we would also do we
*  want you to be better well that's what really scares me about when i see the people who for
*  20 years or however long they've been following politics talk about what matt you republicans i'm
*  talking about now what matters is uh that you've got to you've got to be religious and you've got
*  to pray and you know be god-fearing and you've got to you know divorce is bad and you've got to
*  speak a certain way and all of these different things it was all kind of a ruse right like they
*  never really cared about that stuff it was just that those were the people that were being presented
*  to them for a very long time and then now it's trump and he's the opposite of all of it and
*  they never really cared about that stuff well he represents them in some ways you know you just have
*  to make concessions to be on their side and it's one of the real problems with having two parties
*  right it's like if you're not in the other party you must be in my party if you're not with those
*  people you must be with if you're saying hillary clinton is uh you know she's a problem and you've
*  got to drain the swamp and these career politicians oh well then you must be over here you know if
*  you're if you're against corruption oh well then you must be on my side because i'm against
*  corruption too and you know if we had 10 different parties to choose from it would be way better we
*  would have a way better understanding of the subtleties of human characteristics and what we
*  enjoy and what we don't enjoy what we believe what we don't believe i think a big part of what
*  you're saying when you join a team whether it's the republicans or the democrats you're sort of
*  adopting a predetermined group of opinions like you you you know how to fall in line like you can
*  almost to a person you ask someone if they're are you conservative yes you can almost guess
*  how they're going to feel about the environment or or how they're going to feel about climate
*  change you particularly the freedom of choice that's a big one right like pro-choice if you
*  ask someone if they're a republican boy what percentage you're going to say that they're
*  pro-life it's going to be a high percentage it's going to be a high percentage you know what
*  percentage you're going to be in support of the second amendment it's going to be a very high
*  percentage now if you ask someone who's on the left what do you think about gun control it's
*  going to be a high percentage that are in favor of gun control a favor of maybe doing something
*  different about the second amendment but a high percentage that would you know there's but that
*  would be pro-choice and these lines in the sand you got to wonder how much of these are just adopted
*  like how many how much of these are people who have really analyzed all these issues and come to
*  this objective conclusion based on information and based on their own discussions with other
*  intelligent people and how many people just adopt these positions and i think you're signing on to
*  the package to the orthodoxy in a certain way and one of the crazy things is i get emails from
*  viewers particularly in northern europe who say you know one of the craziest things about american
*  politics when you're in europe is compared to the diversity of parties that they have in many of
*  those countries the standard democrat and the standard republican are really really close like
*  what what are they even really arguing about it's a lot it's a lot of social issues on economic stuff
*  it's a you know is 39.7 top tax rate or 36 top tax rate i mean of course there are democrats who
*  want a much higher top tax there are republicans who want to do a you know do away or really drop
*  it but in a lot of cases a lot of this stuff is created as i don't want to say as theater but it's
*  the creative a package people can sign on to yeah for sure and i think that's one thing that trump
*  has done well ingratiating himself with religious folks because it's never really been his thing and
*  now all of a sudden you know he kind of goes through the motions does all the the god stuff
*  he says all the things when you know you don't believe it for a second right what what santa
*  claus what do you what do you mean what do you believe if i believe he's become religion yeah
*  religious rather one of my favorite interviews was this one guy who was a preacher he's one of
*  those televangelists and he was talking about trump and someone trying to bring up trump's
*  past he goes that was before he was born again and everybody was cheering yes that was before
*  he was born yeah and their their concept is completely absolve someone that would be nice
*  if you could just how many times can you be born again can you fuck up a gang of times and be just
*  be reborn every time with a fresh slate that'd be very beneficial yeah i don't know what the
*  answer is to that that's a concept that's a great idea like i would love if i you know like you're
*  a man i feel real haunted by my mistakes son just raise your hand we're gonna take those mistakes
*  away you you have done them but you're free do you know who general butt naked is you know general
*  butt naked is no this is uh the best example that you're ever going to hear general butt naked was
*  he was a uh in the civil war in liberia and he was known for getting buck naked taking off all his
*  clothes and going to war so he would go to war and you know he's killed many many many people and
*  on video on vice back when they had the vice guide to travel on video he was talking about what they
*  would do if they captured children from the opposing army that they would cut their heart out
*  and eat pieces of their heart he was talking about this murdering children and eating their heart
*  then he found jesus and they absolved him of everything and now he's a preacher so general
*  butt naked is now a preacher and he runs around and you know he's killed who knows how many
*  thousands of people and eaten kids hearts and they're like but that was before now he's a man of jesus
*  pretty amazing it's a great it's a great clause if you want someone to join up
*  oh my goodness yeah have you seen the um the the preachers and the televangelists selling the
*  coronavirus stuff either like you send them money and they'll pray it away or like the silver stuff
*  and all of these different things yeah we were watching that one guy who was blowing was it
*  what's his name again canath copeland that same guy you know he's the same guy that that lady came
*  up to him and asked him about flying public and he was like you know saying that there's demons on
*  those planes are you calling poor people demons i never said that and he got crazy with her who
*  that just that video alone of him and his wild eyes pointing at her is so goddamn terrifying
*  yeah it's it's dark all that stuff is dark it's uh but again it's what you talked about where it's
*  lack of information combined with a desire for some general better health yeah but instead of
*  going out and exercising and getting some sunlight it's maybe you know a silver toothpaste is going
*  to prevent the virus or something like that it's crazy it is crazy well there's also uh obviously
*  these are the same people jim baker was one of them right who was selling survival slop he was
*  selling these buckets of survival food that you could actually use as a the base of your table
*  like you don't know where to put this stuff and he had tables where he had like the tabletop of
*  sitting on these survival buckets and he's selling this shit and and he's even eating it on the show
*  like very good like it is one of the televangelists are one of the very weirdest uh elements of society
*  where we are we're allowing people to just lie like clearly lie but we feel like the lie is so
*  obvious that you have to be so dumb to believe them i can't help you and this is i i made this
*  analogy recently because i was talking about youtube censorship and how youtube has decided
*  that they're going to pull down videos from doctors who have uh different opinions on how
*  to handle the coronavirus and criticisms of how things are and i'm like it's really interesting
*  that they make that line that that's the line that doctors practicing physicians they'll pull
*  their video down but people talk about the flat earth they'll leave that up because it's it's like
*  it's so dumb it's like ah you can leave that up that one's that one's so dumb you have to be a
*  moron to think the earth's hollow and that there's aliens living inside it traveling around on laser
*  beams there's videos that say that they'll leave those up and they'll leave televangelists up but
*  then it gets to these doctors that are saying we're looking at statistics this is the deaths
*  this is the deaths uh in terms of age groups and this is why it's not nearly as dangerous as we
*  thought it was and these quarantines are not the the best way to handle it we think there's better
*  they'll take that video down even if it's someone who's saying rational things and i yeah i don't
*  think that's smart i don't think that's a healthy way to handle things i don't think it's good for
*  the debate i think in fact it strengthens the resolve of the people on the other side that
*  watch those videos and some of those points resonate with those people i think that's not
*  the way to handle it i don't think removing those videos is the way to handle it i think the way to
*  handle it is let other people with opposing points of view put their videos up and let people discuss
*  and debate and see which one makes more sense to you and usually the weight of the information
*  overwhelms the bullshit and at least with most people i don't understand why it's okay to leave
*  some obviously full of shit videos up but take down things that are very very controversial but
*  debatable okay so this this now gets into that part of your episode with bridget from over the
*  weekend that i saw where you basically accurately characterized the the view that i had last time i
*  was on with you about the regulation of social media yeah um so first just to play devil's
*  advocate just for a second on why do you leave up flat earth but take down um the you know
*  coronavirus videos that youtube or whoever disagrees with one can make an argument that
*  there is no real action someone would take because they believe the earth is flat that would endanger
*  others i mean i guess you might try to go to the edge and see if you fall off or something right
*  like but there's no actionable thing for the most part that flat earth belief that's a good point
*  whereas if this disinformation about so like i'll give you one there was a video i saw about
*  coronavirus where there was a doctor saying you know these quarantines are dangerous because
*  if you're not exposed to bacteria your um immune system will be out of practice essentially and
*  it's not it's going to shut down it's not going to work as well and then another doctor another
*  youtube guy who has a youtube channel did a counterpoint where he said he's talking about
*  the hygienic theory but he has it backwards it is true that if you are never exposed to dirt
*  and bacteria and whatever it will impact your immune system but it's actually the opposite
*  is what happens it's that because you're not regularly exposed to things your immune system
*  will overreact and it'll start attacking things that aren't really a threat okay so what's the
*  harm i guess right like there was a video where these doctors identified what they think is the
*  problem with the quarantine and then another doctor can i pause you for a second there i think it's
*  both things though i think it's actually been proven that yeah that does happen where your
*  immune system overreacts to people that don't get exposed to enough but i think there's also
*  it's also been proven that people that are around a lot of different people and constantly exposed
*  to people have stronger immune systems because of that that it does get practiced and it does
*  get strengthened by exposure oh yeah i think that's what the the sort of fact check was saying
*  which is it's completely true that exposing kids you know to the world out there is good
*  but that what is being asserted will happen from staying home for two months is is both wrong and
*  it wouldn't happen in two months anyway like the idea that it weakens immunity yeah i was wondering
*  about that whether or not it was like a cardiovascular system like that it only responds to the level of
*  work that it needs to to do like your cardiovascular system you know if you run if you take some time
*  off boy it slacks off really quickly it would be a real shame if that was the case with the immune
*  system i don't think it is but i mean i guess the point i was trying to make was if you there are a
*  lot of people who are understandably frustrated by what's going on and they're looking for any
*  excuse to just let it rip so to speak and go and do whatever and so i think that the playdevil's
*  advocate there is a different level of risk from allowing some of this disinformation to be
*  propagated that doesn't exist with leaving flat earth up that's a very good point very good point
*  but but that being said you know we last time we talked we had this conversation about like okay
*  if a platform gets to a certain size does it not kind of enter some new space yeah where you need
*  someone to establish some guidelines can i pause you real quick one of the problems with this
*  argument though is that particularly like those doctors in bakersfield they weren't spreading
*  disinformation they were basically spreading the actual facts of fatalities and age groups and and
*  you know they just had a different perspective interpretation well not even the different
*  interpretation because they're basically just going over the statistics but they had a different
*  viewpoint of how they should move forward and they were also discussing things like
*  furloughed doctors and nurses because hospitals are no longer doing elective surgery so and then
*  many hospitals are on the verge of bankruptcy which apparently is true yeah the the problem is
*  that's not disinformation and so if you're saying that if giving people disinformation makes them
*  make poor choices and they could be putting themselves at risk or putting loved ones at risk
*  because of that yes okay i'm with you yeah i agree but this isn't disinformation this is actual
*  information it's just information with a different perspective other than what we're getting which is
*  only one point of view from the world health organization and people who subscribe to those
*  ideas so it's not it's not a lie but i think your point of if someone believes in the flat earth
*  there's no harm in that that's true so if someone believes in pizza gate and they think that there's
*  kids being held in a basement somewhere and they go and shoot up the store then it is a problem
*  right and though that kind of a video i could understand where someone would say hey you know
*  that shouldn't be up there because this is bullshit and this is this is what gets caused from that i
*  don't think it's the same argument when we're all trying to figure out what's going on with a medical
*  situation and two practicing physicians two actual medical doctors are talking about their perspective
*  on this virus so i don't think they're really on the same line yeah so i totally agree that these
*  are not all equivalent situations yeah um for the purposes of you know our conversation about like
*  who what regulation should be in place right who gets to regulate or this sort of thing
*  the the point that i had made last time we talked about this was not necessarily that i'm in favor
*  or against having some kind of infrastructure that says here's how a social network has to operate
*  youtube twitter whatever we could talk about that and i'm glad to my argument last time we talked
*  was i don't know what the legal case is how do you define legally what it is that is supposed to
*  happen is it like what would be the legal framework for that and there's also a double standard
*  element of it because there's a lot of really really loud right wingers who are saying the left
*  is being propped up on social media and the right is being suppressed to put it very simply right
*  and they're calling for regulation they're against new regulation on gun safety they're against
*  business regulation they're against stay at home or etc now they want to regulate tweets like that's
*  where now they want regulation that seems extremely cynical and hypocritical to me
*  but we don't even necessarily have to dig into that to think about like okay if we regulate it
*  how do we regulate it who gets to decide is where you start i think we're dealing with a thing that's
*  very similar to what we talked about earlier the founding fathers who set up this country in the
*  1700s had no idea what 2020 was going to be like and i think when you're talking about freedom of
*  speech it's like do you still have freedom of speech if you could just talk and you can't tweet
*  well i guess you do right do you still have freedom to get the word out well you do but you don't have
*  freedom like you or i do or you could tweet or you could make a youtube video and who gets to have
*  that and is that an essential service is that a thing like the post office or a thing like the
*  electricity and the utilities is it a essential an essential thing i think one could make the
*  argument that in 2020 it's used by so many people to convey so much information and it's so significant
*  that i believe it is an essential thing and i think that just banning someone because you don't like
*  what they say or you don't like how they say it i don't think that's a solution nor do i think
*  there's a clear solution because i think that if you have someone who is hateful and is doxing
*  people and insulting people and stalking people online and saying horrible things that's not good
*  either right there's there's laws about that in person you can't harass people in person why can
*  you harass people online why can you put up your address and have a bunch of people send terrible
*  things to your house what why is that okay well it shouldn't be okay either we need to figure out
*  what's okay and what's not okay and i think one of the problems with isolating like if tech i think
*  tech people and people that whether it's google or apple and you've made a really good argument that
*  they may appear left socially but they absolutely operate right when it comes to finance when it
*  comes to their business i think that is true but i think that when you're dealing with the ability
*  to discuss things and you might say that your perspective is the one that you want to hear
*  because you're a left-wing person and these are your beliefs but you're isolating the the whole
*  other team from being a part of that conversation and maybe they have something you want to hear and
*  maybe they don't have anything you want to hear but to not allow them to communicate you are alienating
*  a giant chunk of the population and if someone gets to a prominent level where they're they're
*  communicating a certain way and you just decide that that certain way is unacceptable and you
*  kick them off you don't just kick them off you also silence all the other people that are along
*  or aligned with them because they have similar ideas and they don't want to speak out either
*  when you when you ban james woods you don't just ban james woods you ban a lot of other people from
*  saying something they might be furious about you know the the russian investigation whatever they
*  want to express themselves and they they they panic they get scared they they worry that they're
*  going to get that censorship that's a form of censorship and i think these companies i don't
*  blame them because i don't think they had any idea what they were going to become and i think they're
*  all adjusting along the way i think when twitter was first when twitter first came out you remember
*  that like you would write at david pacman is going to the movies you're like you like you know at joe
*  rogan just had a great pizza that's what you did i mean it wasn't this thing where you got to
*  express yourself in 240 whatever characters and we're in a different world now and i think this
*  different world needs some different examination about what the ability to communicate online is
*  and this is a an important point because alex jones made some crazy video after our conversation
*  that i had with him yesterday where he was saying that i'm going to war against censorship and a
*  war against youtube that's i'm not doing any of those things i made this deal with spotify
*  because spotify yeah okay i made the deal with spotify because it's a great company and it's a
*  great deal and i'm excited to be in a partnership with a company as opposed to like a company that
*  i just put my stuff up on their platform whether it's apple or youtube i don't like that youtube
*  censors things i don't like that they do that like with those doctors in bakersfield but i'm
*  not at war with them i'm not at war with anybody and i'm not okay i don't i don't envy them their
*  position i don't think it's smart to censor practicing doctors when they have differing
*  opinions i think we need to find out who's right and i think the way you find out who's right is
*  you get people who are experts and they disagree there's nobel laureates out there and i've watched
*  several videos that are talking about this lockdown and that it's not a good idea there's people that
*  believe in herd mentality versus immunizations and or vaccines and i don't know who's right and i
*  would like them to all be able to discuss it equally and openly that said i don't envy twitter
*  i don't envy youtube i don't envy any of these people the idea of trying to manage this in real
*  time while it explodes and takes over the way human beings communicate over a period of a decade just
*  like that that's so instantaneous and mistakes have been made and in my opinion when it comes
*  to the way things are censored and the way it's it these mistakes particularly on twitter far
*  favor the left and they're they're not balanced like this some horrible things that people on the
*  left say about people on the right and it's nothing it gets just gets washed away but when
*  the people do it who are on the right about people on the left they get banned it's not fair and when
*  things aren't fair one side has a better argument that they're being censored and that there's some
*  sort of a conspiracy and it divides people even more it strengthens the hate instead of instead
*  of like i think most people the vast majority 70 80 percent are reasonable people that you could
*  have a conversation with if you were in front of them one on one when they don't feel like they're
*  a part of the conversation or when they speak their side and their stuff gets deleted or removed
*  or put into some you know some shadow ban category it's it's fucking infuriating for people and it's
*  not good for all of us as a community and i think that is the burden that these places like youtube
*  or or or twitter they they have to shoulder this burden and um i don't know how to do it i don't
*  know i mean you know republicans have one perspective there's many people like yourself
*  that have the perspective like listen it's their company should not they be able to make their own
*  rules i think they're too big i think they're too big for that now and i think that it's it's in
*  this position where it literally is a part of who we are as as human beings the ability to express
*  ideas and communicate is so critical right now and as we're evolving and as we're are we're evolving
*  our culture and our civilization discourse is so important it's it's it's it's a giant part of being
*  a human being in 2020 and i don't think it should be just flippantly removed from people so my
*  personal view is very similar to yours in terms of you know sort of like illegal content and really
*  very specific things my instinct is leave it up and let the the sort of uh let people evaluate it
*  let people publish counterpoints that that's my my personal view now the the conservative view on
*  this is you know if you if this cake baker doesn't want to bake a cake because of who you want to
*  marry you don't do anything to the baker you just go and you know the market will if there's a demand
*  for those types of cakes for those types of weddings bakers will enter the market and that's it
*  if you apply that here and we'll get to the differences in a second if you apply that here
*  if the james woods's want to say stuff and a whole bunch of people want to hear that stuff
*  why don't they just go and make their platform and bring everybody over it sounds like a great
*  business right yeah it does sound great business it's way harder to do way harder to do than just
*  do it i mean to say why don't you make another twitter well there would be a thousand twitters
*  it's obviously very difficult no one's ever been able to do it it's not something that's
*  it's you're talking about something that takes an enormous amount of resources it's it's not that
*  yes it's not that simple it's not that simple but everybody already does but everybody already does
*  use twitter so i think the question really is does twitter have a responsibility for fair and
*  even treatment you know and i i'm sure you've seen some of those uh james veritas uh james o'keefe
*  rather project veritas videos where they have secret cameras filming executives talking about
*  how to censor conservative people um i've seen a little bit of it what what i do remember is from
*  the um a planned parenthood era where what they published was pretty dramatically dishonest from
*  what i recall but i've not seen the one you're referring to specifically that was a long time
*  ago was it how long ago was that the planned parenthood stuff was it five years oh are you
*  talking about the acorn stuff the uh the stuff where the they brought in a pimp to try to get
*  money uh for opening up a brothel it's been so long that the details escape me but i remember
*  that there i remember that incident i've not really seen anything recently that they've done
*  whenever you have deceptive editing you know the problem is even if in the future you're don't you
*  don't do that anymore it's like everyone's always going to remember that you did do something yes
*  you did do something that wasn't straightforward cut and dry no emotion journalism just here are
*  the facts planned parenthood awarded two million dollars in lawsuit over secret videos interesting
*  that's not good yeah that was that was that's that's my uh big memory when you mentioned that
*  yeah that organization but so i think that let's say we agree about something needs to be done
*  once you're at a certain level you enter a new category and some kind of regulation has to be
*  done who does the regulation when you look at uh redistricting for example this has been like a
*  multi-decade thing where when republicans are in power they draw the districts in a way that's
*  favorable to them democrats are in power they take the opportunity to redraw districts that
*  are favorable to them you have these ideas of okay we'll have a commission with three democrats and
*  three republicans and together they'll figure out how the districts could be drawn fairly
*  how do you apply that what the lesson from that how do you apply it to does the trump administration
*  decide what kind of content must be left up versus what can be removed but then that
*  administration gets replaced now the next administration says here's how twitter is
*  supposed to operate like how do you do it it's a really good question it's a really hard question
*  that's what i'm saying i don't i don't envy those people um you know i really like jack dorsi as a
*  person i really enjoy talking to him i think he's a very thoughtful guy and in in discussing this
*  with him both on the show and off the show you know they they don't really know exactly how to
*  handle these things so they don't really know what the perfect solution is and he's even proposed
*  a wild west twitter and then a twitter that's under some sort of moderation um and i don't know
*  where they stand on that right now but that was something that they were he was actively
*  bringing up like let's have a twitter where anything goes you could yeah like reddit in
*  the early days you could do whatever the fuck you wanted versus what they're what they have now um
*  but here's another example when you when a person gets so big like trump you can get away you could
*  do shit on twitter that there's no way you could do right like have you seen the recent thing where
*  he's accusing joe scarborough of uh possibly being a part of a murder or something like that
*  i saw that he's bringing up i mean apparently totally i don't know the exact details of the
*  story but it been investigated had nothing to do with it it was just somebody worked with and and
*  trump is he's putting out this thing particularly just to try to target joe scarborough get his fans
*  to go nutty and fuck with him you know and that's a weird way of that that's a right wing guy who is
*  literally the top right wing guy right so yeah right wing bias doesn't seem to apply totally
*  you know negative bias when it when it comes to the president and the president when you get to
*  a certain level like you could just do shit like that like you could just threaten north korea
*  like you could say we have the best missiles we'll fuck you up like he could tweet that he could
*  tweet hey hey buddy uh i'm glad you fake your death and i know you're still alive but i just
*  want you know we got the best missiles and we'll fuck you up have he tweeted that like whoa but
*  this is not really uh unique the twitter in the sense that if you look at our justice system
*  there's sort of like the justice system for the elites and then for other people to focus on
*  street crime instead of white collar crime i mean this this exists in a lot of different places what
*  kind of really big business get away with versus what kind of small business sometimes get away
*  with sure so i don't think that's different what one of the things i'm thinking about is what's the
*  main point of twitter like twitter is a publicly traded corporation so at this point is it fair to
*  say that the main point of twitter is to be profitable and and deliver a return to shareholders
*  because if it is all the stuff we're talking about about how we would like to see it operate
*  is sort of irrelevant because they now have this fiduciary responsibility to just make money
*  right what do you think twitter's worth like like someone if someone wanted to come over and buy it
*  what if the government bought twitter and just applied the first amendment to twitter what if
*  the government said listen you guys are kicking ass great job however you're basically a public
*  utility for communication of ideas and it's imperative that for liberty and for the ability
*  for people to have free speech everyone has to have access to this and so when you go to maybe
*  it's like one of those things you go to jail for a horrible felony you lose your ability to vote
*  maybe you go to jail for something you lose your ability to tweet you know i mean could it be 300
*  billion i have no idea i wonder how much it is i mean how much they're spending on these goddamn
*  stimulus packages i wonder if they you probably buy it cheap right now too i mean i don't think
*  twitter really makes money either i don't think it makes money you know i think twitter is one of
*  those weird situations where it's worth something but i don't i don't know if it actually does
*  i don't i don't think it's in the in the profitable area right i don't think it's i don't think it's
*  making is it didn't you when we talked jamie and i talked about this fairly recently yeah it's
*  complicated you know some things make sense like google makes sense right they use google ads they
*  make a shitload of money youtube makes sense it's profitable it all makes sense twitter's like where
*  you make where's the money coming from like you're it's so valuable but and it's so it's such a useful
*  tool but how does how do they make money i mean so literally there there are ads on twitter as
*  well right boosted posts promote advertisement etc i have no idea how much money they're making
*  from that versus what is the value of the user base wasn't there a point recently where a very
*  conservative investor bought a giant chunk of twitter and was thinking about kicking out jack
*  dorsey wasn't that something that was brought up really recently no i don't know about that
*  you remember that jamie that was a that was a situation right once but i don't know if
*  that's how it went down like fairly recently someone just bought a controlling stake or a large stake
*  look man i just think is there is there anyone you would trust to regulate twitter and youtube
*  and facebook like who would you who would do it oh that's a good question i don't think it should
*  be one person either i think it's also like president like being the president i don't think
*  she should be the president of twitter that's i really think it might be wise for all of us
*  to consider it like a public utility you would socialize twitter yeah i'd give it to bernie
*  that's incredible i think something that has that kind of power when it comes to expression
*  it's a it's valuable for human beings i would never want to take it away from the people that
*  own it obviously but i just think as a concept that we should consider that what we have here
*  with something like twitter or even maybe there's a good argument for youtube as well
*  that what these these new abilities to express yourself are they're they're incredibly important
*  in terms of the process of our culture the process of going over ideas and evolving those ideas
*  there's no better way to do that than open communication there's no better open communication
*  than twitter and youtube like in terms of regular people you can start a youtube video right now on
*  your phone i could just set the phone up here press record and start talking and then upload
*  it and bam my thoughts could be available to anybody and i think that's so valuable it's so
*  it's so important in terms of our ability to go back and forth with ideas it's and and we're
*  changing those ideas like obviously the way we thought about life in 1960 is very different
*  than the way we think about life today and a lot of that comes from discourse a lot of that comes
*  from discussion and the evolution of these ideas jamie has something hold on yeah i think there
*  was a potential corporate takeover that tried to maybe happen but they made an agreement
*  twitter reaches deal with activist fund that wanted jack dorsey out they made a deal they met on
*  fuck island and they all uh no well listen i mean i i couldn't agree more strongly with you about
*  the importance of these platforms my entire business is built on them i mean i'd have no
*  business if it weren't for this i think i think the difficulties are what what are the standards
*  that are applied and i also like i don't want to sound like one of these free market right wingers
*  but what's the legal bait you would have to first establish a legal basis you would have to establish
*  law that says once you have this number of users or this number of page views or whatever you now
*  are bound by this new set of of laws and that is complex to say the least it's very complex it's
*  very complex and i don't i don't i have no idea how one would even begin and how long the process
*  of figuring out what the rules should be how long it would take before we all agreed on that but and
*  i think that would be another great argument for the ability to express yourself because in forming
*  these laws we would want to hear all perspectives perspectives from people that have been harmed by
*  social media and you know and twitter mobs and shit like that and what should be done about that
*  and the same thing can be said about youtube as well i think but one thing that no one can deny
*  is how significant these these tools are whether it's twitter or youtube or you know any new one
*  that comes out whether it's tiktok or whatever they're they're really powerful there's there's
*  something to them that's unprecedented in the history of humanity you know and we can't just
*  apply the old rules to them just doesn't make sense i don't think it's good for us what and when i
*  have talked to conservative people about this they're i mean if you're not accustomed to it
*  if you're not accustomed to feeling like you're censored and you're angry you don't know what it's
*  like until you're around these people and then you see their frustration and their anger and
*  their fury at twitter for for doing that and for for censoring voices that are similar to their
*  perspectives instead of just letting the process take place like it's always has been it's just in
*  a different form the process of being able to talk through ideas one of the risks of this is
*  that once you assert a right to a platform to exist on a platform that supersedes twitter or
*  youtube's ability to say for whatever reason because they're a company that can have terms
*  and conditions and they say we just don't want this if if youtube was determined that they don't
*  want gardening content on youtube i can't think of a legal reason why they can't say no gardening
*  content i mean as long as they're not by virtue of banning gardening content you know banning
*  people on the basis of membership in some protected class or something like that right like if you are
*  if all gardeners were of a certain race right you could make the case that by proxy by banning
*  gardening content they're banning people of a certain race i don't know how you prevent that
*  from then being applied elsewhere like what other platforms would people have a right to and this
*  gets to speakers who say i was censored because a certain school wouldn't have me to speak there
*  it's like well hold on you don't have a right to speak at any particular school schools can make
*  decisions about what they want and what they don't want as long as you're not being discriminated
*  against based on your identity is it not sort of the same thing with youtube like what what is the
*  legal basis for saying they can no longer make these decisions well it's a big there's a big
*  difference first of all a school is a single destination that's a physical place right so
*  you can decide you know this is a conservative school we don't want people coming over here and
*  talking about this or this is a very progressive school we don't want to have someone from the kkk
*  come here and tell us how all races are not equal that that's a very different thing when you're
*  when you're doing something like youtube the real question is is it just a business is it just a
*  business it's owned by people and they have the right to do whatever they want or is at least i
*  mean you know you're on youtube you're you're called a partner right they refer to you as a
*  partner david packman is a youtube partner right but you you know and in some ways you are right
*  because you put out a lot of content you're huge you put out a lot of content and that content is
*  an integral part of like look they have a uh progressive news sort of uh empire really when
*  you really stop and look about and homemade shows like yours um you know like uh there's there's
*  many many of them that you could watch uh kyle kalinsky and jimmy door and all these folks are
*  doing these shows uh basically from scratch right there's no large production company behind it or
*  any of the things that so they've they've they've got this whole empire of you're a part of it you're
*  part of this whole news empire and there's many categories but what they are is not as simple as
*  just a business they are a business but what they all are as well with you know all the executives
*  all the people that youtube as an entity is one of the most powerful tools for expression
*  the world has ever known so if you have this incredibly powerful tool for expression
*  at what point in time or when you when are you able to deny people the use of that thing and why
*  you know and what is freedom of expression if it doesn't apply to these new tools what is the first
*  amendment if it doesn't apply to these new tools if someone can come along and say hey i know you're
*  a doctor and a practicing physician but i'm 28 and i live in palo alto and i say fuck you because i
*  believe in the who and i don't believe in you and i'm just going to delete your video and it seems
*  to me that i followed the rules that youtube has set forth about uh you know if you don't agree
*  with the who and you're giving some sort of contrary coronavirus information delete and
*  i don't i don't think that's wise i don't think that's wise i think that's a very very complicated
*  issue that should be debated publicly and discussed publicly whether or not these people
*  have the right to be heard and this is just one example that we keep bringing up but there's
*  many different kinds of things that fit along those lines you know when you just want to ban
*  all conspiracy theories air quotes the problem with conspiracy theories is first of all the word
*  as a pejorative was created to try to steer people away from the kennedy assassination which is like
*  one of the greatest conspiracies of all time some some people did that whether it was lee harvey
*  oswald by himself i highly doubt it i think there's probably other people involved i think it was a
*  conspiracy so call it i don't know enough about this i know too much about it i know too much
*  about it we we could spend the rest of the day discussing that let's not but when you mention
*  the first amendment though i don't think the first amendment is in play here because you're not
*  talking about the government when you talk about youtube well i think we should revise the first
*  amendment this is what i'm saying i think okay freedom of expression used to be you i can't
*  infringe upon your right to express yourself but that was like yelling on a fucking apple box you
*  know like when when that was created there really was other than writing something in print or
*  yelling something in a public square there were there weren't a lot of ways to express yourself
*  now the most powerful way the world has ever known has come along to express yourself and that's
*  social media that's youtube and twitter and what what are those things and how much of a responsibility
*  do the people who own those things have to adhere to the fundamental ideas that got us to this
*  republic in the first place and i i think there's a real good argument that they're more powerful
*  than simply just a company that they have this amazing ability to get information out and that
*  this is i mean it should certainly be profitable i don't i don't deny them their profitability
*  i mean they've made an amazing thing they've created something that we all benefit from they
*  should make a shitload of money but i think we should really be careful about who gets to use
*  this and who doesn't get to use this just because someone says something that you disagree with that
*  get other people to also agree with them doesn't mean they should be shut down if you don't agree
*  with what they're saying if you don't like what they're saying you probably shouldn't view it
*  or listen to it or read it you should probably find something else to or examine why you don't
*  like it and this is where thinking comes in this is where critical thinking and discussion comes in
*  and this is a huge part of managing a community of managing a civilization so the one of the
*  biggest parts of managing this civilization this kind of discourse is limited and it's limited
*  and censored and people can arbitrarily decide to just remove you from it do you know uh the
*  zooby story do you know what happened with zooby uh i only vaguely zooby is uh he's an entertainer
*  rapper out of the uk great guy wonderful guy that doesn't even swear very religious guy he was in a
*  discussion with someone on twitter didn't know if that was a a male or a female or what they
*  prefer to be mentioned as what their pronouns are but they said i bet i have sex with more women
*  than you and he writes okay dude that's all he writes and he gets suspended from twitter for any
*  he asked them to review it they reviewed it and upheld it they're like yes this is a good
*  suspension you can't just say okay dude to someone that kind of stuff is crazy right you know the i'm
*  sure you know the megan murphy story where uh she had she said she's in an argument with someone
*  over trans rights versus radical feminist rights and you know she's what you call a trans exclusionary
*  radical feminist and she says a man is never a woman this is what she said she doesn't believe
*  that transgender people should be able to have a say in in traditional women's issues and so she
*  gets banned for life for that she she basically said an opinion on something a man is never a
*  woman though they asked her to take it down she took a screenshot of it and then put the screenshot
*  up she took it down and she's obviously being rebellious but should that keep her from being
*  able to use that platform no no you should be able to debate that statement you should be able to
*  refute that if you want to be angry at her tell her what you think tell her what's wrong with it
*  tell her what's hurtful about it tell but you banning someone for that it sends a ripple of
*  self-censorship that changes the discourse and makes you feel like you're oppressed makes you
*  feel like the overlords who watch over the social media platforms you know they have the final say
*  in power and it might not align with my ideas and there's nothing i can do about it yeah my again my
*  view personally essentially lines up with yours in terms of my tolerance of of speech i still think
*  that there's a huge issue and hypocrisy here where you have large swaths of people that are only in
*  favor of this type of regulation oh you're right because they believe and it benefits them based
*  on their biases and they don't want the regulation when it comes to like i said gun control business
*  everything else there's another hypocrisy which i think is important when you talk about net
*  neutrality there's this debate is the internet so necessary and ubiquitous now that it should be
*  like the phone and like electricity a utility just a straight-up utility yeah if you believe
*  youtube which is a piece of the internet should warrant this degree of additional regulation
*  how can you not say that the infrastructure that carries it obviously should be democratized and
*  treated like a public utility and yet you have a ton of people who want to regulate tweets but they
*  don't think that at this point the internet is so important that it should be a public utility how
*  do you square that that's a really good question you know i think there there's a way to balance
*  it out where uh everyone has access to it but if you want really hardcore high bandwidth access
*  it's very expensive you pay for it differently sort of like how in places that have public
*  health care they have they have the option for a private specialist it's really good at certain
*  surgeries uh something along those lines that you could you could pay for it as long as everybody
*  has access to it but you don't have access to it the way that maybe say a business would need like
*  a really fat pipe with a lot of bandwidth it's a good question though and but but i think you're
*  what you nailed earlier about uh discussions for regulation is so important because it does
*  highlight the hypocrisy that people have with ideas that are controversial and one of the things
*  that they feel when it comes to whether it's uh the first amendment the second amendment whatever
*  it is they they want it this is what's written down it's in we're not changing it it's that way
*  forever whether it's the 14th amendment whatever the fuck it is pick an amendment they just nope
*  nope nope written down that's it that's what it is and you're right that when it comes to something
*  like social media where there isn't really a precedent now they want regulation they want the
*  government to come in step because it doesn't favor what their ideas are i i i see that there's
*  some hypocrisy in that but i also favor regulation so i i favor in that regard or favor regulation i
*  favor a regulation in a lot of ways i think this whole i mean i've had these discussions with many
*  people like let the market decide i'm like that's okay a lot of people get fucked over when you just
*  let the market decide that eventually things even out and sometimes maybe not even cliche it's almost
*  a cliche at this point because even a lot of times that people say that they don't really want
*  a free market right they want a free market until who could have seen the pandemic coming let's give
*  cash to all of these 10 types of businesses all of a sudden and i'm not saying i'm against that but
*  i'm saying let's instead of pretending to be for one thing until you clearly need a different one
*  let's recognize these systems are more fragile than we believe them to be yes and let's set that up
*  all along to prevent something so acute from going wrong yes yes yes very good point and i
*  think this is what we talked about earlier that we hope happens out of this pandemic and so we
*  have a greater understanding of some things are out of our control and we we should be prepared
*  as a community as a large community we should be prepared to help each other and um and i think
*  that can be done i really do and i think we could shift in that direction and that's what i really
*  enjoyed about some of the concepts that uh andrew yang had about universal basic income like saying
*  like look we need to take into consideration that this change is probably going to hit us and it's
*  going to hit us hard and we got to be prepared and you know the way he called it i believe he
*  referred to as a freedom dividend and so he gave it a different spin you know this is you this is
*  something you earned by being a part of this country like we're going to have to adjust uh
*  some of these hard line values that we have in terms of what people are responsible for and what
*  people aren't my argument has always been you can't i hate that pull yourself up by your
*  bootstrap shit i hate it it drives me crazy because not everybody is in the same situation
*  from the start you don't come out you don't you don't you're not born into the same family
*  you're not born to the same community you're not born to the same stresses and troubles and
*  crime and gangs and this and that and abuse and sexual abuse and physical abuse and
*  it's not an even playing field it's just not so this all this you know you need to get your
*  shit together like no we need to help people get their shit together and we need to figure out how
*  do we if we looked at the number one problem and this is again going back to bernie sanders
*  the number one problem uh with people that are young that are coming up is is having opportunity
*  having health care having safety having having a place where you could actually have a fighting
*  chance to thrive and my perspective is if you're a person that thinks america as a team that we are
*  america and i'm proud to be an american well what's the best way to strengthen in america
*  less losers less people that have a shitty hand of cards from the jump that's what we should be
*  concentrating on more than anything you know there's a number that a corresponding number as
*  unemployment rises the there's more people dying because of heart attacks suicide depression all
*  these different factors you can apply that to poverty you can apply that to despair you can
*  apply that to growing up in an environment where it seems like there's no hope you know you can
*  only ask someone to hold their breath and swim for so long before they just want to give up
*  and that's what you see with a lot of people in our culture today in our society in these inner
*  cities that's not addressed every people one after the other people run for office and they
*  don't address those things especially run for the top office bernie was the only one who was he was
*  the only one who was addressing it so that was why i was for bernie sanders he he to me represented
*  some revolutionary change in our our perception of what what our society is and what our obligations
*  are as good citizens yeah deaths of despair i think is it's a category that encompasses uh all
*  of that stuff so i i was just reminded of this because we went back to bernie so are are you
*  voting biden or are you voting trump or do you know what you're doing i don't know what i'm doing
*  man i i think i'm probably going to vote independent um i think california is going to go it's going to
*  go democrat no matter what you know yeah um who knows if he if biden has some lady who's badass
*  who tells him sit down shut the fuck up i got this um maybe maybe i'll be more inclined to uh
*  vote for him based on his vice president choice i don't know you know i feel that like from my
*  perspective 70 percent of of what you seem to be highlighting with bernie maybe 60 60 70 percent
*  you would get with biden i'm very cynical i'm very cynical yeah i'm very cynical about that i think
*  so many of these choices like even just having a female president they're done for perceptions
*  and they're done to he's he's appealing to the people that want him in power in the first place
*  those old guard democrats you know and the the the business of the the democratic party it's a
*  it's a giant business the whole thing is getting control and you know there's some social carrots
*  that are dangling out there at the end of the stick that we would like to think that you know
*  having someone in there that's going to vote left in terms of supreme court justices and things on
*  those lines would help us all tremendously but i don't know i'm i'm cynical the way the way this
*  whole bernie sanders thing went down i'm cynical about that how they all dropped out right before
*  super tuesday and it was bernie versus biden and you know there's there's so much of it that i felt
*  like there's so much coordinated shit that he had to endure from the dnc in 2016 that he's enduring
*  he was enduring similar shit running into the 2020 election i don't um i don't have a lot of faith in
*  the same standard institutions changing things for the better i just i just don't have a lot of faith
*  i think isn't that um i mean i guess i don't know i'm thinking like i don't have kids but if
*  thinking if i did all like frustrations with the dnc the coordinated dropouts all of that stuff
*  it's just for me so simple where like if trump gets to pick the next supreme court justice that
*  could affect your kids kids in horrible ways whereas if biden gets to pick the next supreme
*  court judge like that alone and you know these other 250 judges that trump selected that we
*  don't really hear about but that make way more decisions like climate aside i think biden you
*  would agree with more on tax policy i think you'd be more with you know all these different issues
*  like just the judges part would impact society for 20 30 years and that just seems so huge
*  it would be huge yeah i mean and we should probably consider whether or not that makes sense
*  whether or not supreme court justices should be lifetime appointees um does that make sense
*  and should it be so significant that you're willing to ignore everything else just because
*  you want someone in the supreme court that aligns with your politics because they're not going to
*  be there for a couple of years they're going to be there until essentially they either retire or die
*  that's that's a weird thing to have it's a weird amount of it's almost like there's something that
*  happens to professors when they get tenure where they they can kind of get away with wacky shit
*  and do whatever they want it gets real weird and i think that whenever you get people in a position
*  where they don't ever have to worry about getting fired i mean obviously a scandal they murder
*  somebody or something but they're they're appointed for life you know i think and they have immense
*  power it's just it i don't know i'm not obviously i'm not a law student or a lawyer but is that
*  really the best way to do it it doesn't yeah i mean i i tend to favor term limits for supreme
*  court justices the counterpoint which is not a crazy counterpoint is if they know that eventually
*  on the tail end of this thing they've got to go and get a job it could influence their rulings
*  in cases right if you you will very often see cases where it could be dealing with an industry
*  that would be the likely industry you would work at after you leave the supreme court yeah that
*  would be something you would want to eliminate but but i see both sides of it i see both sides
*  of it too it seems to me like also look to have a president that gets to choose
*  the supreme court judges it's like all the other shit he has to do too that that should be the
*  only job he does if he was just going to pick supreme court judges he should mull over that
*  for years he should have stacks of paperwork in his office going over he should first of all he
*  should be a lawyer like obama would be uniquely qualified for that gig you know hillary would be
*  uniquely you should be a fucking lawyer that understands what you're actually going to vote
*  on and what you're actually what what the implications of giving this person this gig
*  is going to be and also wouldn't it be logical if we're just assuming that there's a is probably
*  a terrible idea because it would result in like big stalemates but wouldn't it be great if we're
*  assuming we're admitting that there's only two parties we kind of are there's a third there's
*  independent and green and all that but really there's really there's two parties right there's
*  conservative and liberal wouldn't it be great if there was half and half five of each or four of
*  each or you know pick a number if you're going to have a supreme court wouldn't it be great
*  if it was equally representative of well by definition that cannot happen because in order
*  to avoid stalemates you got to have an odd number right yeah but maybe just one that one is what
*  happens the president gets to pick that one so if you're a republican you get one you have like one
*  that tips it towards your side one but like i mean it's a terrible idea i'm a moron and don't listen
*  to me but wouldn't it make more sense to have equal representation of both sides when it comes
*  to complex issues that's going to affect the entire country i mean it shouldn't just be a simple
*  matter of this one guy is the president he gets to just appoint all these right wing
*  jesus bangers and they come in and burn all abortion clinics like that that it shouldn't be
*  that simple now that's interesting because so you're pro-choice do you really want it to be
*  mandated that half the court is against abortion like why why would that be good again whenever
*  it comes to abortion it's the what there's one thing that you keep bringing up and that you
*  keep bringing up pro-choice you keep bringing it up it's oh no i brought it up because you
*  mentioned abortion right right right but you brought it up earlier too yes yes yes it's it's
*  one of those when it comes to picking a supreme court that's like the number one thing should you
*  i mean i hate to say this way should you be able to abort a baby that's it's what it is right or a
*  fetus or a you know the bundle of tissue before it's ever really anything should you be able to
*  do that and it's so crazy that that is like one of our number one considerations should someone be
*  able to infringe on your rights as a human being to tell you have to carry this baby and then you
*  have to either put it up for adoption or raise it like like what a uniquely human conundrum that is
*  and that conversation that is because as we discussed earlier it does get everybody
*  gets very disturbed when it gets older when you're dealing with five and six months everybody has a
*  problem with it almost everybody but when it's early on it's less and less it's one of those
*  uniquely human things where we're all just like whoa that's a messy discussion it's a messy problem
*  it's not unique to abortion though i mean if you think about think about a speed limit right i mean
*  you get engineers and they say the speed limit here is going to be 35 does that mean when it's
*  dry 40 is unsafe no does that mean if it's icy 35 is safe you've probably got the fact that there
*  is an arbitrary nature to it often gets you into a philosophical black hole where people end up
*  saying you just can't have it because it's not clear in the way we would like it to be clear
*  and i think we don't want to fall into that kind of philosophical black hole because it's not unique
*  to abortion that that exists yeah you could make a good argument about being something you could
*  apply to a lot of different things but abortion is so emotional because the when you talk to the pro
*  life people and they're you know screaming that you're killing a baby like there's nothing else
*  like that that sort of has the consequences of you know on one side people looking at a woman's
*  right to choose and then the other side looks at it you're killing a baby like whoa like that is a
*  really polarizing and complex issue but i agree with you about the speed limit thing and the other
*  problem with the speed limit thing is you're turning cops into glorified revenue collectors
*  because they're out running around giving people tickets and collecting money for going too fast
*  like that's not what they're supposed to be there for i mean for sure if someone's driving
*  unsafe they should do that but they shouldn't be waiting to catch people going three miles an hour
*  over the 45 limit and also like what kind of a car do you have because if you have a you know
*  a 1965 buick and it doesn't stop at all like you hit the brakes and it skids for like 15 feet before
*  it even starts to to break your car is dangerous your car is dangerous probably even going 35 miles
*  an hour if you had an old tank of a car with shitty brakes and you know those cars they're
*  not designed to go fast like in comparison to today's cars at all like maybe you shouldn't even
*  be allowed to drive those when you see someone with like one of them classic cars like j leno
*  drives all around burbank like hey man you can't even those brakes barely work on that fucking
*  piece of shit but if you have a tesla like my god man those things are super fast they're super
*  comfortable and safe the brakes are amazing like there's modern cars today that you can make the
*  argument that 55 miles an hour is preposterous like i know all around massachusetts i used to
*  live there the speed limit was crazy 55 miles an hour is maddening you just want to eat your
*  steering wheel you're like this is going to take so long when was that i don't even remember when
*  the speed limit was 55 hey gar bro i can't drive 55 don't you remember do you remember that maybe
*  i remember 65 i remember 65 how old are you david 36 yeah i'm ancient i'm 52 and when i was a kid
*  sammy hagar before he was even in van halen he had a song i can't drive 55 oh yeah yeah yeah no i
*  know i know i just thought i don't know when it was that slow in massachusetts oh man well when
*  i lived in there i moved out of massachusetts in probably 92 91 92 and it was still 55 then when i
*  used to drive to connecticut for gigs you'd get busted all the time these fucking guys be hiding
*  behind bushes radar we'd have radar detectors you hang from your steering wheel you know or your
*  your rear view mirror remember those things yeah oh yeah i used to have one didn't work at all but
*  yeah but yeah there's there's i mean you know montana had no speed limits montana was like
*  fuck you until the federal government said listen you know you gotta if you want money from us you
*  got to do something you got to have speed limits so they came up with some wacky like 85 mile an
*  hour speed limit up there but that's uh also you know it's it's a place where there's just not that
*  many folks it's big wide open stretches of land it's not like driving 85 miles an hour through
*  downtown boston no are you are you like out and about a lot right now with what's going on with
*  the virus i mean not really um i went to florida for the ufc that was really weird that was uh last
*  weekend or the weekend before last that was very strange you know wearing a mask everywhere and
*  everyone else has a mask on but once we got to the actual event it was just strange because
*  there was no audience we the fight had no crowd and then i came back home and mostly mostly i've
*  been just coming here to the studio and going home i haven't i've actually you know aside from
*  being freaked out all the anxiety and being sad that people are suffering and i myself have enjoyed
*  the time off and enjoyed the the the ability to reflect and to just think about like what is
*  important in life and what what is important in terms of how i spend my time and how critical
*  health is that it's not just a luxury or a vanity that health and exercise it's it's imperative and
*  i may not beat people over the head with that maybe too much but i think it's so goddamn important
*  and that to me um that's really been hammered home to me about this pandemic love friendship how
*  important my friendships are how i value them so much um my obligation in doing this thing you
*  know in this thing it's like i want i want to express a beneficial idea i want to express ideas
*  in a way that maybe people could get something out of it i want i want to i want i want it to be
*  entertaining i want but i want people to get something out of it you know and i think that
*  that's all been highlighted and what a unique position i'm in and how fortunate i am and what
*  what obligation comes with that fortune you know that's all been really highlighted
*  by this uh this pandemic yeah i just feel so lucky that my job doesn't depend on me
*  driving somewhere on some boss whatever the community that you know people are home watching
*  stuff and and for that reason you know stuff shows like these are are particularly important
*  right now but also i that responsibility thing about i really need to make sure i'm informing
*  people about what's actually going on i don't want to be spreading disinformation the feeling
*  of that responsibility has i've always had it but it feels particularly acute right now because of
*  what's going on yeah and it should and you know david it's interesting we were talking about this
*  earlier but your show couldn't exist in any other time and nor could mine and we're very very very
*  similar in that way if you had someone standing over you telling you what to do or hey david
*  here's the data we've got from the polls they don't like it when you talk about this or they
*  say not to talk about that and the sponsor wants you to change the way you're dressed and that kind
*  of shit you would never become you and i think one of the reasons why shows like yours resonate
*  with people is because it's very obvious that no one is telling you what to do you're just a guy
*  who has your perspectives and you're a brilliant guy you have very interesting thoughts on things
*  but these are home brewed thoughts like you've thought about these these are these are not things
*  that are being handed to you on a on a printed sheet by the network executives and that's what
*  makes what you do and what i do so interesting is that it resonates to be people can clearly see i'm
*  a moron so if this moron is be able to talk to all these people and have these intense conversations
*  like there's not really a barrier of entry that we once thought it was you know to be a person who
*  has that kind of an audience you used to have to be vetted and you used to go through a long process
*  there was a lot of other people in consideration you had to play games and politicking and you know
*  you had to be chosen you don't have to be chosen anymore you just have to do it and get better at
*  it and i feel so fortunate to be in the situation that i'm in where this is happening and to to have
*  this ability to just do a show to not have to talk to anybody to be able to just just go and
*  have conversations with whoever i want whether it's you or whoever anyone yeah i think it's yeah my
*  hope is like when we look back at this whenever it's it's done you know that i can just feel good
*  about the work that happened during this time right because i think it's going to be a phase
*  where we'll kind of remember the beginning middle and end of it and i don't know when the end of it
*  is going to be but i don't want to feel like the time was squandered in any way no i don't think
*  it is man i think perspective wise i think we're all going to benefit from this the real problem
*  is people with businesses the real problem is people that didn't do anything wrong and everything's
*  taken away from them and i feel fucking terrible for them and if there's any way we could save them
*  and do something i mean i just don't know what the answers are i don't know what the answers are
*  medically i don't know what the answers are i mean in terms of managing our economy from here out i
*  don't but man it's it's a fucking weird time it's one of the weirdest times like sometimes i'll just
*  be driving down the street and i'll have forgotten that we're in the middle of a pandemic and i'll
*  see some person with a mask on like oh yeah oh yeah the world's fucking haywire right now i forgot
*  we're all afraid to touch each other and everyone's far apart and you get hand sanitized
*  you're squirting every five minutes on yourself it's it's just the weirdest time of my life
*  yeah my my biggest concern is that all the stuff that we figured out we weren't ready for
*  we learn nothing from it and then just the next one of these happens and we're just as unprepared
*  and things go just as haywire that would be like the biggest waste and i fear that that is a good
*  possibility that's a big fear and it's also like how what it went in terms of money to allocate
*  what's left like after the stimulus packages after all this stuff that we're doing what is going to
*  be left how much money is there going to be to try to restart everything do they have enough money to
*  really put together another pandemic response team and do a better job with it to really fund
*  research on the flu and various viruses and to find out what's going on i know there's there's
*  talk about these things about picking up these programs and really stepping up we only hope there
*  is absolutely i mean listen six trillion already prevention is so much cheaper than emergencies you
*  know prevent it's just it's a fraction of the cost obviously pandemic response team never should have
*  been disbanded it would cost pennies on the dollar to what is being spent right now no doubt it's
*  crazy when you go back and listen to bill gates ted talk in 2015 talking about the possibility of
*  a pandemic and wiping everybody out and then five years later you see it happen and you're like
*  nobody listened nobody listens how crazy is it that people are now bill gates is the bad guy i've got
*  people i went to high school i have people i went to high school with hosting insane conspiracies
*  about bill gates is the problem now to a lot of people how did that happen listen help me there
*  help me there with that one because that one's weird i was watching this video from newport beach
*  or huntington beach where there all these people are protesting free california they're running
*  around and this guy's got a megaphone he's like bill gates is the devil like how did that happen
*  it's one of the weirdest memes this weird it's one of the weirdest like cultural memes like this
*  that this thing has happened that bill gates this this philanthropic billionaire who's literally
*  like made toilets in africa and spent millions of dollars to try to get people education and
*  millions of dollars on all sorts of great social good all of a sudden he's a bad guy it's
*  inconceivable and the number of people i've just muted or unfriended that i personally know i mean
*  it's like it's not just random people on twitter but it's people i went to high school with who say
*  he wants the profit from the vaccine or he wants to use a vaccine to control the population or i
*  mean it's like you know this is nanotech yeah it's weaponized disinformation is what i call it well
*  it's it's very prevalent it's really interesting too because like what here's the problem there is
*  profit in vaccines that's a problem so like when you look when someone looks for a conspiracy and
*  they say something like bill gates he just wants a profit on the vaccine you can't say no one ever
*  profits on vaccines so that's a stupid idea you go well how much is a vaccine worth and how much
*  profit is there in vaccines then you look in you you go whoa there's a lot of profit in vaccines
*  shit i wish there was none i wish you know they're making them just for the greater good of
*  mankind and it's not like people are buying private jets and ferraris off that money but
*  look everything where people do it and do it well seems to require incentive you know and it's funny
*  to me of the system right that's a critique of us because it's not just vaccines but it's funny to
*  me that people don't have a problem with that with capitalism but the same people that would
*  vote right and don't have a problem with the capitalism maybe be anti-regulation are angry
*  that people make money off of vaccines but yes they're also angry because we're cynical and we
*  wonder okay if they're making money off vaccines would it be possible for them to incentivize
*  doctors to vaccinate people more or if they got more people involved they would make more money
*  like that is a problem in just human nature when you can make more money okay give me the reality
*  the not vaccinating and having way more people to treat for stuff is way more profitable
*  that's a good point and it's also devastating to civilization right i mean if they never came up with
*  the fucking polio vaccine how many people would be just a mess because of that and die because of
*  that smallpox you've seen those images of i mean i probably never saw them until the internet
*  are the images of what people look like when they were devastated by smallpox it's horrifying
*  vaccines are important my my cynical nature comes up whenever there's anything where people
*  can make a lot of money it's not just vaccines it's like anything whether it's fracking when i
*  hear people talk about how safe fracking is and then i remember uh gasland the documentary where
*  they're lighting water on fire i'm like what tap water is not supposed to be flammable like
*  something's going on here man i mean this place is in pennsylvania where people can't live they have
*  to get out of their fucking house they can't live they can't wash themselves with the water
*  they can't drink it they can't they're they're worried about breathing in the fumes near their
*  houses i mean it's it's devastating it's a tragedy the tragedy and that's that's i mean that's a
*  clear area where profit and not enough regulation are the recipe for disaster and oddly enough an
*  area where the right wing tends to poo poo it oh come on fracking has made this country a oil
*  stronghold you know there's that that argument which i guess it kind of has right i mean that's
*  again a problem with humans we're so life is so complicated being a human is so fucking complicated
*  there's so much to us how long you think this will go i don't know i'm worried about a second wave the
*  second wave concerns me and i'm worried that that could lead to shutdowns that people are not going
*  to be able to make it through that made it through this one or they barely made it through this one
*  with their business and then the second lock knock lockdown comes and you know and they lose
*  everything i'm also worried that people are going to lose their health and their life i mean i'm
*  worried about both things i'm worried about the second wave coming and people being ignorant to
*  the possibility of it hitting and then it does hit and it's devastating both those things are
*  terrible you know but again my uh my thinking is if we're going to quarantine people we really
*  should make more of an effort to quarantine people who are sick and old that seems to me to be a
*  better way of handling it from here forward than quarantining all of us i think i don't think
*  that's tenable i think maybe we could pull that off for a month or so but i think after a while
*  the fucking wheels fall off and i feel like that's where we are right now so i think as i said before
*  much more emphasis on health and your immune system and taking care of your body and being smart
*  those things are those things are underappreciated and critical
*  yeah i don't know how long it's going to last i i think the best scenario is a widespread vaccine
*  by march april 21 right i mean it seems like but would you jump right in with one of those
*  mrna vaccines vaccines well by the time i unless i go out and buy one by the time i get it millions
*  of people will have had it already like i mean it just you know it's going to be health care workers
*  first and then the most vulnerable part by the time there's one available for me unless i just
*  figure out who i can buy it from millions of people will have had it already at this point
*  in the movie the screen would go black and we'd open to david pacman covered in dirt carrying a
*  club filled with spikes running down the street with his friend trying to avoid the zombies
*  because yeah by the time it got to you they had already turned to zombies and you couldn't afford
*  it and you lucky you now there's millions of zombies running through the streets of boston
*  trying to eat people we don't have to go into this but i am like doing some prepping now and
*  i have no clue what i have no clue what i'm doing what are you doing i i just i looked up like what
*  are the 80 you know the 80 20 idea right so like i just tried to figure out what's the what's the
*  the stuff that will cover 80 percent of the scenarios so it's like three days of water i
*  don't need a month of water right some additional first aid supplies but then i got into really
*  weird stuff where i got convinced that i need a flat tire repair kit and so i bought this thing
*  and then i looked at it and i was like wait a second i still need to pump up the wheel at the
*  tire after i use this thing and then i realized like i've got triple a and a flat why did i buy
*  a flat or a spare why did i buy a flat tire repair kit so like some of the stuff i bought made no
*  sense at all that's actually wrong that makes plenty of sense first of all you can get one
*  that plugs in your cigarette lighter that's an air compressor very easy right and i got one of
*  those it's awesome so that that's you're covered there second of all triple a if a lot of shit
*  goes down they're going to be busy man and they might not be answering their phone and you might
*  be stuck in the middle of nowhere no tire repair kit is good um okay knowing how to uh feed yourself
*  that's good like having rice and beans things that are easy to store and that last forever that's
*  really good all that stuff is very important but i i got real super preppery uh at the beginning
*  of this i was real and worried the first couple of weeks i was scared out of my fucking mind
*  i was like this could just be you know 10 of us are dead people just dropping dead in the street
*  left and right i was really worried about it because you know you you hear the stories the
*  salacious crazy horrible stories are the ones that get the most press whether it's any whatever
*  subject the subject is and of course when it comes to a pandemic the ones that people want to hear
*  about is there's a 28 year old guy you know he was a fitness instructor now he's in a coma like
*  holy shit those ones that really scare the fuck out of you though those were what you kept hearing
*  so you know i'd wake up in the middle of the night thinking is my breath feels short and you know and
*  and then also the anxiety kind of was keeping me from sleeping well so then i was look i have a
*  whoop strap that measures my sleep and i checked the app and i would look at my recovery and it was
*  like 13 i was like what the fuck it's because i'm freaking out because i'm up all night worrying
*  about whether or not society is going to fall apart and everyone's going to die so it took a
*  while for me to relax i guess like probably a couple weeks before i was getting like real
*  consistent sleep and and and feeling much better um but i'm still very very worried about what what
*  it's going to be like once things restart yeah yeah i totally agree with you i i thought four
*  different times i had coronavirus first of all so that that whole thing went on but there's some
*  stuff that is going to take a while to get back to just like human interaction type things right
*  i mean i don't think we there's not going to be a day where we say we're back to hugging and
*  handshaking and and sharing drinks and and that type of stuff like some of this stuff will persevere
*  for a long time maybe yeah maybe i don't know when i was at the ufc i was shaking a lot of
*  people's hands and hugging people but they were all tested everyone was tested so everyone had
*  the bracelet on that showed that they had been tested and tested that week and so everyone was
*  cleared right before we got there so i was pretty sure everyone was fine it just seemed so normal
*  all the friends that i've been working with for years so i was shaking their hands and hugging
*  them and and some people were critical of that they were like you got to stay away and social
*  distance and all this and i was like when everyone's clear like if it's if we're we're all tested and
*  everyone's testing negative like why can't we act like normal again is it magically going to sneak
*  somebody could be incubating it right where you know imagine if three of those people tested
*  negative because they're they're incubating it they got it on the flight there or something like that
*  i don't know the horror movie i think they they didn't get on the flight there because everyone's
*  tested once they arrived um but either way yeah i know what i mean like you could it could be in
*  your system from the flight you get a test two hours later but the test is negative but if you
*  just wait 24 more hours then that test would be positive all right dr pacman you got me i don't
*  know i don't know either man um but i hope we go back to normal i think people need touch and we
*  need hugs and it weirds me out already when i see how scared people are of each other walking down
*  the same sidewalk and people cross the street so they don't go near you they give you a weird
*  feeling it's not it's not optimal dystopian yeah listen david we just did three hours if you can
*  believe it or not incredible um i appreciate you man you're a very intelligent guy i really enjoy
*  your show i like watching your clips i love your well-thought-out perspective and i think you're
*  very valuable especially in this crazy time we're living in i so appreciate it three hours went by
*  in an instant and uh really just really appreciate talking to you again having uh having me back
*  next time let's do it in person i'm gonna hug you we're gonna hug each other we're gonna do we're
*  gonna get over our fears i hope so i think we will all right brother will you take care of yourself
