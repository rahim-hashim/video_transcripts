# Joe Rogan Experience #1915 - Brian Simpson
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5.72s)]
*  Oh, cheers. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13.36s)]
*  Thank you, man. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14.36s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15.36s)]
*  Ah, Scotch. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=16.36s)]
*  Okay, first of all, Joe, did you see the guy yesterday, his debut MMA match, he won, by [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=17.36s)]
*  the way, he has no lower body. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=28.48s)]
*  Yes, Zion. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=30.88s)]
*  Zion. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=31.88s)]
*  Yeah, dude, incredible. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=32.88s)]
*  It was unbelievable. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=34.92s)]
*  How fast he closes the distance with no legs. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=36.84s)]
*  So my question is, are you... [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=41.44s)]
*  Zion Clark, amazing. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=44.6s)]
*  Are you allowed, is he considered a downed opponent? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=47.64s)]
*  That's a good question. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  Because that... [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=51.96s)]
*  Changes the game. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=52.96s)]
*  That makes him OP, because you can't kick him. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=53.96s)]
*  You can kick him in the body. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=57.92s)]
*  You can kick downed opponent in the body. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=58.92s)]
*  I mean, you think a leg kick is bad, imagine an arm kick. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=62.28s)]
*  And then imagine, like, you can't grab his legs, you can't... [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=65.60000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=69.04s)]
*  And also, his upper body is insanely strong for someone of that weight class. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=70.04s)]
*  So you have to think, like... [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=75.96000000000001s)]
*  First of all, nothing but props for the guy. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=78.0s)]
*  No excuses. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=80.08s)]
*  The guy's amazing. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=81.08s)]
*  And just the fucking amount of courage that it takes to even train and become an elite [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=82.08s)]
*  wrestler and then become an MMA fighter, all with no legs. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=86.36s)]
*  Incredible. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=90.16s)]
*  Yeah, that's insane. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=91.16s)]
*  No one's saying there's an advantage. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=92.76s)]
*  But one thing that he's able to do... [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=94.68s)]
*  I mean, you don't have legs to control. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=97.84s)]
*  So your game is different. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=100.92s)]
*  In the stand-up game, punches... [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=103.76s)]
*  If you're punching a guy that's down like that and literally is at the hips, you have [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=106.48s)]
*  to bend your knees down and try to punch him. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=112.64s)]
*  To train for that guy... [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=116.56s)]
*  How do you train for that guy? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=117.56s)]
*  All your power comes from your legs. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=118.88s)]
*  So if you can't push off, you can't punch, you can't really load up and... [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=120.48s)]
*  And if you leg kick that guy in his arm and break his arm, that's fucked up. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=125.76s)]
*  But also... [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=130.72s)]
*  Because now he can't even get around. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=131.72s)]
*  But he's probably so... [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=132.72s)]
*  Because there's a thing, you know that old quote about, like, don't argue with a fool [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=133.72s)]
*  because they'll drag you down to that level and beat you with experience? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=137.24s)]
*  It's like that. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=140.8s)]
*  It's like, he has way more experience down there than you do, and you got to get down [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=141.8s)]
*  there. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=144.76s)]
*  Like, you move just on his arms. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=146.6s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=147.6s)]
*  Boy, that's terrifying. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=148.6s)]
*  33-inch vertical jump. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=149.6s)]
*  That's incredible. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=150.6s)]
*  Or whatever that means. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=151.6s)]
*  Have you ever seen that woman who was born with no legs and she does everything with [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=152.6s)]
*  her feet? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=158.64s)]
*  She puts her lipstick on with her feet. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=159.64s)]
*  She eats with her feet. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=160.64s)]
*  She writes her name with her feet. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=162.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=164.2s)]
*  She has dexterity with her feet like people have with their hands. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=166.51999999999998s)]
*  Which makes you think, like, I wonder if that's like a skill that we all could acquire, we [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=169.64s)]
*  just don't, because we don't use our legs for that. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=174.92000000000002s)]
*  Because there's certain things that people could do with their hands, right? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=177.4s)]
*  Like, have you ever seen a guy who's really good at boxing thinking, like, have you done [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=179.6s)]
*  any boxing? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=184.72s)]
*  A little bit, yeah. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=185.72s)]
*  One of the things that's really awkward to learn is a left hook. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=186.72s)]
*  It feels very weird. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=188.56s)]
*  It does, yeah. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=189.56s)]
*  And you're standing like this and you got to do that. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=190.56s)]
*  It feels very weird to learn how to do that properly. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=192.08s)]
*  It's a very odd movement. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=194.8s)]
*  And people are all like, but eventually it gets to the point where it's natural. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=196.44s)]
*  Like, in a fight it just comes out. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=201.44s)]
*  Like, you train it. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=203.16s)]
*  So there's all these like hidden abilities that our bodies have, but we just don't ever [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=204.88000000000002s)]
*  use them in that way. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=208.76000000000002s)]
*  I think, you know, necessity is necessary. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=211.24s)]
*  Like, the fact that you have no choice, that is the number one motivator. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=213.60000000000002s)]
*  It's like, if I don't learn how to do this shit with my feet, I'm never going to do shit. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=218.92000000000002s)]
*  Right, yeah. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=223.04000000000002s)]
*  I admire that kind of shit. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=224.04000000000002s)]
*  And your nervous system, the way you learn things is by repetitive, you know, motion. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=225.24s)]
*  Like you do it over and over. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=231.20000000000002s)]
*  That's why, like when you tie your shoes, you don't even think about it. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=232.23999999999998s)]
*  Eddie Bravo used to always use that as an example about jujitsu, that you got to train [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=235.88s)]
*  it to the point where it's automatic, like tying your shoes. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=240.56s)]
*  Because when you tie your shoes, you're not thinking, okay, I make this loop and I wrap [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=243.28s)]
*  it around that loop and I go under and I do that. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=247.2s)]
*  You don't think that. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=249.67999999999998s)]
*  You just... [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=250.67999999999998s)]
*  And it's like that's, jujitsu has to become like that too. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=251.67999999999998s)]
*  I knew some kind of rhyme when I was a kid at first. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=254.72s)]
*  You know how they teach you like, you know, or some shit like, you know, this is a bunny [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=257.76s)]
*  rabbit and over the bridge and... [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=261.0s)]
*  But now I don't think about it at all. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=264.28s)]
*  Yeah, you're right. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=265.64s)]
*  Yeah, you don't think about it at all. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=266.64s)]
*  Well, that eventually happens, I think, with everything that you do. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=267.64s)]
*  You just got to do it so much, because you tie your shoes every day. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=270.68s)]
*  Get up, tie your shoes. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=273.71999999999997s)]
*  You know, take your shoes off, put them back on, tie them on. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=274.71999999999997s)]
*  That's why I... [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=277.2s)]
*  Because on my podcast, BS with Brian Simpson, check it out. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=278.2s)]
*  It's a very good podcast. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=281.24s)]
*  YouTube, all platforms, BS with Brian Simpson. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=282.24s)]
*  On mine, we... [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=285.72s)]
*  I get, all the time I get emails about... [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=287.32000000000005s)]
*  People go, how do I do stand-up comedy? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=291.20000000000005s)]
*  You know, you get those questions all the time. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=293.84000000000003s)]
*  And it's like, and I remember when I first started, I would get so frustrated because [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=295.72s)]
*  the veterans would always be like, well, just keep doing it. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=299.36s)]
*  And it felt like a bullshit answer. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=302.08000000000004s)]
*  But it is the answer. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=304.20000000000005s)]
*  It's the right answer. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=305.20000000000005s)]
*  It's the right answer. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=306.20000000000005s)]
*  You just got to do it. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=307.20000000000005s)]
*  But you also have to pay attention to what you're doing, you know? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=308.20000000000005s)]
*  Like, I think if we all go back and watch our old tapes... [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=311.12s)]
*  Oh, I can't do it. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=314.12s)]
*  It's horrible. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=315.52s)]
*  You would go like, oh my God, I would never do that that way now. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=316.52s)]
*  Especially the... [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=318.48s)]
*  So I remember when I first started to get good. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=319.48s)]
*  When people... [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=323.28000000000003s)]
*  How many years was that in? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=324.28000000000003s)]
*  Probably like two, two and a half years. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=327.0s)]
*  So you felt comfortable on stage. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=330.28000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=331.96s)]
*  When I felt comfortable, when my reputation in the scene was like, he's one of the best. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=332.96s)]
*  And I remember this guy did a show at the club. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=337.48s)]
*  He booked the club for the whole night. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=343.6s)]
*  I was working the door at this club. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=345.20000000000005s)]
*  And he decided to come out... [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=349.04s)]
*  He booked three other comics too. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=351.92s)]
*  He decided to come out after each comic in a different costume, as a different character, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=353.68s)]
*  and do stand up as a different person. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=358.28000000000003s)]
*  And he'd never done stand up. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=360.48s)]
*  Like he was not a stand up. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=362.72s)]
*  I might have seen him at like one open mic or something, and then he decided to put on [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=364.48s)]
*  this whole big show. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=367.40000000000003s)]
*  He was like a model or something. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=368.40000000000003s)]
*  So he just had like a grand idea. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=369.40000000000003s)]
*  And I watched this motherfucker bomb in front of his friends. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=371.8s)]
*  The club was all people he brought. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=378.12s)]
*  I watched him bomb three times on the same show. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=380.03999999999996s)]
*  It was painful. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=385.0s)]
*  And I went up, I think I went up after the first character and I had the best set of [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=386.08s)]
*  my life. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=393.03999999999996s)]
*  And he also had, he recorded the whole thing. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=395.28s)]
*  He had triple cameras set up and everything. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=397.59999999999997s)]
*  And I remember hitting him up the next day like, hey man, do you think I could get that [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=401.08000000000004s)]
*  tape? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=404.0s)]
*  You know? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=405.0s)]
*  And he was like, I can't watch it right now, but I'll get it to you as soon as... [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=406.0s)]
*  Because I felt him. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=412.36s)]
*  Like his heart was ripped out of his chest. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=413.36s)]
*  By the time he went up the third time, he was already broken. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=415.68s)]
*  This was his first time on stage? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=419.40000000000003s)]
*  It was not his first time on stage, but it was like he'd done maybe two open mics and [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=420.88s)]
*  then put on this show for all his friends and family. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=424.76s)]
*  And I'd forgotten about it. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=429.20000000000005s)]
*  I ain't hear from the guy for like six months. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=430.2s)]
*  And one day I come into work and somebody's like, hey man, somebody dropped this off for [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=433.47999999999996s)]
*  you. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=436.4s)]
*  And it was a DVD with that set on it. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=437.4s)]
*  That I was like, that was the best set I ever had. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=438.96s)]
*  Like I can't wait to watch this. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=440.64s)]
*  And I get home and I pop it in the computer and it was so bad. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=441.64s)]
*  And that's when I realized like, oh no, like the lessons you would have learned from that [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=448.2s)]
*  you've already learned now in these six months. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=453.88s)]
*  Like you needed to watch that the next day or within a week or something to get there. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=455.71999999999997s)]
*  You figured it out. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=460.76s)]
*  It's funny in the beginning because you're working with open micers too. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=462.44s)]
*  So like I remember when I got my first gig, when I got a paid gig, I realized, oh, there's [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=465.52000000000004s)]
*  a giant difference between an audience that's there to see a comedy show versus an audience [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=471.32s)]
*  that goes to an open mic night. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=476.64s)]
*  They're there to see pros. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=478.04s)]
*  And I wasn't really a pro. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=480.26s)]
*  I was just doing open mic nights. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=481.64s)]
*  I was, I sucked. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=484.0s)]
*  And the youth, when you're working with people that are terrible. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=486.12s)]
*  I mean, they're so bad, they'll never be good. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=489.84000000000003s)]
*  They just don't, whatever the fuck it is that makes a person funny, they are void of that. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=491.6s)]
*  We know those guys, right? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=497.08s)]
*  Those girls, those non-binary folks. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=498.44s)]
*  When you learn like how to do it, like comedy is one of those things. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=500.72s)]
*  It's just, everyone's got to figure out their own little weird path, you know? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=505.44s)]
*  And we're all doing that for the first time and you're trying to imitate people and you're, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=510.92s)]
*  so everybody sucks. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=515.08s)]
*  So if you go up and get a few laughs, you think you're the shit. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=516.12s)]
*  And then you do a working show where you're working with real pros and you realize how [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=519.7199999999999s)]
*  terrible you are. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=524.92s)]
*  Yeah, well that's why places like the store were important because it was like, yeah, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=526.4799999999999s)]
*  you're the shit in fucking Des Moines. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=532.4399999999999s)]
*  And then you go to LA and you go to the store and you, every night you see people that are [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=535.3599999999999s)]
*  light years behind you. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=543.1999999999999s)]
*  And you need that. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=545.04s)]
*  You need to see that. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=546.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=547.04s)]
*  How many people, they're comfortable being king of the hill because they scared to climb [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=548.0799999999999s)]
*  the mountain. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=551.4s)]
*  One of the things that Mitzi used to do at the store is if she thought you were any good, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=552.4s)]
*  she'd put you on after the best people. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=555.64s)]
*  You just died. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=558.4399999999999s)]
*  You died. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=559.7199999999999s)]
*  I had to go on after Richard Pryor five weeks in a row. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=560.7199999999999s)]
*  Every time Richard Pryor did a set, I went on after him. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=563.8399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but you know what though? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=566.52s)]
*  The best people, that doesn't scare them. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=567.76s)]
*  Scared the shit out of me. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=570.4s)]
*  Did it? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=571.4s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=572.4s)]
*  But you weren't, it wasn't part of you that was like looking forward to the challenge? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=573.4s)]
*  Uh, no. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=576.48s)]
*  I was terrified. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=577.48s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=578.48s)]
*  You know who terrified me the most? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=579.48s)]
*  Martin Lawrence. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=580.48s)]
*  Oh. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=581.48s)]
*  Dude, I've talked about this before and I'm sorry if you've heard the story, but Martin [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=582.48s)]
*  Lawrence during the You So Crazy days in the 90s, I was just getting to LA, so it was like [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=585.5600000000001s)]
*  94, just getting to LA. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=591.64s)]
*  Little cute, fresh faced Joe Rogan. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=593.5600000000001s)]
*  And I was terrible. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=596.32s)]
*  You know, just clunky. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=597.32s)]
*  Real, you know, I could get a few laughs. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=598.32s)]
*  I had a couple of good bits, but then I'd fuck something up and just, you know. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=600.76s)]
*  So I had some potential and I was working at it. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=604.36s)]
*  And I just went on after murders. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=608.2s)]
*  And when Martin Lawrence would kill, but people forgot how goddamn good Martin Lawrence was [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=611.16s)]
*  back then. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=616.48s)]
*  I hear that from everyone, man. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=617.48s)]
*  People forgot. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=618.48s)]
*  If you go back and watch some of his specials and hear the laughs, you'll get, it's always [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=619.48s)]
*  hard to watch a special from the 90s because for some reason, the comedy doesn't hold up [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=622.84s)]
*  that good with like, it holds up for Pryor. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=629.0s)]
*  It holds up for Kinnison. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=631.9s)]
*  It holds up for the greats of the greats. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=634.1s)]
*  But like, if you watch like some of the really good specials from like the 1990s, there's [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=637.0600000000001s)]
*  something about them. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=642.58s)]
*  They're just kind of the styles dated. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=643.58s)]
*  Something's different. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=645.8000000000001s)]
*  I think some, I think it's just that some comedy is about the big picture, like just [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=646.8000000000001s)]
*  humanity and some comedy is about the times. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=652.58s)]
*  And the comedy is specifically about the times. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=656.02s)]
*  Unless things are exactly the same, things are the same. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=658.22s)]
*  It doesn't hold up because the culture is so different, you know? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=661.74s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=664.66s)]
*  I mean, culture shifts so radically. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=665.66s)]
*  You know who I always fucking dreaded following? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=668.02s)]
*  Who? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=670.78s)]
*  Fucking Joey Diaz. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=671.78s)]
*  Oh, he was the monster. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=672.78s)]
*  Joey Diaz. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=673.78s)]
*  That's why I started taking him on the road with me. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=674.78s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=675.78s)]
*  Because I would bomb going on after him. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=676.78s)]
*  I was like, oh good, I'm going to take him on the road with me. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=677.78s)]
*  It'll force me to get better. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=679.5s)]
*  Rick Ingram. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=680.62s)]
*  A lot of people won't admit this, but everyone hated following Rick Ingram. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=681.62s)]
*  Oh, because Rick Ingram would work the crowd. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=684.14s)]
*  He worked the crowd, but just so masterfully. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=685.86s)]
*  The crowd would be mad that he was gone and that you were there instead. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=690.18s)]
*  Also, they wanted to talk. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=693.8199999999999s)]
*  When Rick's up, he'll talk to you. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=696.5s)]
*  He wants you to talk back. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=698.06s)]
*  He wants to fuck around with you and have a conversation with you. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=699.06s)]
*  But I was like, yo, but I told, you know, I want to go after him every time. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=702.06s)]
*  If we're on the same one. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=706.3s)]
*  That's great. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=707.8199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, because I would bomb after him all the time. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=708.8199999999999s)]
*  And I was like, until I figure out how to not bomb after him, I'm missing something. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=711.66s)]
*  You got to cut all the fat out. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=715.6999999999999s)]
*  That's what I realized. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=717.54s)]
*  You got to cut to the point. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=718.54s)]
*  Don't be self-indulgent. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=719.9s)]
*  Pay attention to yourself like you're a hater. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=721.78s)]
*  Cut that shit out. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=724.02s)]
*  Make it quicker. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=725.02s)]
*  Get to the funny. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=726.02s)]
*  Cut all the stuff that's like C material. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=727.28s)]
*  Cut it out. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=730.06s)]
*  I look at my act like I'm getting ready for a bodybuilding thing where I just bloat it [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=731.06s)]
*  full of every fucking possible idea I could possibly have. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=736.66s)]
*  The bulking phase. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=739.38s)]
*  Yeah, and then I fucking yabby yabby yabby. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=740.38s)]
*  That's a good way to think about it. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=742.06s)]
*  The bulking phase. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=743.06s)]
*  Because it is like the bulking phase. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=744.06s)]
*  I'm in the bulking phase right now because I'm writing all this new shit. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=745.3s)]
*  That's my favorite part about the whole shit. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=749.4200000000001s)]
*  It's like watching a kid grow up. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=752.0600000000001s)]
*  It's exciting. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=753.74s)]
*  Yeah, just wait until I figure it out. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=754.74s)]
*  By the way, I think I figured out that one bit. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=756.46s)]
*  Oh, beautiful. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=758.58s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=759.58s)]
*  Good. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=760.58s)]
*  See you tonight. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=761.58s)]
*  Those days though of like bombing after, I bombed after Dice a bunch of times. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=762.58s)]
*  I bombed after Damon Wayans. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=766.1800000000001s)]
*  I bombed after everybody. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=771.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=772.82s)]
*  There's so many people that's so funny. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=773.82s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=775.66s)]
*  Back in the 90s, man, I couldn't believe I was on stage with them. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=776.8199999999999s)]
*  I remember sitting in the back of the, there's another one that people forgot about, Damon [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=781.74s)]
*  Wayans. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=784.8199999999999s)]
*  Damon Wayans, he had this special called The Last Stand. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=785.8199999999999s)]
*  Go watch that special. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=789.26s)]
*  It's fucking sensational. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=790.26s)]
*  And again, you got to watch it like it's whenever that special was made. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=792.8199999999999s)]
*  I don't know what year that was. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=796.38s)]
*  But dude, he was a monster. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=798.14s)]
*  He just decided to do television. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=800.66s)]
*  He just decided to do, he made a lot of money doing those fucking TV shows. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=802.78s)]
*  I think he's coming back though. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=806.7399999999999s)]
*  God, I hope so. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=808.2199999999999s)]
*  I know he still does stand up. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=809.2199999999999s)]
*  And do you know that he records every fucking show that he's ever done on video? [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=810.5s)]
*  He brings a tripod and a video camera. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=814.26s)]
*  He sits in the back of the room, he puts them all on his computer and he watches them. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=816.5799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I opened up for him in the belly room one time when he popped in, when he decided [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=819.6199999999999s)]
*  to do a show. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=823.54s)]
*  And yeah, he walks in with a camcorder like it's 95. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=824.54s)]
*  And he's been doing that forever. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=829.5s)]
*  He's a pro. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=831.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=832.26s)]
*  He's a pro. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=833.26s)]
*  I feel like those jazz saxophonists practice every day and they get their shit tight and [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=834.46s)]
*  they analyze it and go over it. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=838.54s)]
*  That's what he does with comedy. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=840.9s)]
*  Yeah, I used to be that meticulous. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=842.8199999999999s)]
*  And I'm trying to, but it got to the point where it was, it started to get easier for [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=847.02s)]
*  me and I got lazy. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=852.34s)]
*  You know what, there's a thing that I think we should all implement. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=853.8199999999999s)]
*  You know how we do this sober October thing where this year we had a workout every day [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=856.54s)]
*  and burn 500 calories. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=861.3s)]
*  We should do that with writing. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=863.06s)]
*  We all commit to writing. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=865.34s)]
*  Just make it reasonable, like two hours every day. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=867.78s)]
*  Writing for two hours? [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=870.9399999999999s)]
*  Writing for two hours every day. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=871.9399999999999s)]
*  That's reasonable. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=873.02s)]
*  Yeah, that is reasonable. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=874.02s)]
*  You know why? [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=875.02s)]
*  Because once you start, you just keep going. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=876.02s)]
*  The hard part about writing is sitting down in front of your computer. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=877.86s)]
*  That's what Steven Pressfield calls resistance, the resistance of doing it. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=880.5s)]
*  It's like your ego's fighting you and whatever it is. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=884.62s)]
*  Procrastination, there's times where I'm in front of my computer and I'm supposed to [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=888.66s)]
*  write and I just watch people play pool. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=893.4599999999999s)]
*  Procrastination's interesting because I heard somebody recently say that it's not, procrastination [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=897.26s)]
*  is your inability to deal with the negative feelings around the task. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=902.98s)]
*  Because procrastination isn't you just not doing the important thing. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=908.3399999999999s)]
*  You're doing something unimportant instead. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=912.5799999999999s)]
*  You're doing something with no consequences. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=915.86s)]
*  You're scrolling TikTok. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=917.62s)]
*  You're playing video games. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=918.62s)]
*  You're doing something with no stakes because the stakes make you uncomfortable. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=920.42s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=924.66s)]
*  Yeah, like to sit in front of the computer and not know where to go with anything. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=925.66s)]
*  Fuck. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=929.9s)]
*  See, I need to leave my house because we have a, because you know I'm roommates with Hans [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=930.9s)]
*  and Asan and there's an extra room that we kind of turn into a podcast studio. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=937.06s)]
*  I have to leave. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=944.5s)]
*  I still record somewhere else because I have to leave. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=945.5s)]
*  To work. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=948.34s)]
*  To work. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=949.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=950.34s)]
*  I can't, having my computer in my room was the worst thing I've ever done in my bedroom. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=951.34s)]
*  Because you just sit in the bedroom then. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=954.78s)]
*  Yeah, because it's the place where I work and the place where I rest, they like blend. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=956.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=961.3s)]
*  And it's like I can't get things done that way. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=962.3s)]
*  I realized early on when I started doing my podcast, I had to take it out of my house. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=964.1s)]
*  I was like, I gotta take it out of here. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=968.26s)]
*  Plus my daughter's really young and I was bringing crazy people over and pot was coming [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=970.6999999999999s)]
*  out of the fucking door and into the hallway like, mommy what's that smile? [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=974.98s)]
*  Yeah, and it's like, I don't want motherfuckers knowing where I live. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=978.5s)]
*  There's that too. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=981.8199999999999s)]
*  And then there's also like sometimes my kids would be screaming in the background. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=982.8199999999999s)]
*  It was fun though. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=985.26s)]
*  Those old videos are kind of hilarious. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=986.26s)]
*  And nobody comes and taps you on the shoulder and goes, hey, you're too famous for this. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=987.86s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=992.3399999999999s)]
*  It just creeps up on you. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=993.3399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=994.3399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I had a motherfucker, somebody dropped me off at my house the other day at Uber. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=995.3399999999999s)]
*  And the whole ride, this dude was asking me questions as though he didn't know who I was. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=999.82s)]
*  Oh, he got you. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1004.94s)]
*  And then drops me off at my house and goes, hey man, I'm gonna be honest. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1006.94s)]
*  I'm a big fan and we'll do the Uber. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1009.98s)]
*  And wow, I didn't know you live here. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1012.54s)]
*  And I was like, aw man. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1013.86s)]
*  Shit. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1015.26s)]
*  So now when I Uber home, I have to Uber up the street. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1016.26s)]
*  I Uber to the next block. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1018.5s)]
*  Oh no. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1019.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1020.82s)]
*  Oh no. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1021.82s)]
*  But it's just part of it. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1022.82s)]
*  I don't think I'm not big enough where somebody gonna do something crazy at least, but it [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1024.42s)]
*  only takes one crazy. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1028.26s)]
*  It only takes one crazy. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1029.78s)]
*  Why don't you get a car? [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1030.78s)]
*  I will eventually. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1031.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1032.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1033.78s)]
*  That's easy to drive around here. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1034.78s)]
*  Yeah, I will. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1035.78s)]
*  I get the whole Uber thing, but I like driving myself. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1036.78s)]
*  I like being alone thinking. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1039.62s)]
*  You know, there's something about the movement of driving too. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1042.46s)]
*  You know, especially if you're driving something where you have a manual transmission. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1045.9s)]
*  There's all this activity in your mind. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1049.3799999999999s)]
*  There's a lot of stuff going on. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1051.3s)]
*  They don't even do those anymore. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1052.66s)]
*  Oh yeah, they do. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1053.66s)]
*  Yeah? [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1054.66s)]
*  Yeah, you can get manuals. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1055.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1056.66s)]
*  They still sell the Mustang in a manual. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1058.0600000000002s)]
*  They sell Porsches in manual. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1059.5800000000002s)]
*  They sell... [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1061.22s)]
*  But the default's automatic. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1062.22s)]
*  Yes. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1063.66s)]
*  There's very few cars where you can only get a stick. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1064.66s)]
*  There's a few sports cars where you can only get a stick. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1068.0600000000002s)]
*  Like custom made stuff and there's a few... [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1072.3000000000002s)]
*  What? [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1075.66s)]
*  Like, there's probably, I think, some of the Porsches. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1076.66s)]
*  There's like one or two Porsches. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1079.7s)]
*  Maybe it's the T. See if that's true, the 911 T. They make purist cars. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1081.3200000000002s)]
*  They did that, they used to do that with the Porsche R. It only came in a manual. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1086.34s)]
*  It was like this 500 horsepower, beautiful 911 that was like sedated looking. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1092.1399999999999s)]
*  Because it looked almost like a... [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1098.1799999999998s)]
*  It didn't have like a crazy wing, like a GT3 RS. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1099.9399999999998s)]
*  That's... [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1102.8999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1103.8999999999999s)]
*  The unconnected car. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1104.8999999999999s)]
*  The internet connected car makes it a case for unplugging. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1105.8999999999999s)]
*  How's it unconnected? [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1109.62s)]
*  It doesn't have screens and shit? [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1110.62s)]
*  And GPS, is that what it's saying? [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1113.06s)]
*  It's not stripped down. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1114.94s)]
*  It has more... [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1116.78s)]
*  Oh, the new 911 T has more electronic equipment than the old one, including electronically [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1117.78s)]
*  adjustable dampers, active engine transmission. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1123.06s)]
*  Okay, that's just like electronics for the car itself. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1125.7s)]
*  But the infotainment system is connected and able to receive over the air updates and link [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1128.5800000000002s)]
*  to a smartphone app. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1134.8600000000001s)]
*  But you can still turn the data sharing and refuse to use the app. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1136.06s)]
*  In the UTA, updates are limited to into infotainment software, not vehicle controls. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1140.5s)]
*  For modern high-end vehicles, this is as close you're going to get to an off-the-grid in [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1146.62s)]
*  a brand new car. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1150.34s)]
*  They're dope. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1151.34s)]
*  Go back to that image again. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1152.34s)]
*  Yeah, so that's a manual. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1153.82s)]
*  Yeah, but that's not as close as you can get off the grid. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1154.82s)]
*  Rip that shit out. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1156.9s)]
*  That's off the grid. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1157.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1158.9s)]
*  It still has... [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1159.9s)]
*  It looks like it has Apple CarPlay. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1160.9s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1161.9s)]
*  They're like totally disconnected. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1162.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1163.9s)]
*  But if you get an old car, old cars, that's a real experience. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1164.9s)]
*  But I don't want that. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1168.22s)]
*  I want my shit loaded to the gills. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1169.26s)]
*  Give me every modern... [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1170.94s)]
*  I'm a gadget guy. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1172.18s)]
*  I don't want a fucking old car. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1173.18s)]
*  No. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1174.66s)]
*  You would get annoyed if they didn't have Android Auto, right? [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1175.66s)]
*  Like some of them don't have Android Auto. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1177.42s)]
*  Yeah, some of them don't have it. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1179.14s)]
*  Or they don't have it wireless. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1180.14s)]
*  You have to like plug a cable in to use it. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1182.02s)]
*  Yeah, that's annoying. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1183.6200000000001s)]
*  There was a thing where BMW was going to make people pay to use Apple CarPlay. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1184.6200000000001s)]
*  Or like any other features. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1190.9s)]
*  I don't know what it is. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1192.58s)]
*  Like it was like a monthly subscription. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1193.58s)]
*  I was like, that's crazy. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1195.06s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1196.8600000000001s)]
*  Find out if that's true. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1197.8600000000001s)]
*  But that's just stealing money. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1199.5s)]
*  Yeah, it's like... [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1202.02s)]
*  Like I bought the car. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1203.02s)]
*  Give me the fucking features. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1204.02s)]
*  I could just go out and rip that shit out and put one in there that doesn't require anything. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1205.02s)]
*  I get Apple CarPlay. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1210.02s)]
*  It used to be an $80 feature charge. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1211.6999999999998s)]
*  Now it's not. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1214.5s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1215.5s)]
*  They bailed on it. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1216.5s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1217.5s)]
*  Just the fact that they had you charge per month? [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1218.5s)]
*  A year. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1221.2199999999998s)]
*  A year. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1222.2199999999998s)]
*  That's not a lot, but it's still stealing $80 a year. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1223.2199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, well it's the rich tax. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1225.3s)]
*  It's like I was just talking to one of the guys out there about he pulled out some Tom [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1226.58s)]
*  Ford glasses. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1235.3799999999999s)]
*  It's like when you finally can start buying stuff like that and you realize, oh, these [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1237.98s)]
*  are way nicer than the shit I've been buying. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1240.56s)]
*  But they ain't worth $500. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1243.72s)]
*  But they know if you can afford... [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1246.22s)]
*  They're probably worth like $250. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1247.8999999999999s)]
*  But they know if you can afford $250 sunglasses, you'll pay $500 for them. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1249.46s)]
*  How many people sell stuff on aftermarket? [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1253.6200000000001s)]
*  They'll buy sneakers right when they come out and then they sell those sneakers. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1256.26s)]
*  You could sell them because they'll sell out and you can sell them for hundreds of dollars [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1261.1000000000001s)]
*  more. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1264.02s)]
*  There's some people that's their whole business. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1265.02s)]
*  They're rich off that. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1266.02s)]
*  They flip sneakers. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1267.38s)]
*  Yeah, and they created bots that will buy them as soon as they come out. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1268.38s)]
*  It's crazy the demand for them. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1272.7s)]
*  Yeah, I like some sneakers, but I'm not about to... [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1274.66s)]
*  Sneakers are the thing that I would like that I'm unreasonable, like will pay extra [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1280.46s)]
*  upfront to be the first adapter. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1284.54s)]
*  But sneakers, I'm like, I'll just wait. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1286.78s)]
*  I'll get some nice ones. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1288.42s)]
*  Yeah, you're all in with gadgets and you're all in with Android, which is very interesting. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1289.8600000000001s)]
*  For now. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1295.66s)]
*  Oh, you're starting to come over to the dark side. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1296.66s)]
*  I think Apple is about to switch not to USB-C, but I think they're going to go wireless completely. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1299.26s)]
*  That's not smart. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1304.18s)]
*  It's the way they... [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1306.66s)]
*  It's not as fast. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1307.66s)]
*  Well, the thing is, the reason they still own the old lightning cable is because manufacturers [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1308.8600000000001s)]
*  have to pay them for that made for Apple shit. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1315.74s)]
*  Right, because of the lightning cable. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1318.7s)]
*  They should have gone to USB-C. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1320.8200000000002s)]
*  Right, and they invented USB-C. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1322.46s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1325.0600000000002s)]
*  Now they got the MagSafe shit, and that's proprietary as well, because the EU just ruled [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1326.0600000000002s)]
*  against them. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1332.5s)]
*  Right, the EU said that they have to put USB-C cables. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1333.5s)]
*  No, the EU said anything that can be charged with a cable has to be USB-C. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1336.94s)]
*  Well, USB-C is superior, which is weird. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1342.58s)]
*  It's like superior for data transfer, superior for everything, but Apple had that proprietary [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1345.18s)]
*  input that so many more people have iPhones than I know. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1350.48s)]
*  In America. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1357.02s)]
*  Yeah, but if you look at the number of sales, it's like I think there's way more Android [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1358.02s)]
*  phones than there are iPhones. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1364.26s)]
*  What is it in America? [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1366.82s)]
*  I think even in America there's more Android phones than iPhones. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1368.1399999999999s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1370.6599999999999s)]

*  Really? [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1373.6599999999999s)]
*  I think it's just people with... [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1374.6599999999999s)]
*  Apple has a lock on America. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1375.6599999999999s)]
*  But you can get a really good, cheap Android phone for like a couple hundred bucks. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1377.4199999999998s)]
*  If you're on a budget and you just need a phone to text and send email and shit, an [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1383.3799999999999s)]

*  Go to like Verizon store. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1393.78s)]
*  What's like a cheap Android? [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1395.66s)]
*  Apple claimed over 50% as of September this year. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1397.34s)]
*  Oh, so this is the first time? [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1400.46s)]
*  Yeah, they took from... [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1401.94s)]
*  I just saw 2010, it said that they don't have the lead, but... [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1402.94s)]
*  That's incredible. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1407.42s)]
*  Took it over, I guess. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1408.42s)]
*  We had this guy, Siddharth Kara, on the podcast the other day. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1410.42s)]
*  It was one of the most disturbing and dark and just depressing podcasts I've ever done. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1413.66s)]
*  Is it about spying? [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1420.86s)]
*  It's about cobalt mining, about what goes into getting a cell phone. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1422.06s)]
*  What really goes into getting a cell phone is slaves in the Congo and children in the [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1428.74s)]
*  Congo and people with babies on their backs, women who are working with a child on their [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1433.02s)]
*  back breaking out cobalt with hammers and the toxic fumes. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1437.78s)]
*  They're inhaling them, their child's inhaling them, all sorts of birth defects, cancers, [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1444.3s)]
*  respiratory diseases, dermatitis. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1450.02s)]
*  He was talking about all this horrible shit that happens to these people on top of the [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1452.06s)]
*  fact that they're not getting barely any money. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1455.26s)]
*  They're just barely enough to survive and eat. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1458.1399999999999s)]
*  They're treated like shit, they work 12 hours a day, and that's at the heart of every fucking [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1460.66s)]
*  cell phone we own. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1464.54s)]
*  We can't even get these motherfuckers the cheap Android phones. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1465.54s)]
*  They don't have any phones. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1467.94s)]
*  They don't even have electricity. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1469.46s)]
*  That's what he's telling us. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1471.02s)]
*  That's like a very, very, very small percentage of the Congo even has electricity. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1472.02s)]
*  These people that live in the mines, they're too poor for, or that work in the mines, they're [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1477.98s)]
*  too poor for any of that. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1481.14s)]
*  I'm working on this new bit now about how many steps need to be between you and the [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1482.14s)]
*  atrocity for you to move on with your life. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1492.26s)]
*  Right. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1494.8600000000001s)]
*  That's a good bit. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1495.8600000000001s)]
*  As long as I'm not getting my phone from them, that would make me feel bad. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1497.82s)]
*  Think about all the people that are active on their phone doing what they think is social [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1503.58s)]
*  justice. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1508.62s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1509.62s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1510.62s)]
*  You're on a phone that's literally at the bottom of the supply chain is slaves. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1511.62s)]
*  I have a thing for you, Joe, speaking of which. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1516.26s)]
*  What do you think this headline is about? [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1519.4199999999998s)]
*  This is what we do on my podcast, by the way. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1523.4199999999998s)]
*  Use the cough button for the right reason. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1527.3s)]
*  Someone with Down syndrome loses Court of Appeal abortion law case. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1529.5s)]
*  What do you think that's about? [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1536.26s)]
*  I would say someone is forcing her to get an abortion. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1540.26s)]
*  She loses the lawsuit. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1543.5s)]
*  That's what a reasonable person would think. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1545.94s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1547.5s)]
*  No. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1548.5s)]

*  No. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1550.5s)]
*  What is it? [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1551.5s)]
*  What it's about is, this is in England. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1552.5s)]
*  Their abortion law is pretty much the same as Texas. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1554.38s)]
*  Really? [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1558.0200000000002s)]
*  It's pretty close. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1559.0200000000002s)]
*  Six weeks? [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1561.0200000000002s)]
*  No, it's not six weeks. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1562.0200000000002s)]
*  But there's an exception for the rape and incest. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1563.0200000000002s)]
*  And if there's going to be a severe birth defect, and as a specific example, they use [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1572.1000000000001s)]
*  Down syndrome in the law. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1577.2600000000002s)]
*  This woman wants to repeal the law because she has Down syndrome, and making that an [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1580.62s)]
*  exception makes her less than. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1587.1399999999999s)]
*  So if your baby's about to be born with Down syndrome in the UK, you can have an abortion. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1591.3799999999999s)]
*  Where do you decide birth defects end? [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1598.62s)]
*  So what if your child is born with only one hand? [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1601.74s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1605.74s)]
*  It's all stuff that they can- [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1607.78s)]
*  If your child's born like Zion Clark. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1609.02s)]
*  Well, they can tell genetically beforehand. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1610.02s)]
*  I don't know if they can tell- well, maybe they can. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1612.02s)]
*  I think they can tell a lot. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1613.8999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1615.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1616.3799999999999s)]
*  I think they can tell a lot about your development. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1617.3799999999999s)]
*  If someone decides that- I mean, you could get real crazy with that, right? [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1619.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1624.42s)]
*  Like, people are capable of some very dark justifications. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1625.42s)]
*  Like, look at what they were doing in China. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1627.62s)]
*  The one-child policy in China, there was horror stories about people killing their babies [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1630.62s)]
*  that are girls. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1638.5800000000002s)]
*  So they could have one kid. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1639.5800000000002s)]
*  I don't know how many of them were folklore. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1640.94s)]
*  You know, those are those things that people would tell you. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1643.6200000000001s)]
*  You're just like, you know, they drown their babies. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1645.8200000000002s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1648.22s)]
*  You know? [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1649.22s)]
*  Like the Spartans, they just throw them off a cliff. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1650.22s)]
*  Yeah, they drown their girls. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1651.5800000000002s)]
*  Like, Jesus. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1653.1000000000001s)]
*  Is that- how much is that- is that real? [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1654.1000000000001s)]
*  Do they really- I mean, if you can imagine it, some horrific thing. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1656.54s)]
*  Someone has done it. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1661.88s)]
*  Because it's also crazy. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1663.0800000000002s)]
*  Because like, what you can't have is a country of just men. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1664.0800000000002s)]
*  You can't- No. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1669.3600000000001s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1670.3600000000001s)]
*  As much as we talk and complain about women, it's like, we still need them to be- you know, [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1671.68s)]
*  we need that feminine energy to balance out. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1675.88s)]
*  Because you've seen what happens when it's just men left to their devices and there's [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1678.68s)]
*  no women. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1682.3600000000001s)]
*  That gets crazy. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1683.3600000000001s)]
*  It's not good. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1684.3600000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1686.3600000000001s)]
*  And also, if there's not enough females to match with the heterosexual males, like, you [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1687.3600000000001s)]
*  don't even have a chance. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1692.6s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1693.6s)]
*  It's like, if you're a guy- like, if you're a guy already, for the- you know, everyone [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1694.6s)]
*  wants to talk about, like, you know, the benefits of being a guy and there are benefits to being [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1698.9199999999998s)]
*  a guy. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1705.7199999999998s)]
*  But one of the negative effects of being a guy that people don't talk about is guys that [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1706.7199999999998s)]
*  are unattractive and don't have any money. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1710.4399999999998s)]
*  They are unheard and unseen. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1713.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1715.3999999999999s)]
*  Attractive guys with no money, they're in a very strange position in our society. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1717.2s)]
*  Yeah, you're right. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1722.1200000000001s)]
*  And, like, Andrew Tate, as much as people hate him, talked about that. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1723.1200000000001s)]
*  He's like, it's a very small percentage of guys that have all the money and all the women [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1726.0s)]
*  and all the, you know, the fucking Ferraris and all that shit. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1731.0s)]
*  He's like, to say that that's men, that's representative of men, is insane. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1734.0s)]
*  Because it is such a small percentage. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1738.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1740.96s)]
*  Now, are they, you know, if it's a guy like that, he's got, like, diamond-encrusted watches [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1741.96s)]
*  and he's fucking flashing and he's blinging and he's, you know, taking pictures with all [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1745.96s)]
*  these girls. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1749.3600000000001s)]
*  It's obnoxious. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1750.3600000000001s)]
*  People, everybody else gets upset about it. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1751.3600000000001s)]
*  But one of the reasons why they get upset about it is because they know how inaccessible [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1753.3600000000001s)]
*  that is. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1757.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1758.4s)]
*  It's for most people, it's completely impossible. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1759.4s)]
*  And women don't like to hear that, but it's like the, and in a lot of situations, the [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1761.2800000000002s)]
*  ceiling is capped for women. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1766.2800000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1768.6000000000001s)]
*  But the floor is also capped, you know? [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1769.6000000000001s)]
*  It's like, I ain't never seen a homeless bad bitch. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1772.1200000000001s)]
*  Not one time. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1774.2800000000002s)]

*  But I'm not sure if the world is worse. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1844.84s)]
*  Because the media wants you to believe that everything is horrible. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1848.36s)]

*  Right, right, right. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1854.6399999999999s)]

*  ago. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1861.32s)]
*  Yes. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1862.32s)]
*  But we all just went, the whole globe went through the same shit. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1863.32s)]
*  Well, yeah, you can't shut a country down. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1866.8s)]
*  Now we know. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1870.1599999999999s)]
*  Now we know. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1871.1599999999999s)]

*  But there's a lot of people that want to claim that they had the solution to that. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1873.1599999999999s)]
*  No one knew what the fuck was going on in the beginning. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1877.1599999999999s)]
*  The way it was handled was definitely bad. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1878.96s)]
*  But in the beginning, no one knew what the fuck to do. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1881.1599999999999s)]
*  We were all in favor of the lockdown at first because we all thought it was going to work. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1884.4399999999998s)]
*  If you're like virologists and epidemiologists who thought that it didn't matter, then it [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1888.28s)]
*  was just going to spread no matter what you did. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1893.04s)]
*  Well, what blows my mind is that I feel like we're going to make the same mistake again. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1895.1200000000001s)]
*  We might. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1900.2s)]
*  Well, there's, you know, there's people that want to put the masks back on for RSV and [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1901.2s)]
*  for the flu and for all these different things we never wore a mask for before. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1904.92s)]
*  And then there's all this evidence that kids' immune system function is not working as good [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1908.68s)]
*  because they didn't get exposed to anything for all those times when they were isolated. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1912.92s)]
*  What about that fungal shit? [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1916.68s)]
*  You heard about that? [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1918.12s)]

*  town of people just tripping balls. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1934.6s)]
*  That reminds me of like, I don't know if it was an Outer Limits episode or something, [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1936.48s)]
*  but it was like some shit was going around the world fucking people up and it was making [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1941.0s)]
*  their skin like copper almost. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1947.0400000000002s)]
*  All the medical people were fighting on it and lockdowns and everything and at the end [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1951.28s)]
*  they realized that it was like, it was preparing everyone's skin because the sun was about [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1953.96s)]
*  to go turn into a white dwarf or whatever the fuck or a red giant. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1962.72s)]
*  It was basically aliens saving us. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1968.1200000000001s)]
*  They introduced a virus that changed our skin so we could withstand the extra radiation. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=1969.76s)]

*  They did it to them as embryos? [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2156.72s)]
*  When did they do it? [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2159.8399999999997s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2160.8399999999997s)]
*  I've got to find a different article. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2161.8399999999997s)]
*  I'm reading a study on it. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2162.8399999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2165.8399999999997s)]
*  But the whole point is they've already started doing stuff like that. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2166.8399999999997s)]
*  And so if they can do that with the mind, imagine we all get Elon Musk's brain. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2169.44s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2175.3199999999997s)]
*  Would you want it? [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2177.2799999999997s)]
*  No, not his. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2178.2799999999997s)]
*  Like if I'm picking my geniuses? [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2179.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2180.88s)]
*  No, he's too emotional. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2181.88s)]
*  I would probably go with probably like a Sam Harris. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2183.44s)]
*  Dude, I think they're all emotional. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2188.1200000000003s)]
*  I think most genes, and Sam's brilliant too, but I mean people are human beings. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2189.96s)]
*  Human beings are emotional. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2194.0800000000004s)]
*  No, I'm just saying there's different kinds of intelligence. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2195.0800000000004s)]
*  Well he engages, you know, that's the thing. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2197.52s)]
*  These guys, they engage with people online. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2200.2400000000002s)]
*  When you engage online, like your emotions are going to get beat up. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2202.34s)]
*  Even if they're strong. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2207.1200000000003s)]
*  Even if they're strong, your emotions are going to go on a run. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2208.96s)]
*  You're going to utilize a certain amount of your resources on those emotions. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2211.2s)]
*  Well I went, because my producer doesn't like Elon Musk and we argue about it all the time. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2214.72s)]
*  What doesn't he like about him? [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2221.3599999999997s)]
*  He's just a hardcore lefty. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2224.44s)]
*  So you know, Elon is, you know, I don't want to put words in his mouth, but to him, Elon [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2226.8399999999997s)]
*  is what's wrong with everything. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2233.04s)]
*  I'm one of those people where I'm like, I try my best to be neutral with people like [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2236.4s)]
*  him because he's one of those people that's so polarizing that like, when people don't [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2240.2000000000003s)]
*  like you like the way they don't like him, they, anything negative about you, they just [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2245.6000000000004s)]
*  believe it. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2251.32s)]
*  Or repeat it. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2252.32s)]
*  Well it's always, for people like that, it's always good to try to engage them as calmly [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2253.32s)]
*  as possible and not even to pick a side. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2256.5200000000004s)]
*  Just you kind of want to steel man their position, right? [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2260.36s)]
*  Like if someone is very, very emotional, you almost want to ask them, okay, tell me what [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2263.6s)]
*  you think and why you think this way. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2269.88s)]
*  And then they tell you what they think and then you could say, is, have you ever considered, [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2272.08s)]
*  or did you know that, this? [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2278.8399999999997s)]
*  I see what you're saying, I agree with what you're saying. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2281.68s)]
*  You almost want to say, I see your points, I understand what you're saying. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2283.68s)]
*  But human beings are extremely nuanced. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2287.08s)]
*  And you could narrow a guy like Elon down to like a very dismissible box, like very [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2289.8s)]
*  easily, because he tweets at people and he says ridiculous shit and he trolls and he [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2294.52s)]
*  has fun. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2298.96s)]
*  He put a picture of fucking Bill Gates up next to a pregnant man emoji and said, if you want [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2299.96s)]
*  to lose a boner real quick. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2304.48s)]
*  No. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2305.88s)]
*  I mean, that shit is hilarious. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2306.88s)]
*  Who the fuck does that? [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2309.5600000000004s)]
*  No, he put a, he put a poll up saying like, yo, should I step down as CEO? [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2310.5600000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2314.88s)]
*  And they said yes. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2315.88s)]
*  So he's looking for a CEO. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2316.88s)]
*  I hope he picks Lex. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2317.88s)]
*  Well, Lex offered to do it. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2319.84s)]
*  Lex is a brilliant engineer. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2323.48s)]
*  I don't know if he wants to be a CEO, a chief executive officer. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2325.44s)]
*  That's what that is, right? [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2330.0s)]
*  But do you think he was bullshitting when he offered? [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2331.0s)]
*  I don't know if that's what he's offering. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2332.12s)]
*  He might have been offering to take it over from an engineering perspective. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2334.2400000000002s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2337.52s)]
*  You know, because that would like change what he does. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2338.52s)]
*  And if he did do something like that, I think he'd be, I think Lex is a brilliant man and [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2340.36s)]
*  he would be great at anything he puts his mind to. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2344.6s)]
*  He's one of the best interviewers in the game. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2347.76s)]
*  His podcast is sensational and he's so brilliant. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2349.96s)]
*  I mean, he used to work on AI at MIT and he, you know, he writes code for artificial intelligence. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2353.6400000000003s)]
*  When I first came down here, I didn't know who he was, but I remember he was hanging [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2362.2400000000002s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2372.76s)]
*  Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu black belt shreds on the guitar. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2373.76s)]
*  Genius, like a certifiable genius. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2378.2s)]
*  And he's ultimately like very curious and very kind. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2380.92s)]
*  He's a very kind person. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2385.36s)]
*  And he says it all, like he's always talking about treating people with love. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2387.16s)]
*  And he'll talk to anybody, man. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2391.04s)]
*  He'll talk to anyone. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2392.28s)]
*  He had Kanye on early when everybody was like, oh my God, Kanye's lost his fucking mind. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2393.28s)]
*  Lex is like, let me let him come on long form and express himself. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2398.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2402.48s)]
*  In a way that's like a death knell because it's like once you talk to him and you steal [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2403.48s)]
*  on that shit, like there's no one that's going to treat you with more kindness and more objectivity. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2407.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2413.04s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2415.52s)]
*  Yeah, no, he's great at it. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2416.52s)]
*  But see, the problem is like if he went and became the CEO of Twitter, I feel like we [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2417.52s)]
*  wouldn't have as much of that Lex anymore. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2423.44s)]
*  He wouldn't be able to do those podcasts and do that. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2425.84s)]
*  But I know he likes working hard, man. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2429.2s)]

*  I don't have that gene. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2437.0s)]
*  He's got a different gene. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2438.3999999999996s)]
*  I don't have that. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2439.3999999999996s)]

*  I don't think. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2441.8799999999997s)]
*  I mean, maybe he's, he could probably do it. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2442.8799999999997s)]
*  He could do it if he thought about it. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2444.3199999999997s)]
*  If he thought about it long enough. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2445.3199999999997s)]
*  You think he could do stand up? [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2446.74s)]
*  100%. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2447.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2448.74s)]
*  Really smart people could, Elon could do it 100%. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2449.74s)]
*  Just the fact that he would write that if you want to lose a boner real quick, a picture [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2452.24s)]
*  of Bill Gates next to a pregnant man emoji. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2455.7599999999998s)]
*  See, but I, no, see I disagree. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2458.96s)]
*  Listen, you did it. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2461.04s)]
*  You sucked in the beginning. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2462.04s)]
*  I'm not saying he'd be good. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2463.04s)]
*  Yeah, but I'm, but being funny, being funny is just one part of it, right? [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2464.6s)]
*  But the, but the live performing thing, that's, that's the hard part. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2469.6s)]
*  There's a lot to that for sure. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2475.92s)]
*  But there's people that are really funny that aren't that good at live performing. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2477.84s)]
*  Yeah, they're writers. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2481.0s)]
*  Yeah, but they write and they go on stage sometimes and kill. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2482.36s)]
*  Oh, yeah, you're right. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2485.0s)]
*  You know, there's certain guys that we know that are like really good joke writers. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2486.0s)]
*  They're not the most charismatic on stage. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2489.0s)]
*  The only people that, the only people that I think absolutely can do it are people that [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2490.88s)]
*  are just not funny at all. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2495.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2497.28s)]
*  Like if, if I, cause I know people that think they can do it. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2498.28s)]
*  And I think like you've never, you've never made anyone laugh. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2500.88s)]
*  Like you've never made me laugh in the whole time I've known you, you can't do stand up. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2506.04s)]
*  Well, some people like severely, like we all lack self-awareness, like complete objectivity, [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2509.56s)]
*  but some people just have zero. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2517.44s)]
*  They just don't know, you know, they just don't know. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2519.84s)]
*  It's almost like some people are just born hard of hearing. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2523.32s)]
*  Their ears don't work well. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2527.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2528.7200000000003s)]
*  Some people are born and they just, whatever the fuck it is about personality and. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2529.7200000000003s)]
*  It's like people that are tone deaf. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2533.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2535.1200000000003s)]
*  It's like they think they can sing and they don't hear it. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2536.1200000000003s)]
*  They don't hear it. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2538.04s)]
*  How horrible it is. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2539.04s)]
*  But that's, they're just, it's the same kind of person. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2540.04s)]
*  It's like there's, there's delusional people. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2541.82s)]
*  There's their brains not working right. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2544.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2546.44s)]
*  That comes from like, you have to, that's why who, who is around you is so important. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2547.52s)]
*  And a lot of ways it's the look of the draw. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2553.32s)]
*  A lot of ways. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2555.2000000000003s)]
*  Like if you're in the middle of nowhere, you know, Little Rock, Arkansas, you want to do [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2556.64s)]
*  stand up. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2560.4s)]
*  I don't know how many dudes are there that are really good. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2561.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2563.2400000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2564.2400000000002s)]
*  You're in Hartford, Connecticut. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2565.2400000000002s)]
*  You want to do stand up. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2566.2400000000002s)]
*  Or just somebody, somebody that love you enough to tell you the truth. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2567.2400000000002s)]
*  They're like, Hey man, this is, you shouldn't do this. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2568.88s)]
*  You know? [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2571.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2572.2400000000002s)]
*  But you can't listen to all those people. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2573.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2574.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2575.2400000000002s)]
*  You're right. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2576.2400000000002s)]
*  Oh, well yeah. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2578.04s)]
*  My family, I don't know what they think. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2579.04s)]
*  I think they, they, they recognize that other people think I'm funny. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2581.64s)]
*  Well, they know you're killing. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2585.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2586.68s)]
*  They have to hear the laughs. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2587.68s)]
*  But, but I think it's hard for people that have, that knew you when you weren't this [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2588.68s)]
*  to see you as the way they look at other big name people and stuff. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2592.52s)]
*  That's why it's really hard when you start off as an open micer in a city and then they [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2596.04s)]
*  always think of you as that guy who sucked. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2600.52s)]
*  And then you go on and you get better and you, you have to like come back as a headliner. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2602.94s)]
*  You got to come back when you're undeniable. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2607.3s)]
*  Like somebody, like, you know that, that, that whole bit that Chappelle has about how [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2609.02s)]
*  his kid wanted to really meet Kevin Hart, you know? [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2613.18s)]
*  And it's like, it's like, cause to, to, to his kids, he's just dad. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2615.46s)]
*  Right. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2619.34s)]
*  Right. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2620.34s)]
*  Right. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2621.34s)]
*  He ain't the funniest motherfucker on the planet. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2622.34s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2623.34s)]
*  Right. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2624.34s)]
*  Right. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2625.34s)]
*  Right. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2626.34s)]
*  It's like people that know you a certain way, that's hard for them to knock you out of it. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2627.34s)]
*  Well, the thing, at least they've known him as dad, he's always been Dave Chappelle. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2628.34s)]
*  What if they knew him as dad, the open micer? [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2631.02s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2633.1s)]
*  That's a different animal. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2634.9s)]
*  See, by the time he had children, you know, he was already Dave Chappelle. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2636.1s)]
*  You know, it's, if you're, if you're an open micer and you're in a town and they watch [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2641.34s)]
*  you eat shit, the first time you ever get on stage and you got notes and shit, they're [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2646.54s)]
*  always going to remember that. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2650.46s)]
*  They saw, they probably saw you bombed 20 times. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2652.46s)]
*  Cause I remember like, I was talking to Burt's, Burt's family and it's like, his kids don't [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2654.46s)]
*  even watch him. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2659.7599999999998s)]
*  They're completely uninterested. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2661.76s)]
*  They get plenty of him. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2664.0s)]
*  He's at home. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2665.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2666.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2667.0s)]
*  He's there all the time. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2668.0s)]
*  I was there when they first saw him tell the machine story. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2669.0s)]
*  They weren't allowed to see it until they were like a certain age. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2671.48s)]
*  And it's crazy. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2675.1200000000003s)]
*  They would be completely not even curious to like look up all this stuff. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2676.1200000000003s)]
*  That makes sense though. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2681.32s)]
*  Yeah, it makes sense. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2682.32s)]
*  And then I think, cause I don't have kids, so I don't understand, but now I do, you know, [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2683.32s)]
*  it's like who, like to them it's like, let's just do it. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2686.6400000000003s)]
*  Like I never gave a fuck what my dad was doing when he was gone. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2688.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2691.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2692.2000000000003s)]
*  He's just your dad. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2693.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2694.2000000000003s)]
*  That's an interesting comparison, but I think it's even more extreme when someone sees you [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2695.2000000000003s)]
*  as a beginner in something. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2698.88s)]
*  Like that's the thing with martial arts too. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2700.7200000000003s)]
*  Like sometimes someone's a white belt and you always think of them as that person you [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2702.36s)]
*  sort of crushed when they were a white belt. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2705.36s)]
*  And then all of a sudden they're a purple belt and you're in fucking danger. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2707.2400000000002s)]
*  And they wrap your ass. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2709.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2710.6000000000004s)]
*  You're in danger. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2711.6000000000004s)]
*  Like, Oh no, you got a lot better. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2712.6000000000004s)]
*  Fuck. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2713.6000000000004s)]
*  See, I'm, the jujitsu intimidates me. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2714.6000000000004s)]
*  I think, but I knew, I knew I need to pick something up. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2716.36s)]
*  I think I'm going to do boxing. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2718.96s)]
*  Why don't you do jujitsu? [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2720.96s)]
*  It's it's, I don't know. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2722.76s)]
*  It just, I can't, because I wrestled for like my freshman year of high school and I hated [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2724.6s)]
*  it. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2729.96s)]
*  It's hard. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2731.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2732.2400000000002s)]
*  It's constantly hard. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2733.2400000000002s)]
*  It's like, it doesn't not, it doesn't stop being hard. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2734.76s)]
*  Wrestlers are some of like the mentally strongest people in the world. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2737.84s)]
*  And then to go to meets and to make weight the day of the match and the shit that those [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2742.12s)]
*  guys go through, the way they cut weight, the weight, the mental strength that wrestlers [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2753.36s)]
*  have off the charts. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2758.24s)]
*  They're masters at, at focusing while they're suffering. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2759.72s)]
*  You know, where it's like most, the average person will be suffering and 90% of their [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2764.52s)]
*  brain power will be focused on how much it sucks. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2769.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2771.48s)]
*  And wrestlers learn how to just ignore it and like completely focus while they're in [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2772.48s)]
*  pain, when they can't breathe, you know, because they have a phrase for it. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2775.92s)]
*  It's called embrace the grind. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2780.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2782.36s)]
*  Because because I've been there, it's like if you've never had a motherfucker on top [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2783.36s)]
*  of you that you can't get off you, you don't understand what I'm talking about because [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2785.7200000000003s)]
*  look, I'll never forget one. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2790.44s)]
*  This is what made me quit wrestling. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2791.96s)]
*  I showed up at this. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2793.92s)]
*  It was our school hosting a tournament and and I got my brother to come and and you know, [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2796.36s)]
*  my family didn't give a fuck about wrestling, but he came to watch and I was going up against [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2803.1600000000003s)]
*  this other. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2808.04s)]
*  I was, it was my turn to go against this other dude and I walked in and this motherfucker's [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2809.04s)]
*  got he's got some kind of tubes or some shit coming out of him. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2813.2000000000003s)]
*  Like he's on some kind of, I don't know, a heart thing or something and no one gave me [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2816.4s)]
*  any guidance. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2820.36s)]
*  No one gave me a heads up. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2821.56s)]
*  I didn't know if I was allowed to grab it. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2822.8s)]
*  Like would he die if I pulled it? [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2824.36s)]
*  None of that shit. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2825.68s)]
*  No one said anything to me and I'm but I'm like, okay, it's fine. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2826.68s)]
*  My brother's watching. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2830.3199999999997s)]
*  I'm just going to fuck this dude up. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2831.3199999999997s)]
*  But he's crippled or something, right? [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2833.3199999999997s)]
*  That's how I was thinking back then. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2835.0s)]
*  And as soon as the ref blew the whistle, I've never seen a motherfucker move this fast. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2837.3199999999997s)]
*  He dove at my ankle and tripped me and was on my back and we rolled out of bounds and [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2843.24s)]
*  the rest blew the whistle and he dove at my ankle. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2848.3599999999997s)]
*  He did it like five times in a row. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2850.4s)]
*  Just just lightning. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2852.3199999999997s)]
*  He fucked me up and I threw my headset off and I got docked to point and I was like, [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2855.52s)]
*  fuck that. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2858.4s)]
*  And I walked out of the gym because my you know, because it was the first time anyone [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2859.4s)]
*  come to watch me and I got just embarrassed and I couldn't handle it. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2862.96s)]
*  Oh no. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2866.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2867.6s)]
*  Never wrestled after that. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2868.6s)]
*  If you get in there with someone who's really good at something and you're not, you just [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2870.6s)]
*  realize right away, you're like, oh no, like I can't think as quick as you're moving. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2874.12s)]
*  I'm not, I can't keep the rhythm. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2880.44s)]
*  I don't know what you're doing before you're doing it. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2882.36s)]
*  And then you're doing another thing because you anticipate my counter to that thing. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2884.36s)]
*  And then you've chained another thing together and now I'm on my back again. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2888.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2891.44s)]
*  It's like you're in trouble. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2892.44s)]
*  Like if you don't. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2893.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2894.44s)]
*  And honestly, it came down because there was a war between our coach and our assistant [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2895.44s)]
*  coach and because our coach would focus on technique and drilling and stuff like that. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2898.32s)]
*  And our assistant coach wanted us just in the weight room because it was like, if you're [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2903.1200000000003s)]
*  stronger, you you'll win, you know, and the assistant coach won out because, you know, [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2905.4s)]
*  all these people are fuckers are volunteers and the coach ended up leaving. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2910.4s)]
*  The strength guy was, and he was like, no motherfucker, I needed to know what to do [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2914.64s)]
*  when somebody dives at your ankle with, you know, with the speed of of Usain Bolt or whatever, [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2919.04s)]
*  you know? [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2925.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2926.08s)]
*  If you know technique, then strength is important, but strength is not as important as technique. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2927.08s)]
*  No. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2931.76s)]
*  Technique is the most important thing by far. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2932.76s)]
*  If you look at how the Russians did it, that's one of the things that's interesting about [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2934.22s)]
*  George St. Pierre because George St. Pierre was one of the very best wrestlers in MMA, [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2937.12s)]
*  but he didn't wrestle in high school or college. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2941.6s)]
*  He's from Canada and where he was, where he was from, he didn't engage in wrestling. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2944.84s)]
*  He learned wrestling from the Russian nationals that had moved to Montreal. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2950.2000000000003s)]
*  So he learned it as a martial artist. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2954.7000000000003s)]
*  As an adult? [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2957.08s)]
*  As an adult. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2958.08s)]
*  Wow. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2959.08s)]
*  And look how good he got because their shit was very, very technical. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2960.08s)]
*  The Russians are always known to be very technical and they do a lot of drilling because they're [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2963.16s)]
*  they don't, there's not like an ego based system, right? [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2968.7200000000003s)]
*  The system is about success. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2971.2000000000003s)]
*  Like what's the best way to achieve success? [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2973.0s)]
*  It's like you don't have a choice. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2975.6s)]
*  This is Soviet Union, right? [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2978.44s)]
*  You shut the fuck up and this is what you're going to do. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2980.48s)]
*  Like there's no Billy does it his own way. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2982.88s)]
*  There's none of that. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2985.08s)]
*  This is not the culture. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2986.2400000000002s)]
*  The culture is like figure out what and suffer and what's the best way to do what you don't [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2987.4s)]
*  want to do, which is drill. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2991.7200000000003s)]
*  That's the same thing with Jiu Jitsu too. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2993.36s)]
*  If you want to get really good, you like a guy like Mikey Musumechi, he drills all day. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=2994.88s)]
*  Yeah, I'm a huge fan. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3000.52s)]
*  And Ryan, those guys drill all day. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3001.68s)]
*  They drill constantly. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3003.72s)]
*  The more you drill, the more it's like tying the shoes and the more of those things you [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3004.88s)]
*  can add to your repertoire, the better you are. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3009.0s)]
*  Like those guys that get to a point where you it doesn't matter how strong you are. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3011.32s)]
*  You don't know what to do with your strength. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3015.4s)]
*  You're helpless because you're in bad. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3017.48s)]
*  You're like, like your arm doesn't work strong that way. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3018.92s)]
*  They're behind you. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3022.52s)]
*  You're like you're fighting on armor on your neck. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3023.52s)]
*  You're fucked. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3026.28s)]
*  And then you watch some of the shit they pull off. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3027.28s)]
*  Or just, you know, where it's like you have to slow it down to see exactly what they did. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3031.84s)]
*  Like how the fuck did he get on his back? [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3037.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, Mikey did that in one FC. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3039.4s)]
*  There's this backtake that he had that's so brilliant. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3041.96s)]
*  I made a bunch of people watch it. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3044.1200000000003s)]
*  I'm like watch this. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3045.32s)]
*  Watch how slick this backtake is. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3046.32s)]
*  Are you going to play it? [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3048.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, we could find it. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3049.92s)]
*  Mikey Musumechi's slick backtake in one FC. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3051.48s)]
*  It was beautiful. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3054.96s)]
*  Yeah, he's a genius. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3055.96s)]
*  His whole family dangerous. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3057.64s)]
*  Yeah, his sister's dangerous too. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3058.64s)]
*  Yeah, the sister just, she just did something. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3060.64s)]
*  I forget what she just... [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3062.64s)]
*  She's a black belt too. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3063.64s)]
*  Yeah, she just won a tournament somewhere. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3064.64s)]
*  I'm sure. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3066.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3067.48s)]
*  She's his sister. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3068.48s)]
*  She's probably an assassin. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3069.48s)]
*  But I remember the first time I ever saw him, I saw him live in Austin when they were doing [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3071.08s)]
*  that Who's Number One thing. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3076.44s)]
*  And it was him and this other dude that were grappling. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3078.44s)]
*  The other dude was like ripped and he had fucking shaved head and tattoos and shit. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3083.12s)]
*  Oh yeah, this is it. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3087.2799999999997s)]
*  And I'm like, I'll take the guy with the glasses. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3088.68s)]
*  I'm like, watch this backtake. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3091.0s)]
*  And this is against Iminari, who's super legit. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3093.4s)]
*  Look at that backtake. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3095.88s)]
*  He stepped over with one leg. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3097.4s)]
*  Show that one more time. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3098.72s)]
*  Watch how he did this. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3100.42s)]
*  Like if you don't know Jiu-Jitsu, like he's in sort of side control here. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3101.42s)]
*  But look at that. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3104.2s)]
*  He, he got to his back so quickly. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3105.2s)]
*  It was so slick. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3107.52s)]
*  And all of a sudden Iminari's trapped. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3109.52s)]
*  This is absolute beautiful precision movement. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3111.52s)]
*  And that's something he's drilled like a thousand times, I'm sure. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3115.12s)]
*  And Iminari's like one of the goats. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3117.68s)]
*  Oh yeah, he's a legend. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3119.12s)]
*  Iminari's like, they created a role after him, like the Iminari role. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3121.32s)]
*  It's called the Iminari role. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3124.84s)]
*  There's also an Iminari submission from an Omoplata. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3126.44s)]
*  It's like you got a guy on a shoulder lock and you reach under the chin with an S-grip [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3131.12s)]
*  and you submit him from the back. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3135.16s)]
*  Maybe I will try some Jiu-Jitsu. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3136.76s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3138.2400000000002s)]
*  Because you know what? [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3139.72s)]
*  My fucking is getting more dangerous. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3140.72s)]
*  It's like comedy. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3142.7999999999997s)]
*  You're going to suck and then you're going to get better. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3144.6s)]
*  That's what it's like. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3148.2s)]
*  But unlike comedy, anybody can get better. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3149.2s)]
*  At Jiu-Jitsu? [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3151.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3152.52s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3153.52s)]
*  Anybody can get better at Jiu-Jitsu. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3154.52s)]
*  Yeah, some of the stupidest people in the world are good at Jiu-Jitsu. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3155.52s)]
*  You just need to drill it. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3158.8799999999997s)]
*  But it's a different kind of intelligence. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3160.3999999999996s)]
*  You know, it's a different kind of, you have, you know, like some people have a lot of access [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3162.08s)]
*  to information, like the definition of words, history they can pull up and tell you about. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3167.24s)]
*  It's very, very impressive. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3172.9199999999996s)]
*  And some people have a wide library of physical movements that they could pull up. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3174.8799999999997s)]
*  It's like a reflex. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3180.4399999999996s)]
*  It's still intelligence. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3181.4399999999996s)]
*  You ever have like a bug on you and you pop just without even thinking about it? [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3182.4399999999996s)]
*  It's like some people have that. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3185.52s)]
*  Like they feel your thigh on their knee in a certain way and they just snap and you're [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3186.52s)]
*  fucking dead. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3191.9199999999996s)]
*  They just know what you're going to do too. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3192.9199999999996s)]
*  God, that's so terrifying. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3194.3999999999996s)]
*  They've rolled so many times and they have such a deep understanding of what's possible [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3195.44s)]
*  with the human body, where the leverage points are. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3199.4s)]
*  Jiu-Jitsu is so technical. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3202.44s)]
*  People think of it as being like this broodish thing where people just like choke each other [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3203.8s)]
*  and shit. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3208.36s)]
*  But it's, you see like a guy like Mikey, he's not a brood at all. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3209.36s)]
*  It's like Jiu-Jitsu is super, super technical. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3211.96s)]
*  Why do you think Samba isn't more popular? [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3214.48s)]
*  Well that's interesting that you said that because Gordon Ryan just said that he thinks [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3216.84s)]
*  that combat Samba is actually better for MMA than Jiu-Jitsu is, which he's got some [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3219.68s)]
*  real good points. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3226.2s)]
*  Like if anybody knows it's Gordon and the guys that are really good in combat Samba [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3227.2s)]
*  like Khabib and Islam Akhchev, who's the UFC lightweight champion right now, he's a fucking [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3231.04s)]
*  animal and he's a combat Samba guy. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3238.7999999999997s)]
*  There's a lot of those combat Samba guys where they're really good at controlling people [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3240.7999999999997s)]
*  from the top position, which arguably when you add in punches and elbows and stuff like [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3245.72s)]
*  that, that's more important than anything. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3250.9599999999996s)]
*  And they can submit you too. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3253.16s)]
*  Because it feels like whatever the answer to Khabib is, the next generation is going [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3254.7999999999997s)]
*  to come up with doing that as like natural, right? [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3263.9399999999996s)]
*  Well they're going to encounter guys like that and they're going to try to figure out [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3267.9599999999996s)]
*  to it. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3271.56s)]
*  Or they're going to get better at what they're doing, you know, like that combat Samba style [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3272.56s)]
*  and they'll get better at it and incorporate other things to it. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3278.6s)]
*  But Khabib's done that too. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3281.2s)]
*  You just don't see it as much. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3282.64s)]
*  Like when he submitted Justin Gagey, he submitted him with a mounted triangle and then he finished [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3284.18s)]
*  him off of his back and put him to sleep. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3288.66s)]
*  Like he can do all those other things too. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3290.72s)]
*  That was his last match. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3292.3599999999997s)]
*  That was his last match. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3293.3599999999997s)]
*  But he almost got Dustin at the end of the first round and then finally submitted him [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3295.3199999999997s)]
*  in the second round. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3300.48s)]
*  But it was brilliant. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3301.48s)]
*  But it was as good as you'll ever see like an elite Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu black belt do [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3302.48s)]
*  it. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3308.1600000000003s)]
*  So he can do that too. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3309.1600000000003s)]
*  He can submit you off his back too. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3310.1600000000003s)]
*  But that pressure, that top pressure and the ability to take guys down and control them [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3312.12s)]
*  and beat the fuck out of them, smash what he calls it. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3316.1600000000003s)]
*  By the way, side note, Paige Van Zandt tweeted that she was single yesterday. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3319.76s)]
*  Oh no. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3323.7200000000003s)]
*  Just in case y'all was wondering. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3324.7200000000003s)]
*  Is she tweeting stuff like that? [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3325.7200000000003s)]
*  She tweeted and I'm single. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3327.14s)]
*  Given the amount of dick pics that must be coming that lady's way. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3329.16s)]
*  It must be like Locust. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3335.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3336.0s)]
*  But it's like you gotta, the thing is you gotta be able to beat her to qualify. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3337.0s)]
*  She's not fucking a dude weakening her. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3341.04s)]
*  No. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3342.7599999999998s)]
*  You remember those like videos you'd see of like Kansas in the 1950s when the Locust [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3343.7599999999998s)]
*  would hit? [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3347.24s)]
*  You can't even get to your car. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3348.24s)]
*  That's probably what the dick pics are like coming at Paige Van Zandt. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3352.2799999999997s)]
*  Must be unstoppable. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3355.3999999999996s)]
*  I mean it was probably like that beforehand. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3356.3999999999996s)]
*  Like it was probably pretty bad beforehand but now she's like I'm single everybody. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3358.24s)]
*  She just put the bat signal up. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3361.4399999999996s)]
*  Right. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3363.12s)]
*  If she said I'm single and she said I'm single on fucking social media. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3364.12s)]
*  I'm like yeah just get on one of them apps to get on hinge or something. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3368.3599999999997s)]
*  She doesn't have to do that. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3371.8799999999997s)]
*  No? [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3372.8799999999997s)]
*  No. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3373.8799999999997s)]
*  Just filter through those DMs. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3374.8799999999997s)]
*  Do they have a dating app just for fighters? [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3375.8799999999997s)]
*  That's a good question. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3376.8799999999997s)]
*  There's not enough of them. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3377.8799999999997s)]
*  No? [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3378.8799999999997s)]
*  It's so hard to become a fighter. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3379.8799999999997s)]
*  Oh yeah I guess that's true. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3380.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah you doubt, I mean, and to find female fighters? [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3381.8799999999997s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3385.56s)]
*  Good luck. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3386.9199999999996s)]
*  She might have been kidding. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3388.64s)]
*  Oh just joking around? [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3390.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah there's a tweet she was doing to, it had to do with the football player quarterback [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3391.6800000000003s)]
*  for the Jackson. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3397.48s)]
*  Oh she's joking. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3398.48s)]
*  Okay. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3399.48s)]
*  Like if they did good her husband would like that or something like that and then they [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3400.48s)]
*  won so she says am I single now? [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3404.64s)]

*  Okay. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3407.6800000000003s)]
*  Sorry Paige. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3408.6800000000003s)]
*  But see a lot of motherfuckers like me, she still got, she still got those dick pics. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3409.6800000000003s)]
*  Of course. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3416.16s)]
*  She said it in a chain of tweets but that one was by itself an individual tweet. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3417.3999999999996s)]
*  Most people like us just read that one and be like yes. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3422.8799999999997s)]

*  She's free. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3428.8399999999997s)]

*  How fast are those guys nut? [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3462.48s)]
*  Oh probably immediately. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3464.36s)]
*  Like as soon as they touch it. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3465.36s)]
*  Because the other thing too is like porn stars know how to take away all the insecurity [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3468.44s)]
*  and all of that. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3478.04s)]

*  The lady you've been jacking off to for the past five years. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3499.92s)]
*  Even though I never believe that someone's a virgin. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3502.92s)]
*  You don't believe it? [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3506.52s)]
*  I don't believe that. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3507.52s)]
*  Like they might have been a virgin when they flew in but their first time wasn't on camera. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3508.52s)]
*  You don't think so? [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3513.0s)]
*  She probably gave them a handy off camera and then was like. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3514.48s)]
*  But what if they can't get it up a second time? [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3517.7200000000003s)]
*  What if they've been beating off all day like a maniac? [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3519.52s)]
*  Oh well the porn industry has a solution for all that. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3521.6s)]
*  Like a needle in your dick? [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3524.32s)]
*  They'll inject you something. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3525.6400000000003s)]
*  They'll give you a pill. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3526.72s)]
*  If you don't believe it, Tom Segura has a list of videos I think he can show you that [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3527.72s)]
*  can give you examples of this. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3531.72s)]
*  Of them shooting. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3533.64s)]
*  No there's just a website I know of that he knows of that it's like porn bloopers where [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3534.64s)]
*  all sorts of the stuff that doesn't make it onto the normal videos. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3539.2799999999997s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3542.7999999999997s)]
*  It's like the Cutting Room Four scenes. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3543.7999999999997s)]
*  See I don't like porn bloopers. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3544.7999999999997s)]
*  To me it reminded me of when you remember growing up how the comedy TV shows were like [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3548.12s)]
*  Family Mad is full house. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3553.48s)]
*  These shows you're watching how every now and then they would do like a serious episode [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3555.0s)]
*  that would like tell you to stay off drugs or some shit. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3558.6800000000003s)]
*  I hated that. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3561.4s)]
*  Like I didn't come here for that. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3562.4s)]
*  When I'm watching porn, I ain't watching porn for laughs. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3563.4s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3565.92s)]
*  I'm trying to beat my dick and keep it moving. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3566.92s)]
*  I don't want to watch you know or it's like when they break character or something. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3568.96s)]
*  I hate it when they giggle. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3572.76s)]
*  No don't have fun. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3574.2400000000002s)]

*  Thankfully for you there's a lot of categories. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3582.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah there are. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3584.68s)]
*  Is there anything on earth with more variety to choose from than porn? [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3585.68s)]
*  Is that like the most common? [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3589.64s)]
*  If you think about like if you looked at each individual clip that's available online as [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3591.24s)]
*  a one individual piece of work, is there more porn than any other kind of content? [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3595.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3602.12s)]
*  The only exception, the only thing that could even come close to hanging with porn is cat [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3603.2799999999997s)]
*  videos. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3610.16s)]
*  What about TikToks now? [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3611.8399999999997s)]
*  TikToks are probably closing in. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3612.8399999999997s)]
*  TikTok is, everything on the internet is mostly porn and cats. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3615.8399999999997s)]

*  There's a lot of puppy stuff too. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3621.68s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3623.16s)]
*  That's what drives tech. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3624.16s)]
*  Porn drives tech. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3626.08s)]
*  It's like the unspoken secret. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3627.08s)]
*  It really does. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3628.48s)]
*  It drives innovation in terms of like that's it drove streaming. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3629.48s)]
*  VCRs wouldn't have existed if porn videos weren't getting sold everywhere. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3632.48s)]
*  If Betamaxes won, everybody would have had a Betamax player. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3635.72s)]
*  Who streamed 4k first? [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3638.48s)]
*  Did they? [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3640.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3641.6s)]
*  Porn was first with the 4k. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3642.6s)]
*  Porn proliferated like the VR stuff. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3644.3599999999997s)]
*  You know what's interesting? [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3646.3999999999996s)]
*  Industries get bailed out when things happen and they collapse because people say, well, [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3648.3199999999997s)]
*  we can't afford to let this industry die off like the banking industry. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3653.48s)]
*  Everybody would lose their money. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3658.3599999999997s)]
*  We can't do that. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3660.08s)]
*  Other industries have been bailed out too when things go wrong. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3661.2s)]
*  But when even like people complained about the music industry. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3664.08s)]
*  Remember when Napster came along? [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3668.96s)]
*  Everybody was so upset. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3670.44s)]
*  So upset. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3672.48s)]
*  About Napster? [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3673.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3674.48s)]
*  Because all of a sudden people are just taking their content for free. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3675.48s)]
*  But that happened to the porn industry? [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3677.32s)]
*  No one said shit. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3678.56s)]
*  Tough shit. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3679.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3680.56s)]
*  It's like everyone's pretending they don't use it. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3681.56s)]
*  But they flipped it. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3683.6800000000003s)]
*  They figured out how to bring it back around. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3684.6800000000003s)]
*  Because now a lot of porns, what they'll do is they'll give you almost the whole video [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3687.0s)]
*  and they'll cut it off at the cum shot. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3693.52s)]
*  They're like, if you want to see the rest of this. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3696.2s)]
*  Well they'll get more traffic than they would without it. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3699.0s)]
*  But still more people are going to watch it for free. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3701.48s)]
*  But I guess it's just like one of those things. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3703.2s)]
*  Like you catch as many fish as you can. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3705.12s)]
*  How much money do you think was spent on OnlyFans last year? [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3706.64s)]

*  I'm surprised. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3725.48s)]
*  Really? [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3726.48s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3727.48s)]
*  Four point eight billion dollars. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3728.48s)]

*  Jamie, you were talking about this yesterday. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3732.48s)]
*  Are we going to reach a future where every girl is on OnlyFans? [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3734.48s)]
*  Why wouldn't a young, if you were 16 and they're like college, were you going to go $200,000 [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3737.68s)]
*  in debt? [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3742.68s)]

*  You spend all that money on college. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3752.9199999999996s)]
*  Any woman that is remotely good looking that's complaining about not having any money, I'm [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3755.7599999999998s)]
*  like you just. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3759.08s)]
*  Yeah, but they don't want to do that. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3760.08s)]
*  There's a lot of girls that don't want that. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3761.8799999999997s)]
*  I understand that, but if push comes to shove, because nobody wants to be a whore. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3763.7599999999998s)]
*  There's also the line that we dug, or maybe someone else did, like the bad baby, the girl [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3770.3199999999997s)]
*  from Dr. Phil Show, she barely is showing anything and she makes almost the most money [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3775.4399999999996s)]
*  of anyone. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3779.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3780.16s)]
*  Is that the case with most of the girls that are making a lot of money? [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3782.08s)]
*  How much is a lot of money? [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3784.8399999999997s)]
*  That's the next arguable point. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3785.8399999999997s)]
*  How much money do you need? [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3787.3199999999997s)]
*  Or there's some couples, like a couple do it, like they fuck on camera, they cut their [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3788.64s)]
*  heads off, and they pay their bills. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3792.7999999999997s)]
*  They frame their heads out. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3796.44s)]
*  It's like a push comes to shove, it's like a decent proposal. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3797.68s)]
*  You remember that movie? [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3800.3999999999996s)]
*  It's like, yo, babe, this dude wants to fuck you and he'll pay off our house in Sennock [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3803.08s)]
*  is the college. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3807.92s)]
*  One time. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3809.24s)]
*  I know you don't want to be a whore, but let's at least talk about it. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3810.24s)]
*  Most women would be like, absolutely not, but it's like, okay, wait a minute now. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3814.96s)]
*  We're going to pay off the house, babe. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3817.8399999999997s)]
*  What do you think would happen if prostitution was completely legal? [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3821.04s)]
*  Well first of all, it would make it safer for the sex workers. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3825.12s)]
*  100%. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3827.7999999999997s)]
*  Because it's one of those things that everyone pretends like they don't do, or they don't [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3828.7999999999997s)]
*  participate in. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3833.0s)]
*  Everyone watches porn. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3834.0s)]
*  At least every man watches porn. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3836.68s)]
*  Well there's a lot of men who have sworn off of it because they realize they had a problem [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3838.76s)]
*  with it. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3842.92s)]
*  A lot of people talk about that now. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3843.92s)]
*  There's like a no porn movement among some guys. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3845.48s)]
*  Porn I think for a lot of people is like gambling. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3849.2s)]
*  Some people just get addicted, and they're on it all the time, and it frames the way [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3852.44s)]
*  they think about sex. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3857.4s)]
*  And then some people, they just decide because of that, I'd rather just have none. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3859.0s)]
*  No porn. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3865.56s)]
*  Yeah, I have a few friends that did that. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3867.04s)]
*  They don't watch porn. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3868.7599999999998s)]
*  It's not a bad move. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3869.7599999999998s)]
*  But it's nice to know it's there. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3871.7999999999997s)]
*  It's always going to be there. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3873.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3874.88s)]
*  For other people. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3875.88s)]
*  But you know, it's the gambling argument too. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3876.88s)]
*  Even less so because everybody has sexual urges for the most part. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3879.88s)]
*  Not everybody has gambling urges. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3883.44s)]
*  One of the things I had to argue against, I had a debate thing in college, I had to [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3885.0s)]
*  argue that porn was not harm. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3890.2s)]
*  Because it's a big move, porn, its existence is harmful to women. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3892.52s)]
*  You know, that all the women in it are being exploited. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3898.68s)]
*  And to some degree, that's true, but most of that is because like you said, if prostitution [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3900.7599999999998s)]
*  was legal, it would cut back on all the exploitation. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3904.04s)]
*  The thing is you can't make it illegal because you can't take away a person's right to do [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3907.6s)]
*  whatever they want to do. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3911.92s)]
*  Like those couples. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3913.4s)]
*  Those couples that cut their heads off. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3914.72s)]
*  They frame their heads out so you don't see them. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3916.84s)]
*  That's 100% up to them. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3919.0s)]
*  You can't tell them they can't do that. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3921.3599999999997s)]
*  What about selling your body? [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3922.3599999999997s)]
*  Because I think... [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3923.3599999999997s)]
*  But also, why is it okay to give sex away for free, but it's not okay to pay for it? [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3925.08s)]
*  That doesn't make any sense. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3930.8399999999997s)]
*  I mean, it's also okay to pay for it indirectly. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3931.8399999999997s)]
*  Well it's also okay to pay for massages. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3934.8799999999997s)]
*  Nobody wants to rub your fucking feet. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3937.4399999999996s)]
*  Right. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3939.16s)]
*  But someone rubs your feet and they get money for it. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3940.16s)]
*  Like we allow people to do things they don't want to do that are pleasurable to other people. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3942.24s)]
*  Well the thing is, listen, to me I look at it just like, okay, it's illegal for me to [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3947.4s)]
*  give a politician money directly. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3952.04s)]
*  It's also illegal for me to buy them something. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3954.6400000000003s)]
*  But I can't pay a woman for pussy, but I can buy her something for pussy. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3958.48s)]
*  Well you can pay her, she just can't report it. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3964.0s)]
*  Even though you should. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3968.6000000000004s)]
*  Did you know that you can still report illegal stuff to the IRS? [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3969.6000000000004s)]
*  They encourage you to do so. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3973.2400000000002s)]
*  Really? [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3974.8s)]
*  There's a form for ill-gotten gains. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3975.8s)]
*  That's interesting. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3978.84s)]
*  And it's so they, you know, because that's how they... [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3979.84s)]
*  They don't get you for tax evasion. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3981.48s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3983.2000000000003s)]
*  Which is worse. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3984.2000000000003s)]
*  And legally, technically, they can't use it against you. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3985.2000000000003s)]
*  Isn't that how they got Al Capone? [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3987.96s)]
*  That is how they got Al Capone. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3988.96s)]
*  It's tax evasion. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3989.96s)]
*  He's not the only one. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3990.96s)]
*  That's how they got Wesley Snipes. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3991.96s)]
*  But yeah, but Wesley Snipes wasn't a fucking criminal. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3993.96s)]
*  Wesley Snipes was just an actor who got bad advice. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=3997.48s)]
*  Right, right. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4000.92s)]
*  Capone never fired a federal income tax return claiming that he had no taxable income. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4002.52s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4007.24s)]
*  That's not untrue, right? [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4008.24s)]
*  I guess he had no taxable income, right? [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4010.48s)]
*  IRS Special Agent Frank Wilson and the T-Men followed the money gathering evidence that [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4013.04s)]
*  Capone had made millions of dollars on income that was never taxed. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4017.72s)]
*  Yeah, so that's why the smart ones, like the Russians, they open businesses. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4021.84s)]
*  They buy businesses. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4025.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4026.88s)]
*  And they use those businesses to launder money. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4027.88s)]
*  Yeah, well the smart rich people will... [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4029.68s)]
*  These are criminals, not just rich people. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4033.2s)]
*  Right. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4035.3199999999997s)]
*  We're talking about crime. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4036.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4037.3199999999997s)]
*  Ill-gotten gains. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4038.3199999999997s)]
*  And it's like, how you get a paper trail back when there was hardly no paper? [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4039.3199999999997s)]
*  Well, he had houses and cars and fucking... [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4043.12s)]
*  He, you know, Al Capone was a flashy dude. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4046.92s)]
*  He was old school mafia, John Gotti style. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4049.48s)]
*  He was the king of Chicago. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4052.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4054.36s)]
*  I can't imagine living like that, though. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4055.36s)]
*  That's a scary way to live. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4056.96s)]
*  Always looking over your shoulder, always having to be afraid. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4058.32s)]
*  Because you know, the old saying is like, if you're a criminal, you have to get lucky [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4061.8s)]
*  every day. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4066.12s)]
*  And the cops only got to get lucky once. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4067.12s)]
*  That you just got to slip up one time and the cop just happened to catch a detail or [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4069.52s)]
*  something, you know? [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4074.12s)]
*  Well, you know the Comedy Store was owned by the mob. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4075.12s)]
*  Yeah, when it was C-Rose, right? [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4077.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4078.8s)]
*  Yeah, I hear it, but it's hard for me to tell, because I heard that from the same people that [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4079.8s)]
*  told me it was haunted. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4082.64s)]
*  It was Bugsy Seagulls. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4083.64s)]
*  Bugsy Seagull owned the Comedy Store. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4084.64s)]
*  Wow. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4087.2799999999997s)]
*  Didn't he make sure that's true? [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4088.2799999999997s)]
*  Bugsy Seagull owned C-Rose. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4089.2799999999997s)]
*  He at least was one of the owners. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4091.3199999999997s)]
*  It might have been multiple owners. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4092.72s)]
*  Is that what it was? [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4094.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4095.16s)]
*  Mitzi was originally renting out just the O.R. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4096.16s)]
*  Well Mitzi took over long after C-Rose was gone, and then another thing came after C-Rose, [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4098.5199999999995s)]
*  and then Mitzi took it over after the other thing. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4104.36s)]
*  Okay. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4106.5199999999995s)]
*  Mitzi and her husband. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4107.5199999999995s)]
*  So they were never renting it from the mob? [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4108.5199999999995s)]
*  I don't believe so. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4110.28s)]
*  I think they owned the building. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4111.96s)]
*  It says it was owned by an entrepreneur, William Wilkerson, but then it says only to have control [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4114.04s)]
*  of the resort rested. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4120.12s)]
*  Maybe wrestled is what it's supposed to say, from him by mobster Bugsy Seagull. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4121.76s)]
*  Oh, so Bugsy Seagull took it from him. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4124.56s)]
*  Stole it. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4126.8s)]
*  That probably happened all the time. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4127.8s)]
*  Do you want to die? [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4129.28s)]
*  Or do you want to just give me your club? [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4130.28s)]
*  You can open up another club, stupid. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4131.28s)]
*  Yeah, you can have it. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4132.28s)]
*  Yeah, they just would do that just to flex. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4133.28s)]
*  To take shit from you? [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4136.28s)]
*  Just take shit from you. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4137.88s)]
*  What are you going to do? [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4138.88s)]
*  You can't do anything. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4139.88s)]
*  There's nothing you can do. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4140.88s)]
*  Nothing you can do. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4141.88s)]
*  They'll kill you. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4142.88s)]
*  They owned the police. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4144.72s)]
*  They owned everybody. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4145.72s)]
*  When there was no real, no one was filming things, there was no DNA evidence. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4146.72s)]
*  Come on, man. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4154.68s)]
*  They just ran shit. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4155.68s)]
*  That's back when you could just go to jail from a hunch. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4156.68s)]
*  Do you know how many people are buried in the Nevada desert? [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4158.96s)]
*  Look how they find these people in Lake Mead. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4162.72s)]
*  As Lake Mead dries up, they're finding all these dead bodies. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4164.56s)]
*  They found six dead bodies down there. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4167.84s)]
*  Some of them are people that drowned. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4169.72s)]
*  One of them was a guy who drowned saving his son, and his son remembered it. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4171.16s)]
*  Oh, man. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4174.599999999999s)]
*  His son's a grown adult now, and it's scary. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4175.599999999999s)]
*  That's a great way to remember your dad. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4179.5199999999995s)]
*  I guess, yeah. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4181.0s)]
*  Your dad saved your fucking life. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4182.0s)]
*  There's worse ways. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4183.48s)]
*  There's worse ways. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4184.48s)]
*  There's worse ways. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4185.48s)]
*  There's quite a few people, probably, that they haven't found in Lake Mead that just [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4186.48s)]
*  got fucking shot and dumped there. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4191.16s)]
*  They got one guy who was dressed like from the 1970s. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4192.639999999999s)]
*  They found him in a barrel. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4195.2s)]
*  You know what? [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4196.2s)]
*  They probably found a lot of motherfuckers. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4197.2s)]
*  They demolished one of them casinos. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4198.92s)]
*  They found a lot of motherfuckers. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4201.68s)]
*  Under the cement. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4202.68s)]
*  For sure. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4203.68s)]
*  There's a lot of bodies there. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4204.68s)]
*  For sure. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4205.68s)]
*  For sure. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4206.68s)]
*  They did that just for a goof. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4207.68s)]
*  That's what Mikey is, that cocksucker, that fucking rat. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4208.68s)]
*  We buried him right here. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4211.28s)]
*  For sure. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4212.4800000000005s)]
*  Do you think the mob still exists? [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4213.4800000000005s)]
*  100%. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4215.76s)]
*  Just not as powerful? [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4216.76s)]
*  Well, they probably have learned from their mistakes. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4218.76s)]
*  They probably do it in a way that's a little bit more clever. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4222.36s)]
*  The problem with the way John Gotti did it, that was when people think about the mob, [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4226.4800000000005s)]
*  they think of John Gotti. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4230.48s)]
*  They walk around in those expensive suits and shit. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4231.48s)]
*  The problem with that is he was in front of everybody's face. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4233.679999999999s)]
*  Everybody knew it. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4237.08s)]
*  Whereas Vincent the Chin Gigante, he would walk around in a bathrobe like he was crazy [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4238.08s)]
*  and he would talk to himself. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4243.12s)]
*  He would walk around in the neighborhood like he was schizophrenic. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4244.12s)]
*  That was his hustle. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4247.36s)]
*  That's how they would say he's running the mob. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4248.84s)]
*  They'd be like, what? [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4250.92s)]
*  This crazy guy? [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4251.92s)]
*  Talking to himself? [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4252.92s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4253.92s)]
*  The problem is they put microphones. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4255.64s)]
*  They knew the way he walked, the route. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4257.8s)]
*  So they put microphones. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4260.6s)]
*  They parked their own cars there and put microphones in all these different cars. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4261.76s)]
*  So as he walked by, they could record all the different shit that he was saying. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4265.52s)]
*  Damn. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4269.28s)]
*  So he's ordering hits. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4270.28s)]
*  I thought it was going to be like, they did it with bees or hornets. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4271.28s)]
*  And as soon as one gets in his face, he's like, motherfucker! [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4276.04s)]
*  He just started talking straight. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4278.68s)]
*  That's normally. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4279.68s)]
*  Son of a bitch, who the fuck? [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4280.68s)]
*  You ever see that video of the dude who's a newscaster? [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4282.4400000000005s)]
*  This black guy? [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4286.72s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4287.72s)]
*  That's one of the OG classic. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4288.72s)]
*  That's one of the classic videos. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4289.72s)]
*  He's got the full broadcaster voice going, motherfucker! [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4292.96s)]
*  It's hilarious. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4297.240000000001s)]
*  On that Thursday here at Augusta High School that led to Chris Wood's death. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4298.240000000001s)]
*  The fuck is that? [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4301.72s)]
*  That's amazing. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4309.72s)]
*  This is one of the best things on the internet ever. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4310.76s)]
*  It's amazing. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4312.76s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4313.76s)]
*  It's like, why can't someone just be themselves and tell you the fucking news? [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4314.76s)]
*  If that's who that guy really is, why do I need him to pretend that he is neutral broadcast [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4319.92s)]
*  voice man? [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4325.360000000001s)]
*  I don't know why. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4326.360000000001s)]
*  I don't know where the broadcast voice came from. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4327.360000000001s)]
*  Oh, actually, you know what? [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4329.04s)]
*  I have a theory. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4330.04s)]
*  And I might be right about this. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4331.04s)]
*  I think it came from when microphones weren't as good and you had to enunciate for the whole [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4332.32s)]
*  — [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4342.2s)]
*  Annunciate very clearly. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4343.2s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4344.2s)]
*  Because when I was in the service, we had to be like, we had to say over the radio, [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4345.2s)]
*  we had to say numbers a certain way. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4349.12s)]
*  Like five was fife. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4350.84s)]
*  Like you had to say it like that so that it got through. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4351.84s)]
*  Crackles and shit. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4355.2s)]
*  So I'm guessing that came from those times when it went out. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4357.16s)]
*  But I don't know. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4359.88s)]
*  It might have also come from the theater where you had to talk really loud because there [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4360.92s)]
*  was people in the back of the room where there was no microphone. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4364.32s)]
*  So the earliest performances, like live performances, were theaters probably. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4367.12s)]
*  Or when someone was speaking in front of a large group of people. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4372.16s)]
*  When you're speaking in front of a large group of people, you have to talk like this so they [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4375.08s)]
*  can hear you. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4379.68s)]
*  Well I wonder, I'm sure somebody will hit me up. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4381.36s)]
*  Somebody email me and tell me the answer. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4383.96s)]
*  Yeah, recording equipment had something to do with it. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4385.52s)]
*  Yeah? [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4387.84s)]
*  Yes. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4388.84s)]
*  Why do they still do it? [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4389.88s)]
*  What about the way they used to act in the old, old movies? [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4391.04s)]
*  Were they over acted? [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4394.08s)]
*  Oh, that voice was... [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4395.08s)]
*  So a lot of things we do that don't make sense, it was just fuck the English. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4397.72s)]
*  Yeah, so like the reason we spell certain words differently and all that, that was on [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4402.56s)]
*  purpose. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4408.64s)]
*  It didn't just happen naturally. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4409.64s)]
*  And our old TV voice was like a counter to their... [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4410.96s)]
*  Hello, big British. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4416.28s)]
*  It was our version of their fucking highfalutin, what they call it over there, posh. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4418.96s)]
*  Posh. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4423.5599999999995s)]
*  It was a counter to their poshness. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4424.5599999999995s)]
*  We had our own posh voice and it was that fucking early TV voice. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4426.0s)]
*  That's interesting. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4430.92s)]
*  That kind of makes sense. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4431.92s)]
*  Because everyone talked like that back then. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4432.92s)]
*  Or they tried to. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4434.24s)]
*  Yeah, and then you've got Australian, which is like a drunk English. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4435.44s)]
*  Oh yeah, wasn't you telling me about this? [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4438.88s)]
*  No, someone told me about this and maybe I told you after they told me. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4441.12s)]
*  No, no. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4444.24s)]
*  It was Shane Gillis was telling us. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4445.24s)]
*  That's right. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4446.4s)]
*  That first it was criminals and the babies would see their fathers be drunk and the babies [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4447.96s)]
*  started talking like their drunk English fathers. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4455.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4458.599999999999s)]
*  And then that became the Australian accent. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4459.599999999999s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4461.32s)]
*  Which I'm not sure if he was 100% sure that was it, but that was one of the theories, [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4462.32s)]
*  but I'm going to go with that. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4466.48s)]
*  Well, it is interesting how accents deviate, right? [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4467.48s)]
*  It's like who was the first guy to talk like someone from Boston and why did everybody [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4470.5599999999995s)]
*  copy that dude? [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4476.04s)]
*  You know the pack, you fucking cack. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4477.88s)]
*  Get over here, Brian Simpson. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4479.88s)]
*  What the fuck? [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4481.48s)]
*  And you don't have to be, it doesn't have to be that far away. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4482.48s)]
*  No. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4485.4s)]
*  Distinctive Australian accent is the result of a drunken slur caused by the heavy drinking [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4486.4s)]
*  of the early settlers, according to a communications expert from the country. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4490.98s)]
*  So it's true. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4494.24s)]
*  It's not just about pronunciation, vocal quality or timbre matters as does intonation, the [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4495.24s)]
*  way the pitch of the voice rises and falls. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4503.2s)]
*  Wow. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4507.48s)]
*  Vocal quality or timbre matters as does intonation. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4508.48s)]
*  So that's what it is. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4511.4s)]
*  Alright, Mike. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4513.6s)]
*  It's fucking better. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4514.6s)]
*  And then New Zealand is right there and it's a completely different... [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4516.68s)]
*  Totally different. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4519.64s)]
*  Well, also look at the states. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4520.64s)]
*  You could drive from one state to another state in the United States and they talk differently. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4522.44s)]
*  I used to have a joke about it about California. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4526.76s)]
*  Like people make fun of California accent. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4528.48s)]
*  I'm like, I'm sorry, we enunciate clearly. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4530.44s)]
*  Like California accent is talking like you could hear every word. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4533.0s)]
*  Oh, right, right. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4536.68s)]
*  And even within California. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4537.88s)]
*  Yeah, well in California there's different accents. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4540.0s)]
*  There's a lot of people that have kind of like a southern accent as you get into those [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4542.08s)]
*  farmlands and shit. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4545.360000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4546.6s)]
*  And then think, you can go from Vermont to Boston to New York to Philly to D.C. to Georgia [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4547.6s)]
*  to Alabama to Florida and it's all different accents. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4554.4800000000005s)]
*  You know? [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4559.68s)]
*  All different. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4560.68s)]
*  Well Florida is a mess, right? [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4561.68s)]
*  Because you got Florida accents. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4562.68s)]
*  What percentage of Florida is people that move from the East Coast, from the Upper East [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4564.28s)]
*  Coast? [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4568.28s)]
*  A lot. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4569.28s)]
*  A lot. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4570.28s)]
*  A lot. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4571.28s)]
*  A lot. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4572.28s)]
*  More now than ever before. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4573.28s)]
*  But even when I lived there, there was a lot of people that came from other places that [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4574.28s)]
*  came to Florida. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4576.48s)]
*  People would escape the cold. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4577.48s)]
*  My favorite accent is Louisiana. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4578.88s)]
*  That's a good accent. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4582.08s)]
*  New Orleans. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4583.08s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4584.08s)]
*  That's a good accent. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4585.08s)]
*  Because it's such a... [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4586.08s)]
*  It's a lot of flavor. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4587.08s)]
*  Jazz. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4589.08s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4590.08s)]
*  Jazz to it. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4591.08s)]
*  I watch the chefs on social media. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4592.08s)]
*  Oh yeah, man. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4594.12s)]
*  Like go on there and hit it with your seasoning there, nah? [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4595.12s)]
*  Yeah, when they're talking about Cajun cuisine too. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4597.12s)]
*  All those guys. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4599.36s)]
*  Or like Punky John. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4600.36s)]
*  You know Punky? [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4601.36s)]
*  Sure I know Punky. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4602.36s)]
*  Yeah, so Punky just... [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4603.36s)]
*  Her story is incredible, but she from New Orleans and the way she talked to you, it [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4605.12s)]
*  just make you feel good. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4610.44s)]
*  We talked about Punky when we were at the O2, remember? [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4612.4s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4614.92s)]
*  I love her. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4615.92s)]
*  I love Punky. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4616.92s)]
*  I'm so happy for her. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4617.92s)]
*  I remember her... [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4619.76s)]
*  So she's on SNL now, but I remember when she first got her big TV thing and I remember [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4620.76s)]
*  she... [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4626.36s)]
*  I remember watching her on TV while she was working the bar underneath. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4627.36s)]
*  That's wild. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4634.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4635.16s)]
*  A lot of people don't realize there's no big break anymore. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4636.16s)]
*  It's a bunch of little breaks. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4639.12s)]
*  Sometimes you get a big break, but you're better off with little breaks. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4640.64s)]
*  Because if you got little breaks, you can handle a big break. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4643.4s)]
*  A big break will fuck your head up if it happens all of a sudden. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4646.08s)]
*  That's why these 20 year old stars, good luck. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4648.92s)]
*  Yeah, I feel bad for them. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4651.84s)]
*  How do you... [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4653.4400000000005s)]
*  Even worse is when they're kids. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4655.36s)]
*  That's the worst. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4657.12s)]
*  Growing up a star is like a recipe for mental health problems. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4658.12s)]
*  It's child abuse. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4661.08s)]
*  It's like there's very few... [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4662.08s)]
*  Like Jodie Foster, I never talked to her, but she seems like she's got her shit together. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4663.68s)]
*  There's very few people that were very famous. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4667.24s)]
*  And Jodie Foster was in fucking Taxi Driver. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4669.400000000001s)]
*  Think about that creepy movie. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4672.14s)]
*  Right? [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4673.56s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4674.56s)]
*  That's a creepy movie. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4676.240000000001s)]
*  She was sexualized when she was very, very young in that movie. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4677.240000000001s)]
*  Or what happened to the kid from The Professional. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4679.120000000001s)]
*  Oh, I don't know. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4683.68s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4685.68s)]
*  That movie... [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4687.4800000000005s)]
*  That's a heavy fucking movie. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4688.4800000000005s)]
*  This would be one of my favorite movies, but try to watch it now and it's like this is... [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4689.4800000000005s)]
*  Natalie Portman. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4692.76s)]
*  Oh, Natalie Portman. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4693.76s)]
*  Oh, well, she's huge. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4694.76s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4695.76s)]
*  That was her. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4696.76s)]
*  She was really young then. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4697.76s)]
*  How old was she then? [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4700.0s)]
*  Oh my God, she's a little kid. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4701.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4702.0s)]
*  That's a crazy movie. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4703.0s)]
*  She was like flirting with him through the whole movie. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4704.44s)]
*  Right. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4706.44s)]
*  He doesn't flirt back though, right? [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4707.44s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4708.44s)]
*  That's okay. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4709.44s)]
*  My kids are allowed to pretend. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4710.44s)]
*  Yeah, but it was like... [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4713.44s)]
*  I think maybe... [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4715.24s)]
*  Is it better to be a child star and stay a star or to just do it real quick and leave? [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4716.24s)]
*  Well, it depends. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4722.32s)]
*  If you can do it real quick and then find something else that you really enjoy, that's [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4723.32s)]
*  great. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4727.44s)]
*  And then be successful at it, that's great. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4728.44s)]
*  But you remember when Gary Coleman was a security guard? [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4729.44s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4731.72s)]
*  He had to get a regular job and people would fuck with him. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4733.4400000000005s)]
*  He was super duper famous and very recognizable. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4735.76s)]
*  Want some coffee? [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4738.52s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4739.52s)]
*  Or you want some whiskey? [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4740.52s)]
*  No, no, no, a little coffee. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4741.52s)]
*  I'm going to do both actually. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4742.52s)]
*  Let's go. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4743.52s)]
*  You ever watch Game of Thrones? [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4744.52s)]
*  Yes. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4747.52s)]
*  Okay, you know the Joffrey kid? [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4748.52s)]
*  Yes. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4750.52s)]
*  He just dipped out. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4751.52s)]
*  Good for him. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4752.52s)]
*  After that he was like, I don't want to do this anymore. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4753.52s)]
*  So he's done acting totally? [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4754.52s)]
*  That's the impression I got, but... [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4757.12s)]
*  Bro, imagine your first role. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4758.96s)]
*  You have to play the cunt of all cunts. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4760.56s)]
*  And then when you die, you get poisoned. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4762.84s)]
*  Everybody's happy. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4765.16s)]
*  Dude, and here's what's so fucked up. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4766.16s)]
*  I read the books. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4769.0s)]
*  And I'll never forget being in... [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4770.84s)]
*  Because you got to understand too, in this show, in these books, there's no justice. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4773.5199999999995s)]
*  So he's the first motherfucker that you hope dies that dies. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4779.5199999999995s)]
*  Everyone else that died before that, you like them. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4783.44s)]
*  You don't want them to die. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4785.44s)]
*  But he's the first motherfucker where it's like, so I'm in the middle of an open mic [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4786.44s)]
*  reading these books. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4790.719999999999s)]
*  And he's on stage and I apologize profusely to this day, but when he died, I lost my shit. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4792.16s)]
*  I was like, yeah, in the middle of... [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4798.4800000000005s)]
*  I'm in the middle of like, yeah, die motherfucker. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4800.280000000001s)]
*  You know? [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4803.0s)]
*  Oh, that's so crazy. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4804.0s)]
*  I know, man. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4805.0s)]
*  I wanted him to die so bad. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4806.0s)]
*  So I hated this motherfucker from the beginning. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4807.0s)]
*  And he played the role so well, it's like, it's hard to... [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4809.56s)]
*  Like if I saw him in person... [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4812.68s)]
*  You would think of him as that guy. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4814.12s)]
*  Well, I mean, initially, you know, I mean, obviously... [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4815.6s)]
*  A little bit. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4817.72s)]
*  Yeah, I would try not to treat him that way, but it's still hard. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4818.72s)]
*  It's like, nah, motherfucker, your face is associated with evil. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4821.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4824.64s)]
*  Well, some guys, they do a role and that role is them forever. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4825.64s)]
*  Like Archie Bunker with Carole Conner. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4829.08s)]
*  He was Archie Bunker forever. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4831.4s)]
*  Yeah, I think what he's gonna do... [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4832.96s)]
*  That's him now? [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4833.96s)]
*  Yeah, he just got married. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4834.96s)]
*  Oh, look at that. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4835.96s)]
*  That's Joffrey? [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4836.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4837.96s)]
*  Wow. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4838.96s)]
*  See, I think he's gonna come back as an adult. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4839.96s)]
*  He looks like a country western star. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4840.96s)]
*  He looks like some cool guy who like, you know, plays country western music with Sturgill Simpson. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4842.92s)]
*  Doesn't he? [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4847.96s)]
*  Doesn't he? [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4848.96s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4849.96s)]
*  Totally does. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4851.92s)]
*  Like a completely different person. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4852.92s)]
*  Good for him. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4853.92s)]
*  Good for him. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4854.92s)]
*  Stay normal. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4855.92s)]
*  Look at him. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4856.92s)]
*  He's in church and shit. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4857.92s)]
*  I gotta imagine just psychologically being a kid and playing a very, very hated character. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4858.92s)]
*  You don't have any bright moments on stage where people like you. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4862.6s)]
*  You have nothing to be proud of. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4867.12s)]
*  Everything you do is horrible and awful. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4868.8s)]
*  That's my dream, though. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4870.64s)]
*  Be an evil person? [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4871.64s)]
*  I wanna, no, to play one. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4872.64s)]
*  In a movie or a TV show? [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4874.76s)]
*  I wanna play a villain in something. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4875.96s)]
*  I wanna play a villain so bad. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4878.24s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4879.92s)]
*  Why is that interesting? [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4881.88s)]
*  He giving me the judgmental eye? [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4882.88s)]
*  I'm just interested. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4884.84s)]
*  What about is appealing to you? [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4886.92s)]
*  I think, cause there's a part of you that wants to, it's a fantasy. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4888.56s)]
*  It's like there's a part of you that wants to play the villain. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4898.72s)]
*  When I play RPG video games or whatever, if there's a dark or night side, I always play [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4900.88s)]
*  the dark side. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4906.72s)]
*  There's a part of you that wants to live that fantasy. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4911.120000000001s)]
*  I just think I would do better. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4915.72s)]
*  I think it's easier to play a bad guy. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4918.4400000000005s)]
*  I think I would do better at it. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4920.6s)]
*  But you're such a nice guy in real life. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4922.52s)]
*  I'm kind. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4927.4800000000005s)]
*  I'm not nice. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4928.4800000000005s)]
*  I make that distinction, too, because I have to stop myself from being a piece of shit. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4931.4800000000005s)]
*  From being mean? [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4941.44s)]
*  That's a natural inclination. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4942.44s)]
*  My first thought is to be mean. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4943.879999999999s)]
*  Do you know that Jordan Peterson has this old saying about becoming hyper competitive, [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4945.48s)]
*  that people think that you should be docile. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4952.5199999999995s)]
*  He's like, no, you should be a monster and then learn how to control it. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4953.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I heard him say that. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4957.719999999999s)]
*  I like that. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4959.12s)]
*  Where it's like. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4960.12s)]
*  Yeah, just be ruthlessly ambitious and learn how to rein it in. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4961.12s)]
*  His take on it is a strong man is not a dangerous man. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4966.44s)]
*  A weak man is a dangerous man because they'll fold on you. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4971.52s)]
*  They have no character. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4975.64s)]
*  They have no confidence. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4976.64s)]
*  And also them being kind or them being pacifists, they don't have an option. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4979.4s)]
*  They can't beat people up. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4985.84s)]
*  They can't do anything. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4986.84s)]
*  So them being mean, that's not even possible. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4988.0s)]
*  I think that's why. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4990.76s)]
*  Physically, especially. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4991.76s)]
*  I have an aversion to shaky people. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4992.76s)]
*  Shaky people are dangerous. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4997.72s)]
*  They'll fall apart on you. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4998.72s)]
*  Or even people that are kind of chaotic. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=4999.72s)]
*  They'll fall apart. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5004.56s)]
*  I had such a chaotic upbringing, especially men. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5007.56s)]
*  When I meet men that are unpredictable, I'm like, I can't fuck with you. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5011.12s)]
*  You might be the best guy, you might be a nice guy, but I need distance from you because [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5014.52s)]
*  there's no telling what you're going to do. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5018.2s)]
*  Right. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5019.92s)]
*  Yeah, you're going to fold. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5020.92s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5022.08s)]
*  I get what he's saying. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5023.08s)]
*  If you're nice because you're weak, you're just being nice because you don't have a choice. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5026.08s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5032.6s)]
*  Somebody that could destroy you that chooses not to is more impressive than somebody that [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5033.6s)]
*  isn't doing harm because they can't. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5038.12s)]
*  Yeah, it's strength through kindness. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5039.96s)]
*  Kindness through strength, rather. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5041.92s)]
*  You choose to be nice. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5044.52s)]
*  You choose to be the person who takes the high road in things because you can go either [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5046.799999999999s)]
*  way. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5052.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5053.599999999999s)]
*  That's why when you see very famous people going after other famous people or going after [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5054.599999999999s)]
*  someone who's not famous, it's always very distasteful because this person is in this [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5059.36s)]
*  unusual position of strength and they don't use it the right way. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5063.639999999999s)]
*  There's a different obligation you have if you're in an unusual position of strength [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5069.32s)]
*  than a person who's just weak. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5073.679999999999s)]
*  See, my first instinct is to always be suspicious of those people. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5075.599999999999s)]
*  Weak people or strong people? [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5080.719999999999s)]
*  The people that are trying to destroy people. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5081.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5083.919999999999s)]
*  Or where it's like that's their whole thing. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5084.919999999999s)]
*  Their whole life is trying to destroy people. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5087.459999999999s)]
*  I'm always suspicious because they always turn out. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5091.5599999999995s)]
*  To be a piece of shit. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5094.16s)]
*  Right. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5095.959999999999s)]
*  For sure. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5096.959999999999s)]
*  They just want to hurt people. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5097.959999999999s)]
*  If that's where you put your resources in, is destroying other people, imagine. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5098.959999999999s)]
*  You have so little time in this life. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5102.919999999999s)]
*  You know how every time there's a politician whose whole thing is they hate gays and then [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5104.72s)]
*  they always turn out to be gay. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5111.96s)]
*  But people forget that applies to everything. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5115.120000000001s)]
*  If your whole personality is that you're against something, that's always suspicious to me. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5118.4800000000005s)]
*  It doesn't always turn out to be the case. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5125.76s)]
*  Right, but it's very often the case. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5127.56s)]
*  It's like the male feminist that's secretly a piece of shit. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5131.5599999999995s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5134.24s)]
*  There's a lot of those guys. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5135.24s)]
*  The gender traitor male feminists who just want to shoot down other men to make themselves [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5136.84s)]
*  look better. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5141.36s)]
*  There's a lot of that. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5142.36s)]
*  And there's women that do that too. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5143.36s)]
*  It's a human inclination to try to diminish other people. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5145.88s)]
*  To at least in appearance advance yourself. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5150.74s)]
*  But it doesn't really work. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5153.84s)]
*  It's one of those things like name dropping. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5155.48s)]
*  Name dropping doesn't work. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5158.08s)]
*  Yeah, we're hanging out with Leonardo DiCaprio and Quentin Tarantino. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5159.799999999999s)]
*  Shut the fuck up. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5163.12s)]
*  Nobody wants to hear that. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5164.12s)]
*  Right. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5165.12s)]
*  You could tell a story if it's a great story that like, dude, I'm hanging out with Gary [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5166.12s)]
*  Clark Jr. and we're getting high. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5171.0s)]
*  That's a great story. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5173.32s)]
*  It's not even a name drop. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5174.32s)]
*  It's just a factual story. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5175.32s)]
*  But if you're telling people, these people that you know, you're dropping names to try [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5177.08s)]
*  to elevate you socially, it has the opposite effect. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5181.28s)]
*  It's weird. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5184.28s)]
*  It has the opposite effect because whoever those people are, you're trying to connect [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5185.28s)]
*  yourself to a bad motherfucker. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5188.62s)]
*  But the way you're doing it lets everyone know you're not a bad motherfucker. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5190.5s)]
*  Nor do you have the character to become one. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5194.7s)]
*  Right. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5197.54s)]
*  It's one step down from like, do you know who my father is? [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5198.54s)]
*  It's right there. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5201.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5202.18s)]
*  It's kind of the same thing. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5203.18s)]
*  Or do you know who I am? [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5204.18s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5205.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5206.18s)]
*  Same thing. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5207.18s)]
*  Which I think in certain situations, like if someone tries to pick a fight with Hoist [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5208.18s)]
*  Gracie, you might be justified. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5211.0599999999995s)]
*  Right. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5213.099999999999s)]
*  He goes, excuse me, do you know who I am? [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5214.099999999999s)]
*  Or like, if you're about to go on stage at the O2 Arena and somebody stops you right [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5216.860000000001s)]
*  before you walk on stage. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5220.8s)]
*  What happened to you? [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5221.8s)]
*  They just didn't, first of all, they were, you know, English folks. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5223.740000000001s)]
*  They probably don't know too much about Americans. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5227.56s)]
*  Americans stand up or Americans, they probably didn't even know who the fuck I was. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5230.5s)]
*  The guy did apologize to me, but I'm never going to stop being so mad. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5234.3s)]
*  The lady checked my shit. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5238.26s)]
*  I was trying to go to the bathroom. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5239.700000000001s)]
*  Do you have a pass? [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5240.700000000001s)]
*  I go, I'm Joe Rogan. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5241.700000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5242.700000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5243.700000000001s)]
*  This place is sold out. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5244.700000000001s)]
*  I'm going to throw up. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5246.26s)]
*  Who's going to see me? [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5247.26s)]
*  I have to take a shit. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5248.26s)]
*  You see how that whole wall has my face on it? [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5249.26s)]
*  Yeah, that's this. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5250.26s)]
*  Hey, see that wall? [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5251.26s)]
*  Right. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5252.26s)]
*  It's like, come on lady. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5253.26s)]
*  I got to take a shit. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5254.26s)]
*  Let me through. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5255.26s)]
*  Because, well, you know what it is, is for some people it's just an honest mistake or [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5256.26s)]
*  whatever. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5258.26s)]
*  Yeah, it was an honest mistake with her. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5259.26s)]
*  Or they really don't know who you are or whatever. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5260.26s)]
*  But some people, and this is part of the reason that turned me off from the service, is like [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5261.26s)]
*  Some people, they use the rules as a shield. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5270.62s)]
*  Even though they know, because it's one thing, like, it's my show at the arena. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5277.099999999999s)]
*  My pictures are everywhere. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5283.46s)]
*  I walk up on you, you notice me, you don't recognize me, you can't see the picture. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5284.46s)]
*  And then I go, hey, I'm this person. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5288.9s)]
*  It's my show. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5292.22s)]
*  Now, from that point forward, if you continue to go, yeah, but now you're just an idiot [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5293.22s)]
*  that's hiding behind the rules because you know that even though what you're doing doesn't [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5299.1s)]
*  make any sense, you're protected because you followed the rules. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5302.38s)]
*  Well, it's also a thing when people have power over you, they don't want to relinquish it. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5307.18s)]
*  Even if they just have a little bit of power to keep you from going through somewhere. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5311.62s)]
*  They've already committed to this idea that they're going to stop you from doing something. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5314.74s)]
*  You know the Stanford prison experiment? [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5318.56s)]
*  I'm somewhat familiar with it. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5321.26s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5324.0199999999995s)]
*  I think it's been questioned recently. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5325.0199999999995s)]
*  So I think there's some doubt about whether or not it made sense the way they did it or [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5328.12s)]
*  whether people played it up. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5332.2s)]
*  But what happened was they got these students to pretend to be prison guards and prisoners. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5333.84s)]
*  And they ran this experiment where the prisoners were, you know, they had to listen to the [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5340.18s)]
*  guards and everybody immediately became a cunt, treated people like dog shit. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5343.16s)]
*  And they stopped the experiment early. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5347.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5351.2s)]
*  What was the pushback on that? [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5352.2s)]
*  See if we could find it. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5353.72s)]
*  They did a whole, they did a movie about it, right? [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5355.12s)]
*  Or a documentary about it. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5357.6s)]
*  I think there's a thing that people do when they have the ability, it's like a natural [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5359.68s)]
*  inclination. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5364.08s)]
*  People have been in control of people for so long, whether it's a dictator that controls [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5365.12s)]
*  the population or a general that controls the army or a plantation owner that controls [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5369.28s)]
*  the slaves. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5374.36s)]
*  There's always been people controlling people forever. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5375.52s)]
*  And you know what they would do? [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5378.12s)]
*  Give one of the slaves a gun. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5379.12s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5382.32s)]
*  And have him be the overseer. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5383.72s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5385.84s)]
*  And then now you have power. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5386.84s)]
*  It's like you have a gun now. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5388.92s)]
*  But now you have power over everyone else. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5391.599999999999s)]
*  And you're not- Overseer. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5394.8s)]
*  Isn't that in KRS-1, The Sound of the Police? [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5395.8s)]
*  Oh, probably, yeah. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5398.76s)]
*  That song. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5401.68s)]
*  Boop, boop, that's the sound of the police. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5402.68s)]
*  I was in Brazil in 2003 for the Abu Dhabi World Championships. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5405.0s)]
*  For kickboxing? [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5409.68s)]
*  No, Abu Dhabi World Championships for Jiu Jitsu. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5411.4s)]
*  Eddie Bravo was over there competing. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5415.04s)]
*  That was the year that he tapped out Hoyler Gracie. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5416.44s)]
*  It was the craziest upset ever. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5418.32s)]
*  It was insane, insane. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5420.72s)]
*  In Brazil- Is that what blew him up? [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5423.2s)]
*  100%, man. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5425.08s)]
*  He wasn't even a black belt yet. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5426.08s)]
*  Eddie was a brown belt. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5427.8s)]
*  And he tapped out Hoyce Gracie? [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5428.8s)]
*  Hoyler. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5430.4s)]
*  Oh, Hoyler Gracie. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5431.4s)]
*  He was like Hoyce's brother who was more successful even than Hoyce in Jiu Jitsu tournaments. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5432.4s)]
*  He's like one of the greatest Gracies of all time in terms of his accomplishments in winning [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5438.92s)]
*  World Jiu Jitsu tournaments. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5443.08s)]
*  He was the man. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5444.759999999999s)]
*  What did he tap him with? [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5445.759999999999s)]
*  A triangle off his back. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5446.759999999999s)]
*  It was amazing. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5448.16s)]
*  It was amazing. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5449.16s)]
*  When he locked it in, he went for an omoplata, Hoyler defended the omoplata and exposed his [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5450.5199999999995s)]
*  side and Eddie had- Like we were talking about legs that can move like hands. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5457.0s)]
*  That's Eddie's legs. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5461.16s)]
*  He has crazy leg dexterity. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5462.24s)]
*  He can do a lotus position. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5464.16s)]
*  He can just put himself in a lotus position. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5465.639999999999s)]
*  BJ Penn can do that too. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5469.639999999999s)]
*  Really? [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5470.639999999999s)]
*  They don't even have to use their hands. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5471.639999999999s)]
*  Eddie Bravo can put his legs behind his head. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5473.44s)]
*  He has crazy flexibility and leg dexterity. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5475.96s)]
*  It's very surprising. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5479.04s)]
*  So, if you're in his guard, you're fucked. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5480.04s)]
*  And Hoyler didn't know it. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5482.84s)]
*  And he was in Eddie's guard and Eddie just slapped that triangle on him and then started [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5484.2s)]
*  pulling the head. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5489.2s)]
*  And then Hoyler tapped and it was insane. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5490.24s)]
*  I was crying. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5492.8s)]
*  Oh man. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5493.8s)]
*  Yeah, I can't imagine. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5494.8s)]
*  I'll cry right now. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5496.8s)]
*  Did he even know? [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5498.44s)]
*  Did he think he was going to win? [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5500.44s)]
*  He had already beat Gustavo Dantes, who was also a world champion. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5504.28s)]
*  He tapped him before that. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5507.92s)]
*  That was his first match. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5509.88s)]
*  He got his back and tapped him. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5511.28s)]
*  And then he had this big match with Hoyler and they shut off all the other matches and [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5513.679999999999s)]
*  put all the cameras on this one thing. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5518.92s)]
*  So this footage? [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5521.88s)]
*  Yes. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5522.88s)]
*  Oh, I want to see it. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5523.88s)]
*  Yes. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5524.88s)]
*  You want to see it? [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5525.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5526.88s)]
*  It's one of the greatest experiences of my life. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5527.88s)]
*  I get emotional right now. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5530.2s)]
*  Yeah, because I can't even imagine. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5531.68s)]
*  That's real love for your homie. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5534.2s)]
*  For you to get that emotional because he won? [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5536.76s)]
*  It changed his life. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5539.54s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5540.54s)]
*  Because he was always this super talented guy. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5541.54s)]
*  He and I would talk about it. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5546.12s)]
*  We'd talk about all these jujitsu wizards and all these people that were like super talented. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5547.32s)]
*  I go, dude, you're a fucking wizard. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5550.88s)]
*  I'm like, you're really fucking good, like really good. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5553.36s)]
*  And he didn't want to kind of believe it for some strange reason. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5557.64s)]
*  He was very humble about his jujitsu. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5561.16s)]
*  He knew he was pretty good. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5563.0s)]
*  And then he started winning tournaments and he won the Abu Dhabis and then the West Coast [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5564.72s)]
*  trials. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5570.72s)]
*  And so he made it to Brazil. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5571.72s)]
*  And so this is him against Hoyler Gracie, who is the fucking man. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5573.14s)]
*  And Hoyler's on top of him, right? [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5577.14s)]
*  Now Hoyler has gotten to side control. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5579.38s)]
*  But Eddie does this thing called the jailbreak. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5581.26s)]
*  Look how he retains guard. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5582.820000000001s)]
*  It's the brilliant use of his legs because again, he has this insane leg dexterity. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5584.64s)]
*  So here, Hoyler is defending and then he catches him. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5589.38s)]
*  See that? [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5593.46s)]
*  Because Eddie had his wrist and it looked like he was trying to set up an omoplata and [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5594.900000000001s)]
*  then he locks him up in a fucking triangle. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5598.1s)]
*  And look at him squeezing. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5599.780000000001s)]
*  Hoyler's fucked. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5600.780000000001s)]
*  And he's trying to get out here. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5602.06s)]
*  But Eddie's, this is just death. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5603.740000000001s)]
*  And then Eddie finally grabs the head. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5605.26s)]
*  And when he grabs the head with the squeeze, Hoyler's tapping and that's it. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5607.22s)]
*  And so Eddie walks up and this is what he said. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5610.360000000001s)]
*  He said he couldn't believe it, but he walked around with his arms up in the air like he [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5612.1s)]
*  knew it was going to happen. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5615.68s)]
*  But while he was walking around, like he did a play by play of it on my podcast. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5616.700000000001s)]
*  And while he was walking around, he's like, I can't believe it. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5621.820000000001s)]
*  I can't believe it. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5624.18s)]
*  Then Hoyler hugs him. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5625.18s)]
*  And then he looks at me and he goes like this. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5627.3s)]
*  Like, huh. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5629.46s)]
*  It was one of the craziest things I've ever seen in my life. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5631.86s)]
*  Because for him to go there, he was such an underdog. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5634.28s)]
*  And he had this very strange style of jiu-jitsu that really he formulated. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5638.179999999999s)]
*  He came up with, it's not like he invented submissions, but he came up with new ways [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5643.0599999999995s)]
*  to set things up that were completely unique to him and his system. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5648.099999999999s)]
*  And that's how he created 10th Planet Jiu-Jitsu. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5652.12s)]
*  It's a very well thought out, really effective system, especially if you have leg dexterity. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5654.0599999999995s)]
*  That's me and him. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5659.86s)]
*  We're hugging. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5660.9s)]
*  Holy shit, man. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5661.9s)]
*  He's crying on my shoulders. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5662.9s)]
*  There are a few things better than watching somebody triumph. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5664.86s)]
*  It's amazing. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5667.66s)]
*  God damn. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5669.86s)]
*  It was crazy because you couldn't believe it. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5671.86s)]
*  You couldn't believe it happened. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5674.94s)]
*  When you're broken up. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5676.94s)]
*  You want a full man. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5680.94s)]
*  I'm pretty spat in. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5683.94s)]
*  Emotional, physical. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5685.94s)]
*  Oh, that's him talking about it. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5687.94s)]
*  Going over it. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5690.0199999999995s)]
*  So that was the birth of 10th Planet Jiu-Jitsu. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5691.0199999999995s)]
*  Then he came back. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5693.0199999999995s)]
*  John Jock Machado gave him his black belt. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5694.0199999999995s)]
*  John Jock took his black belt off. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5697.0199999999995s)]
*  After this match? [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5699.0199999999995s)]
*  After that match. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5700.0199999999995s)]
*  And put it on Eddie. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5701.0199999999995s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5702.0199999999995s)]
*  God damn. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5703.0199999999995s)]
*  It was wild, man. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5705.0199999999995s)]
*  It was wild. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5709.0199999999995s)]
*  So then Eddie started 10th Planet Jiu-Jitsu shortly afterwards. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5710.0199999999995s)]
*  Does he say that's the best day of his life? [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5714.0199999999995s)]
*  It's one of the best days of his life. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5718.0199999999995s)]
*  One of the best days of my life. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5719.1s)]
*  It was amazing. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5720.1s)]
*  God damn. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5722.1s)]
*  And then he came back. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5723.1s)]
*  I think he was going to call it Sumerian Jiu-Jitsu or something like that. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5724.1s)]
*  I forget. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5728.1s)]
*  Because the joke was back then Eddie and I would smoke a lot of weed and we would watch [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5729.1s)]
*  documentaries. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5734.1s)]
*  And we would watch. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5735.1s)]
*  The big one was we were really into Zechariah Sitchin. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5736.1s)]
*  Zechariah Sitchin was a linguist and a biblical scholar. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5740.1s)]
*  And he had this belief that if you decoded the Sumerian text, he's like the Sumerian [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5746.18s)]
*  text in his interpretation described a planet that came in an elliptical orbit every 3600 [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5753.18s)]
*  years close to Earth. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5761.18s)]
*  And that this planet was called Nibiru. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5763.18s)]
*  And that this planet, that there's these creatures on this planet called the Anunnaki. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5765.18s)]
*  And that human beings were the product of accelerated evolution. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5770.18s)]
*  So the Anunnaki came down here when we were basically lower primates in the jungle and [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5773.26s)]
*  they experimented with our DNA and turned us into what we are now. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5779.26s)]
*  And there's all these depictions of these gigantic beings. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5784.26s)]
*  And one of them has it on his lap is like a human but with a monkey's tail. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5790.26s)]
*  And he believes that that is like pointing to this link and that there's a detailed map [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5796.34s)]
*  of the solar system, which how the fuck did they know that right? [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5803.34s)]
*  Six thousand years ago. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5806.34s)]
*  How did they know that? [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5807.34s)]
*  But it had the sun in the center and it has all the planets in the correct orbit, like [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5809.34s)]
*  where they are. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5813.34s)]
*  And they're all like they're not the exact right size. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5814.34s)]
*  But obviously Jupiter is fucking massive and Earth is small in comparison. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5816.34s)]
*  But the bigger ones are in the right place. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5820.34s)]
*  So that's why he called it 10th planet. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5823.42s)]
*  So I came up with 10th planet. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5826.42s)]
*  That's my name. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5828.42s)]
*  Was he pissed? [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5829.42s)]
*  I was like, Sumerian Jujitsu, no one's going to know what that means, man. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5830.42s)]
*  I go, just call it 10th planet Jujitsu. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5834.42s)]
*  Like this shit is so crazy. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5836.42s)]
*  It's from over there. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5838.42s)]
*  Was he pissed when Pluto got demoted? [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5839.42s)]
*  No, we never counted that. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5841.42s)]
*  When Pluto got demoted, like you say you, says you. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5843.42s)]
*  I grew up, it was a fucking play. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5847.42s)]
*  Fuck you. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5849.42s)]
*  It's got to know you. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5850.42s)]
*  I grew up, it was a fucking play. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5851.5s)]
*  Fuck you. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5852.5s)]
*  It's got a name, bitch. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5853.5s)]
*  That's a planet. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5854.5s)]
*  I think the problem is Pluto is so small. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5858.5s)]
*  I think Pluto is smaller than the moon, which is weird. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5860.5s)]
*  Oh, by the way, the Sumerians counted the moon as a planet, I believe. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5864.5s)]
*  Oh, OK. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5868.5s)]
*  Because they called Nibiru the 12th planet. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5869.5s)]
*  OK. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5871.5s)]
*  We came up with 10th planet Jujitsu was just Eddie and I getting high, brainstorming names [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5872.5s)]
*  for the Academy. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5878.5s)]
*  Because I think Pluto doesn't clear its orbit is what they say. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5879.58s)]
*  Oh. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5882.58s)]
*  It's not the biggest. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5883.58s)]
*  So basically the biggest thing in that plane basically moves everything out of the way. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5884.58s)]
*  Pluto is about two thirds the diameter of Earth's moon. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5890.58s)]
*  Wow, smaller than the moon. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5893.58s)]
*  Probably has a rocky core surrounded by a mantle of water ice. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5894.58s)]
*  Interesting ices like methane and nitrogen frost coat the surface. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5897.58s)]
*  Due to its lower density, Pluto's mass is about one sixth of Earth's moon. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5901.58s)]
*  Whoa, you could fly on Pluto, just jump through the air. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5905.58s)]
*  Just like Superman. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5908.66s)]
*  That's the idea about Superman. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5910.66s)]
*  He came from an environment that's so dense that when he comes to Earth, he could just fly. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5911.66s)]
*  He just jump? [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5916.66s)]
*  Yeah, but the problem with that is like biologically, we know that what happens to people when they're [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5917.66s)]
*  in zero gravity is their bodies deteriorate like very rapidly. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5922.66s)]
*  Your bone density deteriorates very rapidly. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5926.66s)]
*  Like those guys that go up there for like six months, when they come down here, they're [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5929.66s)]
*  fucked up, man. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5932.66s)]
*  They can barely walk. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5933.66s)]
*  That's why those people that want to volunteer to be the first ones to go to Mars, it's like, [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5934.74s)]
*  y'all are dying. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5939.74s)]
*  That commander Chris Hadfield, we had him on the show. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5940.74s)]
*  That dear moon crew I was telling you about the other day, these guys are all going to [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5943.74s)]
*  take a trip around the moon. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5946.74s)]
*  When is that happening? [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5947.74s)]
*  Before the end of the year is supposed to right now. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5948.74s)]
*  Other things could stop that from happening. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5951.74s)]
*  But shouldn't they send a chicken out there first? [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5953.74s)]
*  I mean, I know that they lied about the CIA killing Kennedy. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5956.74s)]
*  We sure they told the truth about everything back then? [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5959.74s)]
*  We can do so many things and go wrong. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5962.82s)]
*  Steve Aoki, don't do it, Steve! [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5965.82s)]
*  Steve, I love you. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5968.82s)]
*  Don't do it. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5969.82s)]
*  Steve Aoki is a musician, right? [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5970.82s)]
*  Yes! [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5971.82s)]
*  All these people are creators and people that do stuff. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5972.82s)]
*  Oh, you mean none of them are astronauts? [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5975.82s)]
*  Steve, catch the flu. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5977.82s)]
*  Don't do it. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5980.82s)]
*  So this isn't the whole crew. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5981.82s)]
*  This isn't. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5983.82s)]
*  They're flying in the SpaceX autonomous dragon capsule. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5984.82s)]
*  This is a goddamn science fiction movie gone awry. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5988.9s)]
*  They're going to be on a planet fighting off dinosaurs. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5992.9s)]
*  Oh, have you seen that ad for that new movie with Adam Driver? [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5994.9s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5998.9s)]
*  Looks dope as fuck. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=5999.9s)]
*  I was like, this is like dark. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6000.9s)]
*  They go back 65 million years ago with modern weapons from the future. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6003.9s)]
*  What's the matter? [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6008.9s)]
*  But when does it come out though? [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6009.9s)]
*  Oh, I thought you just screamed. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6010.9s)]
*  Like someone bit you. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6012.9s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah, here it is. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6013.9s)]
*  Look at this. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6016.9s)]
*  This looks exciting. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6017.9s)]
*  I almost want to stop now. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6047.98s)]
*  Looks too good. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6053.98s)]
*  Dude, it's good. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6054.98s)]
*  I'm going to see it. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6055.98s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6056.98s)]
*  You need to see some of this. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6057.98s)]
*  They did a great job. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6058.98s)]
*  No, they did a great job with this. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6059.98s)]
*  You already know it's dinosaurs, bitch. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6061.98s)]
*  I ruined it. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6063.98s)]
*  Let's go see it. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6064.98s)]
*  I already ruined it. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6065.98s)]
*  I've located one survivor. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6066.98s)]
*  A giant. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6071.98s)]
*  Sam Raimi, so you know it's going to be really good. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6077.98s)]
*  These dinosaur footprints. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6089.98s)]
*  Oh shit. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6091.98s)]
*  Yeah, see, they just give you a little touch here and there. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6094.98s)]
*  65. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6100.98s)]
*  That's good. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6101.98s)]
*  65 million years ago. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6102.98s)]
*  Oh, the name of the movie, 65? [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6104.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6105.98s)]
*  Because it's about the age of the dinosaurs. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6107.0599999999995s)]
*  It goes back in time somehow. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6110.0599999999995s)]
*  It winds up on earth 65 million years ago. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6111.0599999999995s)]
*  Oh hey, Drasser Park. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6118.0599999999995s)]
*  Oh, man. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6119.0599999999995s)]
*  That's a great trailer though, damn it. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6121.0599999999995s)]
*  There's another good trailer I just saw too. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6123.0599999999995s)]
*  I'm not going to play it now, but the Oppenheimer trailer for. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6124.0599999999995s)]
*  Oh yeah, that looks great. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6126.0599999999995s)]
*  Christopher Nolan's movie looked really fucking sweet. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6127.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, that's Christopher Nolan. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6129.0599999999995s)]
*  The one thing I hate about. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6131.0599999999995s)]
*  Another guy who makes amazing movies. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6132.0599999999995s)]
*  One thing that bothers me about when they do asteroids in movies, asteroid fields, they [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6133.14s)]
*  make it seem like there's no way you would come close to an asteroid and just be surrounded [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6140.14s)]
*  by a whole bunch of other ones. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6146.14s)]
*  They're so far apart. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6147.14s)]
*  The way they always show them in movies is completely wrong. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6149.14s)]
*  I never even thought of that. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6154.14s)]
*  Yeah, there's no way you would have to dodge between. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6155.14s)]
*  But that's all the great Star Wars scenes. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6161.22s)]
*  Right, I know. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6164.22s)]
*  It makes for better action, but it's so inaccurate. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6165.22s)]
*  It bothers me because I know. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6168.22s)]
*  I wish I didn't. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6170.22s)]
*  Too late. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6171.22s)]
*  Yeah, ignorance is bliss. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6172.22s)]
*  It's like you ever heard Neil deGrasse Tyson break down the movie Gravity? [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6174.22s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6177.22s)]
*  He's like, her hair would not be like this. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6178.22s)]
*  And everybody's like, stop. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6180.22s)]
*  Stop. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6181.22s)]
*  The space stations are not that close to each other. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6182.22s)]
*  Stop. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6184.22s)]
*  It's right. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6185.22s)]
*  Let's talk about it after the movie. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6186.22s)]
*  You're going to ruin this shit. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6187.22s)]
*  Imagine watching a movie like that with him. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6188.22s)]
*  Oh yeah, you can tell. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6190.3s)]
*  He probably loses his mind in Lord of the Rings. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6191.3s)]
*  He's like, magic is not real. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6196.3s)]
*  Hey Neil. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6197.3s)]
*  Yeah, well he goes so far with his skepticism though that he's not open minded to the possibilities [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6198.3s)]
*  that alien life has visited Earth. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6205.3s)]
*  I'm not saying that it has, but he said, what is so interesting about us? [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6208.3s)]
*  We had an argument about it. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6213.3s)]
*  One of the rare times I've ever disagreed with him. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6214.3s)]
*  I'm like, we are so insane. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6216.3s)]
*  We have nuclear weapons. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6218.38s)]
*  We shoot video through the sky. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6220.38s)]
*  We'll go to South America to study a rare frog, right? [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6221.38s)]
*  They'll still spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on these expeditions to find these [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6225.38s)]
*  little deer that people can't see in Vietnam. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6229.38s)]
*  They're still alive. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6232.38s)]
*  They've done that before. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6233.38s)]
*  You don't think that a curious alien would want to look at a species that's on the verge [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6235.38s)]
*  of changing what type of civilization it is. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6242.38s)]
*  They're becoming integrated with technology and computers. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6246.46s)]
*  Artificial intelligence is ready to emerge. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6249.46s)]
*  Gene editing is a real thing that's being practiced right now and in levels that we [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6252.46s)]
*  probably aren't even aware of. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6257.46s)]
*  This is just, we know that one story because one guy got busted and he went to jail, but [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6259.46s)]
*  we know they did it. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6264.46s)]
*  So how many of them did they do that they didn't tell us about? [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6266.46s)]
*  Maybe they decided, maybe it'd be better if we just shut the fuck up. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6269.46s)]
*  See, I feel like every time I'm on here, we talk about the Fermi paradox because that's [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6272.54s)]
*  really what it boils down to. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6277.54s)]
*  It doesn't necessarily. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6278.54s)]
*  No? [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6279.54s)]
*  No, because we don't have the ability to see these places. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6280.54s)]
*  We don't have the ability to, we really don't have detailed imagery of any other planet. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6284.54s)]
*  We have very rough estimations of the temperatures. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6290.54s)]
*  No, I shouldn't even say rough. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6293.54s)]
*  I should say they're not precise. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6295.54s)]
*  Right. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6298.54s)]
*  So we don't know exactly what it's like there. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6299.62s)]
*  We don't know if there's life there. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6302.62s)]
*  We don't know what kind of life that would be like a life that could breathe a completely [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6304.62s)]
*  different environment, different kind of air than we breathe with different levels of gases. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6308.62s)]
*  It's totally possible. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6313.62s)]
*  If things breathe underwater. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6314.62s)]
*  The only example we have is Earth. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6316.62s)]
*  But even on Earth, we have so many variables. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6318.62s)]
*  Things breathe under fucking water, man. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6320.62s)]
*  I mean, we drown in there. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6322.62s)]
*  They die up here. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6324.62s)]
*  Like fish. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6325.62s)]
*  That's nuts. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6326.62s)]
*  There's a live shit everywhere. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6327.7s)]
*  Even places where you would think shit would be like, they found life around those. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6330.7s)]
*  Volcanic vents. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6336.7s)]
*  Those vents on the ocean floor. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6337.7s)]
*  Like acidic. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6338.7s)]
*  Like nothing should be able to be alive there. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6339.7s)]
*  And it's like a thousand degrees is coming out of there. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6341.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6344.7s)]
*  But also, I think if aliens, because mathematically they definitely exist. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6345.7s)]
*  At least it seems like highly likely that some life is out there, right? [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6350.7s)]
*  Highly likely. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6355.7s)]
*  But if, I feel like a species that was sufficiently advanced to be curious about us and study, [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6356.78s)]
*  we wouldn't be able to tell that they were here. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6362.78s)]
*  That's true too. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6364.78s)]
*  Unless they wanted us to know they were here. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6365.78s)]
*  Or unless they are not quite as advanced. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6367.78s)]
*  If there is an infinite universe that we're dealing with, and there's planets where life [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6370.78s)]
*  forms could have developed in a much more stable environment where they don't get hit [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6378.78s)]
*  by asteroids and they get to not just where we are, which is like a million years of evolution [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6381.86s)]
*  from the lower primates, but like 300 million years. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6387.86s)]
*  Like what if they just stay alive and they just continue to advance to the point where [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6390.86s)]
*  they're literally like gods. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6395.86s)]
*  They can travel through black holes. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6396.86s)]
*  They can transcend space and time. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6398.74s)]
*  They can instantaneously appear in any spot in the universe they want to. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6401.34s)]
*  The question would be like, would they want us to know about them yet? [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6405.54s)]
*  See, or even crazier than that. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6408.86s)]
*  Remember when we were in London? [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6410.94s)]
*  I was talking to Graham. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6412.94s)]
*  Graham Hancock. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6414.94s)]
*  Yeah, Graham Hancock. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6415.94s)]
*  How great was that dinner? [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6416.94s)]
*  Oh, it was awesome. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6417.94s)]
*  Graham Hancock and Guy Ritchie. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6418.94s)]
*  Yeah, because I remember when he first started telling me about his theory, it was almost [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6419.94s)]
*  like he expected me to be like, shut your stupid ass. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6425.94s)]
*  He expected me to react completely negative. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6428.94s)]
*  And he was shocked that I was listening. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6430.94s)]
*  I'm like, no, I want to hear what you got to say. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6432.94s)]
*  I don't know shit. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6434.94s)]
*  Well, his theory is based on asteroid impacts. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6435.94s)]
*  His combined with Randall Carlson's. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6439.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, he said he thinks that there may have already been a more developed human species [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6441.0199999999995s)]
*  that got wiped out, and they could have sent someone to another place. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6446.0199999999995s)]
*  It's totally possible that anyone who can build the pyramids could build anything. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6450.0199999999995s)]
*  If you can make that, we would struggle to make the pyramids today. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6455.0199999999995s)]
*  And I know people love to say, oh, human beings could do it. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6461.0199999999995s)]
*  Sure, we could do it. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6463.0199999999995s)]
*  But you have to realize there's two million, I think it's two million, three hundred thousand [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6465.1s)]
*  stones in the Great Pyramid of Egypt. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6469.1s)]
*  And some of them are cut from a quarry that's hundreds of miles away. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6472.1s)]
*  And these are massive, massive stones that were cut with such precision that in many [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6475.1s)]
*  cases when you're inside the pyramids before, like on the outside, everything's fucked up [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6480.1s)]
*  because it used to be covered in limestone, but people looted it and they broke off the [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6484.1s)]
*  limestone. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6488.1s)]
*  They built cities with it and shit. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6489.1s)]
*  OK, horrible. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6490.1s)]
*  A lot of like Cairo, apparently the early days, the people stole limestone from the [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6491.18s)]
*  Great Pyramids. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6495.18s)]
*  That's how goofy people are. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6496.18s)]
*  So that's all rough and fucked up on the outside. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6497.18s)]
*  But it didn't used to be like that. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6500.18s)]
*  It used to be flat and smooth to the point where it was probably polished and reflective. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6502.18s)]
*  Like they don't know exactly what it looked like, but they know that the precision inside [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6507.18s)]
*  in some of the areas like where you look at the stones, you can't even get a razor blade [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6511.18s)]
*  between those rocks. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6515.18s)]
*  And these are massive stones. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6516.18s)]
*  And the amount of calculations that are involved and the amount of precision that has to be [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6518.26s)]
*  involved and to take this design where you're stacking stones on, you can't have any errors [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6521.26s)]
*  when you get to the top. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6526.26s)]
*  You have so many stones, a millimeter here, a millimeter there. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6528.26s)]
*  You get to the top, you're all fucked up. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6533.26s)]
*  Do you think that Neal's skepticism comes from, because the other side of it is the [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6534.26s)]
*  speed of light. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6545.26s)]
*  Because that's the big huge barrier, right? [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6546.34s)]
*  Is it's like for us to be visited by an alien species, they would have had to have figured [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6549.34s)]
*  out a way to get around that. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6554.34s)]
*  Either to go faster than the speed of light or to have some kind of work around like warp [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6557.34s)]
*  bubbles or whatever the fuck that we... [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6564.34s)]
*  I think that's more likely it. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6566.34s)]
*  I think the way we're thinking about it is very archaic. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6568.34s)]
*  The fire comes out the back. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6571.34s)]
*  I think we're thinking about it like a catapult. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6573.34s)]
*  Back when they had a catapult, this is the shit, bro. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6575.42s)]
*  I got the new catapult. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6578.42s)]
*  It's like the Staccato 390 catapult with the fucking cut the ropes and that fucking rock [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6579.42s)]
*  goes flying. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6584.42s)]
*  That was as good as anybody. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6585.42s)]
*  No one ever thought missiles would come out of jets. [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6586.42s)]
*  You could have a hypersonic jet and shoot and fucking missiles. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6589.42s)]
*  That's the thing. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6592.42s)]
*  You talk to futurists and they're always wrong. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6593.42s)]
*  Yeah, you can't be right. [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6596.42s)]
*  You have rough estimates and guesses. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6597.42s)]
*  Talk about futurists in the 20s. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6599.42s)]
*  Didn't picture airplanes. [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6602.42s)]
*  They thought everyone would have a blimp. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6604.5s)]
*  Like everyone will have a personal blimp. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6606.5s)]
*  That's what they thought. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6608.5s)]
*  Dude, I had a dream about that once. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6609.5s)]
*  I had a dream, a world... [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6611.5s)]
*  I can't remember if it was a thousand or a million Nikola Tesla's. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6613.5s)]
*  I'm like think about what that guy was able to create and the ideas that he came up with [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6617.5s)]
*  by himself and imagine if there was a million of those guys. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6623.5s)]
*  A million Nikola Tesla's. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6626.5s)]
*  A million insane geniuses that create transcendent technology that we enjoy today. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6629.58s)]
*  He was trying to broadcast electricity through the air and wanted to give it to people for free. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6636.58s)]
*  Think about how... [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6641.58s)]
*  There's an old Voltaire quote where he says, something to the effect of I'm less impressed [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6643.58s)]
*  with Einstein's brain than the near certainty that people just as intelligent are dying [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6650.58s)]
*  in sweat shops and slave fields and shit. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6656.58s)]
*  Imagine if... [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6658.66s)]
*  Because all the geniuses we got, it was luck of the draw. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6659.66s)]
*  We got Nikola Tesla at the right time, with the right family, with the right money, [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6665.66s)]
*  with the right education. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6669.66s)]
*  Or Sir Isaac Newton, he was born a rich kid. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6670.66s)]
*  If he had been born a serf, we'd be 100 years behind on... [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6672.66s)]
*  That's probably totally true what you're saying. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6677.66s)]
*  So I want to go... [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6679.66s)]
*  If I ever had Elon money, like fuck you money, I would start a foundation that went around [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6680.66s)]
*  the world trying to find those fucking kids. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6686.74s)]
*  Like go find this, go pull the smartest... [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6689.74s)]
*  How about better yet, create them. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6691.74s)]
*  Oh shit, with CRISPR? [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6693.74s)]
*  Figure out a way to figure out... [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6694.74s)]
*  Not just that, but also with education. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6695.74s)]
*  I mean, a lot of it is access to things. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6697.74s)]
*  It's the things like if you read Malcolm Gladwell's The Outliers, one of the things [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6699.74s)]
*  that he'll talk about with certain incredible success stories, it's like the access that [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6704.74s)]
*  they had to all these different things that could help them. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6708.74s)]
*  Like Bill Gates, he had access to the computers at the university when he was a kid, and learned [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6712.82s)]
*  how to code very early on. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6717.82s)]
*  He was involved in it super early on. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6719.82s)]
*  I hate all these motherfuckers that act like... [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6721.82s)]
*  All of these tech people try to act like, oh, we started in the garage. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6723.82s)]
*  And they fail to mention that their garage was attached to a mansion. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6728.82s)]
*  Yeah, but it's still impressive. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6733.82s)]
*  It's impressive to... [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6735.82s)]
*  If you think about what Apple is, it actually did start in the garage. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6736.82s)]
*  Like Amazon, you ever seen the desk that Jeff Bezos used to have? [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6740.9s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, and he had Amazon written on white paper? [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6744.9s)]
*  Yeah, it was like one of them vinyl signs. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6747.9s)]
*  But you know what? [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6750.9s)]
*  His parents still loaned him like a quarter million dollars. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6751.9s)]
*  That's true. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6754.9s)]
*  Is that true? [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6755.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6756.9s)]
*  Quarter million? [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6757.9s)]
*  I don't know exactly how much it was, but it was over that. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6758.9s)]
*  It was that or over. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6761.9s)]
*  That's the Trump story too. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6762.9s)]
*  He got loaned millions of dollars by his dad. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6763.9s)]
*  And that's what I mean. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6765.9s)]
*  It's like access to the resources to... [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6766.9s)]
*  Yeah, look at that. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6767.9s)]
*  Ultimately, loaned him $245,000 in 1995. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6768.98s)]
*  By 2020, Bezos had transformed this into one trillion. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6771.98s)]
*  Dude, the investment... [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6776.98s)]
*  Wow. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6777.98s)]
*  That ain't bad. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6778.98s)]
*  It's a good return. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6779.98s)]
*  But you know what I was talking about just the other day? [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6780.98s)]
*  You know what makes me feel sorry, though, for billionaires like him? [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6783.98s)]
*  Is they can't really complain. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6786.98s)]
*  They can't really complain. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6789.98s)]
*  You know, it's like when we flew to London, I called my mother and complained. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6792.98s)]
*  And she was like, what? [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6798.0599999999995s)]
*  You know, it's like you can't complain to people that have less than you. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6801.0599999999995s)]
*  So you can only... [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6804.0599999999995s)]
*  That's true. [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6805.0599999999995s)]
*  It's fucked up that him and Elon got beef because they really the only two... [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6806.0599999999995s)]
*  Because obviously you can complain to your therapist or you can call, but somebody that [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6811.0599999999995s)]
*  really gets it, who the fuck else gets what it's like to be a trillionaire? [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6815.0599999999995s)]
*  Why do they have beef? [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6819.0599999999995s)]
*  What is the reason? [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6820.0599999999995s)]
*  I think it's just competition. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6821.0599999999995s)]
*  Like you said, they're competitive, ruthless motherfuckers. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6823.0599999999995s)]
*  And Bezos went to space first. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6826.14s)]
*  I really think that's what it is. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6829.14s)]
*  I mean, I would love to ask one of them, but I think... [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6832.14s)]
*  I would think that you'd be encouraging as many people as possible to develop space travel, [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6834.14s)]
*  especially like billionaires. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6838.14s)]
*  Or imagine if you're the richest man in the world and you wake up tomorrow and there's [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6839.14s)]
*  somebody else. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6842.14s)]
*  Maybe it's like a premise thing. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6843.14s)]
*  Like if you do a bit on a certain premise, then someone else is doing a bit on that premise. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6844.14s)]
*  You're like, motherfucker. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6847.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6848.14s)]
*  Sometimes it just gets created. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6849.14s)]
*  Like I remember hearing a long time ago, like when TikTok first started getting popular, [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6850.14s)]
*  like the number one girl on TikTok, and she woke up one day, she was number two, she hated [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6855.22s)]
*  that bitch. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6860.22s)]
*  I think it's just that competitive part of you that's just like, you don't really hate [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6862.22s)]
*  the person, but you see them as your opponent. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6866.22s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6869.22s)]
*  But I don't know, but it's weird that they've never had dinner together. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6870.22s)]
*  Because who else are you going to talk to? [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6873.22s)]
*  Maybe a Saudi prince? [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6875.22s)]
*  Right. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6876.22s)]
*  Who the fuck else are you going to complain to about billionaire problems? [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6877.22s)]
*  Right. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6880.22s)]
*  In the Saudi prince thing, remember when he got a, like they hacked his phone? [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6881.3s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6887.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6888.3s)]
*  They used that Pegasus software on his phone. [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6889.3s)]
*  He opened up a WhatsApp link. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6892.02s)]
*  Yeah, that's dumb. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6894.02s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6896.34s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, that's dumb. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6897.34s)]
*  Why would you click on a WhatsApp link? [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6898.34s)]
*  You don't know. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6900.7s)]
*  It's from your friend, your friend the billionaire. [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6901.7s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, who knows? [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6904.22s)]
*  Who knows what goes down? [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6906.46s)]
*  But also like, why would they need to? [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6907.820000000001s)]
*  It's Game of Thrones, bro. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6909.22s)]
*  They're playing Game of Thrones, but they're doing it a different way. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6911.58s)]
*  Because I have a thing, like I know that like, that when you get to that point, it's not [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6913.58s)]
*  even about the money anymore. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6918.94s)]
*  You know, it's about winning. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6922.46s)]
*  Like I don't think Jeff Bezos is checking his balance. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6923.82s)]
*  How could he? [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6926.98s)]
*  Probably fluctuates by a billion dollars every now and again. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6928.54s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6931.5s)]
*  Doesn't it? [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6932.5s)]
*  Like they always say, they lost 11 billion in this thing. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6933.5s)]
*  Like what? [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6935.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6936.62s)]
*  What? [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6937.62s)]
*  Like the stock price lost the most money in American history. [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6939.0199999999995s)]
*  Like it don't seem to be affecting him at all. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6941.66s)]
*  No, he's on a level, but also probably, but he's retired. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6944.34s)]
*  He doesn't, he's not the CEO of Amazon anymore? [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6949.099999999999s)]
*  No. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6952.22s)]
*  Oh, so he just has the stock. [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6953.22s)]
*  He's just balling on the yacht. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6955.26s)]
*  So why not just sell all the stock? [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6956.7s)]
*  I don't know what he's doing, man. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6958.099999999999s)]
*  Maybe that's part of the agreement, like he can't sell the stock. [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6960.099999999999s)]
*  That's the thing. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6961.94s)]
*  But what do you do when you can do anything? [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6962.94s)]
*  I do what he does. [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6967.58s)]
*  You just chill on the yacht? [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6968.58s)]
*  Do testosterone, start lifting weights, get a yacht, become a baller. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6970.06s)]
*  Yeah, I mean his yacht's pretty impressive. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6974.18s)]
*  They just put out a picture of his yacht the other day. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6976.26s)]
*  It looks like a small city. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6978.66s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6980.94s)]
*  Elon Musk doesn't even own a house. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6981.94s)]
*  What? [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6984.1s)]
*  Yeah, he just borrows people's houses. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6985.1s)]
*  Really? [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6987.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6988.42s)]
*  What's the... [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6989.42s)]
*  He says it's an attack vector. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6990.42s)]
*  So when people talk shit about him being rich, like, I don't even own a house. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6994.1s)]
*  He doesn't. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6998.820000000001s)]
*  He's got all that money, but he's like, your possessions, like your extravagant possessions [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=6999.820000000001s)]
*  that people look at, those are attack vectors. [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7005.18s)]
*  He's just brilliant. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7007.820000000001s)]
*  It's very smart. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7009.14s)]
*  Oh, so people attack you because you have them. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7010.14s)]
*  Yeah, well, they point to that. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7012.1s)]
*  People are pointing to Jeff Bezos' yacht. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7015.1s)]
*  We know he has... [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7017.3s)]
*  What does he have? [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7018.3s)]
*  Like 100 and... [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7019.3s)]
*  Did you know he's one of the first shareholders in Google? [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7020.3s)]
*  Kapow. [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7022.3s)]
*  Bezos? [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7023.34s)]
*  250K invested in 1998. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7024.34s)]
*  Kapow. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7025.34s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7026.34s)]
*  How about that? [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7027.34s)]
*  3.3 million shares in Google stock. [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7028.34s)]
*  Oh my goodness. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7029.62s)]
*  Worth 3.1 billion in 2017. [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7030.62s)]
*  Oh my goodness. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7031.62s)]
*  That's a nice return on your investment. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7032.62s)]
*  Elon or Bezos? [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7034.22s)]
*  $245,000. [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7035.22s)]
*  Bezos. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7036.22s)]
*  What was the initial investment? [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7037.22s)]
*  250K in 1998. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7038.22s)]
*  Yeah, but I feel like... [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7039.22s)]
*  He just took his parents' money and put it in there. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7040.22s)]
*  I feel like people are attacking him anyway. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7042.860000000001s)]
*  People don't like you anyway. [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7044.62s)]
*  Just go buy some shit. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7045.62s)]
*  Well, they're definitely still attacking Elon, right? [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7047.1s)]
*  What he says is that a house is an attack vector, meaning that's something that people [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7049.86s)]
*  point to. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7054.38s)]
*  If I had Elon money and somebody attacked me on Twitter, I would show up at their house [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7055.38s)]
*  and give them $100,000 and be like, go back on Twitter and say something nice. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7059.58s)]
*  Wow. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7063.66s)]
*  You'd be doing that all day long for the rest of your life. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7064.66s)]
*  No, you can't. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7066.66s)]
*  That's how you'd starve to death. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7067.66s)]
*  You'd never have time for anything else. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7068.66s)]
*  Did everybody would be lining up to curse you out? [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7070.78s)]
*  You'd be exhausted. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7072.78s)]
*  And people would get mad. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7074.62s)]
*  $100,000 only takes you so far. [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7075.62s)]
*  I'm back. [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7077.9s)]
*  I'm the Elon-hating-train. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7078.98s)]
*  No, he just banned the guy. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7079.98s)]
*  You know, there was a Twitter account called Elon's Jet? [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7082.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7085.42s)]
*  And the guy was telling people when his jet was taking off and landing, which is a little [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7086.42s)]
*  creepy. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7090.379999999999s)]
*  How is he getting the information? [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7092.94s)]
*  It's publicly available. [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7094.98s)]
*  But is it sort of... [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7095.98s)]
*  I think it's more complicated than that. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7097.54s)]
*  I think you have to take data from multiple different places. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7099.219999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7102.82s)]
*  And what he's doing is putting all that data together. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7103.82s)]
*  Is that fair to say? [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7105.74s)]
*  Is that accurate, Jamie? [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7107.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it says ADS-B data, which is publicly available records. [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7108.46s)]
*  But then you got to put it together and find probably tail numbers and stuff. [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7113.780000000001s)]
*  And then he's the one saying, this is him. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7117.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think he's putting it together from publicly available information, but it's still [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7120.14s)]
*  a little creepy. [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7125.46s)]
*  What is the point? [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7128.3s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7129.3s)]
*  He said he started to do it because he was a fan of Elon's. [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7130.3s)]
*  And then he wanted $50,000. [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7133.1s)]
*  And then Elon offered him money to stop or offered him a job to stop. [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7135.26s)]
*  I don't know what happened with that. [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7139.54s)]
*  I don't know what the exact specifics were. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7142.46s)]
*  But there was some sort of discussion about Elon giving him money or something like that. [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7144.9400000000005s)]
*  He says it's a safety issue. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7149.780000000001s)]
*  And I feel like if the richest man in the world is telling you, hey, man, what you doing, [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7152.62s)]
*  making me feel unsafe, and I need you to stop, and here's some money, I think you got to [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7156.1s)]
*  take that deal because... [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7160.7s)]
*  He offered $5,000 and then countered off. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7163.5s)]
*  The guy who runs the account asked for $50,000. [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7166.66s)]
*  He said he's using money for college and to possibly buy a Tesla Model 3. [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7168.62s)]
*  And that was, I guess, their last public exchange, maybe. [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7171.66s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7173.86s)]
*  That's not a bad... [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7174.86s)]
*  Look, that kid saying that, that's a good deal. [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7176.86s)]
*  He said he was a high school senior when it started, then he kept it going during the [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7179.259999999999s)]
*  pandemic. [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7183.099999999999s)]
*  $5,000 is not enough. [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7184.099999999999s)]
*  June 2020. [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7185.099999999999s)]
*  Elon, you got to make an offer they can't refuse. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7186.099999999999s)]
*  But here's the problem. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7187.82s)]
*  How does this prevent other people from doing the exact same thing and doing the same thing [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7189.14s)]
*  and trying to get more money? [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7194.9800000000005s)]
*  When does that end? [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7197.3s)]
*  Is that an industry now? [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7198.3s)]
*  Or is it tracking Elon's jet? [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7199.780000000001s)]
*  That's also why I think it was a mistake to go public with it. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7201.38s)]
*  Because the DMs weren't public until he made them public, until the guy running the account [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7206.1s)]
*  made it public. [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7210.3s)]
*  But is it a mistake for him? [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7211.3s)]
*  Because it's getting him a lot of attention. [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7214.34s)]
*  People are paying attention to it. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7216.58s)]
*  He might be able to monetize it. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7217.66s)]
*  It's weird, though. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7219.9s)]
*  It's definitely, it's definitely weird. [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7220.9s)]
*  And I would not like it at all. [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7223.1s)]
*  I don't think, I don't think it's a nice thing to do. [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7225.22s)]
*  He got more scruples than me. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7228.22s)]
*  Because if I had a trillion dollars, I'd have somebody knocking on your door. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7229.22s)]
*  Hey, listen, you want to make me uncomfortable? [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7232.42s)]
*  I'm going to make you, I'm going to make your whole family uncomfortable. [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7234.98s)]
*  We're not going to hurt you, but we're going to make you uncomfortable. [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7237.5s)]
*  If you won't stop doing this, I already offered to pay you, then I want revenge. [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7240.58s)]
*  I'm petty like that. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7245.38s)]
*  And that's probably not the smart move. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7246.38s)]
*  Do you think you're allowed to like film someone and put them, like every time they're out [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7248.18s)]

*  That could be stalking. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7257.26s)]
*  Is that stalking? [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7258.900000000001s)]
*  I think it depends on how you gather the information. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7260.26s)]
*  What if you just like track that guy's car? [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7261.86s)]
*  Say, I'm tracking his car. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7264.26s)]

*  because you think like you want to shame me for flying a private jet? [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7281.26s)]
*  Because that's the thing that a lot of people do, like the Taylor Swift and all these people [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7284.9800000000005s)]

*  Like, she's not driving four hours. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7310.179999999999s)]
*  Right. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7312.62s)]

*  I've been on an Amtrak train because when I lived in LA I would catch the train down [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7452.0s)]

*  Correct. [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7500.0s)]

*  That's so insane. [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7588.120000000001s)]
*  And I forget what his reasoning was. [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7589.120000000001s)]
*  I forget what he said. [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7590.120000000001s)]
*  How could he? [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7591.120000000001s)]
*  How did he just do that? [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7592.120000000001s)]
*  That's just the fuck up. [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7594.0s)]
*  You fucked up real bad. [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7595.0s)]
*  You fucked up real bad. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7596.0s)]
*  And she didn't die though. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7597.0s)]
*  Oh my god. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7598.0s)]
*  I think she broke all her bones. [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7599.0s)]
*  Oh my god. [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7601.56s)]
*  Oh my god. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7602.56s)]
*  Jesus Christ bro. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7603.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7604.56s)]
*  Did you get by a fucking train? [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7605.56s)]
*  At the very least, aren't you pretty much forgiven for whatever thing you got arrested for? [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7608.6s)]
*  What if it was just like meth? [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7613.04s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7616.04s)]
*  I forget what her crime was. [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7617.04s)]
*  She got caught with meth. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7618.04s)]
*  It was probably something like that. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7620.04s)]
*  But we can't talk about that in court. [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7622.04s)]
*  What prosecutor going to prosecute you when you just got fucked up? [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7627.04s)]
*  Not just that. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7630.84s)]
*  For sure she's going to sue. [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7631.84s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7632.84s)]
*  I would sue. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7633.84s)]
*  If she's still alive. [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7634.84s)]
*  I mean who knows how badly injured. [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7635.84s)]
*  She might be still alive but for how long? [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7638.28s)]
*  She got seriously injured. [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7640.28s)]
*  It says lost teeth, left arm broken, multiple fractured ribs, injuries to heads and legs. [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7641.28s)]
*  Head and legs. [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7648.28s)]
*  But she can still walk right? [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7649.28s)]
*  It says she's alive. [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7653.36s)]
*  It says two cops charged for leaving woman and vehicle. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7654.36s)]
*  Oh my god. [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7658.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7659.04s)]
*  But in the one cop, I mean first of all, where you fucked up at was stopping your car on [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7660.04s)]
*  the tracks. [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7666.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7667.5199999999995s)]
*  Why did the cop stop his car on the tracks? [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7668.5199999999995s)]
*  For sure. [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7669.5199999999995s)]
*  And why did he get it out of his fucking car? [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7670.5199999999995s)]
*  Like the whole thing is bonkers. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7671.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7673.5199999999995s)]
*  It's insane. [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7674.5199999999995s)]
*  I mean did she try to escape or something? [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7675.5199999999995s)]
*  Did he try to put her back in? [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7676.5199999999995s)]
*  I don't know what the story was. [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7678.0s)]
*  Two police officers have been charged with multiple felony and misdemeanor counts stemming [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7679.0s)]
*  from an incident which allegedly placed a handcuffed female suspect in a patrol car [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7681.36s)]
*  that was then hit by a train. [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7684.4s)]
*  Oh my god. [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7685.4s)]
*  Five counts of reckless endangerment. [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7686.759999999999s)]
*  One count each of obstructing a highway or other passageway, careless driving, parking [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7688.04s)]
*  or something. [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7691.28s)]
*  And you definitely don't get to call your son. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7692.28s)]
*  Because he didn't even try to save her. [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7693.28s)]
*  It's so scary, dude. [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7696.72s)]
*  I mean probably nothing he could have done. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7697.72s)]
*  It might not have been, right? [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7699.72s)]
*  I don't know how much time there was in that. [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7701.280000000001s)]
*  He was on the tracks. [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7703.56s)]
*  He might not have been able to do anything to get out of the way. [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7704.56s)]
*  Which is like, what do you do? [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7708.400000000001s)]
*  Do you die with her? [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7709.400000000001s)]
*  She was charged with one count of felony menacing. [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7710.6s)]
*  She got charged? [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7714.280000000001s)]
*  No. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7715.72s)]
*  Before that or after that? [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7717.120000000001s)]
*  Lewis Gonzalez suffered serious injuries following the collision and has since been [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7718.120000000001s)]
*  released from the hospital. [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7721.68s)]
*  She is charged with one count of felony menacing according to the district attorney's office. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7722.68s)]
*  Menaces when? [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7726.68s)]
*  It's like, nah, I'm gonna need you to drop that. [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7727.68s)]
*  I'm gonna need you to drop that. [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7729.68s)]
*  How insane is that they're still charging her? [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7731.44s)]
*  It's obviously still ongoing, I believe so. [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7734.76s)]
*  I don't know that it's even made it to court yet. [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7736.76s)]
*  Yeah, because you can get charged with stuff and then they'll decline the prosecute. [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7738.5599999999995s)]
*  That's happened to me before. [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7742.76s)]
*  What does menacing mean? [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7743.84s)]
*  Like she's threatening somebody? [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7744.84s)]
*  Let's see. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7745.84s)]
*  I'll Google felony menacing. [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7746.84s)]
*  That's the craziest case of karma ever if that's the case. [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7751.0s)]
*  Menacing. [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7753.84s)]
*  The criminal offense generally defined as displaying a weapon with the intent of placing [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7755.56s)]
*  another person in fear or imminent physical injury or death. [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7759.32s)]
*  Oh, she pulled a weapon on somebody. [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7762.4400000000005s)]
*  So who knows what that story is? [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7765.84s)]
*  Public menacing. [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7768.0s)]
*  Who knows what that story is? [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7769.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7771.12s)]
*  The problem with that is like, who knows what that person did? [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7772.28s)]
*  Who knows if she was defending herself? [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7775.64s)]
*  But imagine getting hit by a train and then still having to go to prison. [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7779.360000000001s)]
*  Oh my God, that's so insane. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7784.24s)]
*  Because ultimately she didn't harm anyone. [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7785.8s)]
*  You know? [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7788.28s)]
*  Right, she scared them. [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7789.28s)]
*  Yeah, so imagine still having to go to prison with all your bones broken and everything. [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7790.28s)]
*  Does it say with the intent? [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7794.16s)]
*  I'm looking right now, I'm trying to reel back on the story on why they pulled her over. [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7795.16s)]
*  The definition though, can you read the definition again? [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7799.24s)]
*  Of what? [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7801.92s)]
*  Menacing? [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7802.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7803.92s)]
*  Oh, sorry. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7804.92s)]
*  Does it say with intent? [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7805.92s)]
*  Listen to me like I'm a fucking lawyer. [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7806.92s)]
*  I just want to clarify for the record, Your Honor. [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7807.92s)]
*  The definition of the dictionary says, suggesting the presence of danger, threatening, a menacing [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7812.04s)]
*  tone of voice. [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7817.28s)]
*  To be menacing to someone is occurring when an individual knowingly places another person [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7819.04s)]
*  in fear by means of threat or physical action. [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7823.32s)]
*  So yeah, that would be intent. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7825.5199999999995s)]
*  Oh, but that's just, that's not a weapon though. [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7826.5199999999995s)]
*  I thought you said it was a weapon. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7829.36s)]
*  The first thing I read as Wikipedia is, I'm reading multiple definitions. [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7831.08s)]
*  So if I go, bitch I'll kill you, that's menacing? [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7833.6s)]
*  Isn't that assault? [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7836.4s)]
*  Probably menacing. [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7838.08s)]
*  No, it can't be assault, right? [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7839.08s)]
*  Or is there verbal assault? [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7840.76s)]
*  Yeah, assault is just making someone afraid. [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7842.4800000000005s)]
*  Here's the, again, here's the Wikipedia so we can read that again. [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7844.04s)]
*  Menacing or brandishing in a criminal offense. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7847.4400000000005s)]
*  Oh, is a criminal offense. [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7850.6s)]
*  So or brandishing. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7852.360000000001s)]
*  Generally defined as displaying a weapon, but it's generally menacing. [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7854.92s)]
*  Generally defined. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7857.76s)]
*  But it could be like, what if someone was an MMA fighter and they were threatened to [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7858.76s)]
*  beat your ass. [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7862.6s)]
*  Oh yeah, because you could be menacing by stalking. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7863.6s)]
*  Oh. [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7865.360000000001s)]
*  Idaho has a different definition than Ohio. [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7866.360000000001s)]
*  So it's, you know. [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7868.96s)]
*  Okay. [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7869.96s)]
*  Well, so something. [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7871.16s)]
*  Who knows? [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7874.76s)]
*  So just threatening. [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7875.76s)]
*  Probably. [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7876.76s)]
*  It's threatening somebody, baby. [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7877.76s)]
*  Who knows? [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7878.76s)]
*  But Jesus Christ, getting hit by a fucking train. [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7879.76s)]
*  You know, Matt Hughes, former UFC welterweight champion, got hit by a train. [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7884.72s)]
*  No. [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7889.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7890.24s)]
*  Yeah, he has been recovering over the last few years using a lot of stem cells. [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7891.24s)]
*  Oh yeah, I do remember this. [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7896.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7898.16s)]
*  He's at a cellar place in Columbia, which a lot of MMA fighters go there and they have [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7899.36s)]
*  great results. [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7904.36s)]
*  He's going there and he's done a bunch of videos of him there doing different stem cell [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7905.36s)]
*  therapies. [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7910.2s)]
*  Here's what happened to begin with. [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7911.2s)]
*  It says, multiple law enforcement agencies responded to a report of road rage incident [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7913.4s)]
*  involving a firearm in Fort Lupton on Friday evening. [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7917.76s)]
*  A Platteville police officer stopped Rios Gonzalez's car just past a set of railroad [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7921.24s)]
*  and parked the patrol vehicle on the crossing. [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7927.120000000001s)]
*  She was placed in the back of the police vehicle, which was hit by the train as officers were [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7930.160000000001s)]
*  searching her car. [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7935.8s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7937.160000000001s)]
*  They were searching her car while they parked their car on the fucking train with her in [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7939.6s)]
*  it. [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7944.040000000001s)]
*  So there's no excuse for that. [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7945.040000000001s)]
*  No. [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7947.080000000001s)]
*  I mean, how the fuck do you not know the train's coming? [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7948.080000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7951.080000000001s)]
*  And you're a cop in this area? [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7952.080000000001s)]
*  And then they could hear it. [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7953.080000000001s)]
*  It wasn't like it was a quiet train. [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7954.080000000001s)]
*  And both of them were probably just so locked in. [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7955.88s)]
*  And then by the time they realized it was coming, they were like, I mean, what the fuck? [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7960.28s)]
*  You definitely don't get to be a hero. [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7968.64s)]
*  Imagine being in that fucking car when that train's coming. [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7969.64s)]
*  Woo. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7972.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7973.44s)]
*  That's a crazy way to go. [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7974.44s)]
*  Because being in a situation where you know, where you really know that there's harm coming. [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7975.44s)]
*  They've gotten rid of people that way too, you know. [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7981.68s)]
*  What do you mean? [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7983.8s)]
*  They parked them on the tracks. [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7984.96s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7986.400000000001s)]
*  Like murdered them and then parked them on the tracks. [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7987.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, definitely. [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7989.12s)]
*  Tape your hands on the steering wheel. [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7990.12s)]
*  Do you know that's how they found out about the drug trafficking in MENA, Arkansas? [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7992.2s)]
*  No. [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7996.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7997.12s)]
*  There was a guy named Barry Seal. [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7998.12s)]
*  And he was going back and forth to like, I guess it was Columbia. [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=7999.4400000000005s)]
*  Why does that name sound familiar? [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8002.4400000000005s)]
*  Because they did a movie on him with Tom Cruise. [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8004.8s)]
*  OK. [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8006.4400000000005s)]
*  Think it's called American Maid? [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8007.4400000000005s)]
*  Is that what it's called? [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8008.4400000000005s)]
*  It's a great fucking movie. [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8009.4400000000005s)]
*  But, you know, Barry Seal's was not handsome like Tom Cruise. [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8010.4400000000005s)]
*  So it's weird. [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8013.56s)]
*  But the movie's great. [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8014.56s)]
*  Wow, Tom Cruise played this in the movie? [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8015.64s)]
*  Yeah, that's very cool. [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8016.96s)]
*  He didn't gain weight or anything. [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8017.96s)]
*  He's like, fuck you. [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8018.96s)]
*  Tom Cruise was like, hey man, I can't look like that. [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8019.96s)]
*  He's like, listen, I'm not going to look like that. [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8022.96s)]
*  I'm Tom motherfucking Cruise. [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8024.400000000001s)]
*  I can pretend. [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8026.080000000001s)]
*  Now go see Tom Cruise in American Maid. [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8027.080000000001s)]
*  Now watch the difference of what his character looks like. [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8029.52s)]
*  Just looks like a wild man. [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8036.320000000001s)]
*  Just got some crazy hair. [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8037.84s)]
*  That's it. [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8039.160000000001s)]
*  Damn, I've never seen this movie. [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8040.160000000001s)]
*  Well, it's a true story. [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8042.080000000001s)]
*  The movie is obviously a dramatic adaption or a true story. [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8044.679999999999s)]
*  They took some dramatic license, some theatrical added things. [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8050.08s)]
*  They had creative power over the storyline a little bit. [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8055.839999999999s)]
*  But in it, Barry Seals gets pardoned by Bill Clinton. [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8059.5199999999995s)]
*  For what? [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8064.12s)]
*  There was something that happened where he got in trouble and he said, call this number. [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8065.12s)]
*  And Bill Clinton lets him off the hook. [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8069.36s)]
*  In the Tom Cruise movie. [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8071.4s)]
*  There's a scene right here that supposedly happened. [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8073.96s)]
*  Play it. [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8078.64s)]
*  I'm Dana Siboda. [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8079.64s)]
*  He's just been arrested. [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8080.64s)]
*  You've got DEA, ATF, FBI all wanting their pound of flesh. [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8081.64s)]
*  It's bad. [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8082.64s)]
*  It's quite real. [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8083.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8084.64s)]
*  Well, you hit to trifecta, didn't you? [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8085.64s)]
*  I mean, guns, drugs, money laundering. [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8086.64s)]
*  And the state of Arkansas is going to rip the bark right off of you, boy. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8087.64s)]

*  Do it. [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8179.64s)]
*  He sticks his arms out to get unhandcuffed. [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8182.64s)]
*  He's free to go, boys. [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8186.64s)]
*  What the hell do you mean he's free to go? [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8187.64s)]
*  Explain what's going on here. [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8189.64s)]
*  He's free to go. [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8190.64s)]
*  Free to go? [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8191.64s)]
*  You boys should have taken the caddies. [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8193.64s)]
*  I'll be seeing you, Seal. [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8199.64s)]
*  Oh, you won't. [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8202.64s)]
*  So this is in the movie. [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8203.64s)]
*  It at least implies, without specifically saying it. [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8208.64s)]
*  Does he deny this? [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8212.64s)]
*  Yo, when that motherfucker, when his memoirs come out, that's going to be a motherfucker. [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8215.64s)]
*  So this is what happened. [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8219.64s)]
*  These kids died on this train track in Mena, Arkansas. [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8221.64s)]
*  And the police reported that, the police report stated that they were intoxicated. [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8225.64s)]
*  And they fell asleep on the train track. [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8231.64s)]
*  And that's how they died. [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8234.64s)]
*  Then the parents did an autopsy and they found stab wounds on the kids. [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8235.64s)]
*  And so they knew that the kids had been murdered and placed there. [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8241.64s)]
*  So an investigation started. [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8244.64s)]
*  And then during the investigation, they realized that that was where Barry Seal would do his drug drops. [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8245.64s)]
*  So he would fly into these airports and instead of flying in with giant bags of cocaine and then getting arrested when he landed, [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8251.64s)]
*  he would throw them out the back of a fucking plane with parachutes and they would land. [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8259.64s)]
*  Like these bags, or I don't know if they had parachutes. [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8265.64s)]
*  They just throw these bags out at like, you know, a low altitude. [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8267.64s)]
*  And he had drop points where he dropped these bags. [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8272.64s)]
*  And one of these, these two kids, one of these bags landed and they saw it. [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8275.64s)]
*  And they went over and started fucking with it. [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8280.64s)]
*  And then when the people went to find and retrieve the bag, they found these kids and they murdered them. [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8283.64s)]
*  And so then people started talking and then they found the story of this guy, Barry Seals, and he was arrested. [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8289.64s)]
*  And on his way to trial, he gets murdered with George Bush's phone number in his pocket. [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8295.64s)]
*  Barry Seal. [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8304.64s)]
*  Barry Seal. [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8306.64s)]
*  Man, stop playing. [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8307.64s)]
*  Listen, this is the ultimate story. [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8309.64s)]
*  Is all that in the movie too? [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8311.64s)]
*  I don't know if they put that in the movie, but find out if that's true because I'm pretty sure it is. [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8312.64s)]
*  The ultimate story was this guy was smuggling drugs into the United States a lot, flying back and forth to South America. [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8315.64s)]
*  He had all these photos and he worked in cooperation at one point in time with whatever federal government that was investigating. [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8326.64s)]
*  I think it was, was it Noriega? [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8333.64s)]
*  Who would he get in trouble? [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8338.64s)]
*  Medellin. [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8341.64s)]
*  It was the Medellin Cartel? [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8342.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8343.64s)]
*  So was it Pablo Escobar that he got photographed with? [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8344.64s)]
*  So he got like photos for them of like all these different drug dealers all hanging out together. [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8346.64s)]
*  Pablo Escobar. [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8353.64s)]
*  I suppose that's how I got caught. [[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8354.64s)]
*  Those pictures came back and were released publicly before he had even landed on that flight. [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8355.64s)]
*  So that's how they found him. [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8360.64s)]
*  And they were like, oh, well, we know who Barry is. [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8361.64s)]
*  Yeah. So they murdered that dude. [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8363.64s)]
*  Somebody murdered that dude. [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8365.64s)]
*  But that guy was bringing in drugs and he wasn't making all the money himself. [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8367.64s)]
*  He was a pilot and I'm sure he got a piece. [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8371.64s)]
*  I'm sure he got paid really well, but he was doing it for other people. [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8374.64s)]
*  It is Spinelli. [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8377.64s)]
*  I'm trying to, I don't know who this guy is. [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8378.64s)]
*  Let me see. [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8380.64s)]
*  I think it might have been a previous agent. [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8381.64s)]
*  So he was an agent at one point in time. [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8384.64s)]
*  This says he was his pilot. [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8386.64s)]
*  Was he an agent? [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8387.64s)]
*  His personal pilot and had his phone number in his back pocket. [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8388.64s)]
*  Okay. It says, for example, Spinelli said one of the big conspiracy theories around Barry is that he was George H.W. Bush's personal pilot. [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8391.64s)]
*  And when Barry was killed, he had Bush's phone number in his back pocket. [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8398.64s)]
*  Neither filmmaker felt it was appropriate to include that unsubstantiated theory. [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8401.64s)]
*  But they also knew that astute audience members might already be familiar with it. [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8406.64s)]
*  That's a good way of like saying it might have happened. [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8410.64s)]
*  So then why did they include the Clinton thing? [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8413.64s)]
*  Because the Clinton thing definitely did happen. [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8415.64s)]
*  And the thing about it is, it's like, how, what, what was going on? [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8418.64s)]
*  Like this guy was bringing in cocaine. [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8423.64s)]
*  And if you really thought about it, you go, okay, if you were some big time government agency, right, and you knew there is no fucking way we're stopping all this coke from coming over here. [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8425.64s)]
*  All right. It's coming over here. [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8437.64s)]
*  Well, I get a little taste. [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8438.64s)]
*  Well, we get a little taste. [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8441.64s)]
*  If you're in the DEA and you just constantly bust in scumbags with giant bags of meth and you're like, you know what, man, how about we just fucking sell some of this shit? [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8442.64s)]
*  How about we just sell some of it and use the money like to fund the Contras versus the Sandinistas in Nicaragua? [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8451.64s)]
*  That's what happened with Freeway Ricky Ross. [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8456.64s)]
*  You ever hear Ronald Reagan talking about that shit? [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8459.64s)]
*  Where he, where at first he goes, there's a Kill a Mike song called Fuck Reagan or something like that. [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8461.64s)]
*  And it starts off with his speech about where he goes. [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8468.64s)]
*  He's like, I know last week I said that we were not funding these Contras or whatever. [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8471.64s)]
*  And he was like, and even though this is a very politician way of putting it, he goes, even though my heart tells me that that's still true, the evidence says that it's not. [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8477.64s)]
*  So instead of being like, I lied, he was like, my heart tells me that this isn't true. [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8489.64s)]
*  How much do you think they tell the president? [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8495.64s)]
*  Like how much do you trust a guy who only has a job for four years? [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8498.64s)]
*  I think they tell him the very tip top urgent shit and they tell him all the other shit on the bottom. [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8504.64s)]
*  But there's that little middle little 10, 15 percent that he has no idea. [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8513.64s)]
*  In the 1980s, just just I'm just throwing this out there. [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8516.64s)]
*  Don't you think that in the 1980s they could keep a guy like Ronald Reagan from finding out that they're dealing drugs while his wife is doing the Just Say No campaign? [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8520.64s)]
*  That's during the same time period, man. [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8530.64s)]
*  During the Just Say No campaign, Ronald Reagan was responsible because he was the president, whether or not he knew about it. [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8532.64s)]
*  During his administration, they were selling drugs in South Central L.A. [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8540.64s)]
*  Oh, yeah. You've seen that video where Michael Rupert calls out like there's an assemblywoman and there's the CIA or the DEA guys on stage. [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8545.64s)]
*  And he says, I witnessed I personally witnessed the CIA selling drugs. [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8552.64s)]
*  Yeah, they were definitely putting drugs. They were selling drugs and they were doing it all through Freeway Ricky Ross. [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8558.64s)]
*  Yeah. And then they locked him up and they locked him up and he figured out how to be a lawyer in jail. [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8563.64s)]
*  He couldn't even read when he went to jail. [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8567.64s)]
*  He learned how to read and then became a lawyer and realized they had tried him for double jeopardy incorrectly because for double jeopardy, like when someone has like three strikes, three strikes, right? [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8569.64s)]
*  Not double jeopardy, three strikes. [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8579.64s)]
*  So when someone does that, it's supposed to be like three separate times. [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8581.64s)]
*  It's not like three different things that you charge them for at once. [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8585.64s)]
*  And for his second arrest, they had used that, but they used it incorrectly. [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8589.64s)]
*  I hope I'm not fucking that up. So he could get out? Yes. [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8594.64s)]
*  Oh, OK. Yes, he got out. [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8597.64s)]
*  And his story is insane. [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8599.64s)]
*  It's an insane story because it's all true and verified. [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8601.64s)]
*  That guy was making millions and millions of dollars. [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8604.64s)]
*  He couldn't even read at the time. He was a tennis player. [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8606.64s)]
*  He's a fucking very smart guy. [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8609.64s)]
*  And he didn't know how to read. [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8611.64s)]
*  And he figured out how to do it in jail once they arrested him and learned how to become a lawyer. [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8613.64s)]
*  That's miraculous. Is there a movie about him? [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8619.64s)]
*  No, there's a whole show about him. [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8622.64s)]
*  Well, there's also Rick Ross, the rapper. [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8624.64s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Well, I think they had an issue at first because he's like, I'm actually actually Rick Ross. [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8626.64s)]
*  Yeah, it's like someone calling themselves John Gotti. [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8632.64s)]
*  Right. And then John Gotti gets out of jail like, hey, well, you know, there's a lot of rappers that name themselves out of like mafioso. [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8634.64s)]
*  Sure. Right. [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8640.64s)]
*  Because there's a Yo Gotti rapper. [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8641.64s)]
*  There's a I forget his name, but the guy that used to run Murder Inc, something else Gotti. [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8643.64s)]
*  Irv Gotti. [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8649.64s)]
*  Irv Gotti. Yeah, Irv Gotti. [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8650.64s)]
*  There's, you know, there's Rick Ross. [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8652.64s)]
*  There's I think Biggie used to call himself something slim. [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8654.64s)]
*  I'm getting my shit's getting crossed up. [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8662.64s)]
*  But there's a lot of rappers do that. [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8665.64s)]
*  What did Superfly sell? [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8667.64s)]
*  Was Superfly a drug dealer in that movie? [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8669.64s)]
*  I think he sold pussy. [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8673.64s)]
*  It's not like a pill. [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8674.64s)]
*  Was that what he was? [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8675.64s)]
*  I don't believe. [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8676.64s)]
*  I think he was selling drugs. [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8677.64s)]
*  I think that was the idea. [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8680.64s)]
*  That was like cocaine. [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8683.64s)]
*  Cocaine. [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8684.64s)]

*  Okay. [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8686.64s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Cocaine. [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8687.64s)]
*  And you know what's crazy? [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8688.64s)]
*  We do so much cocaine. [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8689.64s)]
*  The United States does an insane amount of cocaine. [[02:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8690.64s)]
*  I think Britain still does more than us. [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8693.64s)]
*  That's amazing. [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8695.64s)]
*  You talk about a place. [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8696.64s)]
*  It's probably I think Texas might be bigger than Great Britain. [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8697.64s)]
*  Yes. [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8700.64s)]
*  Well, it rains over there so much. [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8701.64s)]
*  They just want to just get. [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8703.64s)]

*  Get gacked up. [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8707.64s)]
*  That's why their fucking food sucks. [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8708.64s)]
*  Their food doesn't suck anymore. [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8710.64s)]
*  No. [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8711.64s)]
*  No, they have some amazing chefs over there. [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8712.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8714.64s)]
*  And you can get some really good food in England now. [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8715.64s)]
*  It's like that was like an old thing that people said. [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8717.64s)]
*  No. I mean, when we went there, that was my only time there. [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8719.64s)]
*  Albania. [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8721.64s)]
*  You didn't think that was great steak? [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8722.64s)]
*  No. [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8724.64s)]
*  How dare you? [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8725.64s)]
*  I thought I thought everything else was good. [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8726.64s)]
*  The potatoes were good. [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8728.64s)]
*  And then Albania is number one. [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8730.64s)]
*  Annual prevalence percentage or something like that. [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8732.64s)]
*  Whoa. [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8734.64s)]
*  So five point nine percent. [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8735.64s)]
*  That's like people do over the age of 12, which is crazy way to measure. [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8737.64s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8746.64s)]
*  How you find out that's where Rose's people. [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8747.64s)]
*  Holy shit. [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8749.64s)]
*  Rose from the Comedy Store. [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8751.64s)]
*  That's her people. [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8752.64s)]
*  Albania. [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8753.64s)]
*  Wow, folks. [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8754.64s)]
*  Albanians. [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8755.64s)]
*  Six percent. [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8756.64s)]
*  That's why I would see the list again. [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8757.64s)]
*  I'm trying to find a better one. [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8759.64s)]
*  That's that one's fine. [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8760.64s)]
*  Well, I just lost it. [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8761.64s)]
*  That was a good one. [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8762.64s)]
*  They broke it down by city. [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8763.64s)]
*  It'll be a whole other thing. [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8764.64s)]
*  Right. [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8765.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8766.64s)]
*  Because some cities are like Miami would fucking dominate the country. [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8767.64s)]
*  Miami. [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8770.64s)]
*  The Olympics. [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8771.64s)]
*  Los Angeles. [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8772.64s)]
*  Miami, though, would really I mean, that's that city was built on cocaine. [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8773.64s)]
*  Wow. [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8777.64s)]
*  Look at that. [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8778.64s)]
*  So United States is only number three. [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8779.64s)]
*  We got to do better. [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8780.64s)]
*  But what is the better? [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8781.64s)]
*  We got to do better. [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8782.64s)]
*  All the coke's coming into this country and we can't get into number one. [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8783.64s)]
*  But what is the prevalent what is prevalent annual prevalence mean? [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8786.64s)]
*  Probably per year. [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8790.64s)]
*  How many times do you do coke at least once a year? [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8791.64s)]
*  And it looks like is that am I reading that correctly? [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8794.64s)]
*  The percentage of the youth and adult population who have consumed the drug at least once in [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8797.64s)]
*  the past year. [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8801.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8802.64s)]
*  So it's two point two point nine for America. [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8803.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8805.64s)]
*  And that's just all the people that are telling the truth. [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8806.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8808.64s)]
*  A lot of people are lying. [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8809.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8810.64s)]
*  And how many of those people that aren't lying are on Adderall? [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8811.64s)]
*  Because it feels like more than four percent. [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8814.64s)]
*  A lot of people are doing it. [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8817.64s)]
*  I feel like whenever I'm in a room and cocaine comes up, I because I don't do cocaine, but [[02:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8818.64s)]
*  I am always in the minority. [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8825.64s)]
*  But most of the people like, oh, yeah, I'll do something. [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8827.64s)]
*  You know, I've never done coke. [[02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8831.64s)]
*  It doesn't affect me. [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8833.64s)]
*  I've never even tried it. [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8834.64s)]
*  And at first I thought maybe I was doing it wrong. [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8835.64s)]
*  I did the wrong kind. [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8838.64s)]
*  People would constantly try to convince me. [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8839.64s)]
*  But I looked at there's a theory that kids that were on Ritalin don't have the same. [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8841.64s)]
*  Cocaine doesn't have the same effect on them. [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8850.64s)]
*  Oh, interesting. [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8852.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8853.64s)]
*  And that makes sense. [[02:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8854.64s)]
*  You probably have a tolerance for speed. [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8855.64s)]
*  Is that what Ritalin is? [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8857.64s)]
*  It's it's very speedy. [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8859.64s)]
*  I don't know if it's technically a speed, but it's very speedy for some people. [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8860.64s)]
*  It makes him like Henry Rollins was on it when he was a kid and he talked about it. [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8865.64s)]
*  He'd be like fucking just gritty. [[02:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8870.64s)]
*  He thinks that had a big effect on him. [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8872.64s)]
*  I'm pretty sure Henry said that about I think that was Ritalin that was on. [[02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8874.64s)]
*  Right. [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8878.64s)]
*  OK. [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8879.64s)]
*  It says this is Ritalin acts much like cocaine. [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8880.64s)]
*  Advanced imaging research has answered a 40 year old question about methylphenidate, which [[02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8882.64s)]
*  is Ritalin, which is taken daily by four million to six million children in the United States. [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8890.64s)]
*  How does it work? [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8896.64s)]
*  The answer may unsettle many parents because the drug acts much like cocaine, albeit cocaine [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8897.64s)]
*  drip through molasses, neurosky, neurosky. [[02:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8903.64s)]
*  That's the person who wrote this. [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8906.64s)]
*  Oh, that was like what did they say? [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8908.64s)]
*  Taken orally in pill form, it rarely produces a high and has not been reported to be addictive. [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8911.64s)]
*  However, injected as a liquid, it sends a jolt that addicts very much rather says Nora Volkov, [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8918.64s)]
*  MD psychiatrist and imaging expert at Brookhaven National Laboratory. [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8928.64s)]
*  They say it's like cocaine. [[02:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8932.64s)]
*  So when you inject it into someone, who the fuck is injecting Ritalin? [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8934.64s)]
*  I don't know how people found that out. [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8937.64s)]
*  How do they make that? [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8939.64s)]
*  It acts like that's a misleading title. [[02:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8940.64s)]
*  It acts much like cocaine when you inject it in someone. [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8943.64s)]
*  They were saying that it doesn't cause that when you take the pill for them. [[02:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8946.64s)]
*  Or maybe it's a very, very mild cocaine effects. [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8950.64s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8954.64s)]
*  But people that I know that have taken it describe it like that. [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8955.64s)]
*  Henry Rollins described it like he was just like fucking grit in his teeth all day. [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8958.64s)]
*  It gave me bad anxiety. [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8964.64s)]
*  I could just imagine. [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8965.64s)]
*  It's like, you know, also the thing about things like that is like who knows what's going to work for you [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8966.64s)]
*  and what's not going to work for you. [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8975.64s)]
*  There's so much involved in trying stuff on you. [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8977.64s)]
*  If you don't feel good, they don't know what's going on in your head. [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8980.64s)]
*  What does that mean? [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8983.64s)]
*  This is what really fucked me up. [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8985.64s)]
*  It's because when they first put me on it, I didn't like how it made me feel the first couple of times I took it. [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8987.64s)]
*  So after that, I was sneaking spit it out. [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=8997.64s)]
*  And after like a month of me... [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9000.64s)]
*  So I took it for a week. [[02:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9002.64s)]
*  I didn't like how it made me feel. [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9003.64s)]
*  Why did they put you on it? [[02:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9004.64s)]
*  I was in foster care and I was like... [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9005.64s)]
*  Basically, I was ADD. [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9007.64s)]
*  It's ADHD, but they called it ADD back then. [[02:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9010.64s)]
*  And the teacher was like, he's smart, but he can't sit still. [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9012.64s)]
*  That kind of shit, right? [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9016.64s)]
*  And so for three weeks, I was spitting this shit out. [[02:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9018.64s)]
*  And then we had a parent-teacher conference. [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9020.64s)]
*  And so I wasn't even on the shit. [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9022.64s)]
*  And you know how sometimes... [[02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9024.64s)]
*  And I don't recommend parents do this, but like adults would talk about me like I wasn't there. [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9028.64s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[02:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9033.64s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9034.64s)]
*  And these motherfuckers, the teacher, the guidance counselor, and my foster mother, they all sitting around talking about how, yeah, I really noticed the progress. [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9035.64s)]
*  And it was my first time. [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9044.64s)]
*  I'm sitting there, you know, seven, eight years old. [[02:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9046.64s)]
*  I'm like, these motherfuckers are full of shit. [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9047.64s)]
*  Like I didn't have the words to say that, but that's how I felt. [[02:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9049.64s)]
*  I was like, they're all full of shit. [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9052.64s)]
*  They don't know about any of this shit. [[02:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9053.64s)]
*  And so for the longest time, I refused any of the shit they gave me. [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9054.64s)]
*  Like once I had the power to say no, I was like, fuck those pills. [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9058.64s)]
*  Because they tried to put me on Prozac too when I was a teenager. [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9061.64s)]
*  And I was like, how you know this ain't they experimenting on me? [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9064.64s)]
*  How you know this shit? What does this shit do? [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9067.64s)]
*  Well, also, the thing that drives me crazy about kids that won't sit still is that no kid wants to sit still. [[02:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9069.64s)]
*  The idea that you want kids to sit still, it's so I know you're trying to give them discipline and train them to be good students, but that is absolutely not what they want to do. [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9078.64s)]
*  Kids are like puppies. [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9089.64s)]
*  They want to run around. [[02:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9090.64s)]
*  They want to have fun. [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9091.64s)]
*  That's natural. [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9092.64s)]
*  That's 100% natural way to live as a kid. [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9093.64s)]
*  When they make you sit down in a fucking room and listen to some boring shit and maybe you're behind in classes. [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9096.64s)]
*  So you don't even you can't even follow what the fuck they're talking about because you you're not up to that level of whatever it was the opposite for me too much for me. [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9104.64s)]
*  I was like, I get it. [[02:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9112.64s)]
*  Oh, so it's boring. [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9113.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9114.64s)]
*  Like if I could get even better. [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9115.64s)]
*  Even better. [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9117.64s)]
*  So if that's the case, imagine the solution is to drug you. [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9118.64s)]
*  It's not like he's so smart. [[02:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9122.64s)]
*  This is all stupid to him. [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9124.64s)]
*  Like that was Einstein. [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9125.64s)]
*  You know, like Einstein failed like seventh grade. [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9126.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9129.64s)]
*  Like how the fuck can you if you fail Einstein, I mean, you got to think that maybe the way you're teaching is kind of fucked. [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9130.64s)]
*  Yeah, because I forget who the fuck it was. [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9138.64s)]
*  I think I think the guy's name was Tom Hartman. [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9140.64s)]
*  But it was like a political guy that I used to listen to a long time ago. [[02:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9142.64s)]
*  He was talking about how there was a heat when he was coming up. [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9145.64s)]
*  There was a school in Boston where they would send these kids. [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9148.64s)]
*  I don't think they called it ADD back then. [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9152.64s)]
*  But but the theory was that it was actually an evolutionary benefit because the person that was it's not that you can't pay attention is that your attention is split. [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9155.64s)]
*  You know, so you're the guy that was hyper aware would help the tribe survive or whatever. [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9165.64s)]
*  There's there's that. [[02:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9170.64s)]
*  But it's also they're bored. [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9171.64s)]
*  Like they want excitement. [[02:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9173.64s)]
*  There's a there's a thing about children. [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9175.64s)]
*  They want things that are like that stimulate them. [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9177.64s)]
*  And when the education doesn't stimulate them, it's just just drone. [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9180.64s)]
*  It's like a trumpet in your face is you want to get the fuck out of there. [[02:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9184.64s)]
*  It's normal being a being a smart kid is like it's kind of a curse in the wrong environment. [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9189.64s)]
*  And because you know, you know, the teachers that always got the best out of me was the ones that were fucking hyped about the subject. [[02:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9194.64s)]
*  They were teaching. It might have felt like a curse. [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9201.64s)]
*  You might have at the time felt like it was a curse, but it's 100 percent not a curse. [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9203.64s)]
*  The curse is to be born stupid. [[02:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9208.64s)]
*  That's the real curse. [[02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9210.64s)]
*  Yeah, you do. [[02:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9212.64s)]
*  You are better off being a smart guy who feels out of place in a stupid neighborhood than you are a stupid guy in a smart neighborhood. [[02:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9213.64s)]
*  Yeah, you're right. [[02:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9223.64s)]
*  You don't want to be the dumb guy. [[02:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9224.64s)]
*  You don't want to be the dumb guy. [[02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9225.64s)]
*  And it took me a long time to stop acting stupid so I could fit in. [[02:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9226.64s)]
*  Oh, interesting. [[02:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9231.64s)]
*  Yeah, because I wasn't just I wasn't just a smart kid. [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9233.64s)]
*  I was also a foster kid. [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9237.64s)]
*  So it would be like I would finally, finally feel like I'm kind of sort of fitting in and then I would move. [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9239.64s)]
*  And now I'm this new kid in a new school. [[02:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9245.64s)]
*  You know, when you're a new kid in the school, everyone's paying attention to you. [[02:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9248.64s)]
*  And I know the answer, but I know if I if I raise my hand, it's going to draw more attention. [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9250.64s)]
*  Right. And you're going to be Mr. Smarty Pants. [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9255.64s)]
*  Right. Oh, Mr. Know-it-all. [[02:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9257.64s)]
*  Right. And it was like so I got into this habit of just dumbing myself down so that I would be cool or whatever. [[02:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9259.64s)]
*  But you know, as an adult now looking back, I realized no one thought I was cool anyway. [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9266.64s)]
*  You know, I'm way cooler now than I'm just myself than I was when I was trying to be somebody else. [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9272.64s)]
*  But yeah, but that's part of being a kid and especially being a foster kid and getting moved around the way you did. [[02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9277.64s)]
*  That's got to be an insanely challenging thing. [[02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9283.64s)]
*  But that's also why you're so interesting. [[02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9285.64s)]
*  Like people develop character through adversity. [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9288.64s)]
*  True, true. I don't think there's any other way that we acquire it. [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9292.64s)]
*  It's it feels like a curse when it's happening, you know, and like, you know, your fucking life sucks and it's never nothing goes your way. [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9296.64s)]
*  And you keep failing. You keep falling flat in your ass. [[02:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9304.64s)]
*  But that terrible feeling of you not meeting your goals and achieving things and getting something going on in your life, [[02:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9307.64s)]
*  those terrible feelings create a more resilient, more focused person that applies to everything. [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9315.64s)]
*  Well, finding comedy is like I found my tribe. [[02:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9322.64s)]
*  Like once I found comedy and I was like, oh, it's all these other fucking people that be thinking and saying weird shit and wondering about dumb shit. [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9325.64s)]
*  Like it was it was like like a glove. Yeah. [[02:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9335.64s)]
*  Yeah. That's why, you know, when Mitzi would talk about the comedy store, she would call it the island of misfit toys. [[02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9339.64s)]
*  That's what you call it. Yeah, it really is. [[02:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9346.64s)]
*  The island of misfit toys. [[02:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9350.64s)]
*  Because people come people think people try to have make it controversial, like some of the shit we say on stage. [[02:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9352.64s)]
*  But if you heard the shit we said to each other, it's a whole other level. [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9360.64s)]
*  Because that's the only way we can make each other laugh. [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9366.64s)]
*  Also, like there's zero stakes. Oh, right. [[02:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9369.64s)]
*  You know, it's just and you get props for it for going too deep. [[02:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9372.64s)]
*  Like if we're out at dinner and Tony Hinchcliffe says some fucking insane shit that you could never you could never say. [[02:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9376.64s)]
*  Sometimes you ever forget that like like there's a not comic around and you forget all the time. [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9383.64s)]
*  And you're like, oh, they probably don't. Yeah. [[02:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9389.64s)]
*  But I'm telling you, but those of y'all listening out there, there's nothing better than, you know, five or six comics that talk shit. [[02:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9392.64s)]
*  Yeah. That know each other and trust each other with no no recording devices around. [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9402.64s)]
*  And we and we're high and we're just we're just mind. [[02:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9408.64s)]
*  It's almost to me, it's almost like the the equivalent of a rap cipher. [[02:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9412.64s)]
*  It's something we automatically fall into to keep each other sharp. [[02:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9417.64s)]
*  It's an exercise that we just do. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9421.64s)]
*  Well, I think that's what podcasts are in a way, too. You know? Yeah. [[02:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9425.64s)]
*  Yeah. And we're spoiled. Yeah, we're definitely spoiled. [[02:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9429.64s)]
*  Because if you try to have a conversation with a knucklehead, it's not fun. [[02:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9432.64s)]
*  That's why the pandemic, the pandemic fucked a lot of comics up like the lockdowns, because a lot of people don't realize like you being exposed to such a high level of thought experiments and just mental stimulation every night. [[02:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9436.64s)]
*  You're you're you're near some of the most abstract thinkers and they're giving you ideas and different angles and you're spoiled by that. [[02:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9454.64s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, it's nothing. [[02:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9462.64s)]
*  You know, you just get a text that says, hope all is well. [[02:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9465.64s)]
*  That ain't doing it. [[02:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9469.64s)]
*  Like six months ago, you were talking about aliens and and you know, if humanity was started from an alien doing mushrooms or whatever the fuck. [[02:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9471.64s)]
*  Right. It's like you were having those kind of conversations every fucking day. [[02:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9481.64s)]
*  Right. And you took it for granted. [[02:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9485.64s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, it's not available to you. Right. [[02:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9486.64s)]
*  And your mind is used to just constantly getting new things to think about and piece together. [[02:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9489.64s)]
*  It's like you just it's just gone. [[02:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9494.64s)]
*  That was real lucky that during the pandemic, we kept doing the podcast. [[02:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9496.64s)]
*  We never stopped. Yeah, we tested everybody. [[02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9500.64s)]
*  We did a lot of different things. [[02:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9503.64s)]
*  We've been the early days. It was very touch and go because, you know, the testing you for antibodies, they're not even testing you like necessarily for covid. [[02:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9504.64s)]
*  It took a little while before they could test for covid. [[02:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9512.64s)]
*  Right. [[02:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9514.64s)]
*  We just had everybody just, you know, be honest about how you feel, be honest about whether or not you've been exposed, constantly get tested. [[02:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9515.64s)]
*  I could test it every fucking day. [[02:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9523.64s)]
*  And then, you know, you got to monitor yourself, too. [[02:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9525.64s)]
*  But it was weird because, like, everybody that was coming in had been isolated. [[02:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9528.64s)]
*  So we knew that we weren't exposed to other people other than these people that we're doing the shows with. [[02:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9533.64s)]
*  But then I did a gig in Houston at the improv in July. [[02:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9539.64s)]
*  It was kind of the heart of everything. [[02:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9545.64s)]
*  And then I didn't get sick, but I got really high and I got super paranoid that, oh, my God, what if I got sick? [[02:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9547.64s)]
*  And then I started thinking about it like, what if I got sick and I infected somebody? [[02:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9552.64s)]
*  I'm like, I know I'm not sick right now. I don't feel sick. [[02:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9555.64s)]
*  But what if I got it? Then I was thinking, oh, my God, I can't do any more of these shows. [[02:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9557.64s)]
*  So I have to stop. I was like, I got to stop. [[02:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9561.64s)]
*  And so we stopped for months and months and months until we did these shows outside with Chappelle. [[02:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9564.64s)]
*  We did the stub shows because then we tested the whole audience. [[02:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9569.64s)]
*  We tested everybody. We had a covid bubble. [[02:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9572.64s)]
*  We tested the whole audience. Everybody got tested. [[02:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9575.64s)]
*  And then we did those for a while. [[02:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9578.64s)]
*  And then as things relaxed more and more. [[02:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9581.64s)]
*  So I was I was able to do the podcast through the entire thing. [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9585.64s)]
*  By the time we came here, they had rapid tests. [[02:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9589.64s)]
*  So they had these rapid antigen tests. [[02:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9592.64s)]
*  They could find out whether or not you're positive in 15 minutes. [[02:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9594.64s)]
*  You'd have probably you probably lost your mind if you couldn't. [[02:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9597.64s)]
*  Yeah, I would have definitely gone into a different headspace. [[02:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9599.64s)]
*  I think a little bit of silence and relaxation and removal from the world [[02:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9603.64s)]
*  sometimes just to get an introspective view into what actually matters, [[02:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9610.64s)]
*  because you could lose what actually matters in that the hectic scramble to pay your bills [[02:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9617.64s)]
*  and advance your career and do this and do that. [[02:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9622.64s)]
*  And, you know, you're trying to achieve things and you're going after it every day. [[02:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9625.64s)]
*  And you just when everything shuts down, the one advantage that you have is that now you could look at life in its like pure state life. [[02:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9629.64s)]
*  And it's pure state is just people around the people that they love. [[02:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9639.64s)]
*  And you're just hanging out together. [[02:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9643.64s)]
*  And you're you're you're locked in together and you're in a place of elevated risk because everybody's a little heightened by the fact they all know that everything's been locked down. [[02:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9645.64s)]
*  And there's there's some meat being smoked. [[02:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9655.64s)]
*  A little bit of that is good. [[02:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9657.64s)]
*  The problem with people is that shit went on too long. [[02:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9659.64s)]
*  It went on way too long and it fucked people up psychologically, whether they realize it or not. [[02:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9661.64s)]
*  Oh, isolation. [[02:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9665.64s)]
*  Isolation. Oh, yeah. [[02:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9666.64s)]
*  Isolation and fear and anxiety, because you got to think people. [[02:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9667.64s)]
*  There's certain people that had a level of anxiety that was already very high. [[02:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9671.64s)]
*  And then the pandemic comes and everyone they see might kill them by breathing on them. [[02:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9675.64s)]
*  And you see people and whether or not masks work or not, you see people with no mask. [[02:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9679.64s)]
*  You're fucking furious. [[02:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9682.64s)]
*  That could be the one that fucking kills me. [[02:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9683.64s)]
*  I remember when we when they first started and I went to the laundromat because I had to. [[02:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9685.64s)]
*  And it was and I remember just thinking like, oh, all the air is poison. [[02:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9691.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9695.64s)]
*  Like, what if that was the one that's going to you know, it was like it was it was it was it was Ruff Wolf. [[02:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9696.64s)]
*  It was also rough because no one really knew what the effects were yet. [[02:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9700.64s)]
*  You know that shit they have in Korea. [[02:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9704.64s)]
*  It's like a phenomenon. They've named it. [[02:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9706.64s)]
*  But it's like a people that like isolate themselves. [[02:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9708.64s)]
*  It's a sickness. [[02:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9711.64s)]
*  They isolate themselves and they just stay locked. [[02:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9713.64s)]
*  They're shut. [[02:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9715.64s)]
*  They're watching video games. [[02:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9716.64s)]
*  Or whatever. They just don't leave the house. [[02:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9717.64s)]
*  They leave the house as little as possible. [[02:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9719.64s)]
*  They have a name for it. [[02:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9721.64s)]
*  And it's a problem. [[02:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9723.64s)]
*  And it's been for years. [[02:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9724.64s)]
*  And it's like we basically did that to everyone. [[02:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9725.64s)]
*  To everyone. [[02:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9727.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9728.64s)]
*  And the really fucked up things, they did that to kids. [[02:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9729.64s)]
*  So these kids are going to have a heart. [[02:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9732.64s)]
*  And also they did a lot of communicating with masks on to kids and then kids to other kids that they forced them to wear masks. [[02:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9734.64s)]
*  So the way children learn how to talk, a big part of it is like watching people talk, like watching facial expressions. [[02:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9740.64s)]
*  That's how you learn. [[02:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9748.64s)]
*  You learn from people. [[02:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9749.64s)]
*  You learn like the way we communicate with each other. [[02:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9750.64s)]
*  You see facial expressions. [[02:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9753.64s)]
*  You recreate them like this is me going, wow, I didn't know that. [[02:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9754.64s)]
*  You know, they have to learn that when half your fucking face is covered by a diaper, they can't, nobody can see that. [[02:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9758.64s)]
*  It's like bad for development. [[02:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9765.64s)]
*  So we have no fucking idea what kind of impact that's going to have. [[02:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9766.64s)]
*  So what do you think? [[02:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9769.64s)]
*  So say there's a pandemic, another one, and there's no controversy. [[02:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9770.64s)]
*  Like this shit is deadly. [[02:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9775.64s)]
*  No one disagrees. [[02:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9777.64s)]
*  It'll be what we experienced times 10. [[02:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9779.64s)]
*  It'll be just as fucked up in terms of like the anxiety levels. [[02:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9782.64s)]
*  They'll be even higher, actually, right? [[02:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9786.64s)]
*  Because people will be, you know, now that this if this is like the Spanish flu or something like that, that killed millions and millions and millions of people. [[02:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9788.64s)]
*  I think people will I think there would still eventually be a point where people were like, fuck it. [[02:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9796.64s)]
*  It's worth it. [[02:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9802.64s)]
*  Eventually. [[02:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9803.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9804.64s)]
*  But if it's something that's fatal to like a large percentage of the people that catch it, not a small percentage like COVID. [[02:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9805.64s)]
*  I mean, think about what ultimately COVID was like. [[02:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9812.64s)]
*  What percentage of the people that got COVID died? [[02:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9815.64s)]
*  Jamie, what percentage of the people that got COVID died? [[02:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9818.64s)]
*  This overall was just include old people. [[02:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9821.64s)]
*  Let's not be ageist. [[02:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9824.64s)]
*  Include young people, old people. [[02:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9826.64s)]
*  See what we got here. [[02:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9833.64s)]
*  What do you guess? [[02:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9834.64s)]
*  I'm going to say four percent. [[02:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9835.64s)]
*  Let's just say five. [[02:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9845.64s)]
*  Let's round it out. [[02:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9846.64s)]
*  I don't think it's that high. [[02:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9847.64s)]
*  You don't think it's that high? [[02:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9848.64s)]
*  No. [[02:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9849.64s)]
*  I think that would be a lot more people. [[02:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9850.64s)]
*  The amount of people that died from it. [[02:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9852.64s)]
*  I think it's like three. [[02:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9854.64s)]
*  Three percent? [[02:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9856.64s)]
*  I think it's three. [[02:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9857.64s)]
*  I'm not sure, though. [[02:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9859.64s)]
*  It might be lower than that. [[02:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9860.64s)]
*  Actually, no, it's got to be lower than. [[02:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9861.64s)]
*  No, that's ridiculous. [[02:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9862.64s)]
*  That's ridiculous. [[02:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9863.64s)]
*  Because three percent is insane. [[02:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9864.64s)]
*  That's an insane amount of people. [[02:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9866.64s)]
*  Right. [[02:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9868.64s)]
*  What do you think? [[02:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9869.64s)]
*  I've seen people say that it's less than one percent. [[02:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9870.64s)]
*  But I don't know if they're going healthy 18 to 49. [[02:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9873.64s)]
*  Obviously, there's a giant risk if you're old. [[02:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9877.64s)]
*  Old people, there's a giant risk. [[02:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9880.64s)]
*  I mean, it really goes up. [[02:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9882.64s)]
*  When you look at people in their 80s, [[02:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9884.64s)]
*  and if you look at the number of people that died from COVID, [[02:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9886.64s)]
*  a large number of them were older. [[02:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9889.64s)]
*  It's real dangerous for that. [[02:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9891.64s)]
*  Because right now, where are we at? [[02:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9892.64s)]
*  Eight billion people on Earth? [[02:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9893.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9894.64s)]
*  And maybe half the people caught it? [[02:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9895.64s)]
*  No, more than that, probably, at this point. [[02:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9897.64s)]
*  Okay, so one percent of that is... [[02:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9899.64s)]
*  That's a lot of fucking dead people. [[02:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9901.64s)]
*  That's too many people, yeah. [[02:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9902.64s)]
*  So it's less than one percent, for sure. [[02:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9903.64s)]
*  We just did science. [[02:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9905.64s)]
*  We're scientists, dog. [[02:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9906.64s)]
*  We're scientists. [[02:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9907.64s)]
*  Where's my honorary degree, goddammit? [[02:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9908.64s)]
*  Cheers. [[02:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9910.64s)]
*  Cheers, man. [[02:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9911.64s)]
*  This has been fun. [[02:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9912.64s)]
*  Hell, yeah. [[02:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9913.64s)]
*  Jamie's still doing math. [[02:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9917.64s)]
*  What do you think the number is? [[02:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9918.64s)]
*  I've seen different numbers. [[02:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9920.64s)]
*  What do you think it is, Jamie? [[02:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9921.64s)]
*  All right. [[02:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9922.64s)]
*  Yo, don't give us those Republican numbers. [[02:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9923.64s)]
*  Yeah, man, give us a real number. [[02:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9925.64s)]
*  From Politico. [[02:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9927.64s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9933.64s)]
*  What did they say on Truth Social? [[02:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9935.64s)]
*  But that's really the best... [[02:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9937.64s)]
*  Because that's how I feel. [[02:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9939.64s)]
*  I don't know... [[02:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9940.64s)]
*  Because listen, I think when the waters get so muddy, [[02:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9942.64s)]
*  all you got is how you feel. [[02:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9947.64s)]
*  Because I'm not going to buy a microscope. [[02:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9949.64s)]
*  You know, I'm not going to do the study. [[02:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9952.64s)]
*  So because it's become so political that both sides [[02:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9954.64s)]
*  are kind of throwing mistruths and shit out there. [[02:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9957.64s)]
*  So it's like, you don't know who the fuck... [[02:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9960.64s)]
*  Because I don't trust any of these politicians. [[02:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9962.64s)]
*  Did you see that they released something today [[02:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9963.64s)]
*  finally on natural immunity? [[02:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9966.64s)]
*  No, what is that? [[02:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9969.64s)]
*  The Washington Post finally published a truth [[02:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9970.64s)]
*  about natural immunity in a piece by Lena Nguyen. [[02:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9972.64s)]
*  She's that lady that was the expert on natural immunity [[02:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9975.64s)]
*  She's that lady that was the expert on CNN all the time [[02:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9978.64s)]
*  that was telling people to mask up. [[02:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9980.64s)]
*  Okay. [[02:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9982.64s)]
*  She said, vaccinated people who never had COVID [[02:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9983.64s)]
*  were at least three times as likely to be infected [[02:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9989.64s)]
*  as unvaccinated people with prior infection. [[02:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9992.64s)]
*  So they're finally talking about that, [[02:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=9997.64s)]
*  which is really bananas. [[02:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10001.64s)]
*  Okay. [[02:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10004.64s)]
*  So, but it also never had COVID is weird because... [[02:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10005.64s)]
*  Here's another one. Ready for this one? [[02:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10009.64s)]
*  Those who are vaccinated but never had COVID [[02:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10011.64s)]
*  were four times as likely to have a severe illness [[02:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10014.64s)]
*  resulting in hospitalization or death [[02:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10018.64s)]
*  compared to the unvaccinated who recovered from it. [[02:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10021.64s)]
*  Protection from natural immunity also... [[02:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10024.64s)]
*  What does it say? [[02:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10030.64s)]
*  It means at a slower rate than from vaccination. [[02:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10031.64s)]
*  Sorry, I didn't put my reading glasses on there. [[02:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10036.64s)]
*  Yeah, but never had COVID is weird because... [[02:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10038.64s)]
*  Because how do you differentiate between people that never had it [[02:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10042.64s)]
*  and people that just never tested positive for it? [[02:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10044.64s)]
*  That's true too. [[02:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10046.64s)]
*  Because I only tested when it was something I needed to test for. [[02:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10047.64s)]
*  My friend Bridgette had it. She had no idea she had it. [[02:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10051.64s)]
*  She tested positive. She was going to a wedding. [[02:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10054.64s)]
*  She tested positive, couldn't go. [[02:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10056.64s)]
*  She's like, this is crazy. I don't feel anything. [[02:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10058.64s)]
*  She tested positive twice. [[02:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10060.64s)]
*  I got lucky, man. I never tested positive when it was something important. [[02:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10062.64s)]
*  When the first time I did this podcast, I was like, please don't fucking test me. [[02:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10068.64s)]
*  And then when I got my Netflix thing, I didn't test positive. [[02:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10073.64s)]
*  And I had some other important thing where it was like... [[02:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10078.64s)]
*  Matter of fact, when they did the festival, they had us all test... [[02:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10082.64s)]
*  I filmed something at the end of the festival. [[02:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10086.64s)]
*  But for almost two weeks before that, we were just doing shows around LA. [[02:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10088.64s)]
*  And then right when you're going to do the most important thing at the end, you got to test. [[02:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10092.64s)]
*  Oh, boy. [[02:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10095.64s)]
*  I know. I passed that one too, though. [[02:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10096.64s)]
*  Was the shows around LA though? A lot of them were outside shows, though, right? [[02:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10099.64s)]
*  No. [[02:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10102.64s)]
*  No? [[02:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10103.64s)]
*  No. By the time the festival happened, it was already... [[02:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10104.64s)]
*  Oh, when is the festival? [[02:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10107.64s)]
*  The Netflix festival? [[02:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10108.64s)]
*  When was that? [[02:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10109.64s)]
*  It was... [[02:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10110.64s)]
*  Oh, the recent one? [[02:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10111.64s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10112.64s)]
*  So when you said the festival, I didn't know which one you were talking about. [[02:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10113.64s)]
*  The one they just had, like right at the end when everyone was fine. [[02:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10115.64s)]
*  But I do know a motherfucker where their whole thing, they were supposed to film something, [[02:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10118.64s)]
*  and they tested positive right beforehand. They fucked their whole shit up. [[02:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10123.64s)]
*  Yeah, I've heard of that too. [[02:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10128.64s)]
*  Well, listen, man, what are you going to do? [[02:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10130.64s)]
*  They have to abide by those rules, especially when we didn't have any way to treat it, [[02:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10132.64s)]
*  or we didn't know what was the right way to treat it. [[02:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10137.64s)]
*  There was a lot of that in the beginning, right? [[02:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10139.64s)]
*  They thought respirators were the way to go. They found out they weren't. [[02:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10141.64s)]
*  But that's how things go when there's a pandemic. [[02:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10144.64s)]
*  There's a lot of Monday morning quarterbacking about stuff. [[02:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10146.64s)]
*  But when are we going to catch a break where the treatment is like, you just got to fuck a lot? [[02:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10150.64s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10155.64s)]
*  You just got to nut twice a day. [[02:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10157.64s)]
*  Or I wanted it to be something crazy like weed was actually the cure. [[02:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10159.64s)]
*  Because stoners always say weed's the cure for everything. [[02:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10165.64s)]
*  But if it came out and it was like, TAC is actually the cure. [[02:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10168.64s)]
*  That's the thing. [[02:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10173.64s)]
*  Oh, man, I can't wait for something like that to happen. [[02:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10174.64s)]
*  Well, you don't want an illness. Just enjoy weed. [[02:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10176.64s)]
*  You don't need to justify your weed usage with an illness. [[02:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10179.64s)]
*  I got you right. [[02:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10181.64s)]
*  You're better off being healthy and just enjoying it on your own. [[02:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10183.64s)]
*  I just don't like the judgment. [[02:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10186.64s)]
*  Judgment from who? Idiots that don't smoke weed? [[02:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10187.64s)]
*  No, but here's the wild shit though, Joe. [[02:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10189.64s)]
*  I've always had... [[02:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10193.64s)]
*  My eyes always make me look like I'm high. [[02:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10199.64s)]
*  And I don't smoke weed as much as people assume. [[02:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10203.64s)]
*  You look like... [[02:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10208.64s)]
*  Right, right. [[02:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10209.64s)]
*  Jim Brewer, that's the perfect example. [[02:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10210.64s)]
*  Jim Brewer? Oh, yeah. [[02:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10213.64s)]
*  Jim Brewer looks like he's constantly high. [[02:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10214.64s)]
*  And I guarantee you he's not high nearly as much as people assume. [[02:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10216.64s)]
*  I don't even know if he gets high anymore. [[02:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10220.64s)]
*  He went through a long period where he definitely didn't get high. [[02:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10222.64s)]
*  He was getting too high and just decided to back off. [[02:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10225.64s)]
*  And he was in half-baked. [[02:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10228.64s)]
*  Yeah, because that's the thing. [[02:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10230.64s)]
*  I can only get super high when I'm fine. [[02:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10232.64s)]
*  It doesn't solve my problems. [[02:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10237.64s)]
*  If I'm having anxiety or depression or something like that, [[02:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10239.64s)]
*  weed doesn't make me feel better. [[02:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10242.64s)]
*  No, it makes you freak out about whatever that thing is. [[02:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10243.64s)]
*  It makes me feel way, way worse. [[02:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10246.64s)]
*  Because I think too much. [[02:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10248.64s)]
*  Yeah, I think way too much about it. [[02:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10250.64s)]
*  But I'm going to show you this damn picture. [[02:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10252.64s)]
*  And this is... [[02:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10254.64s)]
*  Because I get this all damn time. [[02:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10255.64s)]
*  Motherfucker. [[02:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10257.64s)]
*  So... [[02:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10261.64s)]
*  God damn it. [[02:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10263.64s)]
*  What is this in relation to? [[02:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10265.64s)]
*  This is my baby picture. [[02:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10267.64s)]
*  I look high as a baby. [[02:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10268.64s)]
*  I'm going to show you because I'm not making this up. [[02:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10270.64s)]
*  Right, goddamn. [[02:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10274.64s)]
*  Right... [[02:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10277.64s)]
*  Did I take it down? [[02:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10280.64s)]
*  You need an iPhone. [[02:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10282.64s)]
*  This is bullshit. [[02:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10283.64s)]
*  You know, an iPhone, I don't know if you could do that [[02:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10284.64s)]
*  in these primitive Android devices. [[02:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10286.64s)]
*  But you could make folders. [[02:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10288.64s)]
*  I don't see it that way. [[02:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10290.64s)]
*  You could have a favorites folder. [[02:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10292.64s)]
*  I could have saved it and labeled it and stuff. [[02:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10294.64s)]
*  You can't do that in your little Google photo gallery? [[02:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10296.64s)]
*  I'm sure I can. [[02:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10298.64s)]
*  Do you have all your pictures lumped in together? [[02:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10300.64s)]
*  You have no albums? [[02:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10302.64s)]
*  I'm semi-organized. [[02:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10304.64s)]
*  I'm organizing a bunch. [[02:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10306.64s)]
*  Wait a minute then. [[02:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10308.64s)]
*  Why do you like gadgets so much? [[02:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10310.64s)]
*  I thought you'd like them because they help you organize shit. [[02:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10312.64s)]
*  I just like them because it feels like the future. [[02:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10314.64s)]
*  I feel like I'm tip-toed just into the future. [[02:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10318.64s)]
*  Some dudes have all their jokes written out on a spreadsheet. [[02:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10322.64s)]
*  No. [[02:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10327.64s)]
*  The time of each joke. [[02:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10329.64s)]
*  I use three different apps for my joke stuff. [[02:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10331.64s)]
*  Yeah, you were telling me that. [[02:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10335.64s)]
*  Do you use the elephant one? [[02:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10337.64s)]
*  I use Evernote. [[02:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10340.64s)]
*  That's my main one because I know it's cross-platform. [[02:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10342.64s)]
*  If I ever decide to switch, I can still have it all. [[02:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10346.64s)]
*  That's a really good one. [[02:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10348.64s)]
*  Then Samsung Notes and Google Keep is another one I use. [[02:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10350.64s)]
*  Somebody introduced me to one recently. [[02:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10354.64s)]
*  I'm telling you, the kids now, they got so much. [[02:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10356.64s)]
*  The young comics now, they're using an app called Standupper. [[02:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10360.64s)]
*  He showed it to me. [[02:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10364.64s)]
*  I was like, man, if I could pay somebody to transfer all my shit into it, I would. [[02:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10368.64s)]
*  It's made for stand-up. [[02:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10372.64s)]
*  Really? [[02:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10375.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10376.64s)]
*  From you writing out a bit, it'll tell you how long it is. [[02:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10377.64s)]
*  No shit. [[02:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10380.64s)]
*  Huh. [[02:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10382.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10383.64s)]
*  So a comic created or someone who likes comedy? [[02:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10384.64s)]
*  A comic showed it to me. [[02:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10388.64s)]
*  From using it, I'm almost positive a fucking comic made it. [[02:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10389.64s)]
*  Because there's no way you would know that it's perfect for comedy. [[02:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10393.64s)]
*  Interesting. [[02:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10397.64s)]
*  Audio. [[02:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10398.64s)]
*  Yeah, you have little audio. [[02:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10399.64s)]
*  It tells you how long everything is. [[02:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10401.64s)]
*  You can put little tags on shit. [[02:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10403.64s)]
*  I was like, damn, who thought of all of this? [[02:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10405.64s)]
*  They bombed that set. [[02:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10407.64s)]
*  That was a great set. [[02:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10408.64s)]
*  The set was meh. [[02:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10409.64s)]
*  Oh, interesting. [[02:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10410.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10411.64s)]
*  Oh, so you write down like your ... That's crazy. [[02:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10412.64s)]
*  You write down your experiences at every open mic. [[02:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10415.64s)]
*  That's heavy. [[02:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10417.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10418.64s)]
*  It's like they're getting meticulous with it. [[02:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10419.64s)]
*  I'm telling you, it's almost like the way that ... We were talking about Khabib where [[02:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10421.64s)]
*  the new generation of fighters that's coming up are learning how to counter that. [[02:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10427.64s)]
*  And so they're going to be unbelievable. [[02:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10431.64s)]
*  The new comics that are coming out, some of them are going to be fucking incredible. [[02:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10434.64s)]
*  And they're learning at an accelerated rate because they have all the access to all the [[02:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10438.64s)]
*  greats of all time on YouTube. [[02:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10443.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10445.64s)]
*  Red Fox, Rodney Dangerfield, Sam Kinnison, you can get anyone, Richard Pryor, Eddie Murphy. [[02:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10447.64s)]
*  You can get all these specials. [[02:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10453.64s)]
*  You can watch them all. [[02:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10454.64s)]

*  You can watch it all day long. [[02:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10457.64s)]
*  If you wanted to sit down and just watch Rodney Dangerfield all day long, you could just get [[02:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10458.64s)]
*  on YouTube. [[02:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10463.64s)]
*  You know what holds up? [[02:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10464.64s)]
*  It's Sanford & Son. [[02:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10465.64s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10466.64s)]
*  That shit makes me laugh. [[02:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10467.64s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[02:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10468.64s)]
*  Still. [[02:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10469.64s)]
*  Red Fox, did you know he invented the comedy album? [[02:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10470.64s)]
*  Really? [[02:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10474.64s)]
*  Really. [[02:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10475.64s)]
*  He basically, yeah, he was the first person to put comedy on an album. [[02:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10476.64s)]
*  Standup. [[02:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10480.64s)]
*  Yeah, standup. [[02:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10481.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10482.64s)]
*  Wow. [[02:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10483.64s)]
*  To my understanding. [[02:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10484.64s)]
*  Jamie, can you factor in? [[02:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10485.64s)]
*  Well, he used to run a comedy club in LA. [[02:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10486.64s)]
*  Oh. [[02:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10488.64s)]
*  And he would record there. [[02:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10489.64s)]
*  And I bought a series of Richard Pryor cassettes from a gas station once. [[02:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10490.64s)]
*  Cassettes. [[02:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10495.64s)]
*  Yeah, they had cassettes. [[02:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10496.64s)]
*  There were the, was that, you know, the gas stations used to have these cassette racks. [[02:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10497.64s)]
*  You'd pull in to get gas, like some road trip, and, you know, I'm on the road doing standup. [[02:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10502.64s)]
*  And I pull into this place and I'm like, get a snack or something. [[02:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10507.64s)]
*  And they always have like hats and trinkets and shit. [[02:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10511.64s)]
*  And they would have cassettes so you could buy shit you could listen to. [[02:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10513.64s)]
*  Because there's no Sirius XM radio. [[02:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10516.64s)]
*  There was none of that back then. [[02:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10517.64s)]
*  Right, right. [[02:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10519.64s)]
*  So I found these recordings from Red Fox's comedy club. [[02:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10520.64s)]
*  And they're available now. [[02:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10523.64s)]
*  You can get some of them, I think. [[02:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10525.64s)]
*  At least one of them, for sure, on YouTube. [[02:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10527.64s)]
*  You can get the whole recording. [[02:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10529.64s)]
*  But it was crazy, man. [[02:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10531.64s)]
*  It was like, you could hear the clink of the glasses. [[02:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10533.64s)]
*  It was Richard Pryor fucking around on stage, just like inventing shit and being loose. [[02:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10535.64s)]
*  And early, early days, man. [[02:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10541.64s)]
*  It's important to have those, to have a place where you feel that comfortable. [[02:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10543.64s)]
*  Have a club where you can, you feel at home and you can fuck around. [[02:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10547.64s)]
*  You know, that's how Earthquake got so strong. [[02:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10551.64s)]
*  You know the Earthquake story? [[02:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10554.64s)]
*  No, but I know he's a beast. [[02:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10556.64s)]
*  He's a beast, dude. [[02:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10557.64s)]
*  He took over a comedy club in Atlanta. [[02:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10559.64s)]
*  And when he took over this comedy club in Atlanta, he had to be on stage every night. [[02:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10562.64s)]
*  So he was on stage constantly. [[02:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10567.64s)]
*  So he was doing like what the Beatles did when they went to Hamburg. [[02:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10569.64s)]
*  And they were playing like eight hours a day. [[02:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10575.64s)]
*  That's how they got so good. [[02:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10577.64s)]
*  That's also in that Malcolm Gladwell book. [[02:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10579.64s)]
*  When the Beatles went back to Liverpool, everybody's like, what the fuck did you guys do? [[02:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10581.64s)]
*  How are you so good? [[02:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10585.64s)]
*  Like, what the hell happened? [[02:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10587.64s)]
*  That's what I did. [[02:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10588.64s)]
*  Numbers, just numbers. [[02:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10589.64s)]
*  When I first started, I was pretty bad. [[02:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10591.64s)]
*  But then I started working at this comedy club that had just opened. [[02:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10594.64s)]
*  And so I was learning how to do everything. [[02:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10600.64s)]
*  I was basically their first door guy. [[02:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10602.64s)]
*  And I fucking ran the shows and sold the tickets and sat and answered the phones [[02:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10604.64s)]
*  and did every fucking thing. [[02:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10609.64s)]
*  And I was on stage every fucking night. [[02:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10610.64s)]
*  And I only went there. [[02:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10612.64s)]
*  And then everybody else saw me that hadn't seen me in all those. [[02:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10614.64s)]
*  I was like, how the fuck did you? [[02:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10617.64s)]
*  I was just doing this every day, like literally every day. [[02:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10618.64s)]
*  Every day. [[02:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10621.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10622.64s)]
*  And I don't know if I can do that now. [[02:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10623.64s)]
*  But. [[02:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10626.64s)]
*  Don't say that. [[02:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10627.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10628.64s)]
*  Every night. [[02:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10629.64s)]
*  If you had to. [[02:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10630.64s)]
*  You could definitely do it. [[02:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10631.64s)]
*  It's a lot of fun. [[02:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10632.64s)]
*  Well, see, but back then, I think I overcorrected. [[02:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10633.64s)]
*  Because back then, like I said, I was so excited to finally find my thing [[02:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10637.64s)]
*  that I became obsessed about it. [[02:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10641.64s)]
*  But it was to the detriment of everything else in my life. [[02:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10643.64s)]
*  That's how it always works. [[02:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10646.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10647.64s)]
*  It was like, yeah. [[02:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10648.64s)]
*  So I was like, it wasn't healthy, but it was necessary. [[02:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10649.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10652.64s)]
*  If you want to get really good at everything, that's the problem. [[02:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10653.64s)]
*  Like someone has a quote about that. [[02:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10656.64s)]
*  It's like, that's why Tom Brady getting divorced. [[02:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10657.64s)]
*  Do you think that's why? [[02:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10659.64s)]
*  Yeah, because you can't be that good and be a good, you can't be a great anything [[02:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10660.64s)]
*  and be a great. [[02:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10666.64s)]
*  A good other things. [[02:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10667.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10669.64s)]
*  I mean, maybe you can be great at two things. [[02:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10670.64s)]
*  Maybe you'll be a great husband and a great quarterback. [[02:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10672.64s)]
*  But you can't be a great quarterback, a great husband, a great father, [[02:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10675.64s)]
*  a great friend, you know, a great businessman. [[02:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10678.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10681.64s)]
*  It's like you can't. [[02:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10682.64s)]
*  That's why they're getting on for that FDX shit. [[02:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10683.64s)]
*  Do you think he read that? [[02:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10685.64s)]
*  Do you think he had any idea what that even was about? [[02:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10686.64s)]
*  No. [[02:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10689.64s)]
*  They just said, I'll give you $5 million to say this. [[02:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10690.64s)]
*  And he was like, all right, or whatever it was, probably more than that. [[02:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10692.64s)]
*  Yeah, he's like, sure. [[02:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10694.64s)]
*  In the middle of watching film, he's like, oh yeah. [[02:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10695.64s)]
*  Yeah, I'll do it. [[02:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10697.64s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[02:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10698.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10699.64s)]
*  He's probably laser obsessed with football. [[02:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10700.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10701.64s)]
*  I think the best you can be, if you want to be a great comedian, [[02:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10702.64s)]
*  the best you can be is a very good anything else. [[02:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10704.64s)]
*  Right. [[02:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10708.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10709.64s)]
*  You can be a very good dad. [[02:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10710.64s)]
*  You can be a very good husband and a great comedian. [[02:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10711.64s)]
*  I think there was also like the wife didn't want him to go back to playing football. [[02:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10713.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10718.64s)]
*  She wanted him to like look. [[02:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10719.64s)]
*  Because she's tired of being second. [[02:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10720.64s)]
*  Women don't like, listen, why you think, if you ask the average woman [[02:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10724.64s)]
*  how they feel about their husband's PlayStation, they're going to all be like, [[02:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10731.64s)]
*  They fucking hate that device because he chooses it over them constantly. [[02:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10735.64s)]
*  Right. [[02:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10743.64s)]
*  And it's like, and I feel like, I feel like the way people feel, [[02:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10744.64s)]
*  the way some people feel loved is they need to know that you'll, [[02:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10749.64s)]
*  they need to know that you'll pick them over that other thing. [[02:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10754.64s)]
*  Right. [[02:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10758.64s)]
*  At least sometimes and they'll start creating scenarios. [[02:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10759.64s)]
*  Well, what if, like, you know, a bunch of comments have jokes about like their wife going, [[02:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10763.64s)]
*  if I had no legs, would you still love me and shit like that? [[02:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10767.64s)]
*  Right. [[02:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10769.64s)]
*  And it's like, it's the same thing. [[02:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10770.64s)]
*  It's like they start creating scenarios where like, okay, babe, [[02:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10771.64s)]
*  I love that you're a comedian. [[02:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10773.64s)]
*  I know that that's how I met you. [[02:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10774.64s)]
*  And it's the most important thing in your life. [[02:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10776.64s)]
*  But like, my mom just died. [[02:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10777.64s)]
*  Can't you come to the, no, I have a gig. [[02:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10779.64s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10782.64s)]
*  Right. [[02:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10783.64s)]
*  Okay. [[02:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10784.64s)]
*  It's our anniversary. [[02:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10785.64s)]
*  You went out the last three nights. [[02:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10786.64s)]
*  Nope. [[02:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10788.64s)]
*  You know, it's like, eventually that shit's going to get exhausting. [[02:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10789.64s)]
*  Where it's like, I can't get you to pick me ever. [[02:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10792.64s)]
*  It's not going to last. [[02:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10796.64s)]
*  It depends though. [[02:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10799.64s)]
*  Some women are supportive of that. [[03:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10800.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10802.64s)]
*  Remember that movie? [[03:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10803.64s)]
*  Have you seen that documentary? [[03:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10804.64s)]
*  Oh yeah, you talked to the guy. [[03:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10805.64s)]
*  Which one? [[03:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10806.64s)]
*  The solo climb guy. [[03:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10807.64s)]
*  Yes. [[03:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10808.64s)]
*  Same thing with that. [[03:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10809.64s)]
*  We're like, he told that girl like, I'm going to always pick this climbing shit. [[03:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10810.64s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[03:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10815.64s)]
*  I'm going to always climb. [[03:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10816.64s)]
*  Yeah? [[03:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10818.64s)]
*  Go home. [[03:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10819.64s)]
*  Like, if you are the greatest of the great. [[03:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10820.64s)]
*  Yeah, if you're going to be the greatest of the great, you can't be. [[03:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10822.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10825.64s)]
*  You don't have time for anything else. [[03:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10826.64s)]
*  No. [[03:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10827.64s)]
*  How many people are trying to be the greatest quarterback of all time? [[03:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10828.64s)]
*  Well, it's like him and a couple other dudes in the conversation, right? [[03:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10831.64s)]
*  And yeah, because it's a delicate balance if you're trying to make that happen on purpose. [[03:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10834.64s)]
*  Because like, I forget the kid's name, but they called him Robo Quarterback. [[03:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10840.64s)]
*  We're like, his dad tried to make him that. [[03:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10845.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10848.64s)]
*  And it drove him nuts. [[03:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10849.64s)]
*  Marinovich? [[03:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10850.64s)]
*  Marinovich? [[03:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10851.64s)]
*  Yeah, Marinovich. [[03:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10852.64s)]
*  Todd Marinovich. [[03:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10853.64s)]
*  Yeah, and it's like, yeah, and it's like, you can't, because it's a delicate balance, [[03:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10854.64s)]
*  because you've got to instill, you've got to instill it in him, but you can't. [[03:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10857.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10861.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10862.64s)]
*  That Mar Marinovich guy went on to train BJ Penn. [[03:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10863.64s)]
*  Really? [[03:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10866.64s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[03:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10867.64s)]
*  He trained BJ Penn for some of the greatest fights that BJ ever had. [[03:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10868.64s)]
*  Because BJ had like an endless gas tank. [[03:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10871.64s)]
*  So he trained him in strength and conditioning, and he had this idea that strength and conditioning [[03:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10873.64s)]
*  was the most important thing, and that you're fighting, you already know how to fight. [[03:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10878.64s)]
*  Like, you're BJ Penn. [[03:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10882.64s)]
*  You know how to do it. [[03:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10883.64s)]
*  You don't need to work on like sparring and hitting the bag and timing and all that stuff. [[03:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10884.64s)]
*  Like, you already know that shit. [[03:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10890.64s)]
*  What's really important is you have an endless gas tank, a fucking insane gas tank. [[03:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10891.64s)]
*  And so they put him on these wild plyometric exercises. [[03:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10896.64s)]
*  They broke that dude for like six weeks. [[03:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10899.64s)]
*  But when he fought, like when he fought Shawn Chirk and when he fought Diego Sanchez, that [[03:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10901.64s)]
*  version of BJ Penn, that version, I put that version up against anybody alive or dead. [[03:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10906.64s)]
*  Yeah, he was a monster. [[03:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10911.64s)]
*  He was a monster. [[03:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10913.64s)]
*  When people talk about like the greatest of all time, you've got to include BJ in his [[03:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10914.64s)]
*  prime. [[03:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10917.64s)]
*  BJ in his prime. [[03:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10918.64s)]
*  So because people always want to look at a fighter, you look at like the overall body [[03:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10919.64s)]
*  of their work and you make an average of their performances. [[03:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10923.64s)]
*  You can't do that with BJ because in the later stages of his career, like those, that's [[03:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10926.64s)]
*  not the same BJ. [[03:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10932.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10933.64s)]
*  And we don't take care of these guys. [[03:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10934.64s)]
*  But it's also, it wasn't, he didn't have the same, like you can only be burned that hot [[03:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10935.64s)]
*  for a short amount of time. [[03:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10940.64s)]
*  Like when you're that good. [[03:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10941.64s)]
*  And with, I mean, BJ was so ferocious, like in that period. [[03:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10942.64s)]
*  Like you, I think that's very hard to maintain that intensity that he had. [[03:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10948.64s)]
*  But in that time, man, he was fucking good. [[03:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10952.64s)]
*  Did he go against GSP? [[03:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10955.64s)]
*  Yes, he did. [[03:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10956.64s)]
*  He beat him, right? [[03:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10957.64s)]
*  No, GSP beat him up, man. [[03:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10958.64s)]
*  GSP beat him up. [[03:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10960.64s)]
*  He beat Matt Hughes though. [[03:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10962.64s)]
*  But that wasn't in his prime. [[03:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10965.64s)]
*  When GSP beat him? [[03:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10967.64s)]
*  Well, no, it wasn't in his prime. [[03:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10968.64s)]
*  It was a different weight class. [[03:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10970.64s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[03:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10971.64s)]
*  Like BJ was going up to 170 to fight Matt Hughes, who was the welterweight champion. [[03:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10972.64s)]
*  But BJ was a natural guy. [[03:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10975.64s)]
*  He didn't take steroids. [[03:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10977.64s)]
*  He didn't fuck around with anything like that. [[03:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10978.64s)]
*  So he just was BJ Penn. [[03:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10980.64s)]
*  He was like the same size as he was when he's fighting people at 155 pounds. [[03:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10982.64s)]
*  And George St. Pierre is a powerhouse. [[03:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10986.64s)]
*  He's a very physically imposing fighter and his top game was fucking ruthless, man. [[03:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10988.64s)]
*  He would get guys down and beat the shit out of a man. [[03:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10994.64s)]
*  George St. Pierre was a bad man in his prime. [[03:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=10996.64s)]
*  He was a bad man. [[03:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11000.64s)]
*  And he was much bigger and he was very angry at BJ. [[03:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11001.64s)]
*  BJ was talking all this shit and BJ was saying that they're going to fight to the death. [[03:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11004.64s)]
*  Like he said that, like to the death, and I'm serious. [[03:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11009.64s)]
*  We're going to fight to the death. [[03:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11012.64s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[03:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11014.64s)]
*  And everybody's like, oh my God. [[03:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11016.64s)]
*  Remember when Matt Hughes beat GSP? [[03:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11018.64s)]
*  Didn't that happen? [[03:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11022.64s)]
*  Yes. [[03:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11023.64s)]
*  He caught him with a far side arm bar. [[03:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11024.64s)]
*  It was a thing of beauty. [[03:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11025.64s)]
*  Like one of the greatest upsets ever? [[03:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11026.64s)]
*  No, no. [[03:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11028.64s)]
*  It wasn't upset. [[03:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11029.64s)]
*  That was at the time when Matt was the champ. [[03:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11030.64s)]
*  And that was because now my memory is fucked up and so high. [[03:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11032.64s)]
*  George St. Pierre. [[03:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11037.64s)]
*  But GSP was coming back. [[03:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11038.64s)]
*  No, no, no. [[03:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11039.64s)]
*  No. [[03:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11040.64s)]
*  GSP won after that. [[03:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11041.64s)]
*  But GSP lost their first encounter. [[03:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11044.64s)]
*  Their first encounter, Matt Hughes took him down and he caught him in a far side arm bar. [[03:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11047.64s)]
*  And I think like GSP was going for a camora and the counter to the camora was the far side arm bar. [[03:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11054.64s)]
*  So he went to hit the camora and as he went to hit the camora, he didn't have control of Matt Hughes' body. [[03:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11060.64s)]
*  So Matt Hughes spun around him and it was beautiful. [[03:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11066.64s)]
*  It's like a thing of beauty, like a black belt level submission. [[03:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11069.64s)]
*  Well GSP. [[03:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11072.64s)]
*  See if you can find that. [[03:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11073.64s)]
*  Didn't he beat everyone that beat him? [[03:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11074.64s)]
*  Yes. [[03:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11076.64s)]
*  Everyone he lost till he came back. [[03:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11077.64s)]
*  Yes, everyone. [[03:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11078.64s)]
*  Dude, GSP was the fucking man. [[03:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11079.64s)]
*  And the nicest guy on earth. [[03:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11082.64s)]
*  You would never believe he's a stone cold killer. [[03:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11085.64s)]
*  He's so friendly, so nice. [[03:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11088.64s)]
*  Fucking sweetest guy you're ever going to want to run into. [[03:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11090.64s)]
*  Is he on your goat list? [[03:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11094.64s)]
*  Oh yeah, 100%. [[03:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11095.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11096.64s)]
*  If there's goat lists, he's on there. [[03:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11097.64s)]
*  So here's Matt Hughes on top and he's punching them and see what George tries to do. [[03:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11098.64s)]
*  He tries to stop by going for a camora. [[03:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11106.64s)]
*  So the counter to the camora is the far side arm bar and that's the counter and he hits it perfectly. [[03:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11108.64s)]
*  That's brilliant. [[03:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11112.64s)]
*  That is like high level black belt version of a submission. [[03:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11113.64s)]
*  Watch this spin. [[03:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11117.64s)]
*  Spin takes it. [[03:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11118.64s)]
*  Boom. [[03:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11119.64s)]
*  I mean, that's fucking art. [[03:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11120.64s)]
*  That's art. [[03:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11122.64s)]
*  That's the art in martial arts. [[03:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11123.64s)]
*  And someone hits a thing like that, like, God. [[03:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11124.64s)]
*  And you can look at that forever. [[03:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11127.64s)]
*  Like for as long as there's YouTube, as long as there's all these video platforms, you'll be able to see that far side arm bar. [[03:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11129.64s)]
*  I watched a video the other day, it was like the rarest submissions. [[03:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11135.64s)]
*  The rarest ever? [[03:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11139.64s)]
*  The rarest submissions in MMA. [[03:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11140.64s)]
*  That would have to be the twister followed by the alma plata and maybe the calf slicer. [[03:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11141.64s)]
*  And there were some that like, those were all on the list. [[03:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11147.64s)]
*  But it was actually like, not the submissions themselves, but like the actual times that it happened. [[03:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11151.64s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I'm saying. [[03:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11156.64s)]
*  The actual times. [[03:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11157.64s)]
*  I think in the UFC there's only been two or three twisters. [[03:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11158.64s)]
*  And I think the same things like only two or three alma platas. [[03:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11162.64s)]
*  And I know of one calf slicer submission that I'm thinking about and that's Charles Olivera. [[03:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11166.64s)]
*  What is that? [[03:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11173.64s)]
*  Yeah, this was it. [[03:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11174.64s)]
*  This is the twister. [[03:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11175.64s)]
*  Well, that's called the crotch ripper, actually. [[03:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11176.64s)]
*  That is from the same position that you slide into the, that was, I'd love that move. [[03:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11178.64s)]
*  Does that rip your tan apart? [[03:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11183.64s)]
*  It rips your legs apart. [[03:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11184.64s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, bro. [[03:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11185.64s)]
*  Do it again, I'll show it again. [[03:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11186.64s)]
*  This is where it comes from. [[03:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11187.64s)]
*  Where it comes from, it's like back control. [[03:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11189.64s)]
*  You get a lockdown on one leg. [[03:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11191.64s)]
*  See, he's got a lockdown on the right leg. [[03:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11193.64s)]
*  And then he takes the left leg, rather, he takes the right leg and stretches it out. [[03:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11195.64s)]
*  And look, I don't give a fuck how much you training. [[03:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11198.64s)]
*  Your survival instincts kick in when your nuts feel like they're coming apart. [[03:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11200.64s)]
*  Yes, agreed. [[03:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11205.64s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[03:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11206.64s)]
*  Look at that one. [[03:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11207.64s)]
*  Oh, look at that knee bar. [[03:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11208.64s)]
*  That's a nasty knee bar from the guard. [[03:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11209.64s)]
*  That's who Samar Paul Harris. [[03:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11211.64s)]
*  That guy is terrifying. [[03:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11213.64s)]
*  So that's another knee bar from the guard. [[03:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11214.64s)]
*  So he's got a knee bar. [[03:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11217.64s)]
*  He's got a half guard and he clamps down on the leg and gets his body sideways. [[03:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11219.64s)]
*  So he gets all that leverage on the knee. [[03:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11222.64s)]
*  That's a nasty submission too, because you probably don't have much time to tap. [[03:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11224.64s)]
*  Yeah, some of these I had never even heard of. [[03:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11229.64s)]
*  These are definitely not on the UFC. [[03:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11232.64s)]
*  So this is like he got him with a guillotine. [[03:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11235.64s)]
*  Go back to that. [[03:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11237.64s)]
*  So it's like he's got him in a guillotine, but he's got him like backwards. [[03:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11238.64s)]
*  It's a crazy. [[03:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11243.64s)]
*  And it's got an arm in too. [[03:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11244.64s)]
*  And he's like all the way over to the side. [[03:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11245.64s)]
*  That's crazy leverage. [[03:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11247.64s)]
*  This is a buggy choke. [[03:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11249.64s)]
*  This happens pretty rarely. [[03:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11250.64s)]
*  There's more and more buggy chokes in Jiu Jitsu now than ever before. [[03:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11252.64s)]
*  The Rutolo brothers are masters at it. [[03:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11256.64s)]
*  But these submissions like this with the buggy choke in UFC, I think there's only been a few. [[03:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11259.64s)]
*  He's out right there, right? [[03:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11265.64s)]
*  Yeah, he's out cold. [[03:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11266.64s)]
*  Who's being choked? [[03:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11267.64s)]
*  Oh, OK. [[03:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11268.64s)]
*  The guy on top of him. [[03:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11269.64s)]
*  So what it is is the guy gets you inside. [[03:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11270.64s)]
*  Go back to the buggy choke. [[03:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11272.64s)]
*  I'll explain. [[03:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11273.64s)]
*  Guy gets you inside control, which is usually a good position to be in. [[03:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11274.64s)]
*  But what you do is you reach up, you grab your own leg, you trap his neck in between your leg and your arm. [[03:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11277.64s)]
*  So you see how he's pulling that right there? [[03:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11284.64s)]
*  So it's like a triangle. [[03:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11286.64s)]
*  Is the black dude getting choked right now? [[03:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11287.64s)]
*  The guy on the bottom with the hair is the one that's applying the choke. [[03:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11289.64s)]
*  So it's hard to see because his legs are the same color. [[03:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11293.64s)]
*  It's not... [[03:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11296.64s)]
*  Leg? [[03:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11297.64s)]
*  Yeah, it's just... [[03:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11298.64s)]
*  Oh, OK. [[03:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11299.64s)]
*  So he's grabbing his own leg. [[03:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11300.64s)]
*  Let it play out and you'll get to see. [[03:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11301.64s)]
*  And so he lets him go. [[03:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11302.64s)]
*  Both guys are white guys. [[03:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11303.64s)]
*  Oh, OK. [[03:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11304.64s)]
*  So watch, I think. [[03:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11305.64s)]
*  There you go. [[03:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11307.64s)]
*  I'm not sure about that. [[03:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11308.64s)]
*  He's holding his arm here and his leg is in there holding the pressure down. [[03:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11309.64s)]
*  Yes. [[03:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11312.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11313.64s)]
*  So it's basically like a triangle choke, but you're doing it... [[03:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11314.64s)]
*  See, he's got his arm... [[03:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11319.64s)]
*  You want me to explain it to you? [[03:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11320.64s)]
*  So this is his arm. [[03:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11322.64s)]
*  Right. [[03:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11323.64s)]
*  That's the guy who's winning. [[03:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11324.64s)]
*  So he's got his arms clasped together. [[03:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11325.64s)]
*  And see how this one arm that's clasped together over his own foot is pinned down against that dude's neck. [[03:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11327.64s)]
*  So what you have on... [[03:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11333.64s)]
*  You have one side, he's cutting off the carotid artery with his right shoulder, or his left shoulder rather. [[03:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11334.64s)]
*  On the other side, he's using his left leg. [[03:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11340.64s)]
*  So he's got the two of them together, connected and squishing the neck. [[03:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11342.64s)]
*  See how he's doing that? [[03:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11347.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11348.64s)]
*  So it's like he's using his own arm and he's got that guy's arm in place. [[03:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11349.64s)]
*  I mean, it's fucking brilliant. [[03:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11356.64s)]
*  Oh, that's vicious. [[03:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11358.64s)]
*  That's nasty. [[03:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11360.64s)]
*  That's like a camora from the back. [[03:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11361.64s)]
*  That's like... [[03:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11362.64s)]
*  Yeah, he's doing a camora from back control. [[03:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11364.64s)]
*  The Boston Crab. [[03:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11367.64s)]
*  Somebody got submitted with that. [[03:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11368.64s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I saw that too. [[03:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11369.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11370.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11371.64s)]
*  That's probably the rarest. [[03:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11372.64s)]
*  That might be the rarest. [[03:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11373.64s)]
*  Yeah? [[03:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11374.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11375.64s)]
*  I don't know of any other people that I've ever even heard of. [[03:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11376.64s)]
*  I'm sure it's happened. [[03:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11380.64s)]
*  I'm sure it's happened on some regional scene or something like that. [[03:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11381.64s)]
*  I didn't know about it. [[03:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11384.64s)]
*  Yeah, that could never happen in the UFC. [[03:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11385.64s)]
*  If it did, the matchmakers have some fucking explaining to do. [[03:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11387.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11391.64s)]
*  I mean, or maybe it was like UFC one or two. [[03:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11392.64s)]
*  Like, you know, maybe like a long time ago, but not now. [[03:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11394.64s)]
*  Well, it could be that a guy gets hurt. [[03:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11396.64s)]
*  And when guys get hurt, they don't know what's going on. [[03:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11399.64s)]
*  And people can put them in compromising positions much easier. [[03:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11403.64s)]
*  Well, since we watched the whole video, the number one here, [[03:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11406.64s)]
*  I believe what's happening here, the guy on the bottom... [[03:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11408.64s)]
*  Oh, he's doing like a teepee, but he's doing it to his rib cage. [[03:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11411.64s)]
*  Instead of doing it as a choke, he's just crushing his ribs and his body [[03:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11415.64s)]
*  with his arm and his legs together. [[03:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11419.64s)]
*  So he's just crushing the dude's ribs. [[03:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11422.64s)]
*  Yeah, I'm pretty sure that this guy is like... [[03:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11424.64s)]
*  He says in the beginning of the video that they aren't actually ranked in order. [[03:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11427.64s)]
*  Google teepee triangle. [[03:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11431.64s)]
*  So there's guys that are finishing triangles now, and Eddie called it a teepee [[03:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11433.64s)]
*  because it looks like a teepee. [[03:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11438.64s)]
*  You get your legs up there and you get his arm in like a triangle. [[03:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11440.64s)]
*  But instead of cinching it down the way like he tapped Hoyler in Brazil, [[03:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11443.64s)]
*  instead of cinching it down, you clasp your hands together. [[03:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11447.64s)]
*  And when they do that... [[03:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11451.64s)]
*  Is he going to get it here? [[03:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11453.64s)]
*  So when you do that, you have like a pinch. [[03:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11456.64s)]
*  See the S-grip? He's pinching his legs together. [[03:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11459.64s)]
*  So it's like a no-arm triangle. [[03:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11463.64s)]
*  Or rather, it's a one-arm triangle. He does have one arm in. [[03:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11466.64s)]
*  And he puts him to sleep. [[03:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11469.64s)]
*  He had the left arm in. [[03:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11471.64s)]
*  So the other one has no... The buggy choke has no arms. [[03:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11473.64s)]
*  The guy's got his back. [[03:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11476.64s)]
*  No, these two on the side. They're fighting to talk to him or something. [[03:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11478.64s)]
*  What's going on? [[03:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11481.64s)]
*  They're probably coaching. [[03:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11483.64s)]
*  Yeah. He's probably trying to keep his friend from being stupid. [[03:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11485.64s)]
*  All right. I just wondered. [[03:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11489.64s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah. [[03:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11491.64s)]
*  That seems very weird. Is that what it is? [[03:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11493.64s)]
*  It says tap-tag. That's what it says. [[03:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11496.64s)]
*  Oh, my God. That is what it is. [[03:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11498.64s)]
*  Oh, my God. That's hilarious. They have tag-team jujitsu. [[03:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11501.64s)]
*  That is hilarious. [[03:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11504.64s)]
*  So we set it... Show how he sets it up again. [[03:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11506.64s)]
*  So, yeah, it is no arms. [[03:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11509.64s)]
*  So, look, watch. When he gets the leg across, he pops it out, [[03:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11511.64s)]
*  and now he's got... Hey, does he have the arm on the left side? [[03:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11515.64s)]
*  No, he has the arm on the left side. [[03:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11518.64s)]
*  No, he doesn't have it in. [[03:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11520.64s)]
*  You sure he doesn't have it in? [[03:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11522.64s)]
*  Right, but the left side seems like the arm's trapped, right? [[03:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11524.64s)]
*  Oh, you're talking about the dude in the yellow's arm. [[03:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11526.64s)]
*  Yeah. Back it up a little bit. [[03:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11528.64s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's trapped. [[03:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11530.64s)]
*  That's the only thing that makes sense. [[03:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11532.64s)]
*  I have seen people do scissor chokes without an arm in, [[03:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11534.64s)]
*  where a guy's leg squeezed is so good, [[03:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11537.64s)]
*  if they get a hold of your neck, [[03:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11539.64s)]
*  particularly if they get you in a crucifix position, [[03:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11541.64s)]
*  you can't defend right, they clamp down on your neck [[03:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11543.64s)]
*  just with just their legs just squeezing like a scissor's position. [[03:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11547.64s)]
*  Bro, in those situations, man, a lot of times, [[03:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11550.64s)]
*  your life really is in those referees' hands. [[03:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11552.64s)]
*  Oh, yeah, for sure. [[03:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11554.64s)]
*  Because it doesn't take that long. Like, if it's a blood choke, [[03:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11556.64s)]
*  it doesn't take that long for you to die. [[03:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11558.64s)]
*  Right, if somebody lets you hold onto that for, like, five minutes... [[03:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11560.64s)]
*  Oh, yeah. I don't even think it's that long. [[03:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11562.64s)]
*  How long before it kills you? [[03:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11565.64s)]
*  It's seconds. It's not minutes. [[03:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11567.64s)]
*  Really? [[03:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11570.64s)]
*  Yeah, I think you probably have, like, 15 seconds. [[03:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11572.64s)]
*  If they cut off the blood right here... [[03:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11574.64s)]
*  For 15 seconds? [[03:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11576.64s)]
*  It's not that long. I don't know the exact amount of time, [[03:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11578.64s)]
*  but you don't have that long for a blood choke. [[03:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11580.64s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[03:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11582.64s)]
*  You have way more time if they cut off your air [[03:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11584.64s)]
*  than you do if they... [[03:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11586.64s)]
*  Because you can hold your breath much longer. [[03:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11588.64s)]
*  If they hit the arteries, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[03:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11590.64s)]
*  Because the blood choke, [[03:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11592.64s)]
*  your brain is literally not getting oxygen. [[03:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11594.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11596.64s)]
*  20 seconds. [[03:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11598.64s)]
*  A well-applied blood choke may lead to unconsciousness [[03:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11600.64s)]
*  10 to 20 seconds. [[03:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11602.64s)]
*  Injury or death is plausible [[03:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11604.64s)]
*  if the arteries remain constricted [[03:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11606.64s)]
*  for more than 20 seconds. [[03:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11608.64s)]
*  Compared to strangulation with the hands, [[03:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11610.64s)]
*  properly applied blood chokes require little physical strength. [[03:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11612.64s)]
*  That's not true. [[03:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11614.64s)]
*  That's not true. [[03:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11616.64s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you could choke, but you could blood choke somebody [[03:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11618.64s)]
*  with their own... [[03:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11620.64s)]
*  You're choking. That's a ridiculous thing to say. [[03:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11622.64s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[03:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11624.64s)]
*  You need some physical strength. [[03:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11626.64s)]
*  I mean, you don't need to be, like, super duper strong. [[03:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11628.64s)]
*  That was misworded. [[03:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11630.64s)]
*  I think they meant... [[03:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11632.64s)]
*  It doesn't take that much pressure. [[03:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11634.64s)]
*  Not fighting back. [[03:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11636.64s)]
*  But there's a lot, man. There's a lot going on [[03:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11638.64s)]
*  when you're choking somebody. [[03:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11640.64s)]
*  That's not true, really. [[03:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11642.64s)]
*  Like, you can do it like this, [[03:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11644.64s)]
*  but it requires physical strength. [[03:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11646.64s)]
*  It definitely does. [[03:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11648.64s)]
*  I mean, 100% it's technique, [[03:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11650.64s)]
*  but there's physical strength in this. [[03:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11652.64s)]
*  Also, when you get your arm around someone's neck [[03:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11654.64s)]
*  and then you get this behind the neck like this, [[03:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11656.64s)]
*  there's all this struggling [[03:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11658.64s)]
*  to get this hand down in there. [[03:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11660.64s)]
*  There's a lot going on. [[03:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11662.64s)]
*  And then once you get it in there, the guy's trying to peel your arms off, [[03:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11664.64s)]
*  and you just fucking squeeze. [[03:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11666.64s)]
*  Your jaw's getting pushed to the side. [[03:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11668.64s)]
*  You're fucking squeezing. [[03:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11670.64s)]
*  There's a lot of physical strength involved, [[03:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11672.64s)]
*  especially if you're doing it to someone who's strong. [[03:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11674.64s)]
*  The idea of saying [[03:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11676.64s)]
*  there's not a lot of physical strength. [[03:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11678.64s)]
*  But what if someone's strong? [[03:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11680.64s)]
*  But I think you're interpreting it as [[03:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11682.64s)]
*  someone fighting back. [[03:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11684.64s)]
*  They're just talking about it doesn't take that much strength. [[03:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11686.64s)]
*  To cut it off. [[03:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11688.64s)]
*  Well, that's true then. That's true. [[03:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11690.64s)]
*  I'm thinking about it from a Jiu Jitsu perspective. [[03:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11692.64s)]
*  He's like, what? [[03:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11694.64s)]
*  There's plenty of counters. What are you talking about? [[03:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11696.64s)]
*  I just don't like when people diminish [[03:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11698.64s)]
*  what's necessary. [[03:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11700.64s)]
*  I don't want people to get a false sense [[03:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11702.64s)]
*  of what works and doesn't work. [[03:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11704.64s)]
*  Well, there's a lot of that shit going on. [[03:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11706.64s)]
*  There's always going to be that. [[03:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11708.64s)]
*  There's always going to be that. Jitsu's hard. [[03:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11710.64s)]
*  It's fucking hard to do. [[03:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11712.64s)]
*  Do you know of any survival myths that are bullshit? [[03:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11714.64s)]
*  Survival myths? [[03:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11716.64s)]
*  Yeah, like people go, you know, [[03:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11718.64s)]
*  it's like all these old wives [[03:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11720.64s)]
*  tales about what to do if you're in the wilderness. [[03:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11722.64s)]
*  Like we see a bear. [[03:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11724.64s)]
*  And most of it's wrong. [[03:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11726.64s)]
*  Most of it will get you killed. [[03:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11728.64s)]
*  Like what will get you killed? [[03:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11730.64s)]
*  Like rationing water. [[03:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11732.64s)]
*  It's like you're better off [[03:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11734.64s)]
*  rationing your sweat [[03:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11736.64s)]
*  than water. [[03:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11738.64s)]
*  Because if you don't hydrate, [[03:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11740.64s)]
*  real quick you're going to get stupid. [[03:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11742.64s)]
*  Yeah, and you got to drink your own piss. [[03:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11744.64s)]
*  Yeah, but it's like [[03:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11746.64s)]
*  it's way better for you to hydrate fully [[03:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11748.64s)]
*  as long as you can [[03:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11750.64s)]
*  than it is for you to like be [[03:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11752.64s)]
*  10% hydrated [[03:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11754.64s)]
*  for a long, [[03:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11756.64s)]
*  drawn out amount of time. [[03:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11758.64s)]
*  Because you're going to do dumb shit. [[03:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11760.64s)]
*  You're going to come from that, from the beginning. [[03:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11762.64s)]
*  And if you can drink your piss, you have to. [[03:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11764.64s)]
*  Here's one. [[03:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11766.64s)]
*  You got to drink your piss. [[03:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11768.64s)]
*  What is it? [[03:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11770.64s)]
*  Playing dead. [[03:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11772.64s)]
*  That only works sometimes. [[03:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11774.64s)]
*  See, here's the thing. [[03:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11776.64s)]
*  It depends on why the bear is attacking you. [[03:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11778.64s)]
*  Is the bear attacking you because of predation? [[03:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11780.64s)]
*  Is it trying to kill you? [[03:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11782.64s)]
*  Or is the bear attacking you because you think it's a threat? [[03:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11784.64s)]
*  If he thinks you're a threat and they minimize you [[03:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11786.64s)]
*  and you play dead, they may stop attacking you. [[03:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11788.64s)]
*  The question is, how the fuck do you know? [[03:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11790.64s)]
*  When do you know? [[03:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11792.64s)]
*  How much do you have to move before the bear decides to bite you again? [[03:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11794.64s)]
*  I saw the revenue. [[03:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11798.64s)]
*  Dude, that shit, [[03:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11800.64s)]
*  that's based on a real story. [[03:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11802.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11804.64s)]
*  Roughly based on a real story. [[03:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11806.64s)]
*  It happened in the drive Steve Rinell and nuts. [[03:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11808.64s)]
*  Because it happened in the Great Plains. [[03:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11810.64s)]
*  But the way they made it, [[03:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11812.64s)]
*  they made it like it was, [[03:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11814.64s)]
*  I think it happened in the Great Plains in real life. [[03:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11816.64s)]
*  It happened in a totally different environment. [[03:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11818.64s)]
*  And they filmed it in the rainforest. [[03:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11820.64s)]
*  Myth, if a shark attacks you, punch it in the nose. [[03:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11822.64s)]
*  That's a myth? [[03:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11824.64s)]
*  It's really hard to land a solid punch in the nose of a moving shark. [[03:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11826.64s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[03:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11828.64s)]
*  I just saw a video I think they filmed it for the new Shark Week probably. [[03:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11830.64s)]
*  There's a guy in a plexiglass [[03:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11834.64s)]
*  just above the water, [[03:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11836.64s)]
*  just under the water tank, cage they're calling it. [[03:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11838.64s)]
*  This fucking gigantic great white comes [[03:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11842.64s)]
*  and starts circling him. [[03:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11844.64s)]
*  And it just fucking attacks him from the bottom [[03:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11846.64s)]
*  and breaks right through the fucking cage. [[03:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11848.64s)]
*  Oh my god. [[03:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11850.64s)]
*  Dude, don't show me this. [[03:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11852.64s)]
*  Show me it. [[03:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11854.64s)]
*  Did the water immediately fill up with shit? [[03:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11856.64s)]
*  Because I would have shit my pants in that water. [[03:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11858.64s)]
*  I think they filmed it for something. That's why we haven't seen all of the video yet. [[03:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11860.64s)]
*  Imagine Trescent a motherfucker [[03:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11862.64s)]
*  and losing your life because you trusted it. [[03:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11864.64s)]
*  Like when Owen Hart died. [[03:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11866.64s)]
*  Imagine all the motherfuckers that told him [[03:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11868.64s)]
*  all those things were good [[03:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11870.64s)]
*  and strapped in and boom and he jumps [[03:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11872.64s)]
*  from the roof and it breaks. [[03:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11874.64s)]
*  Oh my god. [[03:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11876.64s)]
*  This actually didn't just happen in the summer. [[03:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11878.64s)]
*  So this dude is in a plexiglass box. [[03:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11882.64s)]
*  There's the box. [[03:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11886.64s)]
*  He's there in the water and here's a shark. [[03:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11888.64s)]
*  And it comes right through the fucking plexiglass. [[03:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11890.64s)]
*  Easily could have bit him. [[03:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11892.64s)]
*  Look at that. Easily could have got him. [[03:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11894.64s)]
*  They had to know this. [[03:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11896.64s)]
*  You a goddamn fool. [[03:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11898.64s)]
*  This is what I'm saying. [[03:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11900.64s)]
*  The fuckers are like listen, you want this show to get some fucking attention or not? [[03:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11902.64s)]
*  That's what we do. [[03:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11904.64s)]
*  We give them a plexiglass box. [[03:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11906.64s)]
*  Is it going to stop the shark? [[03:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11908.64s)]
*  Experts say. [[03:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11910.64s)]
*  We have it right here in the paperwork. [[03:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11912.64s)]
*  It's going to stop the shark. [[03:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11914.64s)]
*  It's shark proof. [[03:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11916.64s)]
*  So the guy that they're interviewing, he says there's no cage that will stop a great white shark. [[03:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11918.64s)]
*  It's just something to help. [[03:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11920.64s)]
*  He says we told him it was shark resistant. [[03:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11922.64s)]
*  How crazy is that? [[03:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11924.64s)]
*  There's no cage that will stop a great white shark. [[03:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11926.64s)]
*  These motherfuckers are still going shark diving. [[03:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11928.64s)]
*  Are you out of your fucking mind? [[03:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11930.64s)]
*  That looks so flimsy dude. [[03:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11932.64s)]
*  That looks like an in and out box. [[03:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11934.64s)]
*  There's nothing that you can see through that's going to stop a shark. [[03:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11936.64s)]
*  Look at this dude. [[03:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11938.64s)]
*  Look at this thing go through this. [[03:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11940.64s)]
*  It barely misses that guy. [[03:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11942.64s)]
*  Barely misses biting him in half. [[03:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11944.64s)]
*  He's just got a wetsuit on. [[03:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11946.64s)]
*  It blows right by him. [[03:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11948.64s)]
*  The fucked up thing is it's trying to eat him. [[03:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11950.64s)]
*  That's the most fucked up thing. [[03:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11952.64s)]
*  Show that again. [[03:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11954.64s)]
*  The reason why it's going at him is because it wants to eat him. [[03:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11956.64s)]
*  It had already brushed by and touched it once to find out. [[03:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11958.64s)]
*  I'm going to come back after this thing. [[03:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11960.64s)]

*  From what? [[03:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11974.64s)]
*  From a great white they believe. [[03:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11976.64s)]
*  Not a great white. [[03:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11978.64s)]
*  They're not sure what shark it was. [[03:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11980.64s)]
*  Great whites aren't in Maui. [[03:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11982.64s)]
*  It would either be a tiger shark or something. [[03:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11984.64s)]
*  What was she doing? [[03:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11986.64s)]
*  They were snorkeling. [[03:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11988.64s)]
*  The people on the beach were watching this shark. [[03:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11990.64s)]
*  They yelled at the husband to come in. [[03:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11992.64s)]
*  Body is not recovered. [[03:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11994.64s)]
*  I've always had an intense fear of the ocean. [[03:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11996.64s)]
*  The only time I've ever been in the ocean is I got talked in by a girl when I was in high school. [[03:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=11998.64s)]

*  I immediately got stung on my head. [[03:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12002.64s)]
*  I was like, what the fuck? [[03:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12004.64s)]

*  I'm going to die. [[03:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12012.64s)]
*  I immediately got stung on both feet by jellyfish. [[03:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12014.64s)]
*  I immediately got stung on both feet by jellyfish. [[03:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12016.64s)]
*  Never went there again. [[03:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12018.64s)]
*  When I go to the beach I chill on the sand. [[03:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12020.64s)]
*  Meanwhile, there's a girl who was 13 years old. [[03:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12022.64s)]
*  She got her arm bitten off by a shark surf and she got right back on the board. [[03:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12024.64s)]
*  Right after? [[03:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12026.64s)]

*  Is it a video? [[03:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12054.64s)]
*  She's a wicked surfer. [[03:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12056.64s)]
*  She's doing it all with one arm. [[03:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12058.64s)]
*  She lost her fucking arm to a shark. [[03:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12060.64s)]

*  There's no sharks in my world. [[03:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12106.64s)]

*  No one wants to do that. [[03:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12110.64s)]
*  Look at that wave he's riding. [[03:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12112.64s)]
*  What kind of psychoticness is this? [[03:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12114.64s)]
*  I know that the danger isn't the same. [[03:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12116.64s)]
*  Look at that. [[03:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12118.64s)]
*  Look at that. [[03:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12120.64s)]

*  Imagine if that thing comes crashing down on you. [[03:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12124.64s)]
*  Imagine if you can't believe that thing. [[03:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12126.64s)]
*  And he's riding this with his balance. [[03:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12128.64s)]
*  On this ever changing landscape of water. [[03:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12130.64s)]
*  He's floating with a fucking billion pounds of water overhead. [[03:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12132.64s)]
*  Ready to collapse on him at any moment. [[03:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12134.64s)]
*  And hopefully not knock him unconscious. [[03:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12136.64s)]
*  Because when that water hits you like that, [[03:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12138.64s)]
*  a lot of people just go out, man. [[03:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12140.64s)]

*  Dude. [[03:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12144.64s)]
*  But look, like I was saying, [[03:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12146.64s)]
*  the danger isn't the same, [[03:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12148.64s)]
*  but the fear is the same. [[03:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12150.64s)]
*  People look at what you do and say, [[03:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12152.64s)]
*  you're going to go up and speak in front of 50,000 people? [[03:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12154.64s)]
*  That's insane to the average person. [[03:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12156.64s)]
*  They would never. [[03:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12158.64s)]
*  To them they look at you like you're just as crazy as this motherfucker. [[03:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12160.64s)]
*  Well, I'm letting them know. [[03:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12162.64s)]
*  You're incorrect. [[03:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12164.64s)]
*  That's way harder. [[03:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12166.64s)]
*  Fucking anybody can do this with practice. [[03:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12168.64s)]
*  But you know what? [[03:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12170.64s)]
*  To them, they look at that the same way we look at stand up. [[03:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12172.64s)]
*  What? [[03:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12174.64s)]

*  Where's like you go after stage time and they would never. [[03:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12184.64s)]
*  Where's like you go after stage time and they would never. [[03:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12186.64s)]
*  And they look at that like, oh, there's a wave over there? [[03:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12188.64s)]

*  You ever see that? [[03:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12194.64s)]
*  They get dragged out to the biggest waves, [[03:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12196.64s)]
*  these crazy waves. [[03:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12198.64s)]
*  You're so far, you can't even get back on your own without that wave. [[03:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12200.64s)]
*  You're so far, you can't even get back on your own without that wave. [[03:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12202.64s)]

*  Yeah, the surfers, people that do extreme sports, [[03:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12206.64s)]
*  they lost me. [[03:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12208.64s)]
*  See if you can get a video of them getting pulled by jet skis out to these. [[03:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12210.64s)]
*  See if you can get a video of them getting pulled by jet skis out to these. [[03:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12212.64s)]
*  They do it, I think it's out near, [[03:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12214.64s)]
*  I believe there's a big one near Mexico [[03:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12216.64s)]
*  that they love, that they go out to. [[03:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12218.64s)]
*  But isn't everything shifting because of climate change and shit? [[03:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12220.64s)]
*  But isn't everything shifting because of climate change and shit? [[03:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12222.64s)]

*  Look at how far they are from land. [[03:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12234.64s)]
*  Look at how far they are from land. [[03:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12236.64s)]
*  They save them, so that's very helpful too. [[03:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12238.64s)]
*  They go get them, they crash. [[03:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12240.64s)]
*  That's a good point. [[03:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12242.64s)]
*  Because if you get hit by one of these fucking waves, [[03:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12244.64s)]
*  Jesus. [[03:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12246.64s)]

*  Jesus fucking Christ, your hands get sweaty. [[03:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12262.64s)]
*  That's how I feel about this one. [[03:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12264.64s)]
*  What's the biggest wave ever surfed? [[03:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12266.64s)]
*  How tall is it? [[03:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12268.64s)]
*  That's a good question. [[03:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12270.64s)]
*  Look at this. [[03:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12272.64s)]
*  Watch this. [[03:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12274.64s)]
*  The largest wave surfed. [[03:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12276.64s)]
*  Look at the size of that thing. [[03:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12278.64s)]
*  Look at the size of that wave, dude. [[03:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12280.64s)]
*  That's insanity. [[03:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12282.64s)]
*  What is that, 50 something feet? [[03:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12284.64s)]
*  Who the fuck knows, man? [[03:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12286.64s)]
*  The term unlimited means that the surfer is [[03:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12288.64s)]
*  towed to the wave, enabling them to catch waves [[03:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12290.64s)]
*  that would be too strong to be caught. [[03:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12292.64s)]
*  Otherwise. [[03:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12294.64s)]
*  Oh, that's why they do it, because they would never be able to keep up with it. [[03:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12296.64s)]
*  78 feet. [[03:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12298.64s)]
*  78 feet. [[03:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12300.64s)]
*  That's crazy. [[03:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12302.64s)]
*  But one of these days, a surfer's going to get caught out [[03:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12304.64s)]
*  when it's like a tidal wave. [[03:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12306.64s)]
*  They're going to get lucky and unlucky. [[03:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12308.64s)]
*  That's what they're looking for. [[03:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12310.64s)]
*  Oh yeah, they want to die on that motherfucker. [[03:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12312.64s)]
*  Perfect storm. Have you ever seen the movie? [[03:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12314.64s)]
*  Yeah, because they're going to catch like a 150 foot wave [[03:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12316.64s)]
*  because an earthquake just happened [[03:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12318.64s)]
*  and hit while they was out there. [[03:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12320.64s)]
*  And they might not survive, but they're going to be like, [[03:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12322.64s)]
*  but I'm going out a legend. [[03:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12324.64s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. You would. [[03:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12326.64s)]
*  A lot of guys have. [[03:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12328.64s)]
*  In that world, that's their risk versus reward. [[03:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12330.64s)]
*  They live for it. [[03:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12332.64s)]
*  And there's way less money in it. [[03:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12334.64s)]
*  The people that are making [[03:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12336.64s)]
*  a good living from it [[03:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12338.64s)]
*  is such a small percentage [[03:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12340.64s)]
*  of the surfers in the world. [[03:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12342.64s)]
*  I can only imagine. [[03:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12344.64s)]
*  And surfing's hard to get into, man, because [[03:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12346.64s)]
*  I didn't realize [[03:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12348.64s)]
*  they're very territorial. [[03:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12350.64s)]
*  If you're new somewhere and you're like, [[03:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12352.64s)]
*  I'm just out here trying to figure it out, they'll hurt you. [[03:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12354.64s)]
*  This is the plot to Point Break you're explaining right now. [[03:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12356.64s)]
*  This is a movie I haven't heard of in a long time. [[03:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12362.64s)]
*  Isn't that Patrick Swayze and Keanu Reeves? [[03:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12364.64s)]
*  R.I.P. Patrick Swayze, man. [[03:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12368.64s)]

*  that if you're high, you just need to be a little high [[03:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12386.64s)]
*  and it teeters into the absolutely preposterous. [[03:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12388.64s)]
*  Is it 90s or 80s? [[03:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12390.64s)]
*  89. [[03:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12392.64s)]
*  It's amazing. [[03:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12394.64s)]

*  Remember Ghost? [[03:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12398.64s)]

*  Anything can happen. [[03:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12418.64s)]
*  Look at this. [[03:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12424.64s)]
*  I'm going to the door. [[03:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12436.64s)]
*  Until it's time to not be nice. [[03:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12438.64s)]
*  So says the fighting philosopher. [[03:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12440.64s)]
*  Oh, this dude from Big Lebowski. [[03:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12442.64s)]
*  I keep talking, you're going to go off thinking I'm a nice guy. [[03:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12444.64s)]
*  I know you're not a nice guy. [[03:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12446.64s)]
*  But he's easy. [[03:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12448.64s)]

*  Holy shit. [[03:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12452.64s)]
*  The worst I ever had was wonderful. [[03:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12454.64s)]
*  He's not what you'd expect. [[03:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12456.64s)]
*  He's all karate down on there. [[03:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12458.64s)]
*  But Patrick Swayze [[03:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12460.64s)]
*  was like a dancer. [[03:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12462.64s)]
*  So he wasn't necessarily like a martial arts expert. [[03:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12464.64s)]
*  But he really knows how to move his body well. [[03:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12468.64s)]
*  He got famous from that. [[03:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12472.64s)]
*  The dancing was what, [[03:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12476.64s)]
*  I mean like for dirty dancing. [[03:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12478.64s)]
*  What is this movie about? [[03:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12480.64s)]
*  About a badass, bro. [[03:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12482.64s)]
*  What the fuck is wrong with you? [[03:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12484.64s)]
*  And that's the bad guy. [[03:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12486.64s)]
*  He's the bad guy. [[03:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12488.64s)]
*  Look, here's the other bad guy, the other karate bad guy. [[03:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12490.64s)]
*  Bro, one of the greatest karate fights ever. [[03:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12492.64s)]
*  There's fucking guns, murder. [[03:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12494.64s)]
*  Alright, you've convinced me. [[03:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12498.64s)]
*  Roadhouse. [[03:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12500.64s)]
*  They're redoing it with Jake Glillenhall. [[03:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12502.64s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no. [[03:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12504.64s)]
*  Jake can do it. [[03:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12506.64s)]
*  I bet it's going to be great. Joel Silver is producing it. [[03:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12508.64s)]
*  Roadhouse, do they have that in there? [[03:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12510.64s)]
*  Conor McGregor is in it. [[03:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12512.64s)]
*  I bet it's going to be great. [[03:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12514.64s)]
*  Maybe that's why he left the Usada pool. [[03:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12516.64s)]
*  No he hurt his leg. [[03:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12518.64s)]
*  Some people said that part of the reason helped a little bit. Oh, yeah, it's on Netflix [[03:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12520.64s)]
*  Yeah, the original is though. The new one is they're just starting to work on it now. Yeah, they just finished production [[03:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12526.96s)]
*  I think so they did some stuff at the UFC and Jake Gyllenhaal is playing [[03:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12532.8s)]
*  Explain the Patrick Swayze character. Yeah, I believe so. Yeah, he's playing the badass [[03:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12538.16s)]
*  He could pull it off. He did that Southpaw movie. Did you ever see that? [[03:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12543.84s)]
*  Dude, he got fucking [[03:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12547.08s)]
*  Ready, I think I did see it. It's pull up Southpaw. It's a good fucking movie man. It's a heavy movie [[03:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12549.56s)]
*  It's like it's not like a cheesy movie by any stretch of the imagination is very gritty movie very realistic movie [[03:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12555.8s)]
*  About this guy's like really really fucked up, you know, what killer boxer, you know, what shit you gotta see [[03:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12561.44s)]
*  Barbarian look at him. Look at him [[03:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12567.16s)]
*  Bro, I mean he got fucking jacked. I think I did see this dude [[03:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12569.84s)]
*  He looks like he's fighting in the UFC welterweight division like look at him he's fucking shredded there dude [[03:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12574.62s)]
*  Yeah, and this is some of the hardest acting to do is look at that the like boxing is though [[03:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12581.02s)]
*  It's real right make it look real. Well, he pulled it off man. He's one of the few guys [[03:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12586.02s)]
*  That that's really pulled off looking like like he knows how to box [[03:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12590.94s)]
*  Daniel Day Lewis did it in that movie the boxer and he actually trained as a boxer for a year before he did that movie [[03:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12596.98s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Well, then you're dating on fucking real dude [[03:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12604.380000000001s)]
*  He's the the best version of like a guy who had doubt but Jake Gyllenhaal nailed it [[03:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12607.26s)]
*  He really looks like a modern-day elite athlete that can fight like you buy it [[03:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12612.14s)]
*  Oh, there's never a moment where you like get the fuck out of here. Like why is he knocking everybody out? It seems real [[03:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12617.14s)]
*  Yeah, he's one of the best. Oh, it's phenomenal in this movie. But what was the other movie that I said? [[03:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12622.7s)]
*  I [[03:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12627.9s)]
*  Said I said barbarian no, no, there's another box. Oh Daniel Day Lewis pull up Daniel Day Lewis from the boxer [[03:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12630.619999999999s)]
*  Oh the boxer. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So the reason why this one is almost like [[03:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12638.22s)]
*  It's it's almost more realistic like when you see him move around [[03:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12645.18s)]
*  This is almost because the other one was like all knockout punches and shit. Whereas most boxing matches [[03:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12649.18s)]
*  They're they're matches like a lot of shit goes on before a knockout punch [[03:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12655.5s)]
*  It's not like you just unless you're Mike Tyson, you're not just smashing everybody right away [[03:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12659.1s)]
*  You know that so they're showing like these clips like quick clips [[03:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12664.42s)]
*  But in that movie see if you should this is the fight when you see him fight [[03:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12667.900000000001s)]
*  It looks like an actual fight [[03:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12673.7s)]
*  Like they're moving around hitting each other [[03:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12676.28s)]
*  Like this is like he looks good man, he looks good like I'm buying that he just knocked that guy out pretty quick too [[03:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12678.92s)]
*  Though maybe this destroys my argument. No, but that's what Daniel the way he the way he prepares for a movie is like insane [[03:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12685.0s)]
*  He looked good there though, but so did Jake Lillin Hall. The point is like Jake Lillin Hall almost looks too good [[03:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12691.68s)]
*  He's like he's so shredded. He's like he looks more like a wrestler like an MMA fighter [[03:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12696.64s)]
*  Like an MMA fighter then is it like there's a there's only a few boxers that are that jacked is like Anthony Joshua [[03:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12702.4s)]
*  There's a few guys. Most guys are like a little like Terrence Crawford. They're a little leaner [[03:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12708.24s)]
*  They're not quite as muscular. Yeah, cuz I pretty must why do you think that is? [[03:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12713.52s)]
*  Well, because you want to be the right size for the weight class, right? [[03:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12718.880000000001s)]
*  so if you're in a weight class say like a hundred and seventy pounds you [[03:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12722.36s)]
*  You want to like maximize your frame? [[03:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12727.92s)]
*  You want to like fight in the weight class that your frame is suited because if you're too big in the chest [[03:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12731.52s)]
*  You're slower because you have longer to reach [[03:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12736.52s)]
*  There's also like some people are just naturally thicker and they're built like Dwight Muhammad. Kawee [[03:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12738.76s)]
*  He was a heavyweight champion and he was [[03:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12744.12s)]
*  Well, he was a light heavyweight champion and then he fought as a heavyweight and he was like I believe he was 5'7 [[03:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12747.28s)]
*  No, and Dwight Muhammad Kawee [[03:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12752.68s)]
*  He was amazing man in he fought some wars back in the day [[03:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12755.640000000001s)]
*  He fought a Vanderhoof feel I think it was cruiserweight now that I'm thinking about it [[03:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12760.060000000001s)]
*  I think he beat a Vanderhoof field for the cruiserweight title. I think that's what it was [[03:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12763.62s)]
*  I don't think it was light heavyweight [[03:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12767.78s)]
*  But he was a tank man and he would just like cover up and move in and you never heard of him [[03:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12769.300000000001s)]
*  No, dude, he was a beast but it's so on you see pull up Dwight Muhammad Kawee [[03:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12775.32s)]
*  Versus a Vanderhoof field and this was on Holyfield just got back from the Olympics spell Kawee [[03:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12780.380000000001s)]
*  QAW I [[03:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12786.74s)]
*  And it was like when a Vander this was his first like big test as a professional [[03:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12788.62s)]
*  This was like a world championship fight and he lost. Yeah. No a Vander one. I've been to beat him [[03:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12793.82s)]
*  That's how good a Vander was [[03:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12799.18s)]
*  And Kawee was in his prime back then look at look how short Kawee is, but he's just a tank [[03:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12802.3s)]
*  Look at the build on that dude, but look at his fucking defense. It was superb and he was a murderous puncher and [[03:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12807.58s)]
*  Just mauled people and kept pressure on them. It's just a masterful defensive fighter and he was all over a Vander [[03:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12814.98s)]
*  I mean they had a real war man. He tested a Vander but a Vander wanted a decision [[03:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12822.74s)]
*  Great fight though. You know what a Vander Holyfield could take an ass whooping. Oh fuck. Yeah, he could remember the Riddick bow fights [[03:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12828.58s)]
*  Yeah, really bow was huge [[03:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12835.54s)]
*  Riddick bow was huge and really fucking good and then that was the thing about I think that was was [[03:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12838.34s)]
*  frustrated so many people are fighting him is because [[03:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12843.94s)]
*  He would just take your best and just keep fucking Mike Tyson that fight. Yeah, dude [[03:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12846.140000000001s)]
*  I watched that fight with Kevin James. We couldn't believe our eyes [[03:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12852.26s)]
*  We were in I rented a house in Encino and we were watching it live on pay-per-view [[03:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12856.160000000002s)]
*  It was the craziest especially the second one [[03:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12861.740000000002s)]
*  Yeah, the second one was nuts cuz it could you like there's no way well [[03:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12864.7s)]
*  I guess it was only nuts because it ended the same way you bid him the second one. Yeah [[03:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12868.72s)]
*  Yeah [[03:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12873.5s)]
*  The first one he just beat him down a Vander beat him down the second one a Tyson bit him [[03:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12874.86s)]
*  Twice I think in my mind in my mind growing up Mike Tyson was the first person that I thought of is like [[03:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12880.78s)]
*  Truly invincible like I I truly believed when I was a kid that nobody could beat him [[03:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12887.98s)]
*  You know [[03:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12894.82s)]
*  Everybody did [[03:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12897.66s)]
*  Everybody did cuz for a while it was true, you know, you know what also blew my mind is I was the first time to [[03:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12899.22s)]
*  Cuz there were people that hated him [[03:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12905.54s)]
*  There were people that just just because he won so much there were people that were like fuck that guy, of course [[03:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12907.18s)]
*  Oh, yeah, they were like all like a lot of the old men in our neighborhood [[03:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12912.42s)]
*  They like I can't wait for somebody to teach these ass and lesson, you know [[03:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12915.5s)]
*  There was only 20 right but they just hated it was like cuz he represented [[03:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12919.3s)]
*  He represented the new guard. Yeah, it's like you know, like all the motherfuckers they rooted for but he just beat the shit out of [[03:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12925.14s)]
*  Larry Holmes. Yeah, you know, but there was always those guys like Joe Lewis. What a mop the floor with him, right? [[03:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12931.78s)]
*  Right, right. Let him run up it with Marciano and you know [[03:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12938.06s)]
*  Those guys were pulling out people from the pack. I think Mike Tyson beats them all [[03:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12942.34s)]
*  I think Mike Tyson is prime the Mike Tyson that beat Marvis Frazier the Mike Tyson that knocked out Michael Spinks [[03:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12945.98s)]
*  That Mike Tyson beats them all I mean he might not beat Ali. I think he beats everybody else though. I [[03:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12952.82s)]
*  Just think in his fucking prime man. He was a force of nature [[03:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12959.34s)]
*  He was it was it was knowledge, right? [[03:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12963.46s)]
*  You know, we're talking about like watching films his manager Jim Jacobs had an enormous library of old fights and [[03:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12966.7s)]
*  They were on like, you know one of those projector things and Mike Tyson would go down there and play old fights [[03:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12975.78s)]
*  So he would play like Jack Johnson fights and he would play like Mack Schmeling versus Joe Lewis [[03:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12982.62s)]
*  Jack Dempsey he was a big Jack Dempsey fan because Jim Jacobs had this extensive [[03:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12990.02s)]
*  Library of these great great old fighters Stanley Ketchel all these amazing guys and nobody ever heard Harry Greb [[03:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=12995.539999999999s)]
*  And he would watch all these Sugar Ray Robinson [[03:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13002.5s)]
*  Willie pep and he would watch all these and he would like absorb their style. Did Willie pep dine ring? [[03:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13006.34s)]
*  That name stood stands out to me for some reason I don't believe so [[03:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13013.58s)]
*  Okay, Benny Perret died in the ring Benny Perret was killed by a meal Griffith [[03:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13017.1s)]
*  Emil Griffith beat him to death in the ring after Benny Perret teased him for being gay. He kept talking shit about him being gay [[03:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13021.9s)]
*  He beat the shit out of he beat him. Oh, was he gay? I believe so I believe so I think that was the rumor [[03:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13030.78s)]
*  Wow, he beat him to death, but that wasn't illegal right? Nope. I mean he wasn't trying to he's trying to knock him out [[03:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13039.14s)]
*  But it's a I forget what they call that fight [[03:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13045.78s)]
*  See if you can fight that fight because that's a rough one to watch the end a meal Griffith [[03:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13048.66s)]
*  Changed boxing but they had to like crack down on my safety rules. No the one that did that was [[03:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13053.86s)]
*  Ray boom boom Mancini versus duck who Kim [[03:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13060.54s)]
*  that was the one where duck who Kim died and [[03:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13064.3s)]
*  I think that was when they started to go to 12 rounds [[03:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13068.380000000001s)]
*  I think they go went to 12 rounds slightly after that because they were doing 15 rounds before and I think [[03:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13072.5s)]
*  Duck who Kim died in the 13th or 14th round forget which round I think they had decided that 12 rounds would be the right one [[03:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13078.58s)]
*  so this is a meal Griffith versus [[03:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13084.98s)]
*  Benny Perret and this is the one where you know, he was taunting him and a meal Griffith just fucking [[03:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13088.5s)]
*  I'm guessing the guy on the right was the gay guy [[03:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13095.7s)]
*  The guy on the right is email Griffith. Yes, okay. That's the that's the gay guy with the I don't know if he's gay [[03:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13098.74s)]
*  But that's what he was being teased about. Yeah, and that was he was definitely being teased about that [[03:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13105.66s)]
*  But that was the rumor that he was but look dude. He just beats the fucking shit [[03:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13110.6s)]
*  He's stuck in the ropes and a meal Griffith just teeing off on him while he's out [[03:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13115.26s)]
*  So he's trapped in the ropes and he collapses and then he's dead. He's dead right now. Yeah, he's dead man Wow [[03:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13119.54s)]

*  The only thing keeping him up is the punches the punches are so hard [[03:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13142.74s)]
*  They're they're keeping his body upright as he's leaning up against the rope cuz he did right here bang [[03:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13146.300000000001s)]
*  Well, he's out right here right like right there you could have stopped it right there [[03:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13152.9s)]
*  I'm sure right here turning away and he's hitting it with bomb after bomb and he keeps going one two one two one two one two [[03:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13157.18s)]
*  I mean, he's just swinging at him afterwards in the ref just today like this. Yeah [[03:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13164.66s)]

*  Gerald McClellan maybe that's what I'm 100% are you talking about? Yeah, he was the guy that was a rival for Roy Jones, Jr [[03:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13190.96s)]
*  So as Roy Jones, Jr [[03:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13197.039999999999s)]
*  Was a champ and he was a champ and he fought Nigel Ben and he almost put Nigel Ben out in the first round [[03:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13198.72s)]
*  But they collided heads at one point in the fight and [[03:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13205.0s)]
*  Nigel Ben [[03:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13208.599999999999s)]
*  hit him with some real good punches and he went down and took a knee and then he went back to his corner and [[03:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13209.84s)]

*  Yeah, that's crazy the resilience crazy the endurance [[03:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13277.119999999999s)]
*  So Gerald McClellan emptied his gas tank and Nigel's catching him now [[03:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13280.539999999999s)]
*  He catches him with a big left hook and at one point in time they collided heads and it was a bad one [[03:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13284.0s)]
*  Bang [[03:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13290.38s)]
*  Think that's what did it? No, no, no, it was all these punches for sure [[03:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13292.38s)]
*  But it was like I think it was a collision of heads as well that someone had identified that was really bad [[03:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13295.619999999999s)]
*  But he hit him with some fucking bombs [[03:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13302.42s)]
*  Look, he dropped him again [[03:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13305.66s)]
*  so Gerald eventually comes back and drops Nigel again the eighth round and [[03:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13307.099999999999s)]
*  Nigel gets back up and he's like still not going anywhere. Boom hits him with the left hook [[03:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13311.9s)]
*  This is after getting dropped again [[03:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13316.44s)]
*  Imagine hitting the motherfucker with everything you got look at this combination boom Nigel over the top of that right hand [[03:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13318.44s)]
*  So what the point is this was a fucking war and there's another brilliant one. So we see like where he takes a knee [[03:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13323.84s)]
*  Boom look at that right hand. This is another right hand. So that's where it was. That's where he takes a knee [[03:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13331.52s)]
*  This is sad. So he decided to stay down [[03:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13336.960000000001s)]
*  So he gets hit he gets I guess he got up for the first one, right? Is that what they're saying? [[03:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13341.04s)]
*  Oh, so he goes down a second time [[03:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13347.44s)]
*  So this is a second time then look you see him like wincing in pain like holding his head and that's when he decided to [[03:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13350.04s)]
*  Stay down and so everybody's like I can't believe he you know, he quit on his knee like that [[03:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13355.32s)]
*  but then he went back into his corner and he slumped and [[03:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13361.08s)]
*  He really never recovered. He went to the hospital and he's alive still but he's like severely disabled and I believe he's blind [[03:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13364.76s)]
*  What did it cause like a brain bleed? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean that's the risk that these guys are taking man [[03:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13373.2s)]
*  I mean, that's a crazy sport [[03:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13379.28s)]
*  You're throwing haymakers at each other with like thick padding over the top of it and that's that's him today [[03:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13380.92s)]
*  and [[03:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13386.640000000001s)]
*  This like greatly affected Roy Jones jr [[03:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13387.84s)]
*  Too because you got to think that Roy and him almost fought [[03:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13390.640000000001s)]
*  Right, like they that was like a big super fight that people were setting up for the future [[03:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13394.0s)]
*  Roy and him down the line did wind up fighting that could have been Roy or that could have been Gerald like [[03:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13398.64s)]
*  Could have been either one of them. Yeah, like when when two guys are that good and they're swinging the way those guys were at each other [[03:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13404.04s)]
*  My money would have still been on Roy though [[03:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13410.52s)]
*  Roy and his prime was fucking stupid [[03:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13413.36s)]
*  In his prime no one can touch him he would win entire rounds without him being hit to me [[03:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13418.48s)]
*  You know what? I'll compare Roy to is Anderson Silva [[03:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13423.36s)]
*  Well, we're similar in that way like there was just so dominant for a while and he would win in such stylish fashion [[03:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13426.6s)]
*  You know where it was it wasn't just that he was winning, but he just made you look silly [[03:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13433.84s)]
*  You know, he was doing movie shit. He was doing movie shit [[03:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13438.560000000001s)]
*  Roy put his hand behind his back and then knocked out with one punch [[03:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13441.4s)]
*  Yeah, put his hand behind his back ducked and then popped him with the right hand and knocked him out [[03:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13444.880000000001s)]
*  but just like both is like eventually it catches up to you where it's like [[03:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13449.0s)]
*  You know, it's like you hit an age where like you don't realize but you just a millisecond slower [[03:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13451.68s)]
*  Yeah, there's that there's also this other speculation that speculation is that he went up to heavyweight to fight John Ruiz [[03:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13456.0s)]
*  And so he had a pack on weight and then he went back down to light heavyweight [[03:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13463.44s)]
*  and I think the losing the weight to get back down diminished him severely and then he fought Antonio Tarver and [[03:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13467.76s)]
*  Antonio Tarver was a murderous puncher and a motherfucker of a boxer [[03:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13476.36s)]
*  Antonio Tarver could box and he said in the ring to Roy because they had had one fight previously where it went to a decision and [[03:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13480.92s)]
*  You know and Roy had some excuses I guess and so he says in the ring for the second fight [[03:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13488.439999999999s)]
*  You got any excuses tonight Roy? [[03:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13493.779999999999s)]
*  The referee goes any questions any questions and he goes got any excuses tonight Roy and Roy didn't say anything and Tarver went up [[03:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13496.119999999999s)]
*  Knocking him out and then after that he just kept getting knocked out, right? He got knocked out bad after that [[03:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13502.96s)]
*  What do you think that is when after somebody gets knocked out? [[03:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13508.22s)]
*  It's almost like it's easier to knock him out after that. Well, he fought Glenn Johnson after that who was a very [[03:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13511.699999999999s)]
*  talented [[03:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13518.74s)]
*  Contender who people like I think Glenn Johnson was a little older at the time and maybe people overlooked him [[03:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13520.019999999999s)]
*  He like he really had great success like later in his career [[03:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13526.06s)]
*  But Glenn Johnson knocked out Roy in a scary knockout pull that one up Glenn Johnson Roy Jones, Jr [[03:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13529.939999999999s)]
*  That was a scary one because this was after the Tarver one, but the Tarver one he was kind of he was conscious [[03:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13536.54s)]
*  But he was fucked up. I mean Tarver cracked him and he went down, but he was out right [[03:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13543.5s)]
*  But he was moving around this one's even scarier because he bangs the back of his head when he goes down and [[03:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13548.740000000002s)]
*  This was the comeback fight, right? And so Glenn Johnson was like a suitable comeback opponent [[03:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13554.820000000002s)]
*  But nobody told Glenn Johnson that like Glenn Johnson came to that fight to win and Glenn Johnson has his high guard [[03:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13560.26s)]
*  He's like really difficult style to deal with and super super tough guy [[03:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13566.02s)]
*  Just very very skillful [[03:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13570.86s)]
*  And you know this was Roy coming off of getting KO'd and whenever a guy comes off of getting KO'd the odds of him getting [[03:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13572.42s)]
*  KO'd again go up [[03:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13578.619999999999s)]
*  I don't know it depends on the person some of them it doesn't go up at all [[03:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13580.699999999999s)]
*  Some of them it only goes up slightly but some of them it goes up a lot for whatever reason it might be the damage [[03:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13584.619999999999s)]
*  They took from the first knockout. It could be a lot of factors. Look at this [[03:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13590.3s)]
*  Boom, he hits him with that right hand. Look how he goes out [[03:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13594.26s)]
*  He goes out stiff [[03:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13597.66s)]
*  He banged his head off the ground like watch that again because it is a fucking brutal series of punches. He hits him with [[03:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13599.58s)]
*  That here goes so he gets him up against the ropes sets him up for the right hand and boom [[03:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13606.5s)]
*  He's out one hard right hand to the side of the head and Roy's out [[03:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13610.7s)]
*  That was a rough one. That's nothing like Ray Mercer versus Tommy Lawrence. I think it's like your brain going [[03:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13615.86s)]
*  We're not taking any chances probably probably some something to that get Ray Mercer versus Tommy Morrison [[03:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13620.62s)]
*  This one was one of the worst and this one was one after the movie [[03:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13626.78s)]
*  So Ray Mercer people thought about him as like this like gold medalist in the Olympics [[03:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13631.02s)]
*  Murderous puncher like he was a guy who was on the up like he was coming up and somehow or another they set him up with [[03:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13636.94s)]
*  Tommy Morrison who was a very good boxer and had beaten some good guys, but he was just coming off of this movie [[03:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13644.140000000001s)]
*  So he was the fucking the in the Rocky movies and he's fighting a guy that's just been doing nothing but boxing now [[03:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13650.3s)]
*  Tommy Morrison's a movie star now and he's a young guy. He's got to be [[03:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13657.14s)]
*  Distracted. I mean, he's got to be not focused [[03:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13661.46s)]
*  Right and he's fighting a guy that he probably would have lost to anyway because Ray Mercer was a motherfucker [[03:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13664.099999999999s)]
*  And so Tommy is doing well in the fight for a while [[03:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13669.66s)]
*  But then Mercer eventually catches him because Tommy starts getting tired and this one of the things about Tommy Morrison [[03:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13672.66s)]
*  If you look at Tommy Morrison in the early stages of his fights, he was always better. He would fade and [[03:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13678.6s)]
*  Eventually Ray Mercer catches him and he hits him with that right hand and watch this boom. Hmm. He's in trouble here, right? [[03:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13685.32s)]
*  Boom, boom, boom boom. Now. This is why it's the worst one ever. Oh [[03:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13691.16s)]
*  Bro, he's tangled up in the ropes and the referee is too small to pull Mercer off of them [[03:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13696.24s)]
*  So he hits him with multiple punches why he's out cold. Look at this over now referee doesn't get in there [[03:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13701.34s)]
*  Look look how he gets in there. The referee's just like hey you stop. Hey you he's scared cuz he's a little old guy [[03:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13707.4s)]
*  He shouldn't be referee in this fight. These are two elite heavyweights [[03:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13713.6s)]
*  These are enormous men and this poor referee is old got a little pot belly [[03:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13717.6s)]
*  He doesn't want to dive in there and get fucking murked. Yeah [[03:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13722.2s)]
*  Yeah, and so because of that Tommy Morrison takes haymaker [[03:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13725.72s)]
*  He's out cold and Ray Mercer's just full blast teeing off and another left hook after that while the referee was holding [[03:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13730.32s)]
*  onto his arms [[03:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13738.0s)]
*  bro [[03:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13739.56s)]
*  That might be the worst he survived he lived but he was never the same boxer yet [[03:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13741.56s)]
*  No, no way. He beat some good guys after that. He actually beat George Foreman after that [[03:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13746.56s)]
*  Yeah, old George old George Foreman. He won a decision off of old George Foreman [[03:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13751.64s)]
*  Look at that left hook boom boom boom right hand. I mean, this is horrendous, dude [[03:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13756.66s)]
*  This is we're looking at it from a different angle now. Look at this [[03:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13761.46s)]
*  I mean come on man boom and then still [[03:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13764.42s)]
*  He's fully out cold that he got hit four or five times clean [[03:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13767.619999999999s)]
*  This is like Benny Perrette like all over again. This easily could have been the end of his life [[03:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13771.82s)]
*  Yeah, easily could have been and probably changed his brain cuz right here like yeah, I mean, what is this ref? [[03:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13777.1s)]
*  I mean, but seriously do like this probably probably changed his brain forever [[03:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13783.46s)]
*  What is it this reference waiting to see I don't know man [[03:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13791.939999999999s)]
*  That is a crazy beating cuz when you say a motherfucker getting hit in the face and they're not trying to stop it [[03:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13794.72s)]
*  I think the fights over you need a big referee with big men [[03:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13799.34s)]
*  You just you need someone who could separate those you need Herb Dean [[03:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13802.74s)]
*  I'm gonna be diving in like he'd dive over first base Mark Goddard [[03:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13806.46s)]
*  Big guy, you know jump big John McCarthy was always great at it. He's a big guy [[03:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13811.08s)]
*  You want a big guy for big guys? [[03:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13816.0s)]
*  I don't want no little motherfucking like that because that's not protect that guy did [[03:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13818.0s)]
*  He didn't want to just dive in there and separate who's pulling in gone who off you? Oh my god [[03:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13823.44s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? You need somebody that could at least move that motherfucker. Yeah. Yeah, you know Christ winning [[03:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13829.6s)]
*  Ungunu when he knocked out Alistair over him and then fucking hammer fisted him when he was unconscious [[03:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13835.36s)]
*  And he got I mean that was just in the nick of time just in the nick [[03:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13842.08s)]
*  But can you imagine a referee being late on that? Oh my god [[03:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13845.5s)]
*  Like letting him hit him two or three more times my god while he's out cold and he's not gonna stop [[03:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13848.44s)]
*  He's not gonna stop till the referee pulls him off. That's his job [[03:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13854.68s)]
*  His job is not to stop when the guys unconscious his job is to stop and the referee says stop [[03:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13857.68s)]
*  Yeah, yes the people have stopped when they thought a guy was out and then the guy was okay and winds up winning a fight [[03:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13862.48s)]
*  Which is the craziest thing to say but it's in life seen on like these local circuits [[03:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13868.44s)]
*  It does happen guys walk away and the guy gets up and winds up winning the fight somehow [[03:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13872.880000000001s)]
*  But I'm pretty sure I've seen that I might be talking shit when the guys concussed though. They don't get up, right? [[03:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13877.92s)]
*  No, no, no, those guys don't generally get I [[03:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13883.84s)]
*  Mean different people it's like different kinds of concussions are different [[03:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13887.56s)]
*  But I've never had kinds of knockouts are different [[03:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13892.48s)]
*  So people get knocked out and they come back and like what happened off fuck man, and then they seem fine [[03:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13894.519999999999s)]
*  Well, I used to be all judgmental. I'll be like, yeah, you have to hit him again, but it's like that [[03:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13900.279999999999s)]
*  Oh, I'm not a fighter. I don't fucking know do they don't have to and people do applaud people that don't hit someone while they're out [[03:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13904.22s)]
*  Like they show that he showed really good judgment there. That's great [[03:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13911.519999999999s)]
*  Like Mark Hunt was the king of the walkway chaos Mark Hunt would uppercut you and just walk away [[03:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13914.44s)]
*  He knew he'd watch you crumble and like you're not getting up. Yeah [[03:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13918.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but then there's opposite like a like the black beast [[03:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13923.12s)]
*  You know Derek Lewis Derek Lewis he liked to see people get hurt he hits you when you're out. Yeah [[03:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13928.720000000001s)]
*  Well, that's his job and one for good measure [[03:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13935.2s)]
*  Yeah [[03:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13937.320000000002s)]
*  Job is the referee has to pull him off the referee has to stay stop stop the referee has to get him to stop [[03:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13938.52s)]
*  He's like a gang is con type of my father's bad [[03:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13944.52s)]
*  Very bad man. Yeah, the hardest puncher like probably ever [[03:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13947.44s)]
*  He hits guys so he had Curtis blade so hard. It was just a short uppercut boom and Curtis just went flat out [[03:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13951.44s)]
*  Yeah, he was he's one of those people that's truly [[03:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13958.52s)]
*  Never out of a fight never when he hurt his back [[03:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13962.0s)]
*  Yeah, and when he came back he wasn't the same [[03:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13965.36s)]
*  Well, it sometimes locks up on him still yeah, but he's still oh he's always so dangerous man still when he thought Alexander Volkov [[03:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13969.68s)]
*  He was losing that fight. Didn't he knock out in Ghana? [[03:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13976.68s)]
*  No, he beat in Ghana by a very boring decision. Okay, it was one of the most boring fights of all time [[03:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13979.119999999999s)]
*  They'd neither guy engaged and there's like Derek apparently had a fucked up back and Francis was like dealing with just losing this DPA [[03:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13984.16s)]
*  And so he didn't engage much. He's like [[03:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13990.96s)]
*  Uncharacteristically like apprehensive but that fight problem. I think that fight turned Francis into a fucking mom [[03:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13994.0s)]
*  Well, he came back from that like a beast and he knocked out Curtis blades in one of his fights [[03:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=13999.960000000001s)]
*  He knocked out Junior dos Santos and the knockout of steep. It was just horrific like that that knockout was wild [[03:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14004.400000000001s)]
*  Like that knockout was just you know, it just showed [[03:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14011.160000000002s)]
*  First of all showed how good he had gotten because it wasn't just that he knocked him out [[03:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14014.92s)]
*  He did it patiently and with technique he took him down a couple times, right? [[03:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14019.0s)]
*  No, he didn't go to the ground with Steve. No, I don't believe so in the second [[03:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14022.68s)]
*  What fight am I remembering the first fight? I'm pretty sure the second fight was only taken only took place on the feet [[03:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14026.16s)]
*  I'm pretty sure no cuz that cuz the first fight steep a took him down a bunch of no, I'm talking about Ghana [[03:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14033.960000000001s)]
*  I remember down steep. I remember in Ghana taking a fight to the ground. Oh, no. No, that was zero gone [[03:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14039.08s)]
*  Okay, right. I miss information [[03:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14045.0s)]
*  To I'm to my memories all fucked up right now [[03:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14048.24s)]
*  It's the serial gone. Yeah, that was because and Ghana went into that fight with a torn ACL [[03:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14052.68s)]
*  Yeah, so his leg was fucked up. He tore his ACL and his MCL [[03:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14058.6s)]
*  So he had two fucked up ligaments in my fight [[03:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14062.24s)]
*  He had it cuz he wanted to win and he wanted that money and he thought he could beat him even with a fucked up [[03:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14065.2s)]
*  Knee and he was right [[03:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14070.2s)]
*  so then after the fight and when got surgery so he hasn't been back since and what they're trying to set up is [[03:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14071.36s)]
*  Francis and Ghana versus John Jones [[03:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14078.44s)]
*  Man [[03:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14081.56s)]
*  Here's my thing a Francis I'm a huge fan bro, but please don't fight John Jones with nothing broken, you know I'm saying [[03:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14084.759999999998s)]
*  Well, they fixed his knee. Oh, okay. Yeah, he's got he's got knee surgery. He's rehabilitated it [[03:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14091.72s)]
*  He's back, you know, I don't know what level of rehabilitation has been completed, but he's on track [[03:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14096.56s)]
*  He's been surgically repaired bro. I'm seeing that fight. Yeah, he's also using the UFC PI [[03:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14102.96s)]
*  I think he was using them a while [[03:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14109.160000000002s)]
*  Uses them for some things the PI the Performance Institute [[03:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14111.84s)]
*  Okay, there's a bunch of experts there [[03:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14115.160000000002s)]
*  they could give you good methods of like healing injuries and they they're up on the latest science and [[03:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14116.92s)]
*  You know latest studies about they have a great facility to the facility is fantastic, man [[03:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14122.44s)]
*  It's just filled with heavy bags and in the cage we could film all your sparring sessions the hype for that fight [[03:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14127.320000000002s)]
*  Oh my god [[03:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14134.240000000002s)]
*  But wait a minute it's gonna be the the biggest fight of all time you think John you think John is going to [[03:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14136.56s)]
*  Like you think that's gonna be his first fight back. Yeah, I do. Yeah, I think that's exactly what John wants to do [[03:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14143.72s)]
*  I think it's a bad idea. But also I think he has his ego the way his ego set up [[03:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14149.94s)]
*  he wants he likes the idea of of [[03:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14155.32s)]
*  Doing something that people think is crazy that can't be done. I don't think it's a bad idea. No, no [[03:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14159.16s)]
*  I don't think it's a bad idea at all. Well, I think first of all both guys are gonna be out of condition for a while or out of [[03:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14164.36s)]
*  competition rather for a while [[03:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14171.6s)]
*  John's been out for a couple years now and Francis will be out for a year because of his surgery true [[03:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14173.84s)]
*  So whenever it does take place, let's let's say they try to make it take place in the spring [[03:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14179.900000000001s)]
*  So if they do make it take place in the spring [[03:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14184.560000000001s)]
*  That is a long time off for both guys. It's longer for Francis for sure [[03:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14187.28s)]
*  But it's still they both have like a little bit of a layoff no, it's longer for John [[03:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14192.08s)]
*  Oh, I'm sorry longer for John. Yeah, that's what I meant. I meant to say the other way [[03:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14197.08s)]
*  It's uh, it favors Francis for sure because Francis is only like a year whereas John is a couple years [[03:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14201.12s)]
*  But a year's a long time to not fight. I mean, I don't know if it's any better [[03:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14206.32s)]
*  Or worse to do it once a year versus twice in or once every two years [[03:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14211.04s)]
*  So I don't know both of them will give you a certain amount of ring rust [[03:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14215.92s)]
*  Also John's not only been out for two years, but now he's moving up a weight class [[03:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14218.480000000001s)]
*  He's never fought a heavyweight, but he's trained with a lot of heavyweights and the results were very favorable [[03:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14222.04s)]
*  Stories that I had heard from Jackson Wink about John Jones and heavyweights [[03:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14228.16s)]
*  May made me think like why doesn't he just fight heavyweight because like at a certain point in time when he was dominating the light [[03:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14232.16s)]
*  Heavyweight division there was some discussion about that, you know when he like after he knocked out Daniel Cormier [[03:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14237.6s)]
*  You know, like there was a lot of discussion about him. Like would he ever move up? [[03:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14243.7s)]
*  Here's this UFC 285 odds. Whoa, John Jones is betting underdog against Francis and Gano [[03:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14247.599999999999s)]
*  But healthy favorite to wallop Curtis blades. Oh, so this is the this is the story behind that [[03:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14253.119999999999s)]
*  So if Francis is not ready in time if he's injured still because you know knee [[03:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14258.24s)]
*  Rehabilitation it's a tricky thing and you know, you're not getting like up-to-date [[03:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14264.039999999999s)]
*  Like updates of how he's doing every day. So he might be training and might tweak it [[03:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14268.72s)]
*  Guys do that all the time. Yeah, and then it then it's another three months another four months [[03:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14274.880000000001s)]
*  You definitely can't you can't fight that man. You can't find a torn up [[03:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14279.28s)]
*  Especially not John when it comes to wrestling, right? [[03:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14284.560000000001s)]
*  Because he's going to utilize that that advantage that he has John Jones has John Jones took down Daniel Cormier [[03:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14287.04s)]
*  You got to always remember that. Oh, yeah, I remember [[03:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14292.640000000001s)]
*  But everybody's got to remember that because you think about like he was a junior college level champion, you know [[03:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14295.28s)]
*  He's a elite wrestler, but that's just cuz he went to junior college [[03:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14300.720000000001s)]
*  Like if John Jones was in another school like a division one school [[03:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14304.2s)]
*  He would have been a champion there too [[03:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14307.880000000001s)]
*  John Jones was a motherfucker of a wrestler and the way he takes guys down the UFC and the way he would like manhandle [[03:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14308.92s)]
*  Guys, he's got immense physical strength, but it's it's fucking immense and he knows how to fight man [[03:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14315.28s)]
*  He knows how to win fights. He knows how to do the right thing at the right time. He figured he's just he's got a like an octagon [[03:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14321.36s)]
*  IQ that's as high as anybody ever [[03:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14328.36s)]
*  He just know any he's also long as shit so he knows how to use that length and I think he he also has that [[03:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14331.16s)]
*  Little extra something. Yeah, he's crazy where he he don't he doesn't care if you die [[03:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14337.6s)]
*  Like the way he the way he throws some of them elbows is almost like he doesn't care if that elbow crushes your fucking skull [[03:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14343.16s)]
*  You know, there's a little more intent with him when you see him hit people. He's a bad man [[03:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14349.32s)]
*  There's no time about bad man [[03:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14354.76s)]
*  One of the scariest John Jones finishes was when he choked unconscious Leo to machete and just dropped him [[03:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14356.04s)]
*  Yeah standing up. Yeah, he had him in a standing guillotine put him to sleep and just dropped him like a sack of potatoes [[03:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14361.12s)]
*  Yeah, that was dark. Yeah [[03:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14368.0s)]

*  And it's just been a disappointment. You know, I mean, yeah that does happen [[04:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14425.04s)]
*  It also doesn't happen like I met Jared Leto and he's really cool [[04:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14428.52s)]
*  Oh, really nice guy really fun. He was friends with Theo, but you're definitely rolling the dice [[04:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14432.78s)]
*  You're rolling the dice but every now and then I don't even know man [[04:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14437.58s)]
*  It's like I've met enough of them that I'm thinking maybe I'm prejudiced [[04:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14441.06s)]
*  Like maybe I was just you know [[04:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14444.7s)]
*  You look at like famous people in particular actors and you just almost want them to be douchebags [[04:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14446.42s)]
*  So like you look at it in a biased sense like Chris Pratt is one of the nicest people I've ever met in my life [[04:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14451.300000000001s)]

*  He's like a legitimate Christian and like a really kind friendly person. Yeah, I went elk hunting with him [[04:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14466.300000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you know what? He's nice to everybody man. It's not fake. What I like a really really good guy [[04:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14473.82s)]
*  what I've noticed is that the people that are [[04:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14478.42s)]
*  the people that are secure in [[04:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14481.5s)]
*  in their [[04:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14484.06s)]
*  Careers are usually cool people. Yeah, but it's like how do you how are you secure in that business? That's like [[04:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14485.86s)]
*  It's always in flux you're always coming and going he's at peace with that he's at peace with that [[04:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14493.14s)]
*  It's like it's just like when you hear when you meet like a you know, Jim Carrey or fucking [[04:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14498.3s)]
*  You know somebody like that in there and you hear or Keanu Reeves and you hear about how nice and sweet they are [[04:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14503.06s)]
*  It's like I think they've just come to peace with as much as that business can fuck you up. Right they've [[04:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14507.76s)]
*  the stuff that because the reason the reason Hollywood fucks you up is because they start making you care about things that [[04:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14514.02s)]
*  Aren't real or don't really matter and you lose sight of what really matters [[04:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14521.14s)]
*  But but the people that hold on to what matters like like it's like it's oxygen [[04:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14524.82s)]
*  They they're the ones that come out the other side like pretty okay. Yeah, you can you can do it [[04:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14529.26s)]
*  You know, it's like you can win the Tour de France people have won it. Yeah [[04:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14534.38s)]
*  Because for most people it's just a pressure cooker that fucks with your head to a point where it's really hard to maintain [[04:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14538.42s)]
*  Especially when you're a star right and no when you will Smith and nobody checks you nobody ever goes [[04:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14545.22s)]
*  Hey bitch, be quiet. Well, you know, right, right [[04:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14549.72s)]
*  Like how long has it been since somebody's been like shut your stupid ass up that guy that moment was the first moment like that [[04:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14552.42s)]
*  probably ever for him [[04:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14558.48s)]
*  Where he lost control? Well, not just that he lost control. He did it publicly [[04:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14560.199999999999s)]
*  He showed his ass in front of the whole world and he was humiliated by it [[04:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14563.8s)]
*  Everybody was mad at him. Yeah, there's a few people that supported him initially [[04:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14569.119999999999s)]
*  Like you don't talk shit about girls girl, you know man's girlfriend, but they he didn't even talk shit [[04:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14573.08s)]
*  It was a mild joke. It was like a dad [[04:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14577.24s)]
*  Now he's trying to cut he make he's trying to make the comeback with the slave movie [[04:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14580.28s)]
*  Well, I don't think I think they were already filming that I think it's already out. Yeah, but I think they were already working on that [[04:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14583.16s)]
*  Oh, yeah, but I think he's just hoping that people forget I might be wrong about that [[04:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14589.84s)]
*  But I was under the impression they were was that true Jimmy [[04:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14593.68s)]
*  They made it in the last five months, which seems a little no no. No. Yeah, it's [[04:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14598.16s)]
*  Is it out on Apple TV already? Yeah, but I you know what though [[04:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14602.64s)]
*  I I don't know cuz I'm cuz I'm so much like pretty much everyone in my life is a comedian [[04:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14606.24s)]
*  so it's hard for me to know if [[04:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14612.48s)]
*  The average person feels the way I feel cuz it's hard for me to overlook it. Yeah, you don't have to overlook it [[04:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14615.36s)]
*  You know why just forgive them? [[04:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14621.8s)]
*  People do stupid shit and they lose their fucking head and they do things in a way that they think is justified whether it's because they're famous [[04:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14624.08s)]
*  Or because it's deserved or the relationship they have with their significant other that leads them to believe that they have to defend [[04:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14632.0s)]
*  That woman or she's going to be upset at them later [[04:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14639.4s)]
*  And they would rather just go on stage and smack Chris Rock in front of everybody [[04:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14642.08s)]
*  But you can tell that he had lost his mind because he was saying keep my wife's name [[04:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14645.199999999999s)]
*  I don't show fucking mouth and he was saying it and the whole place was silent and he had to realize that the whole place [[04:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14650.84s)]
*  Was silent and he had to realize why those words were coming out of his mouth that this was on television and the Academy Awards and [[04:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14657.12s)]
*  He was scheduled to win an Oscar and he's like am I still winning this fucking Oscar like what is gonna happen now? [[04:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14664.52s)]
*  What did I what the fuck did I do and then to have it go from that to not knowing how the world's perceiving it? [[04:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14672.400000000001s)]
*  Then you go on stage and you cry and you apologize and they give you an Oscar and everyone gives you a standing ovation [[04:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14678.76s)]
*  So you think it's over [[04:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14685.16s)]
*  Yeah until you so maybe there's no Wi-Fi at the Oscars [[04:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14688.2s)]
*  What's that what's going on there's people talking to them like in the commercial breaks, right? [[04:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14696.12s)]
*  But I don't think they I don't think he probably fully grasped after everyone gave him a standing ovation. I bet he still thought he was okay [[04:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14699.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah, man, because you gotta understand the world they live a lot [[04:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14708.92s)]
*  I think a lot of me he was dancing at the fucking party the after party [[04:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14712.08s)]
*  Yeah puffed out he came up on the stage. I want to have to talk about this later [[04:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14716.039999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean he shouldn't have done it and they you know, like it's a fucking tremendous mistake [[04:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14719.48s)]
*  But the miscalculation is that you don't control Twitter man. What's also? [[04:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14725.24s)]
*  you're gonna like [[04:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14731.0s)]
*  You're gonna like dismiss all the great movies that guys made I am legend [[04:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14733.32s)]
*  I robot all these I mean he made some killer fucking move. Is he like useless now? No, no, like let the guy [[04:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14738.800000000001s)]
*  Realize he fucked up [[04:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14747.24s)]
*  Yes, Chris Rock is the one who really has to forgive him if he forgives him. He forgives him. It's basically over [[04:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14749.52s)]
*  I think and I think he will eventually [[04:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14754.800000000001s)]
*  Maybe maybe Chris is like that was like his sign that you know [[04:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14757.800000000001s)]
*  All that to be smacked in the face and then they give that same guy a standing ovation like these are these the people [[04:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14763.48s)]
*  I'm working with these people. I think that shit unlocks some shit in [[04:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14770.2s)]
*  Old-school bring the pain Chris Rock and yeah, I think I think he got freed because like I said it's like, you know [[04:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14778.92s)]
*  Cuz Patrice called it the golden handcuffs [[04:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14784.02s)]
*  It's like the deeper you get in Hollywood is like the more they give you the more they give you the more they give you [[04:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14786.0s)]
*  But they all that shit come with at any time we can yank it away [[04:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=14790.44s)]

*  you've got to be healthy to do this to actually be on the road every weekend and [[04:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15003.0s)]
*  Constantly writing and constantly auditioning it beats you up if you're not yeah [[04:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15009.039999999999s)]
*  And and I let all of that go and it's like now I got to focus on that [[04:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15012.58s)]
*  But the most important thing is you've you've done it before so you can get in shape again [[04:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15017.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I could never give it all you have to do is make a number and do that number every day [[04:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15021.359999999999s)]
*  So we'll get you a polar chest strap. That's what I use you can use any one you want [[04:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15026.16s)]
*  But the chest trap seems to be the one it's a heart monitor. So it works with an application [[04:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15030.699999999999s)]
*  So you put it on it's a strap you wrap it around [[04:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15035.44s)]
*  it's a little sensor sits right here and you have an app on your phone and you start your workout and it'll tell you when [[04:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15038.76s)]

*  Whatever your calorie goal is so you just decide on [[04:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15049.68s)]
*  You know whatever the number is whether you want [[04:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15055.32s)]
*  I think 150 is a good number to start with and you just do it every fucking day every single day [[04:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15057.359999999999s)]
*  Don't ever take a day off [[04:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15062.359999999999s)]
*  Take unless you're sick if you're sick don't work out, but if you're not sick, don't take the day off [[04:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15064.08s)]

*  Yeah, and both of them could have fought both of them could have fought and his brother I think is I think Arthur [[04:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15175.54s)]
*  I've done a lot of em. I think it's his brother Arthur. Is that the bigger one? [[04:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15180.98s)]
*  It's done a bunch and there's bigger Chandler's younger Arthur's order though. I think it's the older brother [[04:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15185.02s)]
*  I think it's Arthur Arthur's done a bunch of MMA training. There's like videos of him training and people were speculating that he was gonna [[04:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15190.58s)]
*  Have a fight [[04:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15196.58s)]
*  mmm [[04:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15197.78s)]
*  Do you do that's a family? Do you think yeah? [[04:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15199.54s)]
*  But out of all of them, I mean look what John Jones is done man for fighting man [[04:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15203.92s)]
*  Yeah, it's incredible. Yeah, cuz cuz because the thing is as athletic grandma. Look at her [[04:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15210.64s)]
*  Wow, she's so strong man, but as athletic as the whole family is like none of them are the greatest at what they're doing [[04:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15217.32s)]
*  Like he's the he's he's the greatest. Yeah, well, it's a hard. I think GSP is the [[04:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15223.64s)]
*  again, this is me being a [[04:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15230.12s)]
*  slightly above filthy casual [[04:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15232.44s)]
*  But GSP is the only person where you could really make an argument [[04:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15235.44s)]
*  For all-time great. Yeah, you can make an argument for Khabib to [[04:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15240.0s)]
*  Khabib he retired undefeated John Jones is also undefeated. I should say yeah, John Jones has one loss on this [[04:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15244.18s)]
*  It's a bullshit loss. Yeah where he was destroyed he destroyed the dude [[04:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15251.0s)]
*  But he was hitting him with downward elbows, which is a the dumbest fucking rule in the game [[04:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15254.6s)]
*  The absolute dumbest rule in the game you can hit a guy with any kind of elbow except for a downward elbow that makes zero [[04:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15258.1s)]
*  Sense you could block that the same way you block any other kind of elbow side elbows downward elbow [[04:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15263.8s)]
*  You can figure out a way to block it. You just gotta it has to be a weapon [[04:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15270.66s)]
*  It's it's the reason why it was made illegal is so stupid. It's it has to do with people being ignorant [[04:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15274.14s)]
*  We're back in the early days of MMA. Okay. Yeah, you break bricks with it on TV [[04:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15279.8s)]
*  So you can't have that knock the odds too dangerous really that's that's how big John McCarthy talks about it [[04:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15284.1s)]
*  Okay, it was his experience with these people trying to like bro. These are athletic commissions. They are so slow to change [[04:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15289.98s)]
*  Some of them are some of them are really good. California's really good. Yeah, but they've never Vegas is really good [[04:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15295.78s)]
*  They're because I remember seeing something recently about like the biggest like bullshit decisions and how like I don't think they've ever overturned [[04:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15300.82s)]
*  An MMA decision the Nevada people I don't think they've ever overturned even the most egregious [[04:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15309.779999999999s)]
*  Unfair bullshit. They've never overturned. Yeah, I don't think they have either [[04:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15316.82s)]
*  I don't know if that's a fact [[04:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15321.14s)]
*  But I don't know with any offhand that I could just pull I could pull a lot of shit out of the top of my head [[04:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15322.619999999999s)]
*  What's the most it's like you got John Jones you got Khabib you got GSP? [[04:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15327.38s)]
*  I still say BJ Penn in his prime at lightweight was [[04:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15331.44s)]
*  Motherfucker you for sure have Khabib, you know, there's some there's some [[04:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15335.699999999999s)]
*  Kamaru could have been right there [[04:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15340.26s)]
*  Yeah [[04:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15341.98s)]
*  Kamaru didn't lose to Leon if Kamaru just moved away for that last minute of that last round and didn't get head kicked [[04:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15342.58s)]
*  People would be talking about Kamaru in that same category [[04:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15349.26s)]
*  They already were dominated everybody man, and he might still come back and he might still come back [[04:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15353.3s)]
*  Yeah, but he's had some real problems with his [[04:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15358.539999999999s)]
*  With his injuries knee injuries that are real bad hand injury that he had to get surgery on [[04:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15362.119999999999s)]
*  He's had some real problems always like a room when he I think when he won the title [[04:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15368.279999999999s)]
*  His something wrong with his foot. Well, he I think so [[04:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15372.84s)]
*  Well, he also had bad knees forever like real bad like since college. It's like rest. Yeah [[04:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15376.44s)]
*  Yeah, real bad like fucked up cartilage like constant pain. We're like he had to go downstairs backwards [[04:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15381.96s)]
*  While he was training for a fight [[04:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15388.68s)]
*  His knees were in so much pain that he'd go downstairs backwards [[04:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15391.32s)]
*  And then when he would walk on like sidewalks and was grass next to it [[04:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15393.84s)]
*  He'd walk on the grass cuz didn't hurt his knees [[04:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15397.68s)]
*  That's the kind of pain. That's the kind of mental strength. He has to be able to fight [[04:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15400.279999999999s)]
*  He's just willfully destroying his knees and if you look at his body [[04:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15403.72s)]
*  His legs like the strength the size and the musculature of his legs is not [[04:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15408.36s)]
*  Comparable to the musculature of his upper body and I've always wondered if that's related because if you look at his upper body [[04:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15414.44s)]
*  He's fucking shredded and jacked but he has fairly small legs for a guy that big but like severe knee problems [[04:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15420.16s)]
*  You know, it makes I think about it all the time. But man fighters are the most [[04:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15427.24s)]
*  Used up and thrown away people for what they give up for the chance to be great [[04:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15432.84s)]
*  You know, but if you can do it the glory for many of them [[04:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15441.72s)]
*  Yeah, but even after the glory we throw them away [[04:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15445.72s)]
*  Well the moment they start getting knocked out people start their time is done, you know [[04:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15447.92s)]
*  The thing is like do do they deserve more? What do they deserve? [[04:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15453.56s)]
*  They deserve well some of them get to do commentary, which is great. Like DC has transitioned into commentary, which is brilliant [[04:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15457.4s)]
*  Yeah, it's perfect. The perfect amount of losses the perfect time in his life. He steps out. That's a wrap and he's good at it [[04:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15463.76s)]
*  He's very good at it [[04:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15469.72s)]
*  And he has a unique skill set in wrestling [[04:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15470.92s)]
*  He can describe wrestling better than anybody but a lot of fighters though, you know when they in their career they out here sounding like [[04:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15474.08s)]
*  Hershel Walker. Yeah, Dominic Cruz is really good at it too. So is Michael Bissping. So Paul Felder [[04:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15479.44s)]
*  Well, there's a lot of guys that wind up doing other stuff and they become successful at it. It's totally possible [[04:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15484.2s)]
*  It's just real hard. It's a real hard transition because there's more people that's like [[04:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFarwiXKSng&t=15489.88s)]
