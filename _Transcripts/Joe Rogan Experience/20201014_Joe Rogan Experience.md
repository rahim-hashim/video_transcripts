# Joe Rogan Experience #1549 - Tom Papa
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [October 14, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D2bNqpLbtE)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Train by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day.
*  Tom Papa, welcome to real America.
*  I'm glad you've gotten out of your liberal hidey hole.
*  You come here where you can eat at a real restaurant.
*  It feels the same.
*  Does it?
*  Yeah.
*  What do you mean it feels the same?
*  It feels the same.
*  I went to a restaurant and, you know, is that what real life is now?
*  A restaurant or not a restaurant?
*  It feels the same where?
*  As it does in LA?
*  Just walking around.
*  LA feels the same as this place?
*  Kind of.
*  That's not what you were just saying before we got in here.
*  What are you, a fucking propagandist?
*  The guy comes here.
*  No, I'll tell you what the difference is.
*  He's so different off air.
*  I'll tell you what the difference is.
*  He was saying y'all and all kinds of shit.
*  Two hundred guns.
*  No, you know what I found?
*  I'm here with you by way of Denver and then to here.
*  And they're all doing the same things pretty much.
*  You have a little more indoor, but everyone's masked up, everyone's doing things, but there's
*  less anxiety in these places.
*  In LA, they keep the pressure turned up to scare you, to get you to behave.
*  So you do walk around feeling more trapped and more nervous.
*  Yeah, but it's not based on reality.
*  It's not wise, it's not healthy.
*  Trump's 74 and he's fat and he kicked it in four days.
*  I don't give a fuck what anybody says.
*  What did they give that guy?
*  They gave him everything.
*  He's the president of the United States.
*  But it works.
*  They have a thing.
*  If you give him everything, it works.
*  It works for fat old guys.
*  Yeah, but he's getting stuff that's very different from what you would get just walking
*  into urgent care in Encino.
*  Don't go to urgent care in Encino.
*  Go to Cedars-Sinai.
*  They'll hook you up with whatever he's got.
*  Is he getting things that you can't get?
*  Yes.
*  In all seriousness?
*  Yeah.
*  Are you sure?
*  How do you know that?
*  100% because the first thing is a trial drug that hasn't been approved yet.
*  They're not just handing that out at Cedars.
*  Is that the?
*  The first thing.
*  That's Remdesivir?
*  No, everyone can get that.
*  Remdesivir?
*  Remdesivir.
*  Anyone can get that.
*  Anyone can get Remdesivir.
*  What is the other stuff they gave him?
*  The other thing he got was the plasma-related therapy.
*  You can't get that everywhere?
*  No.
*  Why can't you?
*  Because you're not the president of the United States.
*  Or maybe the liberal media is trying to keep that from you so that you stay sick so that
*  they can get Biden into the White House.
*  Ever think about that?
*  All right.
*  Now wait a second.
*  I literally last night because I literally was ... There is definitely so much confusion
*  because that side is ramping up the fear 100% making it scarier than it is so they can get
*  him to be president.
*  The other side is definitely saying from Trump on down, don't worry about this thing.
*  It makes it looks like we did a good job and the economy comes back and all that stuff.
*  I'm like this cognitive dissonance.
*  What is real?
*  I watched Tucker Carlson.
*  He made sense for a minute.
*  Then I watched Anderson.
*  He made sense for a minute.
*  I was like, let me lift off into the satellite and let me just look at the world.
*  Let me see what's happening in the world that's not involved in this election.
*  Spain, France, Moscow, the Netherlands all opened up a little too much and now are all
*  putting restrictions back.
*  Everything spiked.
*  Yeah, but if you want to look at other countries, look at Sweden because they opened up completely
*  and they have less cases and now they're back to normal.
*  They have no masks.
*  You go to a bar.
*  Obviously, it's a smaller country.
*  Smaller country.
*  I mean, look.
*  Less people.
*  They live in different sort of circumstances.
*  They have mostly smaller villages other than Stockholm, but they're fine.
*  I know, but if you look at Spain and you look at France and you look at Moscow, there's
*  no political agenda in these places.
*  There's no political agenda.
*  It's just they opened up and they said, let's go all open and the cases skyrocketed and
*  now they have to bring it back a little bit.
*  The virus is a real thing eating all these extra humans.
*  And you know, it's like-
*  Eating all these extra humans?
*  What the fuck?
*  What are you saying?
*  The virus is a real thing eating all these extra humans?
*  Yeah.
*  What is that?
*  What do you mean?
*  What kind of way to describe it is that?
*  The virus is a real thing eating all these extra humans.
*  We have extra humans right now.
*  We have way too many humans.
*  You can't say it like that.
*  Well, it's the truth.
*  You know how sometimes you have moss that's growing and it comes up just up to the edge
*  of the walkway and you're like, that looks pretty.
*  And then it starts going over onto the brick and starts coming.
*  We are the moss and we're covering the bricks now and something's showing up and scaling
*  us back a little bit.
*  Or there was an experimental virus that they were working on the Wuhan, what is it, level
*  four lab and it got out.
*  Sweden, which refused COVID lockdown, says restrictions will remain for at least another
*  year.
*  The restrictions are very different.
*  The restrictions are for really large gatherings, but you can go to restaurants, you can go
*  to bars.
*  Yes, but there's still restrictions.
*  The virus is a real thing go all around the planet and it's going to be a little bit.
*  It's going to be till June, by the way, I heard in Denver.
*  How do they know that in Denver?
*  Are they the people who told you about eating up extra humans?
*  They told me that this pilot was talking to me at the show and he said his doctor of some
*  note was saying that all of our pandemics have lasted 18 months despite what we try
*  to do.
*  Restrictions, no restrictions.
*  It runs its course.
*  18 months is about where the fire starts to subside and you go back to normal.
*  Historically.
*  Historically speaking.
*  Because it's a hundred years in between pandemics, nobody's around to give you lessons from the
*  last one.
*  We make all the same mistakes.
*  If you go by that, it's about June from when this virus started.
*  We're talking about June when we're back to normal, which is kind of upsetting, but kind
*  of nice also that you have an end date.
*  It's kind of like, all right, that's annoying.
*  I got to wear masks and do all this stuff and be kind of messed up.
*  But till June, that's kind of nice.
*  I can maybe make some plans.
*  I can make a 4th of July.
*  How many businesses are we going to lose between now and June though?
*  I think the real issue is people putting restrictions on what people can and can't do.
*  That's the real problem.
*  You're basically giving up your constitutional rights and there's no real protection for
*  you this way.
*  There's no real protection for your business.
*  There's no real protection for your livelihood.
*  Even with all this, you're still dealing with other kinds of horrible deaths and other kinds
*  of horrible things that go along with the economic despair.
*  How many people are going to die because of drug overdoses?
*  Or depression or suicide.
*  These have to be factored in too.
*  They totally do.
*  I really get the feeling, but there's the middle ground between the CNN narrative and
*  the Spock's narrative.
*  There's the truth.
*  I saw it in Portland.
*  I saw it in Connecticut.
*  I saw it in Salt Lake City.
*  What are you saying?
*  I performed in all these places.
*  They are all wearing masks, but their businesses are open.
*  That's what we should have had in LA a long time ago.
*  They're testing.
*  They've got the masks on.
*  They're distancing.
*  I ate in restaurants, but it's limited capacity.
*  I performed in comedy clubs, half capacity.
*  But here's the thing, though.
*  Not just because of my comedic draw.
*  I don't think that that's scientific because there's aerosol.
*  The virus is carried through the air now.
*  This has pretty much been confirmed.
*  They used to think it carried through droplets, which is the reason for the whole six-foot
*  social distancing space.
*  They don't think that's the case anymore.
*  They think it's airborne.
*  If that's the case, all that social distancing stuff is horse shit because it's in the air.
*  But not if you're social distanced and have a mask on.
*  I'm telling you, the social distancing thing doesn't mean anything anymore.
*  Gotcha.
*  What they're saying is-
*  So you can be close with a mask, but you're still in a mask.
*  A lot of these masks have holes in them.
*  A lot of these masks, you see these paper masks that people have with the wire?
*  There's an opening in the top, there's openings in the side.
*  There's a lot of sketchy masks.
*  I'm not saying it's not a good idea to wear a mask and maybe it reduces some of the droplets
*  that go out.
*  100%.
*  Maybe.
*  I'm not a scientist, neither are you.
*  But what I am saying is, I don't know how much ... I think what you're getting is you're
*  getting a lot of people that are healthy and they're going out and they don't have it,
*  and they're not giving it to anybody because they don't have it and you're getting away
*  with it.
*  Everybody's wearing masks and it's good to be cautious.
*  But I don't necessarily know if you were in a room filled with people who had COVID and
*  you ... Unless you had an N95 mask, unless you have a real mask, I don't know if those
*  fucking cloth masks are going to help you.
*  I think they work.
*  I mean, because look, you look at these places-
*  What are you basing that on?
*  I'm basing it on cities where they have the mask as a thing and they made it mandatory
*  that you wear these masks and the numbers go down.
*  Everyone does.
*  Everyone does what?
*  Everywhere you have to wear a mask.
*  The whole country.
*  Well, now, but it wasn't.
*  This was fits and starts and people screwing around.
*  There's all sorts of weird shit.
*  I traveled-
*  The protests were a big kick in the virus.
*  That was a giant uptick.
*  Right.
*  Of course, and there was a lot of people out there with no masks.
*  Not just that.
*  They were just bumper to bumper with each other.
*  They were right next to each other and screaming.
*  Right.
*  Exactly.
*  And it's in the air.
*  Exactly.
*  Especially at nighttime.
*  They think the sun kills it almost instantly.
*  Oh, that's nice.
*  Yeah.
*  There's been studies on UV light and UV light kills it almost instantly.
*  So sunlight and even simulated sunlight can kill it.
*  All, look, any proco-
*  You're playing the odds.
*  Yeah.
*  Right?
*  You want to do all the things that you can to-
*  I want the steroids that Trump's on.
*  That's what I want.
*  I want them too.
*  I want the vaccine.
*  I want-
*  The same shit that the rock had when he was doing Jumanji.
*  That's what they gave him.
*  They gave him all the good stuff.
*  Yeah, the really good stuff and shots in the ass.
*  Did you see his tweets?
*  I wanted-
*  Remember when you were a kid and you got a shot in your butt cheek?
*  I do.
*  Those things worked.
*  That's what we need to bring back.
*  Ass cheek shot.
*  What shots did they give you in your butt?
*  I don't know, but they worked.
*  Remember.
*  And you didn't want to go back to the doctor and have some man take your pants off and
*  make you cry in front of your mom, so you stayed healthy.
*  I never cried on my kid.
*  How funny would it be if you're sticking your ass out of your car window to get your vaccine?
*  That would be hilarious if everybody's just like parked with their butt right up to their
*  driver's side window.
*  So look, all of this is kind of like, it's going to run its course.
*  But you can do things to calm it down.
*  Connolly also revealed Trump has been treated with dexamethasone, an immunosuppressant steroid
*  that can cause euphoric mood changes.
*  Well, there's his tweets.
*  Since then-
*  I'm doing wheelies in the parking lot.
*  Since then people have posted online about their own experience with the drug.
*  Interesting.
*  An immunosuppressant steroid.
*  That's what's interesting too.
*  They say that one of the things that happens with this disease is you actually don't want
*  the immune system to react too violently to the disease or too aggressively to the disease.
*  I don't understand the logic behind that because I'm stupid.
*  I tried to read that article.
*  It was complicated.
*  It made me think how amazing the human body is.
*  This immune system.
*  There's stages of the immune system.
*  It originally comes out and gives you a dose of stuff and surrounds the virus.
*  Then it goes up and then it ramps up and then it reboots and then it sends another part.
*  It was like four stages of what your immune system does.
*  Because it has to be ramped up to attack this virus, it could actually hurt you more than
*  the virus.
*  Well, here it says, what does dexamethasone do?
*  Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid hormone that decreases the body's natural immune response
*  and reduces swelling and allergic reaction symptoms.
*  This medication treats a number of conditions including asthma, IBS, Crohn's disease, and
*  a number of lymphomas.
*  It is used to treat COVID-19 because serious cases can provoke an exaggerated immune response,
*  releasing a large number of pro-inflammatory cytokines in what's known as a cytokine storm.
*  I've heard of that.
*  As an immunosuppressant, dexamethasone is thought to help reduce the likelihood of the
*  body's overreaction to the virus.
*  Researchers found dexamethasone to significantly reduce mortality among seriously ill, i.e.
*  hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
*  Scientists have said it may prevent one in three deaths among patients on ventilators.
*  Interesting.
*  Yeah, so they gave him, they threw the kitchen sink at it immediately.
*  Yeah, and it worked.
*  Yeah, you're the president of the United States.
*  You should get everything they possibly have.
*  All I'm getting at this by fucking with you here is that in these times where things are
*  very unsure, a lot of times people like to say exactly what you need to do and what's
*  happening.
*  As long as people do this, we're okay.
*  As long as we wear a mask, we're okay.
*  I'm not sure.
*  I'm not sure that's the case.
*  I think we're all gonna get it.
*  That's what I think.
*  Well, that is the reality of what I'm saying that doctors saying that it goes 18 months.
*  But I don't know if 18 months means everybody gets it.
*  You're gonna come in contact with it.
*  Some people's immune system just beats it.
*  That's what I kind of, after looking at it globally last night and what that doctor said
*  of this timeline, which is total hearsay, but it seems to make sense.
*  It made me think all of this is noise and us all freaking out.
*  What about my job?
*  What about the mask?
*  What about this?
*  What do we do?
*  Is it real?
*  Is it not?
*  And it's all, we're all freaking out and it's gonna run its course either way despite
*  how crazy we get.
*  This virus is going to run its course and in a year and a half, it's gonna kind of ebb
*  out.
*  Exactly.
*  Listen to what you're saying.
*  You're talking as if you know what's gonna happen.
*  I'm guessing.
*  But see what people do?
*  You just sort of lay it out.
*  People do this at cocktail parties.
*  You say, yeah, well, we gotta do it.
*  This is how it's gonna go.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  And you feel comforted by that.
*  Of course.
*  Comforted by that.
*  And then you go home and try to relax.
*  If you say to a room full of people, I feel like I'm getting something.
*  They run away from you.
*  You gotta take zinc.
*  You gotta take this.
*  You got chicken soup.
*  You know what you gotta do?
*  You gotta get ginger.
*  There's this ginger drink.
*  Everybody has the idea.
*  And that's what I'm trying to say.
*  We're all trying to control the universe, but this thing's gonna run its course.
*  It's gonna happen.
*  We don't really have that much control over it.
*  Well, it's insanely contagious.
*  Santino caught it giving a guy a ride home.
*  Ten minute ride home with the windows open and he caught it.
*  No mask.
*  No, they weren't wearing masks.
*  Yeah.
*  The guy didn't know he had it.
*  No symptoms.
*  No coughing.
*  No nothing.
*  Gives him a ride home for ten minutes.
*  How did he know that that was the guy?
*  Because the guy called him afterwards.
*  A couple days later, it says, I got it.
*  And then Santino's like, fuck.
*  And then a couple days after that, Santino has it.
*  I like Fauci.
*  He looks like a little guy from the Bronx and he kind of makes me feel comfortable.
*  And he's in the administration, part of the Trump team.
*  And he's saying, please, just wear the mask.
*  Yes.
*  But, you know, initially he didn't say that.
*  And the reason why he didn't say that is because he wanted to make sure there was masks for
*  first responders.
*  Right.
*  The problem with that means he lied.
*  That means he said something that he knew wasn't true.
*  I'm not perfect.
*  Everybody lies.
*  He said something he knew wasn't true because he wanted people to react in a certain way.
*  But then he still expects them to trust him after that.
*  I'm not saying you shouldn't trust him.
*  I hear you.
*  I'm not saying it's wise or unwise.
*  But I'm saying in that circumstance, I wouldn't have recommended he do that.
*  Of course not.
*  I mean, the idea was that we were panicked and he thought, like, look, if I tell people,
*  everybody get a mask, then there's going to be this nationwide shortage of masks.
*  100%.
*  I read this article of countries that have done better than other countries.
*  South Korea, New Zealand.
*  They have advantages about isolation and all that kind of stuff.
*  And fewer people.
*  But the main thing that they were saying is communication.
*  Tell people the truth and they'll react accordingly.
*  And it calms the hysteria and it puts trust in the people that are giving you the advice.
*  So if he had come out and said, masks are important, use a bandana and leave these for
*  the health care workers.
*  These are very important that these people on the front lines get it.
*  That would have been so much better because then we wouldn't have the discussion.
*  My friend was a doctor and said that bandanas are useless.
*  They look cool, though.
*  Not really.
*  They look better than the plastic ones.
*  If you weren't in a pandemic and you're wearing a bandana over your face like that, you're
*  either a douchebag or a bank robber.
*  What about when you pull it down around your neck?
*  You look like you're at Studio 54.
*  You're a Chris Christopherson fan.
*  Or you're a guy who's at the range.
*  Like, a lot of guys at the gun range, they'll put bandanas around their neck because shells
*  come flying, hot shells.
*  Right.
*  And they can land in your collar and burn your neck.
*  I like it.
*  I used to wear it when I was on my motorcycle.
*  I would wear a bandana up for that same reason, for the road stuff.
*  And then you walk into the bar afterwards and you pull it down.
*  You look like a badass.
*  You take that little disposable paper thing and put it down on your neck.
*  No one's looking at you.
*  My friend Jeff, who's a doctor, he said that's the worst thing you can wear, is those bandanas.
*  He said cloth masks are better.
*  They're thicker.
*  They'll protect you more.
*  He goes, but you really want an N95 mask.
*  Yeah, that's the real deal.
*  I've been in my travels.
*  I've been on four or five round trip flights and I've been wearing the paper ones, the
*  disposable ones.
*  Yeah, the paper ones are okay.
*  As long as they're easiest to breathe in, which makes me suspicious.
*  I know that's I was thinking the same thing.
*  That's what I was saying.
*  I think if it's airborne, I don't know if that shit is blocking that much.
*  I don't know.
*  I know.
*  I'm like, I'm wearing the bandana.
*  I'm suffocating.
*  So then I put on the disposable one.
*  I'm like, oh, this is good.
*  I can go all the way to New York like this.
*  What do you think's larger, the virus in the air and aerosol or fart particles?
*  Because I guarantee you that made me suspicious too.
*  Someone has a hard fart.
*  I got on the tram in Denver at like eight in the morning and someone let a meaty one
*  out.
*  I mean, one of those lasagna farts and the whole place, we're all in masks and everyone
*  was horrified.
*  I'm like, how strong are they?
*  Did anyone say anything?
*  No, they didn't have to.
*  You saw facial expressions.
*  People should have said something.
*  Through the, oh, there was a couple.
*  I made eye contact with the lady next to me.
*  We both gave an eye roll just to tell each other it wasn't us, but somebody let it through
*  and I'm like, if this farts getting through.
*  Joey Diaz farted on a plane.
*  It was so bad.
*  I wrote a story about it.
*  I did.
*  I wrote a fucking, it's called Happy Pills.
*  It's probably still out there on the internet somewhere.
*  It was on my blog.
*  He cut a fart that was so bad.
*  I was in the middle of thinking about life and people getting older.
*  I was listening to Jimi Hendrix and I was high.
*  He cut this fart and this lady behind us goes, oh my God.
*  He starts laughing.
*  I put my shirt over my face.
*  I'm like, oh my God.
*  It was so bad.
*  It's the worst.
*  Some are so powerful.
*  Look at that.
*  If a fart can make it through pants, how can a mask protect you from a virus?
*  Exactly.
*  That's what I'm saying.
*  Who wrote this article?
*  This is back in May.
*  Johnny Farks a lot.
*  Like a Yahoo News thing.
*  The fart particles are way smaller apparently.
*  Kristen May.
*  Oh, Dr. McQueef.
*  A thousand times smaller.
*  Dr. McQueef.
*  Fart particles are smaller than the virus?
*  Yeah, that's why.
*  Wow.
*  Tiny stinky fart molecules.
*  C4 3SH is a rather small molecule with a diameter around, oh my God.
*  They've measured farts.
*  Yeah, this is science.
*  By comparison, viruses typically range in diameter much larger.
*  COVID-19 being about 60 to 140 nm.
*  I don't know what that means.
*  Nanometers or molars?
*  I'm not sure.
*  Okay, so farts are smaller.
*  The virus is 100 to 1000 times bigger than a fart molecule.
*  What about if a virus goes through farts?
*  Oh, wait a minute.
*  Hold on.
*  Go back to that.
*  They explain how N95 masks work.
*  Look at that.
*  N95 masks is capable of filtering 95% of test aerosol containing the average particle size
*  of 300 nm.
*  Basically, N95 masks has a tight weave pattern with multiple layers that serve as a barrier
*  to larger structures like viruses or simply spittle.
*  That works.
*  That stuff works.
*  There's a reason doctors wear that stuff for all sorts of things.
*  Keith Robinson once, my good pal and comedian, we were at Del Frisco's across from Radio
*  City Music Hall.
*  Del Frisco's?
*  Yeah, great place.
*  Great place.
*  Huge.
*  It's two floors, but there's no ceiling over the first floor dining section, so it's just
*  like 50 feet high in the air.
*  We had this big dinner, steak dinner.
*  I mean, it's a massive place with huge ventilation.
*  Like, you could do a show there now in the middle of a pandemic and everyone would be
*  safe.
*  And he farted on our way out of there.
*  He crop dusted the whole place.
*  Other tables were putting napkins over their faces, dropping silverware.
*  It was that bad?
*  It was that bad.
*  Just toxic.
*  What was he eating?
*  I don't know.
*  He's decaying.
*  What's that?
*  It's a mixture of things.
*  It's usually like when you mix broccoli and meat.
*  Or some beans.
*  Some beans following that up.
*  No, it's disgusting.
*  No, but I was like...
*  But, by the way, I leave...
*  The reason I started even looking at the perception of it all and trying to look at it in a global
*  way is because it is confusing.
*  This whole thing is very confusing.
*  And that we're in the middle of an election makes it so confusing because everyone is
*  using whatever little information they have to their advantage.
*  But there's also the confusion of...
*  I'm in LA.
*  I go to LAX.
*  Joe, I could have gotten there five minutes before my flight.
*  I'm the only guy going through security.
*  I walk right up to the gate and get on the plane.
*  No traffic going down.
*  No wait at all.
*  It's unheard of.
*  Then I land in Denver.
*  It's like it's 2018.
*  Packed.
*  You know that big...
*  Yeah, that's real America, Tom.
*  That's what I was telling you.
*  You're living in this bullshit, liberal, communist, Marxist, phony state.
*  It's a nation state.
*  And it's controlled by a dictator named Gavin Newsom.
*  And he wants you to be poor.
*  Why would he want me to be poor?
*  Because he wants more hair.
*  He wants to use your money to grow his hair thicker.
*  You ever see his sexy shot?
*  Have you ever...
*  Have you ever seen the sexy shot?
*  Who was the woman that gave the...
*  That he used to date who's now on the Trump...
*  Oh, that was his wife.
*  Donald Trump Jr.'s girlfriend is his ex-wife.
*  Yeah, which I had no idea.
*  Before he ruined San Francisco.
*  Before he ruined San Francisco, they were together.
*  Yeah, they were. They're laying on like a bare skin rug.
*  Oh no.
*  Oh yeah, they call him the new Kennedys, Jamie.
*  You got it?
*  Oh, who let them take that picture?
*  Why would you do that?
*  It's funny that Jimmy Kimmel used that.
*  Why would you do that?
*  Is that hilarious?
*  Who said yes to that?
*  What serious politician poses on the floor with your knee up...
*  The kind that wants to wreck a whole state.
*  We've got to get the lockdowns.
*  I have to say, when he was giving the speeches in the beginning of the lockdown,
*  I liked hearing him.
*  He sounds good. He's a handsome man.
*  He looks very distinguished.
*  His voice is good. He's a little raspy.
*  But the draconian laws, these draconian enforcements,
*  the way they're handling it, it's just...
*  What state do you think is handling it the right way?
*  Like, where do you think it...
*  Who's got kind of like it down?
*  Florida.
*  You think?
*  They're like, Buckwild, let's go.
*  Florida doesn't give a fuck.
*  Jimmy Bucket concerts.
*  You can do whatever you want.
*  We could do stand-up in an arena in Florida.
*  I'm not kidding.
*  No social distancing, no mask requirement.
*  What's happening to their numbers?
*  They did this, what, two weeks ago?
*  They're fine. Everyone's getting stronger and younger.
*  They're going back in time.
*  You never get any older and you never die.
*  They look better than they have ever looked.
*  They're the only ones free in this whole country.
*  They're the most American people in America.
*  Freedom is kind of overrated, don't you think?
*  Listen to this fucking communist...
*  They got you beaten down.
*  I understand you have a mortgage. You gotta stay in California.
*  You're trying to swallow the Kool-Aid.
*  You're taking it down in sperm-like chunks.
*  You're just trying to swallow it.
*  And the chunky sauce of Gavin Newsom.
*  You're sucking it down your pipe right now.
*  But there's no difference.
*  What's the difference? Restaurants?
*  You can't go to comedy clubs, you can't go to restaurants.
*  You can't go to movie theaters.
*  You can only go to comedy clubs in certain places.
*  You can't go to any retail store in a mall that doesn't have an outside entrance.
*  What? My wife is just at the mall.
*  Yes, you can go to Nordstrom's because they have an outside entrance.
*  She went to Kiehl's, which is inside.
*  Well, unless they've changed it recently.
*  Oh, it's a whole euphoria now. You gotta come.
*  You gotta move back. It's amazing now.
*  He's a propagandist. I told you, Jamie.
*  I told you we can't have him on.
*  He's done.
*  He's got a fever.
*  I just got tested.
*  I want to test your forehead. I want to see if you got something else.
*  I want to see if you have a fever.
*  What is the difference between
*  LA and
*  I'm asking this honestly.
*  I was kind of trying to figure it out.
*  Honestly, all fucking around.
*  People are less scared here.
*  First of all, they're way friendlier here.
*  It just seems more relaxed.
*  You can work. You can go to work.
*  You wear a mask and go to work.
*  I'm sure there are some cases.
*  Deaths are way down.
*  Everywhere in the country.
*  They used to be climbing and climbing.
*  Now it's like
*  it was 208,000 people.
*  Now it's 209,000 people.
*  When you're dealing with 320 million plus people,
*  it's a relatively small number of people dying from it.
*  They have the remedies better.
*  They have the different treatments better.
*  It still sucks.
*  I don't want to get it.
*  Everybody that I know that's got it has kicked it pretty easy except Michael Yeo.
*  Michael Yeo was in a bad situation.
*  Michael Yeo was in a bad state when he got it.
*  He was really run down.
*  But broken down.
*  He had been traveling a lot.
*  He has low vitamin D. Admittedly, he wasn't taking vitamin D.
*  Which is apparently a big factor in your immune system.
*  I do feel like
*  that's probably
*  the places that I've been
*  they're not ignoring it.
*  It's not Florida.
*  They're not ignoring it.
*  I don't think Florida is really ignoring it.
*  The governor all bullshit aside.
*  He was saying
*  the issue that we really need to concern ourselves with
*  is people 70 plus.
*  70 plus are the ones who have a significant risk of dying.
*  He was saying everybody else
*  what we really need to consider is the people that have underlying conditions.
*  This is what should have been done all along.
*  The people that are at higher risk should have been sheltered.
*  But shutting everything down
*  is an economic disaster.
*  That's where we're at.
*  They shut the comedy store down when they were trying to do shows outside in the parking lot.
*  With a fucking snot shield
*  in front of everybody.
*  They had a big glass shield in front of the audience.
*  And they still said no.
*  Outside.
*  You can open up a restaurant outside
*  but you can't do stand up in the parking lot of the store.
*  I don't get that at all.
*  There's literally no
*  difference.
*  I've performed in a lot of places.
*  I was in a casino in Connecticut.
*  Everyone's wearing masks.
*  Everyone's doing the right thing.
*  I'd rather catch COVID than do a casino in Connecticut.
*  I'm not proud of it.
*  How dare he!
*  I'm not proud of it.
*  Which casino?
*  I had to go see my family.
*  Higginson.
*  Doing the shows was so great.
*  The comedy store documentary.
*  I got to see it for my radio show.
*  I got to see it all the way through.
*  They sent it to me in advance.
*  It's really good.
*  It's heavy.
*  It's really great.
*  There's a real depth to it.
*  Your part is amazing.
*  It's just amazing.
*  What you did for that club
*  was everybody kind of knows
*  how you had such an impact on it.
*  But actually seeing it
*  we're with you all the time
*  but seeing in a documentary style
*  starting with the mencia of it
*  and getting to now
*  man, it was amazing.
*  It was amazing.
*  Man, it made me want to kiss you
*  right on the lips.
*  Is that a threat? He's threatening me now.
*  Jesus, Jamie.
*  He's come here.
*  It really is such a great thing.
*  To have such a historic place
*  that was so bright and great
*  and then really decimated and fell on its ass
*  and you're really the force
*  that brought it back to this
*  was just great.
*  It was so great.
*  Watching your story was really cool.
*  It was heavy. It was weird to make.
*  I cried a bunch of times thinking about Mitzi.
*  Yeah, man.
*  Thinking about the old days.
*  But what it was like to come there
*  just to be a paid regular there.
*  It's such a polarizing place.
*  So many people have a negative
*  impression of it because it's such a
*  difficult club and there's so many killers there
*  and a lot of people just didn't feel like they got
*  the respect that they deserved there.
*  But it's not the case.
*  You needed a higher level.
*  It's hard.
*  You're on a line up with
*  15 murderers and everyone's killing
*  in front of you.
*  There's a lot of people that would go there
*  and they would have sort of mediocre sets
*  and they would be upset because they had a career.
*  They'd be on television shows.
*  They'd be doing things.
*  The comic store would be like,
*  we don't have any spots for you.
*  They would harbor this terrible resentment
*  and they would talk about it.
*  Years later they would say,
*  everybody had to prove themselves at that place.
*  They don't give a fuck if you're on a TV show.
*  They don't give a fuck.
*  No one cares.
*  It's not an easy place.
*  Take the booking out of it.
*  Getting up and performing in any of those rooms.
*  You gotta be good.
*  You not only have to be good, you have to learn
*  that room. All those rooms.
*  It's tough. It's a tough place.
*  But the exciting thing is the people that do come
*  through and the people that are coming up
*  like Laura Beats, like Annie Letterman,
*  all these young kids that are coming up.
*  Ali Mikovsky.
*  And then you have these people that are there
*  and established and looking to break through
*  like Tony Hinchcliffe.
*  Guys who are killers.
*  There's so many of them.
*  And it makes you. If you can stick it out,
*  it really does make you.
*  But for some people, they liked the UCB.
*  They liked these places where they could go.
*  Comforting.
*  Everybody was relaxed.
*  Everybody was supporting.
*  And the audience was a little bit more enthusiastic
*  about laughing.
*  No one's gonna bomb.
*  There's also a darkness to the store
*  that's undeniable.
*  And I think it comes from it being
*  Ciro's nightclub. Because it was Bugsy Siegel's
*  nightclub. And people were legitimately
*  murdered there.
*  That is 100% fact.
*  People were murdered
*  at the Comedy Store.
*  Who owns Ciro's?
*  Bugsy Siegel.
*  Bugsy Siegel owns Ciro's.
*  Dude, there's old school pictures
*  of Ciro's that are amazing.
*  Where you could see the stage
*  where we perform on.
*  But instead Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin are on that stage.
*  Yeah, doing a live show.
*  Now what is that?
*  Because there are places that
*  the place
*  has a magic to it.
*  There are places that
*  just undeniably succeed.
*  And there's other places that
*  never really get it going.
*  And I'm talking about restaurants or
*  a hotel or just like
*  there's a magic to certain
*  I think spots.
*  Rupert Sheldrake believed this.
*  He believed that he's
*  an intellectual. I forget what his actual
*  discipline is. Is he any biologist?
*  What is Rupert Sheldrake? He's a mathematician.
*  I forget what exactly he does.
*  But he has this concept
*  that everything has memory.
*  And he believed in this thing
*  called morphic resonance.
*  That all these things are connected in some
*  sort of indescribable, unmeasurable
*  way. But I'm probably
*  butchering that. But he also believes that
*  things have memory.
*  A type of memory. And this is the reason why people don't want to
*  live in a house where someone was murdered.
*  Right. You can feel it.
*  You don't want to buy a car that someone blew their
*  brains out in. You know what I mean?
*  Remember that movie, Stephen King movie,
*  Christine? Yeah. Awesome.
*  Better book. Book's fucking incredible.
*  I hate when people say that, but it really is.
*  It's more in... The book is way more
*  in depth. And it's just... It's a slower
*  process of the kid who owns the car going crazy.
*  Oh, nice. Yeah. And it's...
*  You know, someone died in the car.
*  The guy who owned it
*  haunted the car. So great.
*  I think that was the story that someone died in the car.
*  So great. No, things
*  definitely... Yeah.
*  Like, you wouldn't want... You wouldn't even
*  want to buy an asshole's car.
*  Like, if you had some person
*  who was really mean, who was a real shitty person,
*  you wouldn't buy their car. Like,
*  driving around their car. No, like when you
*  go look... Like, when you go to buy a car or buy a
*  house,
*  you walk in and you know
*  if it fits you. Yes.
*  That's a thing. Sure. It's a vibe. That's a...
*  You get it. Yeah. You know?
*  There's something there. There's something beyond
*  what you're seeing. Yeah. Like, if you buy a house
*  and you meet the owner and you get along great
*  with them, you're real friendly, like, that's
*  a nice feeling. Yeah. You're like, oh, we bought Mike's
*  house. Yay.
*  Yeah, exactly. There's a little story to it.
*  And that's the thing with the store. There is
*  really a long story
*  of show business in that spot.
*  And it's... It is...
*  It's got many
*  edges to it, which is just like
*  comedy. The thing that I loved about the
*  store is not just that it's
*  this historic place where
*  all these great comics started out,
*  like Kinnison and Richard Pryor, and
*  all these people made their mark there.
*  But it's also
*  a place where everybody worked
*  out. So there's
*  failure in that room, too.
*  There's the potential for failure.
*  It's not a place where you film things
*  all the time and everything's perfect
*  and it's all polished.
*  No, this... You work. It's a
*  gym. Right. It's got edge to
*  it. And it's got... You know, there's people
*  went up on stage, they're
*  too drunk. They went up coked
*  up. Right. They failed.
*  They got in fights with audience members.
*  You know? Yeah. It's
*  just... It's got
*  so much humanity
*  to it. The coolest
*  part, I think,
*  of the old
*  crew was watching
*  the Jim Carrey stuff.
*  How, you know, he was
*  kicking ass and pretty
*  successful and killing in the room
*  and then changes his act and sucks
*  for a long time as he's
*  leaving the impressions and going into other
*  stuff. And I mean,
*  the balls of that, in that
*  room... And you just see him in the hallway. There's pictures
*  of him just sweating. He's just
*  drenched. He doesn't know what he's doing.
*  But that they supported him and let him
*  do that in that room like that.
*  Because, you know, when you're there,
*  people are throwing fastballs. Everyone's
*  great and everyone's killing.
*  And then you've got to be humble to get up there
*  and really stick to your guns
*  and try your new shit and suck.
*  And when you saw the old guys
*  that aren't really around anymore... Was it Tim Tomerson?
*  Is that one of them? Yeah. You saw
*  these guys that... They said was like a killer.
*  It seemed like a killer. Yeah. But you realize
*  like, oh, these guys come in waves.
*  I know. You know? I mean, there's
*  these guys that if you don't know
*  any better, like, you might not know who Rick Ingram
*  is. Right. But you might have to follow that motherfucker.
*  And he's throwing some 94
*  miles an hour right down the pipe.
*  Woo! You're there with your new notes.
*  Good luck, bitch. Yeah.
*  Or, you know, you might go on after Sarah
*  Silverman murders. Or you might go on after
*  Eliza Schlesinger gets a fucking standing ovation.
*  Yeah. That place
*  is crazy, man. I know. And
*  it was filled with good feelings
*  and bad feelings. And there was a lot of emotions.
*  And there was a lot of arguments.
*  And there was a lot of tension. But
*  the last few years
*  was the most camaraderie,
*  the most
*  warmth and supportive that I've
*  ever felt it there. Oh, 100%.
*  And I think I attribute that to the
*  internet. I attribute that to podcasts
*  because I felt like it was a time
*  of bounty. It wasn't a
*  time of famine. And in the past,
*  everyone had this famine mentality.
*  Because, like,
*  if you got a sitcom and I
*  was trying out for the same part, I felt like you
*  took something from me. Like, fuck, there's only one part
*  in the sitcom and Tom got it. Or if
*  you were trying out for a game show or you're
*  trying out for a talk show. Yeah. And there's
*  five of us are out for it and one of us gets it.
*  So there's this weird, creepy
*  competitiveness. Right. And if you
*  were on a morning radio show
*  and then there was a guy who was across town that was
*  on the radio the same time, you weren't his buddy.
*  Right. Like, we're friends.
*  And we also have podcasts.
*  And I tell people, listen to Tom
*  Poppa's podcast. Right. Listen to Tom Poppa's
*  radio show. Right. Listen to Fortune
*  Femston. Tom Poppa on Sirius.
*  They're both great. There's a camaraderie.
*  There's a different thing now. It's very
*  true. We support each other. Like, I don't think of you
*  and Fortune as being competitors.
*  I think you've been my friends. Oh, you should.
*  What Fortune says about you.
*  Oh, no. Oh, no.
*  Oh, boy. Fortune, I love you.
*  Fortune, I love you. How are we going to kill that guy?
*  Why? Why?
*  But there's none of that in this community.
*  Like, everybody does everybody's podcast.
*  That's a great insight. It's never
*  happened before. No. Never been like that before.
*  No. Yeah. I mean,
*  even when we started. Guys helped each other before
*  a little bit, but only if it didn't hurt
*  them. Right.
*  Now you don't have to worry about it hurting you.
*  It only helps you. Like, if I help you,
*  it only helps me because people know
*  you're funny. And they go, oh, I can listen to
*  Joe because every time he tells you about a comic, I know
*  they're funny. Right. Because he's telling the truth.
*  That's right. Which is why I won't have people on that suck.
*  And I've had people ask.
*  Right. I'm like, you can't do it.
*  I can't do it.
*  Sometimes people get real edgy when they don't get a
*  response. I have to hide.
*  I have to filter myself. I have to change my phone number.
*  That's where Jamie comes in.
*  No, Jamie doesn't. He should insulate.
*  Good luck getting through Jamie.
*  Jamie's Fort Knox, motherfucker. You ain't getting through that wall.
*  I think about Jamie every time
*  something technologically
*  doesn't work. I'm like,
*  Jamie can fix this in a second. He'll figure it out.
*  But as far as like getting
*  through to him to get to the show, he is the least
*  approachable.
*  It's impossible.
*  I remember when I got a
*  pilot or something, and
*  early on,
*  and Geraldo,
*  Greg Geraldo, my friend, said
*  we all went out to dinner
*  with Esti and
*  Manny from the Comedy Cellar, and
*  Greg and his wife, and
*  myself and my wife. And Greg
*  took me aside, and he said, dude,
*  I have to,
*  this is how much I love you. I am genuinely
*  happy for you. I know people
*  say like, oh, I'm happy for you.
*  But it was so unusual to truly be happy
*  for other comedians that he had to take me aside
*  and say, no joke,
*  I am so
*  happy for you. And he didn't
*  have his own ego involved. He didn't have
*  any of that. And at that time, you're right,
*  that was an unusual position to be in.
*  It was rare. There's only a few friends that I
*  had that were real tight
*  like that all throughout
*  comedy, like Joey Diaz for sure, Ari Shafir,
*  always Duncan
*  Trussell. There's a lot of those guys that I was
*  real tight with from the beginning.
*  But Greg was, or
*  Greg Giraldo, not just Fitzsimmons,
*  just such a smart person.
*  Just an interesting person.
*  You know, I was really lucky. I knew Greg
*  from New York, but we also were
*  on the set together because
*  News Radio was being filmed
*  right next to his show.
*  When he had... Common Law. Right.
*  We were on the same set. Oh, wow.
*  So I would hang out with him all the time. We'd go out in the
*  parking lot and run into him. We knew each other
*  from L.A. That's great. Or from New York, you know.
*  That was a fun time.
*  And also the John Larroquette show was there too.
*  I'm pretty sure... Oh, yeah. Wasn't Lenny Clark
*  on the John Larroquette show?
*  That sounds familiar. I'm pretty sure Lenny Clark
*  was on that show. Yeah.
*  Something... Yeah, it sounds familiar.
*  But that was
*  there too. Was it Lenny Clark? Was he
*  on that show?
*  I think... Yeah, that's a
*  hard one. Good luck spelling that. Lenny Clark
*  was on that?
*  Yeah.
*  Yes. Okay.
*  So Lenny was there too. I'm trying to remember it.
*  But I didn't run into Lenny
*  as much, but I ran into...
*  And also, you know who else was there?
*  Joey Lawrence.
*  Oh, really? Yeah, Joey Lawrence
*  who used to sit in his car with his fabulous
*  hair. I was always so jealous of
*  his hair. Because it was right when my hair was really
*  like struggling. And
*  he would sit in his car and he was like
*  fucking 12 years old. There's
*  Lenny Clark! Oh, yeah. Look at him.
*  I love that motherfucker. God, what a force.
*  Yeah. And Ron Funches.
*  That's not Ron Funches.
*  Son of a bitch. He's so much older
*  than Ron. Shut up.
*  Be mean to Ron. Lenny Clark!
*  So
*  they were right next door. And
*  Joey Lawrence, his show was there
*  and so he would sit in his car.
*  He had like... You know, he was like fucking 12
*  years old or something. And he had some
*  he was probably 20. But he had some
*  ridiculously expensive car that I
*  could never afford. And he'd be playing his
*  own music. Yeah. So he had his door
*  open and he'd be like sitting there jamming
*  to his own music really loud.
*  His own music? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  And I'd be like, look at that guy
*  living the life.
*  All I could think of is like
*  how many girls must be throwing themselves
*  at Joey Lawrence. Oh my god.
*  He's there playing his own music. There he is.
*  Look at him. Look at his hair. It's so great.
*  Beautiful. I've never had hair that good. Ever.
*  I had it for like a week.
*  When I was seven my hair wasn't that thick.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  There he is. Yeah, that 80s like
*  graffiti in the back and the big
*  jackets. He looks like Madonna.
*  He does look like Madonna. He looks like Madonna.
*  He's got this... Why does he have this shirt
*  tied around his waist? I feel like you could give that to shirts.
*  You're filming.
*  Hand that shirt off to somebody. Is that like a look?
*  See, Joe, that's why you were never a heartthrob.
*  You don't understand the intricacies.
*  There's a lot of reasons why I was never a
*  heartthrob. I'm not good looking, you know.
*  But the... That...
*  He's adorable. It's a different look that he's got.
*  Oh, I love picturing him in his
*  car listening to his own music.
*  Yeah. That's what you would do.
*  And we would be like, well, look at that kid
*  living the life.
*  Living la vida loca. I remember
*  that when Greg was doing that show
*  he had this
*  guy that was running the show
*  who was just like... We didn't... You know, you didn't
*  know anybody from LA who wrote shows
*  so they just matched him up with some
*  guy. And he came by the
*  cellar and I met him. And I
*  was just like, you know when you meet people who are like...
*  They just don't give a shit.
*  Like, you could tell he was
*  just getting paid and it's just another
*  pilot. He's gonna have 50 more.
*  He's already done 25.
*  And we were like, you know, you should really do
*  this for Greg. And he was just like, yeah.
*  And he just knew in his eyes
*  like, this guy's not really
*  gonna help Greg.
*  Well, people don't know what we're talking
*  about but we should try to explain that there was a
*  time where you would go to the Montreal
*  Comedy Festival and you'd get a development
*  deal. And this is like everybody would
*  cash in. You'd go get a development deal
*  and then they would try to do
*  a pilot. And I knew so
*  many people that lost their fucking
*  minds when they got
*  deals to do a pilot. I had a phone call
*  from this guy. I'm not gonna say his name.
*  But he was a terrible comedian.
*  He calls me up and he says, hey listen, I know you got
*  a show that you're working on right now
*  but I'm telling you, my show
*  is gonna go to air and I want you to play my
*  brother. I was like, what?
*  He's like, I know it's a smaller show but this show's guaranteed
*  to air. Never aired. Of course not.
*  And he starts telling me all these crazy
*  things. Like, there's a
*  guaranteed pickup and if this doesn't
*  pick up, then NBC Universal's
*  got second position and they're gonna
*  pick it up. He was drinking the Kool-Aid.
*  It was like the craziest conversation.
*  It's hard in the first time around.
*  Nothing ever happened for him. Nothing.
*  Nothing ever happened for him.
*  What I mean, nothing. I mean, nothing.
*  I mean, that went away and then he never
*  really had a stand-up career, never had anything.
*  Who was it again? I'm not saying.
*  But the conversation was so bizarre.
*  Because he called me up. I was in the middle of
*  filming something. And he
*  was telling me, listen, forget that bullshit.
*  I've got a thing. This is gonna go.
*  It hits people's egos. 100%. It hits so many people.
*  Yeah. That ego.
*  I knew someone who all of a sudden had an assistant.
*  I'm like, why do you have an assistant?
*  Like, what do you do? I don't have an assistant.
*  Just got off the plane. Right.
*  I tell people, don't get an assistant. Do less shit.
*  Right. If you ever need an assistant, just do
*  less things. Sarah says that too.
*  Sarah Silverman says that. Smart lady.
*  That's the move. Do less things.
*  You don't need a fucking
*  assistant. Like, what are you doing?
*  Some people like it. It's the ego stroke of it.
*  They know that famous people have assistants.
*  Someone shows up with a pad.
*  What would you like, Tom? Latte?
*  Grande? Grande latte, Tom?
*  Yeah, coming up with stuff for them to do.
*  But the problem with assistants is sometimes they tazer you.
*  Like David Spade's assistant. Yeah.
*  No, I know. Fucking guy tried to kill him.
*  It's a lot of those stories. That guy wanted to kill him.
*  Too close. Yeah. Way too close.
*  Yeah, well, maybe David wasn't
*  nice to him. I mean, let's just...
*  No. I mean...
*  Probably not that big a stretch.
*  To say he felt a little demeaned.
*  I mean, I don't know what happened.
*  I'm sure he just... He'd misconstrue space.
*  Could be.
*  Just his attitude. The smug asides.
*  He just thought he was serious.
*  He thought he was serious. Exactly.
*  It was just jokes. Just jokes.
*  But that was a heady time. I kind of just missed that time.
*  Because that was
*  the way for comedians was
*  the sitcom.
*  That was the Roseanne, the Science Public.
*  Everybody was... Everybody on down.
*  Convinced that that was what you needed to do.
*  That was the formula.
*  So you would do it, and then
*  you would get on a show, and then hopefully
*  people would come to see you at comedy clubs.
*  That's my strategy. I was hoping
*  I could get a special somewhere,
*  and I was hoping someone would come to see me at comedy clubs.
*  I had the
*  thing where I just never thought I was
*  ready for it.
*  Even when I had my first pilot, it was like,
*  yeah, we'll see!
*  Guys with huge egos would be like,
*  this is my thing. I'm going to make
*  this the thing. And I was always like, I don't
*  know if I'm really... People might think I have a
*  huge ego. Good enough. Because it seems
*  like I do. But honestly, I've never
*  thought that anything that I was doing was
*  going to work. Yeah. I always
*  thought it was going to be canceled.
*  I never thought... I did jokes
*  about Fear Factor being canceled the very
*  moment it was on the air. And I'm like, I'm doing
*  this show is not going to fucking last.
*  They're sticking dogs on people and
*  making them eat animal dicks.
*  How long are we going to do this?
*  Or even news radio. That was
*  a great show to kind of check
*  your ego because I was only one of eight
*  people. And the other people,
*  especially Phil Hartman and Dave Foley,
*  were much more famous than me.
*  Much more talented. And it was like
*  I had
*  an opportunity to do an apprenticeship.
*  I had an opportunity to
*  learn what it's like to act. I
*  had never taken... I took a few acting
*  classes, private lessons when I had
*  gotten a development deal. But I never
*  acted. And then all of a sudden a couple
*  of months later I'm on TV.
*  Like literally. Very little
*  preparation. And I'm sitting there
*  next to Phil Hartman.
*  On a TV show. And if you watch those
*  old news radios, it looks like it.
*  Because my character
*  had to be kind of like
*  innocent and stupid.
*  And I was like really
*  into conspiracies, which they made.
*  Because of me. Because I really was really
*  into conspiracies. They kind of turned my character that way.
*  But while I was there I was kind of like huh.
*  Was this really happening? Like even while
*  I was doing it. Well that's what's wild about it
*  is a lot of moments in this career
*  you... Look at me. Also cute. Oh adorable.
*  Fresh face. 27 year old.
*  Look at that. 27? Yeah. Back then.
*  It's weird because you get into a situation
*  where you have to be great
*  at it while you're learning it. Yeah.
*  Like that is a
*  But the thing is that... But you were surrounded by good people.
*  And it's also... It's sitcom acting.
*  And stand up is harder than that.
*  And I had already been doing stand up for 6 years.
*  But where you... Did you believe that
*  when you walked in there? Didn't you think
*  this has got to be harder?
*  No. No you...
*  It's definitely easier. Oh I know it is.
*  But when you first showed up on set, weren't you scared?
*  No.
*  I don't know this. No, no. I thought it was easier.
*  For sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 100%.
*  Yeah. It was definitely easier.
*  Because you could do it again.
*  You did it in front of a live audience if you fucked up.
*  Like we fucked up all the time. We would laugh about it.
*  And then we would do a retake. Like I was always
*  laughing. When I would do scenes with Andy Dick
*  I could never keep it together. Oh really?
*  I'd try to keep a straight face. And I would always
*  crack. He was so funny
*  man. I mean he's so self destructive and
*  so crazy but so fucking
*  talented. Andy Dick is literally one
*  of the funniest human beings I've ever done
*  anything with. Just so... But
*  you can't... After a while you're like I can't.
*  I can't do this anymore. You're just too crazy.
*  But so talented.
*  And when he and I had this weird
*  sort of dynamic on the show
*  and we had these hilarious scenes together
*  and you know...
*  It was so hard to do. So you'd be able
*  to like fuck up and laugh and then
*  the audience actually got a kick out of it.
*  Because they got to see how the sausage was made.
*  They got to see the behind the scenes. Because you're breaking.
*  But way easier. If you
*  fall blind they give it to you. You redo it.
*  It's a hundred times easier than
*  stand up. Oh it is, yeah. But when you don't know it.
*  Yours was the Ray Romano role, right?
*  Sort of.
*  I took the Ray Romano role
*  that someone else took. See what happens is
*  Ray got fired from the pilot.
*  They brought in another guy for the pilot.
*  That guy did the pilot. There was another
*  guy on the original episode of News Radio that played
*  me. And then they fired that guy.
*  And then I entered into
*  a cattle call. And there was like a
*  hundred dudes that auditioned for the part.
*  And I wound up getting it.
*  Wow. Alright, that's good.
*  But I had a development deal with NBC
*  to do my own show.
*  Oh, so they could use your contract and put you in that?
*  Yeah, so in the middle of the development deal
*  they're trying to find me writers. We're talking about
*  different projects. And they say to
*  me, hey, we have this show
*  we'd like you to look at. And they showed me this
*  pilot, which is fucking genius.
*  And I had just come from this Fox show.
*  Which started off really good. The writers
*  were hilarious. They were
*  really good writers. They wrote for
*  The Simpsons. They wrote for Married with Children. They were
*  excellent. But they got fucked over hard.
*  They brought in this
*  aaaaaaack producer
*  and just ruined the show. And all these
*  network executives are getting their
*  fucking spittle laden fingers all
*  over everything. It was awful.
*  That's what's so hard. That's what's so hard. Is that
*  anytime you get that many people
*  on anything, any organization,
*  the idea you've got, that's where
*  the luck comes in. That all those people
*  are going to be cool and not ruin it.
*  It's just something that's waiting to be ruined.
*  Everything where you get a lot of people together
*  and try to create an art piece,
*  good luck. Tough.
*  Sometimes it works. Yeah.
*  That's like why the great directors,
*  like the Soderberghs and the Nolens,
*  James Cameron's, they end up
*  working with a lot of the same people all the time.
*  Adam Sandler does that as well. Yeah.
*  Because you have
*  some control over the universe. Well you also
*  know how each other works.
*  And you all have a common goal. And you've done it
*  before so you know how to do it. Right.
*  Or you have these people that are these
*  super powerful figures
*  like Cameron, who just takes control of everything.
*  I've heard James Cameron will grab
*  a paintbrush, give me that fucking thing, you don't know what you're doing.
*  And paint the wall.
*  Because he's got a vision.
*  If they let him
*  do it, you get Avatar.
*  Otherwise, you
*  get fucking a bunch of other people
*  and then you get one of the more recent Star Wars movies.
*  You get a bunch of people
*  trying to add this and that.
*  Use a formula.
*  And you get dog shit.
*  You get dog shit.
*  And that was the guy who went back to the Geraldo thing.
*  When I saw that guy, I knew he was one of those guys.
*  It was just like, ugh.
*  And then it just ended up like, oh that's not Greg.
*  Well after I did
*  News Radio, I did have a development
*  deal to do another show. I think I might have had
*  two different development deals. I had one
*  and another one afterwards. But I was like
*  really soured. Because News Radio
*  was so good and the directors
*  and the directors and the actors and the actors
*  and everyone. The writers were so fucking
*  good. Those scripts were really
*  great. I would read this other stuff and I'd be like
*  this is horrible. Yeah.
*  I can't do it. And also it's the risk
*  of the crew that we
*  had were hard partiers
*  that were really fun people.
*  Like me and
*  Foley and Maura and
*  some of the other folks on the show. We would get
*  hammered. I mean
*  after the show. After the show film.
*  We'd go to the local bars. We'd walk to a local
*  bar or we'd drink on the set.
*  We would get blasted. They were partiers.
*  Especially Foley. He loved
*  to drink. And it was
*  like there was a camaraderie to
*  that. And we always felt like
*  we were outcasts. We never made
*  it. That show didn't become
*  famous really until after it was cancelled.
*  Yeah. I remember
*  thinking about writing and getting some News
*  Radio scripts from my agent.
*  They were so
*  funny. They're brilliant. Paul Sims is a
*  legitimate genius. They were tight.
*  But what a cool thing to be in
*  that kind of environment because a lot of times
*  you end up playing like a dad
*  or something and it's like
*  you had your brothers
*  your comedic brothers around you.
*  That's like a pirate ship. It was like punk
*  rock a little bit. We were doing
*  the show but we knew that we were the underdogs.
*  We never had a good time slot.
*  We only had a good time slot once. They put us on
*  like after Friends once
*  and we were like number three. We were like holy shit.
*  We realized that's what it takes. You have to be
*  on after a really good show. How long is it on?
*  We were on for five years
*  but the last year was the year that
*  after Phil was murdered.
*  So the last year was with John
*  Lovitz. He took over the
*  Hartman spot and he was a really
*  good friend of Phil's. He
*  had done an episode before and so
*  he would probably be the only
*  guy that we would have embraced
*  to do that because it was just like he
*  sort of fit that groove.
*  The toughest.
*  He's so funny. He's such a funny cat.
*  That was the only year that we thought
*  that it was going to come back.
*  Every year we thought it was going to be canceled.
*  First year, this is not going to make it.
*  We're not a rating suck and we made it back.
*  Then the fifth year, we were like, well we're doing pretty
*  good. Canceled.
*  They pulled the plug on it.
*  What people decide to cancel and
*  don't decide to cancel, unless you're a giant
*  hit, unless you're like
*  the
*  modern family or something like that, you really never know.
*  You don't know. That's a fucking
*  great show, Modern Family. I never
*  watched it. But my whole family
*  got into it during the lockdown.
*  God, that's a good show.
*  So well
*  written. So well
*  acted. Amazing.
*  I auditioned for
*  a role in it.
*  It was kind of
*  okay.
*  What's his name?
*  The husband.
*  I'm spacing on his name.
*  But it's one of those where you audition for
*  something and then you watch somebody who got the
*  role and you're like, oh yeah.
*  Yeah, he's better than me.
*  Good move. I love Ed O'Neill
*  too. He's great in everything.
*  I mean, to have
*  that character, to have those two great
*  characters married with children and then
*  this. I know. So good.
*  Everyone on that is solid.
*  And the storylines are so good.
*  It's so good. It's just such a well
*  made show. And the fact that it's done
*  that way and that funny with no audience is
*  incredible. I know. You know? It's all
*  singing camera.
*  That means that there's people that are really fun
*  that know funny. Yeah. Right? Because you
*  can get in that situation and have somebody
*  who, yeah, it's funny enough.
*  Right. They don't have that level
*  of what they know is funny.
*  Do you ever watch Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt?
*  No. One of the funniest shows
*  on TV. Really? Amazing.
*  So good. Tina Fey's. Yep.
*  Tina Fey's show. It's on Netflix. I forget who the girl
*  is. The redheaded girl.
*  The girl who plays Kimmy Schmidt.
*  And Titus Andromedus.
*  The gay guy. He's great. Fucking
*  amazing. He's a force. He's so good.
*  He's a force. It's a hilarious show, man.
*  And it's a crazy show. It's about a girl
*  who gets kidnapped, run into a
*  sex cult and locked into a bunker
*  for 15 years. So she gets
*  released and she has no idea how the world
*  works. But she's super innocent but really
*  positive. It's fucking great.
*  It's a really good show, man.
*  I love those characters. What about
*  Ted Lasso? You've seen that one now? What's that?
*  That's, um,
*  what's his name? Jason
*  Sudeikis. No, I don't know what that is.
*  It's on, I think on Apple.
*  So
*  similar character. It's a new one of those Apple
*  only shows? Yeah, yeah. Those are weird.
*  Like, who's watching those? I don't know.
*  This one seems like it's catching. This one seems
*  like, yeah. And the same kind of character.
*  He's just wide-eyed and super
*  optimistic football coach that comes
*  to England to coach soccer.
*  That's a good premise.
*  And he's so positive. He's just really
*  just, you can't break
*  this guy. And it's almost
*  like a dumb optimism. It's great.
*  He's so good in it. Everyone on it is
*  great. There's too much good stuff to watch right now.
*  I know. Oh, you know what I did want to
*  talk to you about? Yeah. I watched The Social
*  Dilemma. Oh, geez.
*  Dude.
*  You know. That's a must-see,
*  kids. I heard it's depressing.
*  Oh, so is real life.
*  Real life's depressing, Tom.
*  Listen to you. Everything's gonna be
*  fine. Wear a mask.
*  I live in communist Russia.
*  Wear a mask. Trust me.
*  Gavin Newsom's penis tastes delicious.
*  We're all gonna be fine.
*  We are gonna be fine.
*  You think we exist on this plane and this
*  plane only. Ooh, that's heavy.
*  No. No, because I've done a lot of drugs.
*  I think there's probably something else.
*  You've seen. I think there's something.
*  I think there's something else out there, but just
*  inaccessible right now. Yeah. But this Social
*  Dilemma makes me
*  very concerned about the future.
*  Because all of these technologists
*  and all these people that have invented all
*  this stuff that now are
*  very unhappy. Yeah. It's really fascinating
*  to see them discussing
*  their own creations and see outsiders
*  who are also technologists who didn't
*  invent these things but are seeing the patterns
*  in these things and understand it from
*  a really educated
*  perspective. They're
*  saying this could lead to civil war. People are
*  getting more and more divided and it shows in the
*  film how social media
*  has made people far more polarized,
*  far more divided than ever
*  before. The red and the blue and
*  the this. Sure. It's like
*  it's disturbing. What's the most dangerous
*  part of it and can it be corrected?
*  Well, there's a lot of
*  dangerous parts about it, but the thought
*  bubbles, the fact that these
*  people get in these bubbles
*  of thought where everybody around you
*  thinks your way and everybody who thinks a different
*  way is the enemy. Yeah. This is
*  a really dangerous
*  part of the reality that we live in today
*  because it's not what
*  we anticipated. I thought
*  that the internet and the age
*  of information and all that we're experiencing right
*  now would bring about an understanding
*  in a nuanced perspective.
*  Yeah. In life in all ways. You'd be able
*  to see things from other people's perspectives more
*  easily because it'd be more
*  readily available and it would be
*  more encouraged for you to seek out
*  all this information. But
*  a bunch of factors
*  that happen at the same
*  time all have
*  sort of made it worse than ever
*  before. And one of them is Trump.
*  Trump being such a polarizing
*  figure and whether or not
*  you know,
*  whether or not it's justified and how much of it's justified
*  and how much of it is liberal
*  propaganda and how much of it is Republican
*  propaganda. When you look
*  at the way people feel about him
*  and the things they equate with him
*  like they equate white supremacy
*  and you know,
*  anti-immigrant mentality
*  and you know, xenophobia
*  and all these different
*  things they think and a lack of
*  empathy which is probably accurate
*  right? If there's anything, if you could say anything
*  about Trump, one of the things you would say that's negative
*  is he seems to not be
*  empathetic. He doesn't seem
*  to care about other people the way
*  you would want a leader to care about people.
*  You don't buy it.
*  Even when people die,
*  like when John McCain died, he
*  still never had any empathy for the guy.
*  And you know, it's just
*  there's so many
*  in this so it's so easy
*  to look at him and even though
*  in his mind he's got to be
*  a tough guy, if people come at him he's going to come back
*  at them but this is like sort of the
*  mentality that someone takes if you're battling
*  trolls online.
*  You don't understand like you
*  as the president, you're supposed to
*  you're in this rare position. You can't be
*  responding to individuals
*  because you're too big. You
*  represent a different thing. You're not Donald
*  Trump anymore. You're Donald Trump
*  who is also the president of
*  the United States. And if you don't adjust
*  the way you communicate with
*  people and bring people together
*  and one of the things that Obama
*  did brilliantly was
*  he made you feel like
*  America was
*  something you could be proud of
*  because that guy is representing you.
*  This really articulate
*  super smooth
*  statesman who seemed
*  elegant and he seemed
*  like composed and
*  when he would speak, regardless
*  of his policies, you know, regardless
*  of the criticism you might have of his
*  administration, the way he
*  handled the role of president
*  perfect.
*  A plus. A plus.
*  A plus. No
*  pettiness. No, I mean
*  I think he called Kanye jackass once. That's about it.
*  Well it might have led to Kanye
*  wanting to be president. He might have
*  fucking made Trump be president.
*  That White House Correspondence
*  dinner where he shit on Trump and you see
*  Trump going there.
*  You think you'll never be? Which is the president of the United States.
*  Everyone's laughing and he's just
*  glaring up at the dais.
*  No, that was a moment. That psychopath
*  took you up on that little challenge.
*  But you take someone that has lack of empathy
*  and doesn't really see
*  the responsibility of the office and
*  what he says and you combine
*  that with that technology
*  that's a dangerous
*  combination.
*  You're asking a guy to change
*  who he is at 73.
*  Right. Right. Or 72
*  whatever he was when he got in. 71?
*  I think he was 71.
*  You're asking a guy in his 70s to change
*  who he is and the thing that
*  made him successful, the reason why
*  he was in all these rap songs
*  like if you go back and listen to rap music in the 80s
*  and 90s, Trump's name was throwing up
*  all the time. He was that guy.
*  He was that guy with the big gold letters on his
*  fucking building. Yeah and fighting with Rosie
*  O'Donnell. Yes. You're calling her a pig.
*  All that stuff.
*  Well that was okay
*  back then for some reason. He would
*  call her terrible names on the Conan O'Brien
*  show or whatever
*  television celebrity.
*  But he was famous for being that guy.
*  So that guy became president
*  and there's always
*  a polarization. There's always
*  a group of people that hate
*  the president because they didn't vote for him and they
*  want him to fuck up and they want him to fail and they want
*  everything that he's doing to be wrong.
*  Do you remember when they got mad at Obama for wearing
*  a tan suit?
*  It was horrible. Yeah. It was like his
*  greatest violation of the office.
*  They made a big deal about it. Or when he fist bumped his wife.
*  Like the outrage.
*  Why do you fucking care
*  about this? I know. It's got a nice
*  suit on. It looks good. Exactly.
*  Look good in that suit.
*  So there's that, right? There's Trump
*  as a figurehead which accelerates everything.
*  He's gasoline on an already raging
*  wildfire. He loves keeping the
*  temperature at maximum.
*  He wants everything at a hot boil.
*  And you really feel it.
*  You know that that's the thing of that office.
*  He could calm this situation
*  down. He could make you all
*  relaxed. I think he knows how to do it.
*  He likes it. And he exists.
*  He's like the only one who's comfortable.
*  Like you ever go out with a girl
*  who loves to fight? Yeah.
*  And just ahh. She's only comfortable
*  because that's the way she was raised. And they get mad if you don't want to
*  fight back. Yes. That's him.
*  That's him. He wants to fight.
*  He'll bring shit up until you take
*  the bait and there's a fight on.
*  And then they calm down and you're
*  having a nervous breakdown. So it's not all his
*  fault though. There's social media
*  and the divide that comes
*  and this is where the social dilemma comes
*  in place. There's a divide that
*  comes about because of the way
*  they've engineered these algorithms
*  which is really disturbing. So
*  whatever you're into, it finds
*  those things and accentuates
*  them because it just wants you to stay on
*  more. It wants you to engage more.
*  It wants you to pay attention to
*  the things. Now Ari Shafir
*  did a little bit of a study on this.
*  A little bit of a test.
*  And he only YouTubed puppies.
*  That's all he would
*  YouTube. Just YouTube puppies.
*  Just to see what happened. And all
*  YouTube would
*  send him is puppies.
*  All they would show
*  him, all they would suggest is puppies.
*  So this idea that they're engineering
*  outrage is a little
*  disingenuous because what they're really
*  doing is finding what
*  you're interested in. And people
*  have been shown to pay attention
*  to what they disagree with far
*  more than what they agree
*  with. So that's how you... The algorithm
*  spits you things that you disagree with more.
*  Exactly because you get engaged
*  with that and you get angry.
*  Which is, that was a part of the movie.
*  It was showing how things that people
*  disagree with, things that make people upset.
*  Those are the things that people
*  are much more likely to engage
*  with. And you're like, fuck you fucking liberals
*  or fuck you you fucking racist.
*  Everyone's racist.
*  It's this thing that
*  is a part of being a person.
*  Where you see, especially when you don't
*  feel like you're really
*  you're being heard. When you're at home
*  and you're sitting on the toilet and you're
*  going through Facebook and you see some shit
*  about, what the fuck, burn the flag.
*  You motherfuckers. And you start
*  making these messages that you're more
*  likely to do that than
*  seeing some beautiful story
*  about these parents that adopt this kid
*  and they give him a home and he
*  comes from a bad part of the world. Like that.
*  You're not going to go, way
*  to go for you. Let me write down all the
*  amazing things about what you're doing.
*  Is that terrible? Yeah, you're going to get mad.
*  Or if you're on the left, you're going to get
*  mad because of the wildfires. You're going to blame them on
*  Trump and climate change. Right. All these
*  different things. Yeah. You know, like look.
*  Gets your outrage going. Yeah, I mean, so many people
*  think Trump's responsible for the wildfires.
*  Listen, folks, those fucking
*  fires were going to happen
*  regardless of who is president.
*  Now, whether or not he is putting in
*  policies that's going to protect people 10, 20
*  years from now, that's a real argument.
*  But the fucking fires that are
*  going on right now are not because of Trump.
*  It takes a long time to turn that
*  battleship. Absolutely.
*  It's not his fault. And I'm not saying he's
*  done good things for the environment.
*  That's not what I'm saying. He's not plotting a future
*  that you think will help
*  out these fires in the future. Right. You do
*  have to take into consideration.
*  Here's the thing. Everybody's applauding Newsom
*  for saying that they're going to
*  eliminate these gasoline
*  powered cars by 2035.
*  Finally! You can't. But here's the
*  thing, because you and I both have Teslas.
*  But here's the thing.
*  Those batteries don't come free.
*  You have to get lithium out of the ground.
*  I mean, they're fucking literally
*  staging military coups.
*  There was a story about
*  see, there was a
*  thing, there was a controversy
*  because Elon Musk made a tweet.
*  And I think the tweet was something
*  will coup whoever we want to
*  or something crazy. He was just responding
*  to someone. I think he was
*  just like being joking around about it.
*  But people were saying,
*  here it is, we will coup
*  whoever we want, Elon Musk, in the overthrow
*  of democracy in Bolivia.
*  You probably shouldn't say that, Elon.
*  He was probably joking around.
*  But the idea is that lithium,
*  which is a primary
*  component of these batteries,
*  you're going to need a massive
*  amount of that shit.
*  And that shit is called conflict minerals.
*  Conflict minerals,
*  one of the reasons why they call them that is because these fucking
*  minerals are in the Congo,
*  they're in Afghanistan,
*  they're in all these places that
*  are, you know,
*  there's a lot of people vying for them, like
*  China's trying to get into the Congo.
*  Yeah, it's a little
*  sketchier than diamonds. You're going to need a whole
*  lot more of it. And
*  you need it to get batteries. It's not like
*  it's a free ride to get batteries.
*  Yeah, but, you know,
*  so you lose democracy in Bolivia,
*  at least there's no more fires.
*  At least the air's better.
*  Everything's a little evil.
*  I don't think it works that way.
*  I think we gotta figure out how to suck carbon out of the air.
*  They have figured that out.
*  There's like small scale
*  versions of these things that look like,
*  it looks like an air cleaner that's the size of a skyscraper.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Yeah, they've talked about implementing these things to actually
*  extract carbon from the atmosphere.
*  What about that soil documentary?
*  Did you see that one where they, it's all about the soil?
*  That's fucking terrifying.
*  Like sucking, like if you heal the soil,
*  you'll heal the earth?
*  Well, regenerative
*  farming is the best way to heal
*  the soil. And there are some people that are experts
*  on regenerative farming.
*  And regenerative farming is essentially what they're doing
*  is farming the way
*  they farmed thousands of years
*  ago or hundreds of years ago. The way you're supposed to
*  like ruminants, animals
*  eat grass, they shit, the
*  manure actually brings
*  these nutrients
*  back into the earth and that acts as
*  fertilizer for new plants
*  to grow. And you rotate the crops.
*  And it's supposed to have a carbon neutral
*  effect when it's done correctly.
*  The problem is, we've adapted to
*  this world where you want to pull in a jack in the box
*  and get a cheeseburger in five seconds.
*  And that has got to be cheap meat. And cheap
*  meat comes from factory farming. And factory farming
*  is universally regarded as fucking
*  disgusting. Horrible.
*  So that way you've got trucks
*  and you've got all this fucking, these animals
*  and they're eating terrible food.
*  It's all gross.
*  Like from top to bottom it's gross.
*  Horrible. Horrible. And there's a, it's a new
*  documentary on Netflix. I forget the name of it.
*  What do you have? Kiss the Ground.
*  Kiss the Ground. Really good.
*  Because it's kind of one of those that actually
*  gives you some hope. You're like, well this isn't
*  that complex of a solution
*  that could actually change things. What is their solution?
*  What are they trying to do? They're trying to
*  regenerative farming? Yeah. Exactly.
*  The thing about regenerative farming though is I don't
*  know if it will work at scale.
*  Like we had Joel Salatin on
*  a few, well we've had him on twice
*  but we had him on a few months back. And
*  there's a guy who doesn't go fuck about coronavirus by the way.
*  Oh really? Older fella, farmer,
*  healthy as, just
*  healthy as an ox, drinks out of
*  the trough where the cows drink.
*  Because he says he gets that biome
*  into his gut.
*  He wants that. He wants all the
*  bacteria. Really? Yeah.
*  Doesn't wash his hands. Doesn't get
*  sick. That's why I feel comedians
*  have kind of been strong because
*  traveling or in front of all these people you're holding
*  mics that other grubby comedians
*  are holding. Well that's the argument about prisoners.
*  Most prisoners are asymptomatic
*  from coronavirus which is fascinating.
*  Yeah. Because they're just
*  surrounded by germs all the time. Yeah you
*  would think they're so stressed out. Like here
*  they are in fucking jail that's about
*  as stressful as life gets. Oh god. But
*  everyone's coughing in everybody's mouth
*  and they're fine. But yeah
*  I know your immune system, you know, it gets
*  ramped up and it goes to work. By the way what's going
*  on with Harvey Weinstein? He's fat and
*  old and he got coronavirus when he
*  was in jail. Yeah. Nobody heard a
*  peep out of that guy. Yeah. Because he's
*  probably in a house in the hampton.
*  You never heard about that guy right? You don't hear
*  about him at all anymore right? No.
*  He's the one that started it all.
*  There's a rapper who just got sent back to
*  jail for social distancing violation.
*  How about that?
*  Sent back to jail? Sent back to
*  jail. Yeah. He's
*  shot at Chief Keef.
*  You know that... You can't be shooting
*  him. That's what I say.
*  He shot at him though. He didn't
*  shoot him. They sent him to jail
*  and then they released him because of the coronavirus.
*  And they got pictures
*  of him at a party. Having a good old
*  time. And there's like oh he's
*  social distance violating
*  so they put him back in jail.
*  What a dummy. You imagine that? I didn't know
*  you can go back to jail for violating
*  social distancing rules.
*  Well this seems like a special case.
*  Perhaps.
*  I know right? If you get out of jail for
*  shooting at somebody because you might get a cold.
*  I mean he's a young guy too.
*  He'll probably shake it off like that.
*  Exactly. Just play by the rules. Just turn
*  it down a notch. If I was his lawyer I'd be like
*  bro. Stay inside. Listen to me.
*  I know you like partying but do you have a
*  mask? Yeah.
*  Wear a mask when you party.
*  Like a Halloween mask.
*  They were saying that. Yeah right exactly.
*  Just put on a big thing. Yeah just pretend
*  you're someone else. Yeah this is the dude.
*  Takeshi69 ex associate
*  Kuda B. I like that name.
*  Headed back to prison for party stunt.
*  Well they're calling it party stunt. They were calling it
*  social distance violation.
*  He hasn't even been sentenced yet apparently
*  so he might have got out early while
*  he was being held. Caught on tape
*  partying with a large group of people
*  in a Brooklyn apartment soon after his April release.
*  Manhattan federal
*  judge called the decision
*  to have a party after receiving social
*  distancing orders
*  an astonishing stunt.
*  And he ordered
*  Kuda to surrender
*  to US marshals no later than
*  2pm October 15th. So he's got
*  some days to party. So it's only the sixth.
*  Homeboy's got nine days to fucking
*  have a good old time. Geez.
*  Maybe we need face tattoos.
*  Why?
*  To help all the cool kids got them. No we're too
*  old dude. If you get a face tattoo in your
*  R age people frown upon that.
*  Yeah they think you're suicidal. You're losing your mind.
*  Maybe you get a nice little star on your
*  cheek. Just a little tiny one.
*  Why not man?
*  Like the NBC thing the more you know.
*  What if you got your lips done?
*  Just real subtle.
*  You came in and your lips were darker.
*  I'd be like what's going on with your lips Tom?
*  What? I don't know.
*  They were always this way. Like all of a sudden your lips
*  are dark.
*  I don't know if you caught what he was in jail for
*  by the way. Shot at Chief Keef.
*  He paid someone to.
*  Wait wait. According to McKenzie's
*  confession Takeshi 69 paid
*  that guy to shoot at Chief Keef.
*  Supposedly
*  in an attempt to scare the rival rather
*  than seriously injure him instead
*  Kuda opted to outsource the shooting to
*  someone else but still pled guilty
*  to assault with a dangerous weapon
*  in aid of racketeering. Which is
*  a maximum prison sentence of 20 years.
*  He's only 22 years old but
*  likely to spend the next couple of decades behind bars.
*  Whoa. So they're kind of gang
*  are they gang related?
*  He has not yet been sentenced
*  so he was being held with a bunch
*  of other people who were like backed up in the court system.
*  Oh so they let him out just
*  on bail.
*  Maybe he wasn't granted bail or something.
*  So they're like well now you're not out on bail.
*  You violate it.
*  He's going to jail for a long fucking time.
*  I hope he got another face tattoo before he went in.
*  He should have got a raft and gone to Cuba.
*  Would you escape like if you had to go on the run
*  or okay you get busted for something.
*  Maybe you didn't do it but the fuzz
*  is coming for you. Would it be
*  possible to escape the
*  law for the rest of your life nowadays?
*  I was talking to a man who
*  knows things. And he
*  was telling me that there is technology
*  that they're working on that's going to let them hear
*  fully clear
*  completely crystal clear
*  conversations from satellites.
*  Uh huh. You mean
*  person to person conversation? I mean you
*  in your house having a conversation
*  with your wife. They're going to be able to hear you
*  from a satellite. They're just
*  tuning into your house. They're going to be so bored.
*  I'm sure they will be.
*  But not if they tune into Chief Keefe's house.
*  They're going to find some crazy shit
*  going on. But these
*  Really? Yes. Yes. I don't think anybody's
*  So like with GPS they can pinpoint a house
*  and listen to that conversation. No one's hiding.
*  That's my point. Right. Like
*  they're closing in on everything. And you're going to get
*  to the point where there's not going to be
*  there's no hiding. It's like that Tom Cruise
*  movie. Minority Report? Yeah.
*  Yeah. Right?
*  When I saw that movie it was like oh yes this is all
*  definitely coming. Like yeah. Right?
*  They were trading eyeballs because
*  That was like a future crime.
*  Right? They could catch you before you did something.
*  Right. Right. Right. Before you did something.
*  That's coming. Well if you really believe
*  in determinism. You know
*  you really if you could get a computer
*  you could devise a computer that's
*  so powerful that it could accurately
*  anticipate individual
*  events. Criss-crossing
*  and compiling together to create
*  a specific result. And you knew
*  they would force someone's hand to do something.
*  I mean
*  it's not completely
*  outside of the realm of possibility
*  that one day at least
*  they could figure like they could
*  figure out a likelihood
*  of things happening. Right.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  And then where are you going to run? Bolivia?
*  You ain't going anywhere bro. Come on.
*  You get hot sometimes. Just keep walking
*  into the ocean until you stop breathing.
*  I don't want to go to jail.
*  Like what was it when you
*  ran on the mafia and you got to go into a house in
*  Arizona? They did that for a while.
*  Was it relocation or? Yeah.
*  Witness relocation. Yeah. Witness protection.
*  Yeah. Witness protection. Right.
*  That worked right? We showed Sammy the Bold
*  Gravano did that. He's got a podcast now.
*  I don't think
*  you're supposed to do that. Yeah. He's third
*  next to Hillary Clinton. She's to
*  Michelle Obama's number one.
*  Number one what?
*  We just brought it up.
*  He should be on a podcast.
*  No. Witness protection you would think. But he
*  like Takeshi Six and I just said he's like
*  I'm coming out. He ratted on people.
*  Yeah. But what is he doing? Is he
*  in witness protection
*  at all? Nope. No. He's out in New York
*  making music videos. Passing like he's
*  literally on the street corner passing out
*  his CDs with I guess he just
*  How come nobody has killed him? He hustles. I'll give him
*  that. But he's had to move
*  his spot. He's had houses
*  where he got ratted on.
*  Sure. Of course he's going to rat on him.
*  He's a rat. You're a rat.
*  I don't know. Very popular. Yeah but how long
*  before he runs out of money? Like it costs
*  a lot of money to have that kind of security. Keep making
*  it. Yeah.
*  Keep coming up with some new beats.
*  Yeah. If you're going to get a face
*  tattoo what kind of tattoo would you get?
*  If I was to get a face tattoo
*  I would get
*  I don't know. A little booger
*  right underneath my nose. Be serious.
*  Maybe a tattooed tear. Scare everybody off.
*  Pretend you killed people in prison. Yeah. Let people think I killed
*  people. No. Then gang members would be like
*  no you didn't and they'd come get me. That's
*  true. Good call. You don't want troubles.
*  Maybe. You don't want to cause trouble. Yeah.
*  I'm telling. A little star on your cheek. I like the star.
*  Right here. Right in the upper cheek bone area.
*  Just a little tiny star. What did Papa
*  do? Just answer questions too. He is a
*  Convicted rapist. Harvey Weinstein to face
*  new sex crimes charges. Oh boy.
*  11 counts in California.
*  This is new news. 11 counts
*  of sexual assault in the state of
*  California where extradition proceedings
*  have been put on hold due to the pandemic.
*  11 counts.
*  So I got 3 more counts I guess I added to it.
*  3 more counts of rape and other
*  sexual crimes involving 2 women.
*  He's already serving 23 years.
*  And he's got to put a suit on and go
*  defend himself more?
*  Do you think if he left a gun in his
*  cell he would just blow his brains out?
*  Cause he doesn't think he's getting out
*  at this point. These charges keep piling up.
*  God.
*  Is he in jail jail?
*  Oh he's in Rikers bro. He's in Rikers?
*  Yeah. Yeah. He got COVID
*  when he was in jail. And they didn't
*  send him home to get healthy?
*  No. He's not at Rikers but he is
*  in jail somewhere. Wasn't he in Rikers though?
*  At one point? Maybe before he got
*  sent to the Wendy Correctional
*  Facility, Max Security.
*  God.
*  Man oh man.
*  And Cosby's in jail.
*  You ever remind yourself of that
*  as you're going about through your day?
*  Bill Cosby.
*  He's only in jail for a short amount of time.
*  Is he? Yeah.
*  Which is interesting. He's only in jail for
*  I believe he's in jail
*  for one of those
*  things that he did.
*  I believe. For a short
*  amount of time. I don't think he's in jail
*  for very long. I think he's in jail for like 10 years
*  or something. Is that what it is?
*  It says 3-10 in state prison. 3-10.
*  So he could get out on parole and
*  still be alive. But he's like
*  blind too. Next year would be parole.
*  He was in jail September 25th, 2018.
*  Still won't admit he did anything.
*  God. Hold strong.
*  Yeah. He seems insane.
*  He seems completely insane. Like he was
*  out at a barber shop before
*  they put him in.
*  And I don't know if he was on
*  parole or on appeal or
*  he was at a barber shop
*  with these guys and they made a video
*  of it. It's so strange.
*  Why? Because he's acting as if
*  nothing happened. Bill Cosby
*  interviewed. He expects to serve full 10 year
*  sentence rather than say sorry.
*  Wow.
*  Geez.
*  So he's just at the barber shop like
*  acting like he wasn't going? He was holding
*  court. That's what he does.
*  Holding court at a barber shop and they were
*  talking about bands.
*  Like what guy was in what band.
*  And they were talking
*  trivia and shit. He's probably doing the same thing in
*  jail. I wonder.
*  I bet he's
*  got a lot of fans in jail. I wonder how
*  he's treated there.
*  There he is. That's him at the barber shop.
*  Play some of that. Give me some volume.
*  The original.
*  So he's got that sweater on
*  that says hello friend. He's talking
*  jazz. Yeah.
*  That's Alonzo Brodin's older
*  brother.
*  Come on. Tell me that guy isn't Alonzo
*  Brodin's older brother.
*  Yeah.
*  Any money on you.
*  He's either
*  He wants to bet him.
*  Let's hear it for one kid
*  in the jail.
*  One kid in the jail.
*  He's holding court.
*  Talking about jazz musicians.
*  Who made this post?
*  Bill Cosby himself.
*  Bill Cosby hangs out to Marco's
*  hair artistry.
*  And they have to put in quotes barber shop.
*  In brackets.
*  Yesterday
*  with friends. January 21st
*  2018.
*  Look at his hashtags. Go Eagles.
*  Philadelphia.
*  That's crazy. That's weird.
*  Wow. God what a weird
*  story. Man oh man.
*  So he thinks that it was just
*  he was just
*  with some ladies.
*  That's his in his head.
*  Right?
*  Dude when I was on news radio we heard about
*  him. Yeah. We had heard about him
*  drugging people. You did? Yeah.
*  It was a rumor. It was always a rumor.
*  It was always a thing that people had heard.
*  They knew someone who knew someone.
*  They knew something. It was always out there.
*  So when Hannibal Burress was on stage and he was
*  talking about that. That was not
*  something that was unknown.
*  No I mean he said it on his set right? Just Google
*  it. Yeah. And then that's
*  what starts it all which is just bananas.
*  One set that someone films
*  on their phone. Yeah. Gets up on YouTube
*  and everyone is like wait what?
*  And everybody outside the industry
*  woke up. Goes
*  Cosby? Cosby? Bill
*  Cosby. Like the Cosby show.
*  Like America's dad. Right.
*  Like the Jell-O pudding guy. That guy.
*  The adorable guy.
*  Ugh. So awful.
*  I wish you could read a person's mind. 2014.
*  Yeah. When that happened. With Hannibal?
*  Yeah. Ooh.
*  I wish you could read a person's mind.
*  Yeah. Like I really want to know.
*  I want to know. Sounds like those satellites
*  are going to do it. They're going to hear your mind.
*  They're going to hear your words. Yeah.
*  But I don't think we're too many decades away
*  from being able to actually read your mind. You think?
*  Someone was convicted of a crime
*  in India back
*  in the day. We covered this when I did that
*  Joe Rogan Questions Everything show
*  because of FMRI.
*  FMRI is functional magnetic imagery.
*  I think that's the right
*  terms. But basically
*  it's reading the mind
*  and reading like patterns
*  and they
*  decided that this person
*  I think it might have been a woman
*  was convicted
*  of a crime because they had functional
*  knowledge of the crime scene.
*  Now this was
*  in another country. I believe it was in India.
*  And I talked to a neuroscientist
*  in America and they said
*  you would never accept
*  this in America because
*  functional knowledge of a crime scene
*  could be obtained by just examining
*  evidence. Like if you were charged
*  if someone charged you with a murder, said Tom
*  I know you killed that guy and you're like what?
*  And then they show you the photos.
*  You would have access to the information.
*  And if you had that in your head like thinking
*  oh my god someone killed this person
*  and now they're blaming it on me. How could they think
*  I did it? And you could possibly
*  have functional knowledge of
*  where it happened and what happened
*  just based on someone describing to you what you've been charged with.
*  How do you find out if someone has
*  functional knowledge? They don't really know.
*  This like in Italy
*  people were charged
*  that were seismologists
*  because they didn't warn
*  people in time for an earthquake
*  that took place.
*  Right. Yeah because
*  they're Italians.
*  The fucking
*  hey! They don't know. They don't know no better.
*  So they charged people
*  now in America you could never charge
*  a seismologist. I believe that's true.
*  See if that's true. If that was in Italy.
*  I'm asking you to google a lot of shit that
*  may or may not be real. It seems like
*  so like early
*  like other century like she's a witch!
*  It does seem like that. That's why it rains!
*  She's a witch!
*  Actual you know seismologists
*  and scientists all over the world were aghast
*  because like you can't
*  fucking charge people
*  with not warning you about something that's
*  utterly unpredictable.
*  Italian seismologists cleared of manslaughter.
*  Okay so they were charged. They came to their senses.
*  Six scientists did not cause
*  deaths in 2009. But what's crazy
*  is that that actually went to court.
*  So these poor guys had to defend themselves in court
*  that they should
*  have known that this earthquake was coming.
*  This is how dumb. That is old world isn't it?
*  That's very old world. Hey! I'm eating
*  my spaghetti and my fucking air starts moving!
*  That guy's got a Geiger counter! How much I pay that guy?
*  How much I pay him?
*  Who's the guy with the Geiger counter?
*  Get him! How come he don't know?
*  We're both Italian. We can get away with talking like this.
*  He should have told me.
*  Do you know I look like a
*  famous
*  Italian film star?
*  Who? Carlo Verdoni.
*  How much do you look like him?
*  I got into a taxi cab in Rome
*  and this kid
*  fell out. It was like 22
*  year old kid was just like
*  Verdoni's in my cab!
*  Verdoni's in my cab!
*  And he called his family. Oh my
*  God. He made me get on the phone with him.
*  Oh my God. That's pretty
*  close right? What do you think?
*  I think it's insulting. You should be mad.
*  That guy looks like he's 10 years
*  old and he's going to die tomorrow.
*  He is older. But he's like
*  He's a fucking Verdoni!
*  He's one of the comedic actors.
*  Make that face.
*  Oh!
*  What's in the bowl
*  bitch?
*  That one's pretty
*  close. That's pretty close.
*  Give me a smile with your lips closed.
*  Oh wow.
*  Is it close? Very.
*  This kid lost his mind.
*  He's like Verdoni's in my cab. It took me the whole ride
*  to convince him I wasn't Verdoni. If someone didn't have
*  a phone on them where they couldn't Google the
*  actual Verdoni. You could probably pull it off.
*  Right. Right. I bet.
*  I'm going to go find him.
*  I like that one with the pointing at you.
*  The glasses. Like he's a badass.
*  That's me in my sunglasses. That's you bro.
*  Carlo Verdoni!
*  Verdoni!
*  Carlo Verdoni!
*  That's you bro. I wish I spoke Italian.
*  Damn. Well you can learn. It's not that hard.
*  It's not like you want to breathe under water.
*  You lazy fuck. Jesus.
*  Get a nap.
*  I wish. I wish I could do something
*  that I don't do right now that other people do easily.
*  I just don't have the energy.
*  I don't think my brain can handle it. Do you think you can learn
*  a whole language right now? Of course I could.
*  No way. Of course I could.
*  I don't want to. But of course I could.
*  While you're living your life here. Not going over to Italy
*  and... Yes. You could.
*  It would just require a lot of time.
*  A lot of time. You would have to be a real reason for you to do it.
*  Right.
*  Look if I had a wife and she was Italian and she was talking a lot of shit.
*  You don't...
*  The way you said it though, you don't need to learn the whole language.
*  We don't know the whole English language.
*  We know a good portion of it.
*  And how to talk with it. But we don't know the whole thing.
*  Almost.
*  Talk with it.
*  Apparently Russian is a really hard one to learn.
*  I took that in
*  freshman year in college. It's not as hard as you think.
*  But what about the writing?
*  No. They just have a couple blocky letters.
*  But...
*  It's not as complicated.
*  Yeah?
*  Yeah. There's something about it that's...
*  They say that English is much harder than...
*  No shit. Russian. Yeah.
*  Learning it the other way is really a bitch.
*  That's interesting. So Russians have a hard time learning English.
*  English can learn Russian better.
*  Right. Right.
*  I only took it for a semester and the guy let you take the test
*  as many times as you needed to pass.
*  But... Really?
*  It wasn't that mind blowing. Yeah.
*  Really? I would think just the language itself,
*  the written language would be really hard.
*  It's fucking cool looking. Yeah. It is really cool.
*  My daughter
*  is studying Italian in college.
*  Yeah. And it's like
*  every day you have to take it
*  five days a week.
*  It's pretty immersive. Wow. That's how you learn it.
*  Yeah. That's the move, right? If you go to an immersion
*  school and you have to teach...
*  They teach every class in
*  the language. They don't speak any
*  English to you. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Or go live in Rome. Pretend you're
*  Verdoni. Fitzsimmons kids went to a Spanish
*  immersion school. Oh, yeah? Yeah.
*  And they learned it. Yeah.
*  You just learn. You speak Spanish every day.
*  You have to do it all the time. It's just that thing.
*  That's so funny.
*  I wish I could learn
*  something that other people know that I can learn.
*  It is
*  lazy. It's not lazy.
*  Well, listen. I'm busy.
*  You could do it. I have a lot of stuff going on.
*  It would require many hours a day,
*  many days in a row,
*  probably for years before you got adept
*  at it. Yeah.
*  It could be done. How long until I was
*  like a get-by
*  on a trip? I don't know.
*  I can't speak another language.
*  I have no idea.
*  There's those Rosetta Stone commercials.
*  They promise you could get fairly good
*  at it in like 90 days or something.
*  I think you have to put a lot of time into it.
*  It's like anything else.
*  But isn't there a thing with the brain
*  that if you learn it when you're
*  14, it's much easier than
*  when you're 50?
*  I think it's younger. I think it's really young.
*  When you're really young, kids
*  I mean, think about how quick kids
*  speak English.
*  My daughter, one of my daughters
*  was speaking really young.
*  She was at one year old. She was speaking in full
*  sentences. It was really weird.
*  She's really smart.
*  But at one year old, she would ask me questions.
*  Daddy, what is this? And why is that?
*  One.
*  Imagine you speaking full Italian in one year.
*  That would be crazy.
*  That would be crazy. Man, that would be fun though.
*  I just want to be able to handle myself in a restaurant.
*  Like really well.
*  Be able to talk about the wine.
*  Well, Google has
*  these earbuds that will
*  translate languages
*  in real time.
*  So with this Google app,
*  someone can talk to you
*  as long as they speak clearly,
*  clear enough for it to transcribe.
*  They will be able to say it back
*  to you in real time.
*  Will be able to or can't?
*  No, Ken, I'm pretty sure it's the
*  Pixel buds,
*  Pixel earbuds.
*  See if that's... That's pretty cool.
*  That's true.
*  It's interesting, right?
*  There's arguments for both Android
*  and Apple.
*  One of the arguments for Apple
*  or one of the arguments for Android rather,
*  here it is, right here it is,
*  in the earbud.
*  We can...
*  Oh, the phone takes it over for you.
*  Check this out.
*  Any thoughts?
*  It's pretty dope.
*  That's...
*  It's enough for you to make a drug transaction.
*  I can't even get a...
*  Cocaine.
*  Cocaine.
*  There is not one time when I transcribe
*  just in my
*  English to my text where it
*  nails it.
*  Well, Google is better.
*  I use
*  my Apple... I have an Apple phone
*  and I have an Android phone. My Apple phone
*  is my primary phone.
*  I use my Android phone more to
*  fuck around with than anything, but I'm
*  fucking around with a few things on it. One of the things
*  is how well it picks up
*  your voice and how well it transcribes
*  it. Here's the argument.
*  Apple is much better with your
*  privacy. They're much better with your privacy
*  like when you use Apple Maps, it's not
*  sending your data to anyone.
*  But it's one of the reasons why Apple Maps
*  is not as good.
*  Google Maps are better.
*  Because they're sharing it. It's just better.
*  They're getting data constantly
*  from you. They're getting data from
*  all the other drivers. They're sharing
*  that data. They're compiling that data.
*  And they're also sending ads your way
*  to profit off of this to make it profitable.
*  So, because
*  of that, because Google
*  is just sucking up data
*  constantly, they can provide
*  you with better services.
*  So, they have an amazing search engine.
*  But that was one of the
*  things about the social dilemma. The search
*  engine gives different
*  results based on where you are.
*  Say if you type, they use an example, climate
*  change. If you write climate change is,
*  it might say a hoax.
*  Or climate change
*  is a terrible threat.
*  Depending on where you live.
*  Just where you are.
*  It might give you one thing, but if you live in Waco, Texas,
*  it might give you another thing.
*  And it's based on what it thinks you
*  want to see.
*  That's crazy. It's not good.
*  It's just reinforcing people's
*  dumb ideas. That's why I use DuckDuckGo.
*  DuckDuckGo does not do
*  any of that stuff.
*  It gives you things.
*  It doesn't send your data
*  somewhere. It protects your privacy.
*  So, you put climate change
*  is on DuckDuckGo. No, I put chicks with
*  dicks. And then no one knows.
*  I got a burner phone with DuckDuckGo on it.
*  You put
*  whatever you want.
*  The results are not curated.
*  So, it's just giving you
*  the most applicable results
*  for the things you're looking for.
*  But it's not doing it in a way where it's
*  curating it for your own interest. If you try to
*  find things that are controversial, and we've tried
*  to find that on the podcast before, where Jamie
*  will Google something, and I'll know
*  it to be correct.
*  But Google will not show that it's correct because
*  maybe the correct answer is not
*  politically correct.
*  So, you have to go through several
*  pages, and maybe you even have to Google it in a
*  very specific way to get to the heart
*  of the science behind what's
*  wrong with the consensus
*  opinion. The consensus opinion might be
*  wrong. That's the case with a lot of
*  nutrition things. It's the case with a lot of
*  things regarding
*  anything controversial.
*  Anything where there's a political
*  motive to sway
*  the argument one way or the other. It's so amazing
*  how deep you have to dive to
*  cross-reference stuff, to
*  really try and assemble a truthful
*  opinion. It's so
*  hard. So, with all this stuff,
*  and you have all these people
*  from Twitter and Google and stuff
*  who are saying what we did, or Facebook
*  was horrible, and we really
*  kind of F things up.
*  Do they feel like they can also
*  correct this problem?
*  I don't know if
*  you can put the cap
*  on the bottle. I don't know if you can
*  do that. I don't know if you can do that.
*  I don't know if they know it either, because
*  they didn't think it was going to happen in the first time.
*  Jack Dorsey was
*  testifying, I think it was before
*  Congress, and he
*  was saying that 12 years ago,
*  when we created Twitter, we had no idea
*  that this was going to be a
*  situation that we had to anticipate.
*  No one ever saw this coming. And if you
*  go back and see the early
*  Twitter, remember you would
*  do the at, it would always
*  show your name in front of every
*  tweet. So it would be like
*  at Tom Papa is having pizza.
*  You would say what you were doing. It was really weird
*  how people would use Twitter.
*  But it was
*  not political.
*  It was just fun.
*  No one knew what to do
*  with it. And then somewhere along the line
*  people started figuring out how to get into arguments.
*  I know, it's so bad.
*  We just always ruin everything.
*  It could be so great. I remember when it first
*  came out, it was like wow, there would probably
*  never have been slavery if there had been Twitter
*  because people would have exposed it so early
*  and it just seemed so hopeful.
*  But of course all the scummy
*  people get it and then just
*  ruin it.
*  It makes people scummy too. Because it makes
*  people more polarized. It makes
*  people more aggressive in
*  reinforcing their
*  idea what the truth is and
*  trying to stop other people. And you're seeing so
*  much suppression
*  of other people's
*  opinions and expression today. Which is
*  so strange. It's
*  one of the weirdest times ever
*  to look at the way human beings communicate.
*  Because of the tension, we were talking
*  about this earlier, we never really finished the thought.
*  But you got Trump,
*  then you got the pandemic, then you got the economic
*  collapse. You have all these things happening. So people
*  are desperate,
*  they're sad. And then you've got looting. And you've got
*  the riots. And you see you get racial tension.
*  You've got violence. You've got this anti-
*  police sentiment. Which also leads
*  to more instability in the streets.
*  More instability in the cities.
*  And less safety. And fear.
*  Fear of
*  fear of police.
*  Fear of gangs.
*  Fear of Antifa.
*  Fear of white supremacists.
*  Fear of everything. It's like all this fucking fear.
*  And then you have people
*  arguing online.
*  Really, literally,
*  addicted people. People who are
*  addicts. They're just as addicted
*  as people who are gambling addicts.
*  Just as addicted to people that are sex addicts.
*  They're addicted to Twitter.
*  And they're mentally ill people.
*  And they're constantly engaging
*  in conflict. Right. And they're coming
*  up on people's posts and you don't know that you're
*  interacting with mentally ill people.
*  Or people from other countries
*  that are trying to incite it. Assume
*  you're interacting with mentally
*  ill people. Because almost everyone
*  who's using it in that way is
*  in one way or another mentally ill.
*  Or you put
*  your phone in the drawer and
*  you go to the park and
*  all of a sudden everything calms down.
*  And then there's no cops because you want to defund the police.
*  Everything calms down and goes away.
*  Because you're not
*  living in this
*  weird reality. You're just
*  living in real life. And you're
*  not participating in all of that.
*  That's what we'd all hope for.
*  The problem is there's so many people
*  that are doing it. Whether they're doing it on Facebook
*  or Twitter or arguing.
*  Whatever things they're arguing about.
*  It's spilling out into the real world.
*  Right. You're in the park being all Zen
*  and all of a sudden a flash mob shows up that organized
*  on Twitter. And you're like, what the
*  hell is happening here? I was just
*  all Zen a minute ago. So one thing
*  that I wanted to bring up we talked about before the podcast.
*  That I actually read a whole article
*  about. We were talking about on the podcast
*  whether or not Chris Cuomo was
*  really lifting a 100 pound
*  barbell. Now
*  I had completely forgot we even
*  talked about this until I stumbled upon
*  an article online about it.
*  And in the article it actually referenced
*  us talking about it on the
*  podcast. Right. And
*  apparently he wasn't. They think I'm
*  quite stupid for believing
*  that Chris Cuomo really
*  had this
*  100 pound
*  dumbbell that he was lifting. It looked very
*  light. It did look very light.
*  So my thought was how big is
*  Chris Cuomo. Ah, that's a good
*  point. I thought he was bigger than he is.
*  So I googled it.
*  He's only 182 pounds.
*  Which says
*  he's 6'2", 182 pounds.
*  I don't know if that's accurate.
*  6'2", 180?
*  He doesn't look
*  that lean. Thin guy.
*  He doesn't look that lean. But anyway, that
*  makes him 20 pounds lighter than me.
*  So very unlikely
*  that he's carrying that dumbbell like
*  that. So then I'm like, okay, I
*  gotta ask some people who would actually
*  know. So
*  I sought out some people
*  online. And one of them was
*  Rob Kearney. He's been on
*  the podcast before. He's world's
*  strongest gay. Oh yeah,
*  I know that guy. He's awesome. I follow him. Love
*  that dude. And I think
*  he won recently
*  a pound for pound strongman
*  title. I believe it.
*  He's not a big guy. He's a tank.
*  But he's only about
*  5'10", maybe?
*  But fucking gorilla strong.
*  So
*  he says to me,
*  so I say to him, have you ever
*  seen the thing? And he says, I just watched
*  the video. I think it's fake.
*  LOL. He doesn't look
*  to be bracing hard enough for it to be
*  actually 100 pounds. Good point.
*  He is kind of wishy washy in his seat.
*  He's a real expert,
*  right? So he's an actual strongman.
*  So I'm pretty convinced.
*  So then I ask Robert
*  Oberst, who's also
*  Robert is fucking
*  enormous. Absolutely one of the strongest
*  men in the world. He's a
*  Goliath. You sit next to him.
*  300 plus pounds. So he
*  says, the picture looks possible because
*  his elbow's up and stable, but the
*  video where he's at his desk
*  showing the weight off, he moves
*  it around out at an
*  angle that would be the smallest
*  head of the top of the bicep
*  taking all the weight and it doesn't even
*  phase him. He said, if it's real,
*  he's stronger than anyone
*  I've ever seen use a dumbbell.
*  I'd say it's
*  a 40 pound weight with 100
*  pounds written on it.
*  He said lots of Insta-famous lifters
*  have fake dumbbells and plates.
*  Two experts, Rob Kearney
*  and Robert Oberst. Both of them
*  call bullshit. So I
*  refer to them.
*  Wow. It does when he's sitting in the chair
*  at the desk there. It looks very
*  light. When I saw he's 182 pounds,
*  that might not be true because I bet if you
*  Google what my weight is, they probably don't know what my weight
*  is either. 100 pounds is a lot.
*  But 182 pounds for a
*  man who's 6'2 is not a gorilla.
*  Like Brendan Schaub.
*  If Brendan Schaub was doing that, I'd go
*  I bet he could do that.
*  Brendan Schaub is
*  270 pounds, 260 plus pounds.
*  He's huge.
*  But even then, it
*  seems light. It seems like it
*  wiggles.
*  I obviously didn't look at it close enough.
*  I'm not a lifter in that
*  sense. I don't lift
*  heavy weights. The heaviest
*  shit I ever lift is I might squat
*  a couple of hundred pounds for reps.
*  But most of the shit I do is kettlebells.
*  So I'm doing like, the heaviest ones I do
*  are like 90 pounds.
*  And that's rare. Usually I use like
*  a 70 pound kettlebell or
*  50 pound kettlebell depending upon the exercise.
*  They're not heavy. I'm doing like
*  functional movements that use
*  your full body. So I'm not in that
*  lifting world. But if you wanted to talk to like
*  you'd have to talk to like
*  C.T. Fletcher. You'd have to talk to like those
*  powerlifter dudes who really understand.
*  Those are the ones that...
*  It's a little uncomfortable that I'm sitting right in front of you
*  and I'm not in the list of people that you're asking.
*  Because on my Peloton there are
*  three and a half pound weights that
*  sit on the back of the seat. And
*  once in a while you have to take those out and
*  curl them. Sometimes two in one hand
*  mind you. And it is
*  quite a workout.
*  Okay, so he's 200 pounds. He says he went from
*  218 pounds to a pretty lean 200
*  pounds. He cut out
*  so he cut out about bullshit.
*  Cut dairy and bad sugar
*  2014 cut back booze.
*  So he's 200 pounds.
*  His body fat plummeted to 12 percent.
*  Okay.
*  So he's basically... He's pretty dialed in on his stuff though.
*  Right. But he's taller
*  than me.
*  And he's
*  my weight. He's not...
*  There's no way he's handling that weight like that. I can't
*  handle that weight like that. Can we see
*  the video? I'm fucking jacked son.
*  Oh man I wish I didn't have my jacket on.
*  I would be showing you my biceps. Show me what's up.
*  Roy Jones Jr. flexed his arm
*  in that chair.
*  He has two of mine. Does he really?
*  On his left. It's crazy.
*  His left arm is so much bigger than his right.
*  Because he's got like probably one of the
*  best left hooks. Not probably. One of the
*  best left hooks a human being's ever thrown.
*  Oh my god. So his left bicep
*  is gigantic. It's so much
*  bigger than his right. He's joking around about it.
*  But when he flexed you're like Jesus!
*  Good lord. Just like
*  an alien head in there. Yeah, see
*  there it is.
*  He does have shoulders. Yeah.
*  Well that move. When he does that.
*  Well that's not, that's kind of braced.
*  That's a hundred pounds that's so
*  heavy. A hundred pounds is so
*  heavy. This is where I'm
*  less, go back to that.
*  When he's doing the little hammer curls
*  this is where I'm less likely to believe.
*  This one right here. When he's doing that.
*  He's not even straining.
*  There's no strain at all in his back.
*  Everything looks too light.
*  Yeah, it just doesn't.
*  Again, I don't know shit.
*  This is not my world.
*  I can show you a video of a guy
*  like Bradley Martin, a dude off YouTube.
*  Doing like 120 pound dumbbells.
*  He's struggling with those.
*  Right, of course.
*  And Bradley, he's a
*  giant. Who is?
*  Bradley Martin. Show Bradley Martin.
*  Bradley Martin takes girls, he puts
*  like weights on bars and then has girls
*  hang on the bars and he fucking
*  presses them. He's enormous.
*  He's a YouTube famous
*  lifter. But all
*  completely, look at this, he's cleaning and pressing
*  a girl.
*  But the dude is like
*  6'3", 6'4",
*  270, easy.
*  Enormous. He's a huge man.
*  He's a huge,
*  legitimately huge man.
*  So he's struggling.
*  There's a video of him on there with a hundred pound dumbbells.
*  Look at that one.
*  When he's doing deadlifts.
*  Look at the size of this motherfucker.
*  So much weight on the bar that the
*  you look at him and you go, oh, okay.
*  Oh, that shit's real as fuck.
*  As people always say, it's fake.
*  Look at the bar bending. This guy doesn't have to fake anything.
*  Listen, ain't no faking going on right there.
*  You look at the way that weight is moving.
*  When you see the size of him too,
*  it all makes sense.
*  But his tricep doesn't wiggle when he points at
*  something like Mike.
*  But it's nice that I could ask,
*  like, everybody's, you know, you wonder about
*  stuff like that. You look at him doing that, like,
*  is that real? And then you ask
*  experts and the experts are like, uh-uh.
*  That is pretty great. Like Oberst and Rob
*  Cairney, those motherfuckers know. Yeah.
*  That's pretty badass. But what
*  kind of a person would fake a weight?
*  Do you think people give him fake weights?
*  Imagine if they wanted you to look like a moron.
*  Like, hey, move this weight around.
*  What is that, a hundred pounds? You're like, hey, take a video of this.
*  Show everybody how strong I am. His assistant
*  was trying to get brownie points. Maybe he doesn't even know.
*  Maybe he doesn't know.
*  His assistants are just
*  doing it to make him feel good. There was a guy
*  who was, I don't know,
*  he was like a royal, some
*  royal guy or something.
*  But he would
*  play pool with guys.
*  And they would pay the guys to lose.
*  And so this guy would enter
*  into pool tournaments.
*  And he was
*  okay. He was a decent player, but
*  guys would like blow shots on purpose.
*  You could tell. Someone
*  had paid them off. He was just walking around thinking
*  Kim Jong-il. He thought he was the shit.
*  He's the world's greatest basketball
*  player.
*  It's so weird. But apparently,
*  this is one of the things that Rob Kearney
*  was telling me is that there is a whole culture,
*  I'll pull up the dude's name,
*  there's a whole culture of people online
*  who do this with fake
*  weights. And that's probably why
*  he was talking
*  about that. Right. Yeah.
*  Fake followers and fake weights.
*  People just trying to get some cred online.
*  This is the guy, Brad Castleberry.
*  I know who that, I follow him.
*  I know who he is. I've seen him get called out
*  for the fake weight thing. I don't know how high-rated he is.
*  Because he's a monster as well.
*  Right. Exactly. He's a monster
*  as well. He's a monster and he's still...
*  He's huge. But apparently...
*  Look at those legs. Yes. But apparently,
*  people have asked him to do...
*  Now this is according to my friends
*  in the powerlifting world.
*  Apparently, people have asked him
*  to show up at meets
*  and do this stuff. Why am I seeing his butt cheeks?
*  He's in his underpants. I'm not comfortable
*  with that. Why is he in his underpants?
*  So not necessary. So not necessary.
*  For him to show that while he's squatting.
*  World's strongest almost gay.
*  World's strongest curious.
*  Rob needs to show
*  the way. Rob's a married man. He's not interested in
*  your butt cheeks, sir. Put him back.
*  Put him away. But that's
*  a real problem in that world apparently.
*  It's like people fake weights.
*  Which is real weird. People are so shitty.
*  They fake everything. They fake how many
*  followers they have. They fake how much weights
*  they've got. This might be a video I think.
*  Yeah, I know someone who fakes followers. Scammer.
*  Yeah. This is him
*  lifting? I think so. How to spot
*  fake weights.
*  How can they spot it? What are they saying?
*  How do you know that's fake? I guess they're saying how he
*  held it. Which, I mean, maybe...
*  I don't know. I know the power
*  electors get deep into this too because of what
*  you're saying. So what do you think they do?
*  They put like one fake
*  one, one real one, one fake one,
*  one real one. Like stack them or something like that.
*  Right. They want some resistance.
*  And here's the other question. That looks like a public gym.
*  So how are you getting them fake weights
*  into that gym? You're not.
*  That's the thing. I followed him online for a while.
*  I've seen people call him out.
*  Who? For years. Brad Castleberry.
*  Because he's like, oh he's been at like
*  the 24 hour fitness. Like I see him bringing in
*  stacks of fake plates. Yeah.
*  Right. You just take a picture of him.
*  Yeah, exactly. That would spread.
*  It's just such a weird world.
*  The world of how much can you lift?
*  Yeah, well they're so into it. Right?
*  These guys aren't learning Italian. See that looks
*  real, man. Look at that bar bending.
*  That's fake. They're saying that's fake.
*  This video is about how
*  to spot it. So like we're not listening to what they're saying.
*  Right. They might be saying
*  that's legit. It's a weird...I don't know
*  how much I can lift. How about that?
*  Someone says how much do you bench? I don't bench.
*  I just say 250.
*  It's a good move.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't remember when I was...
*  That's why I wear the jacket. I don't want to intimidate people.
*  I don't want anybody to know.
*  Remember when you sent me a picture of a fat comedian
*  and you said don't end up like this?
*  No. Did I?
*  Did I do that? Yeah. How fat was he?
*  He was pretty porky. I won't name him.
*  I won't name him.
*  Did he have a shirt off on stage?
*  I must have been in a teetering
*  weight at the time.
*  Were we discussing weight loss? Is that what it was?
*  Maybe a little. I was trying to encourage you by fat shaming you.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, I'm sending you lean elk meat.
*  Listen, I have food for you
*  back in LA. I've got to get you in touch
*  with my security guy. He'll get you into the studio
*  and give you some elk meat.
*  It's the only meat I eat. Yeah, because I'm going to have to...
*  Well, I got one this year already.
*  I'm going to have to ship some of that meat back out here soon.
*  Oh, man. So get a cooler.
*  Do you have a freezer
*  at your house? No, I just have this
*  tiny fridge in the garage. Maybe I should
*  get a freezer. If you get a commercial freezer, I could
*  fill it. Really? Yeah.
*  I'm the only one that eats meat in my
*  house. Really? So sad.
*  It's me and the dog. That's why you're the man. That's right.
*  That's why you dominate.
*  Are they all tired and sleepy all the time? Yes, they're
*  anemic.
*  No joke. Really? Yes.
*  They won't eat meat?
*  And it's so like the...
*  No. Do they not
*  eat meat for health reasons? Because obviously that's not
*  working. Or is it a moral
*  thing? It was animal sympathy
*  empathy. Yeah, they just love
*  the animals. And my wife
*  taught my daughters the same. What happens
*  to elk if you don't eat them?
*  What happens to them? Yeah.
*  Wolves eat them. Bears eat them.
*  Oh, yeah, of course. Of course.
*  And it's funny because... What you're saying, they're
*  not opposed to... They're not opposed to the dog
*  eating meat.
*  Well, that's good. You don't want the dog to die.
*  Like they literally
*  ask, like, is there any meat around?
*  Because I'll make it and
*  I'll make a steak and then there's always some left over.
*  And she's
*  like encouraging it now because the dog
*  showed up in our life and
*  she eats meat. Dude, they go crazy.
*  You ever see feed your dog liver? That is one
*  of the best things. She feed your dog liver?
*  Oh, yeah. Oh my god.
*  Marshall, my dog Marshall, who you'll meet later
*  today, is the sweetest dog
*  the world's ever known. Loves everybody.
*  But the wolf in him comes out
*  when he smells liver. Oh, really?
*  He has this wild eyed look.
*  You feed him liver, he's like twitchy.
*  Like getting pieces of liver.
*  He's like... Because it's so packed with
*  iron and... It's something in his
*  DNA understands that liver
*  is like the number one thing. That's the
*  best thing to get. That's so great.
*  When the wolf kills an alpha,
*  the alpha eats the liver. Oh, really?
*  Yeah. It's the prize.
*  That's Marshall with a little bird.
*  I found him. He wasn't
*  paying attention. I was calling him and he wasn't paying attention.
*  And I see him staring out the window.
*  And there's a little bird that I
*  think the bird flew into
*  the window. Oh, it was her? Conked himself.
*  And so the bird is just sitting there
*  and Marshall is just tweaking hard.
*  Staring at this bird.
*  But he eventually, the little bird, he eventually
*  flew off. But Marshall
*  instinct man. My sister
*  has two dogs, two
*  hounds. And
*  she's had a chicken
*  coop forever. And
*  the chicken in there is like
*  12 years old.
*  An old chicken. That's old. Yeah.
*  And she still was producing eggs kind
*  of, you know, just part of the family in
*  a way. It's just been there forever.
*  And the dogs... And somehow
*  someone left something open and those
*  hounds ripped her apart. Yep.
*  Just lived with it.
*  Like for years.
*  No problem. No nothing. As soon as they had
*  the opportunity. They can't help themselves. They could not
*  help themselves. My dog Johnny
*  actually broke through the chicken coop.
*  He figured out a way to get inside the
*  chicken coop and he went on a rampage.
*  They killed like eight
*  or nine of them. I forget. Oh my God.
*  By the time I got to them, there's just bodies all
*  over the place. But I had, at that time,
*  I think I had 20 plus chickens.
*  So there were so many chickens for him to kill.
*  It took a while for me
*  to figure out what was going on. My wife screamed
*  out, why is Johnny in the chicken coop?
*  I'm like, fuck. And I ran
*  out there and grabbed him.
*  Or like, is it just a kill thing?
*  They don't. They just kill him. He's well fed.
*  That's what I thought. Yeah. Just for fun.
*  It was just for shits and giggles.
*  Yeah, just having a good time. Little rat terriers
*  killing the rats. But did I tell you the whole story
*  about him where he was talked
*  into killing chickens by a coyote?
*  Talked into it?
*  Yeah, man. They had to sit down in the bar?
*  There's a thing that happens
*  with coyotes that's really amazing.
*  They're clever.
*  They're clever in a very specific
*  way. This is what was happening.
*  My
*  chickens, when female
*  chickens don't have a rooster,
*  they lay eggs, but the eggs never
*  become baby chicks, right?
*  So this is what people don't know that
*  are vegetarians. Like, you can eat
*  eggs guilt free.
*  Because eggs will never
*  become a chicken. Right.
*  People want to look at it like you're
*  doing some harm to the chicken. Right.
*  But if you have pets, chickens
*  as pets, and you just let them free
*  range, they run around, they eat bugs,
*  they eat grass, they eat all these different things.
*  They give you these incredibly nutritious eggs.
*  And you don't have to
*  worry. There's no bad karma. No one's
*  getting hurt. Right. Just popping out eggs.
*  But every now and then, the
*  chicken will decide that this
*  egg is going to hatch.
*  And they'll molt.
*  I think it's called brooding.
*  And they'll start picking their
*  feathers off their body so that
*  they can have skin on the
*  egg, and they won't
*  get off that egg. And you
*  come near them, they peck at you, they want
*  to preserve that egg because in their head,
*  they're confused as to why they're not
*  having chicks. Right.
*  In their little dinosaur brain. So,
*  I had to take them,
*  and I would separate them from the other chicks,
*  and you had to put them in a smaller
*  container where they couldn't sit
*  on the thing. So you had to put a perch.
*  So, when you put them in that container with a
*  perch, then their legs
*  clutch on the perch, and they sit there
*  in a smaller chicken coop,
*  and then they would eventually get over it.
*  And then you could let them back in, they would act normal again.
*  But otherwise, they would damage themselves.
*  They'd peck at themselves. It was real weird.
*  That is weird. When you say they decide,
*  does that mean that all eggs could, and they
*  just pick this one out? No, no, no.
*  They have a feeling that this one is going to have it.
*  No, no, no. No eggs can ever become
*  a chick. Gotcha. The only way an egg
*  can be a chick is if there's a rooster. Gotcha.
*  So, if these chickens, these female chickens,
*  which, by the way, I didn't know until I was 40.
*  I thought that they just fucking had an egg, and the egg became a chicken.
*  You were eating it before it became a chick.
*  That's what I thought. That's why you get a feather in it once in a while.
*  I put zero thought into it.
*  Until we had chickens, and then we realized that this is a brooding thing
*  where they have to hold on to the per... So, you have to basically take them...
*  If you don't do it, they'll go through a full cycle, like 30 days of brooding,
*  and they won't lay any other eggs, and it's like...
*  They get real weird. Right, right.
*  But they also, they damage themselves.
*  They pluck all their feathers out and shit.
*  But if you take them, and you put them in this small container
*  for a number of days, like I forget how many days it is,
*  they'll eventually get over it, and then they act normal again.
*  So, we did that, and I put this smaller container on the outside of the larger chicken coop.
*  Because for whatever reason, I didn't bring it inside. I just put it outside of there.
*  The coyote became friends with Johnny Cash.
*  Johnny Cash is a mastiff, and he's a fucking tank.
*  He's 140 pounds, head like a fire hydrant, dumb as shit.
*  The coyote was super clever, and the coyote was his friend.
*  So, the coyote would hop the fence and hang out with him.
*  Because the coyote was way too small to eat him.
*  The coyote is only probably 35 pounds.
*  But the coyote got him convinced that they're buddies.
*  So, the coyote would come visit, and Johnny would see it outside the fence, and he'd go, hello.
*  And so, one day, somebody left the gate open, where the way the house was set up,
*  the dog could stay on one side, and the chicken coop was on the other side.
*  So, I didn't have to worry about him, because he's so strong.
*  He could literally go through the chicken coop, which he eventually did.
*  He pulled the chicken wire apart, and just slaughtered in there.
*  But before he did that, the coyote convinced him to go to the box where that one chicken was, and knock it over.
*  So, I'm sitting there, and we were playing games.
*  We were playing, like, Sorry or something with my family.
*  And I look out the window, and I see this fucking coyote with a chicken in its mouth,
*  running across my yard, and bounces over my fence like it doesn't exist.
*  I mean, it's like, you can't believe how graceful they are.
*  Six-foot fence, just like this. Bing, bing, bong.
*  Gone, with a chicken in its mouth.
*  I'm running out, chasing him, you motherfucker.
*  And then I go over, and I'm like, how did he get the chicken?
*  And then I go over to where the chicken coop is, and somebody had let Johnny over to that side.
*  And he's destroyed the chicken coop, the small coop.
*  And he's just looking at me, like, Hey, man. Hey, man.
*  What's up? I'm like, what the fuck did you do?
*  And then I realized, oh my God, the coyote tricked him into knocking this thing over, and then it stole the chicken.
*  Because it was hanging out with him.
*  The coyote told me you'd want me to knock it over.
*  He wasn't barking at the coyote.
*  He wasn't acting like the coyote was an intruder.
*  In his mind, the coyote was like my other dog, was like his friend.
*  Right, right. They were buddies.
*  Let's do this. Come on, it'll be cool.
*  Exactly.
*  But he didn't even know what it was.
*  He got beer pressured into it.
*  What do you want me to do? You want me to knock that over? I'll knock that over.
*  Boom.
*  And he shatters his box, and the coyote's like, Thanks, sucker.
*  Whoo.
*  Poing.
*  It just bounces over the fence.
*  They are smart.
*  But I was, I mean, I spent the rest of the day going, like, what did it do?
*  Yeah.
*  Did it know that he could do that?
*  Right.
*  Like, how did it?
*  Probably.
*  Or did it just think maybe we'll work together and we can do it?
*  Did it know?
*  Look how big that thing is.
*  I think that thing could probably break this.
*  Did it understand?
*  Yeah, it does.
*  Its size is, my wife was walking.
*  We have a new dog in the house.
*  We have a pug named Frank.
*  Oh.
*  New addition to the house.
*  When did you get Frank?
*  Like four weeks ago.
*  I rescued it.
*  My daughter, one daughter went to school and my other daughter replaced her with a pug.
*  And my wife is walking the Black Lab Bella and Frank the pug.
*  She's just walking them on the sidewalk.
*  And she ran into a coyote in the middle of the street.
*  Coyote.
*  Pretty big one.
*  And she said she was making noise trying to get it off.
*  And she said he wasn't moving.
*  He was just watching.
*  He was like sizing up kind of what you're saying.
*  Yeah.
*  Looking at Frank, this little edible pug, but seeing my wife in this Black Lab and she said he was just trying to figure out.
*  What he could do.
*  Yeah.
*  What could he do?
*  And my wife was making a lot of noise trying to push him away.
*  Look at him.
*  Eventually he went.
*  There's your little pug.
*  Oh yeah.
*  There's Frank.
*  Look at that little face.
*  It's a great name for a pug.
*  He's adorable.
*  Yeah.
*  He's pretty great.
*  They're not that bright.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, they eat those things all day long.
*  Yeah.
*  Coyote snatch those up from yards all day long.
*  It's a fun dog name to be like, come on, Frank.
*  I had a dog named Frank Sinatra.
*  It's like you're talking to a guy from the 50s.
*  You had a Frank Sinatra?
*  Yeah.
*  Frank Sinatra, Johnny Cash.
*  Isn't Frank great?
*  Yeah.
*  The name to Frank is great.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Aw, what are you doing?
*  Come on, Frank.
*  Frank.
*  Frank.
*  Not in the office.
*  He looks like a Frank.
*  Frank.
*  We've never had a pug before.
*  Oh really?
*  They're cute dogs.
*  Look at that little face.
*  Look at that face.
*  Look at them.
*  Hilarious.
*  They're not that bright.
*  You got to keep them away from fucking coyotes, man.
*  Yeah.
*  Coyotes are going to come and take it.
*  Maria Bamford, great comedian.
*  Great comedian.
*  Great comedian.
*  She adopts pugs.
*  She has like five at a time.
*  And only adopts them like at 10 years old.
*  Like the end of their life when people aren't caring for them.
*  It's how big hearted she is.
*  She brings them in and cares for them to the end of their life.
*  Whitney has about 100 dogs at her fucking house.
*  Does she really?
*  She's always got dogs.
*  She's always adopting.
*  She just sent me pictures.
*  Look at this new dog I got.
*  Bitch, how many dogs do you have?
*  I went to her house.
*  I did a backyard standup thing.
*  I saw that.
*  P and Tim Dillon.
*  I was criticizing her for that backyard standup show.
*  She tested everybody.
*  Oh, please.
*  They're all comics.
*  Everybody wore masks.
*  Yeah.
*  And people were like, you're putting people at risk.
*  Oh, snooze fest.
*  Professional comedians were saying that.
*  What?
*  Yes.
*  Which ones?
*  You know, ones with money that don't worry about making a living.
*  Oh, god.
*  That don't want anybody to do any dates at all, even if it's just fun.
*  Oh, shut your trap.
*  Oh, it's so gross.
*  Shut your trap.
*  This whole risk shaming thing.
*  Oh, my god.
*  Exactly.
*  You can't take people at risk.
*  That was another thing in the article.
*  Sorry to go way back to the pandemic.
*  Another thing that countries that have done things well, they don't shame people into their actions.
*  If you give them the information and let them act on their own.
*  Well, you got to take Twitter away.
*  If you shame them and yell at them and we're better than you and you tell them what to do and you're going to shame the shit out of them, then they all rebel.
*  You make Trumpers.
*  Right. You'll rebel.
*  You're like, don't tell me what to do.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, that's human nature, man.
*  Oh, please.
*  Those people are gross.
*  Let people go perform.
*  I went and performed in Portland.
*  Has anybody given you any grief for doing shows?
*  No.
*  Wait till after the show.
*  They will.
*  Oh, F them.
*  They're coming for you.
*  They're coming for you.
*  Yeah.
*  Talk to me about the waitresses that were almost losing their apartments and are back at work.
*  Sure.
*  Talk to me about the people that are subsiding their anxiety by finally getting out of the house and hearing comedians translate stuff.
*  I think you should be able to take risks.
*  We are almost seven months into this thing.
*  Yeah.
*  And the idea that you're supposed to stay home until there's a cure is fucking insane.
*  It's insane.
*  It's untenable.
*  It doesn't make any sense.
*  And obviously, you can navigate it.
*  You can navigate this water.
*  You can.
*  You can do it safely.
*  You wear a mask.
*  You take care of your health.
*  You take vitamin D, zinc, and vitamin C, drink a lot of water, get a lot of rest.
*  And whatever's good for you.
*  Get tested.
*  If you're vulnerable and you don't want to go, you don't go.
*  But if the governor of that state says it's okay and the mayor says it's okay and the club owner is doing all the right things and the staff is there and the people show up, we've all decided as a collective that this is okay for us.
*  We're adults.
*  Right.
*  And if we're out there bungee jumping or riding bulls or any other dangerous activities, we should be able to do that.
*  And the other argument, the argument against that, of course, is that you're going to transmit it to someone else.
*  Don't fucking do that.
*  Okay?
*  Get yourself tested.
*  If you have a vulnerable person in your household, don't do anything risky.
*  That's right.
*  But you can be tested now.
*  It is possible.
*  You can find out.
*  100%.
*  And Trump kicked it and he's fat and he's 74.
*  Need to get on the same shit they put the rock on when he was doing Fast and the Furious.
*  Can you imagine?
*  Run through walls.
*  The rock got COVID.
*  And he was on.
*  One of the most difficult things me and my family have ever been through.
*  Meanwhile, you're like, come on, son.
*  Come on.
*  I'm watching your Instagram the whole time.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  Even flinch.
*  You didn't even cough.
*  You never stop posting.
*  One of the most difficult things my family and I have ever done.
*  I'm a giant rock fan.
*  I love that guy is jacked.
*  Holy cow.
*  He's so inspirational.
*  He's always getting after it.
*  If you're lazy, there's three people you need to go look at.
*  Cameron Haynes, David Goggins and the Rock.
*  Go pay attention to those.
*  They will get you off your fucking lazy ass.
*  They sure will.
*  And people think, oh, that's frivolous.
*  Listen, it's not.
*  It's mental strength is an important thing to have.
*  And it's something that you can grow.
*  You can cultivate it.
*  It's a thing that you see in other people.
*  You admire it.
*  And a lot of people, they like to pretend they don't admire it because they don't have it in themselves.
*  And so they try to dismiss it.
*  It's inspiring.
*  But those people, Goggins and Cam Haynes and the Rock, people that are constantly...
*  Kevin Hart is another one, too.
*  Constantly hustling, always getting after it.
*  Those people are very valuable to humanity.
*  They really are.
*  But people who consider themselves intellectuals or at least intelligent or artists or whatever,
*  they look at those people as like they're doing something frivolous.
*  And that maybe perhaps my support of it is just reinforcing the meathead part of me that I enjoy, which is true.
*  I'm a meathead.
*  It's a fact.
*  It's a fact.
*  Well, that's true.
*  I'm a meathead.
*  But you inspire a lot of people.
*  I like muscle cars.
*  I like bow hunting.
*  I like meathead type shit.
*  But I also like to read.
*  And I also like intelligent things.
*  I like interesting discussions.
*  And you get motivated to work really hard.
*  The mind is the hard part.
*  Getting your mind to force your body to do things.
*  When your mind starts concocting all these excuses and starts coming up with all these different ways why you don't have to do that.
*  Very clever.
*  It's a sneaky bitch.
*  Really clever.
*  You got to conquer it.
*  You got to conquer your inner bitch.
*  You got to figure out a way to tell that motherfucker to shut up and you start working.
*  And once you start sweating and things start moving along, you get a sense of satisfaction.
*  That's right. Exactly.
*  You had one post, literally I saw it as I was doing a pour over coffee in the morning before my radio show.
*  And you said something like my inner bitch wanted me to go and just have coffee and skip the workout.
*  I was sitting there like literally making the coffee.
*  I did.
*  That was a hard day.
*  Yeah.
*  Sometimes it's hard.
*  You got to, for me, and I always feel silly talking about working out in front of you anyway.
*  But as long as I know when I'm doing it in the day, if it's going to be right after the radio show, as soon as I turn it off and I go out, like I just have to know.
*  Just have the schedule.
*  Yeah.
*  You can't have it loose.
*  Like some time in the afternoon does not work.
*  Yes.
*  I have to know exactly.
*  That's how I am with writing as well.
*  I have to have my writing.
*  I have to know I'm writing today at 3 p.m.
*  I will show up.
*  I will flip open that laptop.
*  I will fucking fire it up.
*  That's right.
*  And all you have to do is show up.
*  Exactly.
*  Just show up.
*  There's this great book on writing rituals.
*  All these different writers and they tell you it's just what each author did.
*  And some painters.
*  Something rituals.
*  I feel like you've told me about this before.
*  I think I have.
*  I'll get you a copy.
*  That will be my mission.
*  It's so great.
*  Just keep it at your end table just to kind of like pop it open and just see how these
*  people.
*  Just that they, some of them are really decadent, some of them are really puritanical, but they
*  had it.
*  Well the best one was Hunter S. Thompson.
*  They knew what it was.
*  Hunter S. Thompson, there was Beardy Man took me and Fitzsimmons reading Hunter S. Thompson's
*  ritual and put it into music.
*  Oh really?
*  And made a song.
*  Do you think we can play that?
*  Are you allowed?
*  I wonder if we can play that because I'm in it.
*  I mean I gave him the rights to use it.
*  Uh huh.
*  What do you think happens there?
*  It's kind of an interesting experiment.
*  Yeah.
*  He seems like a nice guy.
*  It's weird like what you can get away with and what you can't get away with.
*  Who owns it?
*  Who's thing?
*  It's not me.
*  I certainly don't own it, but I let him use our voice.
*  But it's me and Fitzsimmons reading Hunter S. Thompson's schedule.
*  He had a writer come visit him and the writer observed what he did in the day.
*  And was his ritual, he would do it every day?
*  Yeah play this.
*  Here's his daily routine.
*  3pm, rise.
*  3.05, Shiva's Regal with morning papers.
*  Smokes Dunhill's.
*  3.45, cocaine.
*  3.50, another glass of Shiva's.
*  Another Dunhill.
*  4.05, pm, by the way.
*  First cup of coffee and a Dunhill.
*  4.15, cocaine.
*  4.16, orange juice and another Dunhill.
*  4.30, cocaine.
*  4.54, cocaine.
*  5.05, cocaine.
*  5.11, coffee, Dunhill's.
*  5.30, get more ice in the Shiva's.
*  Cocaine at 5.45.
*  6 o'clock, smoke and grass, take the edge off the day.
*  7pm.
*  The day, 3 hours into it.
*  3 hours in, lit.
*  7.05, Woody Creek Tavern for lunch.
*  Heineken, two margaritas, coleslaw, taco salad, double order of fried onion rings, carrot cake, ice cream, a bean fritter.
*  Dunhill's, another Heineken, cocaine.
*  And for the rest of the ride home, a snow cone, a glass of shredded ice which is poured over four jiggers of Shiva's.
*  Okay, so snow cone is Shiva's.
*  Okay, 9pm, start snorting cocaine seriously.
*  10pm, drops acid.
*  11pm, chartreuse, I don't know what that is.
*  Cocaine and grass.
*  11.30, cocaine, etc. etc.
*  12, midnight, Hunter S. Thompson is ready to write.
*  That's when he sits down to write.
*  12.05 to 6am, he writes.
*  Chartreuse, cocaine, grass, Shiva's, coffee, Heineken, clove cigarettes, grapefruit, Dunhill's, orange juice, gin, continuous pornographic movies.
*  6am, in the hot tub with champagne, Dove bars, Fettuccine Alfredo.
*  8am, Calcion, just sleeping pill.
*  8.20, sleep.
*  Oh my god, I can't believe he shot himself.
*  What a fucking animal.
*  Well, he's in serious pain.
*  He had hip replacements and he was all fucked up.
*  Man, oh man.
*  You can only...
*  I can't call that a ritual.
*  You can only throw that much sand into the engine.
*  Yeah, right, exactly.
*  Where the block sees is up.
*  It's gonna seize.
*  It was sad towards the end of his life because he couldn't talk.
*  Like, there's a famous interview with him on Conan O'Brien.
*  Yeah.
*  And he had lost his ability to communicate.
*  He was just so compromised by alcohol and drugs, he couldn't talk anymore.
*  That is the worst.
*  That really is bad.
*  I was looking at this video of David Lynch talking about TM.
*  Transcendental meditation.
*  Yeah.
*  And he was talking about that the people that are in pain that are drinking like that
*  and taking the drugs, artists that are doing that stuff, that that ends up killing the art.
*  And that if you can find something else for your brain that gets you away from those things,
*  you'll be able to create.
*  But that all of those drug-fueled, alcohol-fueled artistic endeavors and artistic lives all just burn out.
*  They just, you've killed it.
*  You've killed the part of you that's gonna be able to create.
*  And it's true, all those stories don't end in a way.
*  Stan Hope's still kicking.
*  Is he?
*  Mm-hmm.
*  Doing great.
*  Yeah.
*  Tell David Lynch to suck it.
*  We'll see.
*  Honestly, I think that's a generalization.
*  It's a pretty...
*  I think that drugs and alcohol can be tools.
*  I think the problem is...
*  In short bursts.
*  The inclination that people have to excess is often what leads them astray.
*  It's like this inclination to just keep boozing and keep drugging and year after year, day after day,
*  eventually your body falls apart.
*  Right.
*  This is why I'm doing Sober October.
*  Yeah, how's it going?
*  It's nice.
*  You feel good?
*  I'm fucking sore.
*  You're all by yourself.
*  I know no one's doing it with me.
*  You're all alone.
*  But I'm sore.
*  I've been working out.
*  I decided to work out every day for the whole month.
*  Oh, really?
*  See what that's like.
*  Yeah.
*  Wow.
*  What's your normal schedule?
*  I take days off.
*  Normally, I take a couple days off a week.
*  Right.
*  But I've just been forcing myself to do what I would call active recovery.
*  So I mix it up.
*  So like days...
*  I just do different things on different days.
*  I'm just trying to keep it going.
*  One of the things I've become real obsessed with is this thing called the Rogue Echo
*  bike.
*  You know what that is?
*  No.
*  You know what an air dyne bike is?
*  Yeah.
*  You do your handles and then you basically...
*  It's wind resistant.
*  Yeah, that big wheel.
*  It's a fan.
*  Yeah.
*  This is like the most brutal version of that.
*  Oh, yeah?
*  It's a really rugged, tough piece of equipment.
*  And I've become obsessed with seeing how much I can do on it.
*  It's really weird.
*  Like I started doing these Tabata rounds.
*  I would do like four rounds.
*  Four rounds are...
*  You do eight Tabatas, which is 20 seconds of sprinting followed by 10 seconds of rest.
*  And you do that for a cycle of eight.
*  Like you do that eight times.
*  How long?
*  How far?
*  It takes four minutes to do eight times.
*  How far is the sprint?
*  No, it's just time.
*  Oh, time.
*  You're just doing time.
*  Got you.
*  Because you're not going anywhere.
*  Oh, you're on the bike.
*  I'm sorry.
*  You're on the bike.
*  Pay attention.
*  You're not even listening to me.
*  I'm on drugs.
*  I would do four minutes and I would do that.
*  I started off doing it.
*  I would just do it like four times, which is 16 minutes.
*  16 minutes of sprinting, which is hard.
*  It's difficult.
*  Yeah.
*  And then I moved it up to eight.
*  And then I moved it up to 10.
*  And then I moved it up to 13.
*  So now I'm basically at 52 minutes of sprinting and resting, sprinting and resting.
*  And it's amazing for my cardio.
*  Yeah.
*  You just rest and recover.
*  And then I have this day of dread where I know today I'm doing the air dyne bike.
*  Right.
*  And then I start fucking with my head and I start saying, OK, pussy, today you're going
*  to do 15.
*  You're going to do 15 sets.
*  Each one is four minutes long.
*  Ready, go.
*  And once you get through one, you go, OK, 13 more to go, 14 more to go.
*  Yeah.
*  13, 12, 11.
*  And you just keep going.
*  And then when you get to seven, you feel the finish line coming.
*  And then you get to six and to five.
*  And you're fucking, I'm drenched with sweat.
*  Right.
*  And I'm taking liquid IV in these big two liter bottles and I'm chugging it.
*  I've become crazy with this.
*  It's just the starting that's the hard part.
*  It's the dread.
*  Yeah.
*  It's the dread.
*  I try to find ways to avoid doing this because I'm doing it three days a week sprinting on
*  this thing.
*  That's amazing.
*  Good for you.
*  But my quads, my legs are getting big.
*  Mine are getting big too.
*  What are you doing?
*  Getting fat?
*  Peloton.
*  Oh, sorry.
*  What?
*  Do I look fat?
*  No, no, no.
*  You look great.
*  Peloton's awesome.
*  I hit a 61 week streak on the Peloton.
*  You did it 61 weeks in a row?
*  I'm at 61 weeks.
*  Nice.
*  I'm still alive.
*  That's amazing.
*  It's good.
*  How many days a week are you doing it?
*  Three.
*  And when you do it, are you following the same course?
*  No.
*  Or do you have different instructors?
*  You follow their workouts?
*  I've got this great, I only like one instructor.
*  I have this guy, Matt Wilpers, who's, he's not partying on the bike.
*  There's a lot of, you know, everyone has their different soul cycle kind of a, you know,
*  girls flirting and Wilpers is like a coach.
*  He's like just dialed in.
*  Hardcore.
*  He's like, yeah, he's like a high school coach kind of a thing.
*  And he's just all about, you know, hitting these zones and doing the stuff.
*  But he keeps coming out with new ones.
*  So like every week there's, he drops like, you know, a 60 minute or a 45 minute and just,
*  he just keeps you, keeps me motivated.
*  It keeps me in.
*  And it has music.
*  So you're going along to the music.
*  You've got music.
*  And he's coaching you.
*  And he's coaching you.
*  He's like telling you crank it up, let it go, all that stuff.
*  Right.
*  Exactly.
*  Exactly.
*  Hit this zone.
*  Peloton's awesome.
*  They also have a treadmill now too, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  There was a place that we, when we were working in Phoenix once and we went to this gym, we
*  were doing standup in Phoenix and we went to this gym during the day and they had these
*  cardio machines that were exactly what I always wanted.
*  I said, why can't someone come up with a cardio machine where as you're running, you're doing
*  like a video game.
*  And so like, so you had like fire in your left hand and I think what you did with your
*  right hand, but it was like a elliptical machine and you, the only way you went forward is
*  by doing this.
*  So you have a screen in front of you and you were shooting pew, pew, pew.
*  And then you would turn it pew, pew, pew.
*  And you were, you were actually, I forget what you're shooting.
*  I think you were in a tank.
*  And you were shooting at like other objects.
*  It wasn't, it wasn't so sophisticated where you had like, there was, there's a thing that
*  they're doing where they, I know there was a concept at least where they had VR goggles
*  and you had this omnidirectional treadmill.
*  So you'd be harnessed by the waist and the omnidirectional treadmill would go in any,
*  any way.
*  And so you would run left and one right and you'd shoot at this and shoot at that, but
*  you'd actually be getting exercise in it because you're on this self propelled omnidirectional
*  treadmill.
*  Have you ever used a self propelled treadmill?
*  No.
*  Dude.
*  No.
*  We have this thing called the air runner at the old studio and I miss it.
*  It's amazing.
*  Really?
*  It's 15% harder than regular running because it's at this little slope and you're pulling
*  to get it to go.
*  And as you get it to go, like you're keeping up this pace.
*  It's, it's very difficult.
*  Wow.
*  It's really good though.
*  Like running on the beach.
*  Like in the sand.
*  Running on the beach is pretty fucking good.
*  Yeah, it's not quite the same as that, but it's really good.
*  Yeah.
*  The thing is, it's, if you could have something like that where it's difficult to do, but
*  also fun, like you put on these goggles and you're doing halo or something or doing quake
*  and you're running down the hallway and shooting at things.
*  I mean, what a workout you would get.
*  That'd be really cool.
*  If you get it behind you and have like, someone's coming up behind you, you got to outrun them.
*  Just think about how many people get addicted to video games.
*  Yeah.
*  Video games are extremely addictive.
*  Sure.
*  I mean, you get addicted to something that actually gives you cardio where you're running
*  four or five hours in a day.
*  Yeah, that'd be great.
*  So the only way you get good at this game is by drinking a lot of water, taking vitamins,
*  eating clean.
*  Yeah, come on.
*  Yes.
*  Let's do it.
*  Let's make it.
*  Well, I think they're really close to doing something like that.
*  You've tried that game Beat Saber where you're swinging the sticks.
*  John Carmack was a wizard of that shit.
*  When you have that ramped up, granted, maybe if you made those weighted so you're actually,
*  it's not weightless in your hand.
*  I've played that for like an hour.
*  You get pretty sweaty if you're doing good.
*  Like if you're not fucking up every 30 seconds.
*  Well, do you remember when we put that boxing game on and I was whacking all these opponents
*  and I was getting tired?
*  I was like, this is a good workout.
*  I get tired during Dance Dance Revolution.
*  Because if you actually know how to box a little, you could fuck those guys up.
*  So those guys would come at me and be like, pap pap, duck under, but you're actually moving.
*  And when you get hit, the light flashes.
*  How cool is that?
*  It's pretty cool.
*  That's pretty cool.
*  Like if you could dial that in and be like, go against Tyson or go against, you know what
*  I mean?
*  Like go against Ali.
*  They will definitely have that someday.
*  Frasier coming at you?
*  The thing would be cool is if you could actually hit something.
*  If you actually had a thing in front of you that you would hit.
*  Like a heavy bag.
*  Right, because right now it's not that way.
*  Right now it's just air.
*  So you're just swinging in air.
*  And when it's like, poop poop, when you hit it, it makes noise.
*  Put the goggles on and a heavy bag in front of you.
*  It might hurt yourself.
*  And you see it and poop poop poop.
*  You might hurt yourself.
*  The problem with that is like if you swung and you thought that the bag was here but
*  the bag is right here, you might like hurt your wrist or something.
*  Really depends on, maybe it's possible.
*  Maybe you could be able to hit a really spongy bag.
*  Like a light water bag.
*  If they ever hit a water bag, they're really good because there's weight to them, but they
*  don't have the same impact.
*  Sometimes people have a problem with actual heavy bags because the impact is so jarring
*  on your joints.
*  If you hit hard especially.
*  Like Roy Jones was here yesterday and he was talking about how he hits these little paddles
*  instead of like regular mitts.
*  Because he hits so hard, he doesn't want to hurt his hands.
*  So he's like, bap bap, whap, whap.
*  So he's just whipping into these paddles.
*  And the paddles offer very little resistance.
*  They just make this slap.
*  Just for the quickness of it.
*  Yes.
*  So if you could have something like that maybe.
*  Where you hit it but it's not hurting you.
*  It just seems like the fun part of it, of you being able to go against legends.
*  That's got to be a thing.
*  Someone's already done it.
*  Someone making this on their own, I just found this is a test they made.
*  So it shows you the spots to hit.
*  That would be what you would want, right?
*  Yes, that's a great idea.
*  That's a great idea.
*  Does that bag look like it's set up right?
*  Well the bag is actually virtual.
*  So there's a virtual bag but then a physical bag.
*  So the virtual bag, what the goggles are doing is picking up on the actual position of the
*  real bag.
*  So when you're hitting it, even with these fake gloves, the distance is correct.
*  So if you're seeing the way this guy, look at the video.
*  The way this, oh now he's punching the wall.
*  That's a macawara.
*  So there he's just doing that for reflexes.
*  Go back to the bag part though.
*  Let me see the bag part again.
*  Now if you could make that square.
*  But see how he's hitting it?
*  Like he knows where the bag is.
*  He's hitting it in the correct distance.
*  So it's showing him accurately where the bag is as he moves forward.
*  It's representing where the bag is.
*  Pretty dope.
*  Yeah, they're getting there.
*  It's gonna come, right?
*  I mean, that would, yeah, come on.
*  Be able to run like against Carl Lewis.
*  That would be pretty cool stuff.
*  I don't know about all that.
*  Come on man, make it a little fun.
*  Yeah.
*  But the Peloton for my thing has been good.
*  Yeah.
*  But if they could combine something like, see if you can find that omnidirectional treadmill
*  plus VR game.
*  Because there was a thing that they were doing.
*  I don't remember what the game was.
*  They were working on it.
*  I'm pretty sure it was in beta.
*  And they were just trying to figure out how to do it.
*  But they wanted to do it like Quake or Doom or one of those 3D shooters where you'd be
*  running with a plastic gun and you'd run down and shoot at things.
*  It seems like that's the gyms of the future.
*  Getting a kayak and you're going down a roaring river.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like all that running through the mountains.
*  That's probably where the gyms are gonna head.
*  Or how about you're running and wolves are chasing you?
*  You run this treadmill, you turn around VR and you see glowing eyes of wolves.
*  Probably the best looking one I saw.
*  There's a couple different ones I remember seeing.
*  That's an omnidirectional treadmill as well?
*  I remember the one you were talking about.
*  It was a little concave I think, right?
*  It was circular.
*  Okay.
*  So this traps you in the same way but the way the ground moves can go all directions.
*  Let me see this guy get in there.
*  So the...
*  Oh what?
*  He's got goggles on.
*  Look at that.
*  He's a robot.
*  Oh that's so dope.
*  Look at that.
*  He's pretty...
*  So is he harnessed into that treadmill?
*  He's not.
*  No.
*  He looks like a robot in the woods.
*  That's for tracking.
*  That little thing on the back.
*  So it seems like...
*  Oh that's so awkward.
*  They just need to get that better.
*  Yeah.
*  It's the beginnings of it.
*  Or really what you really could get is like...
*  This one he is trapped in.
*  Look at that.
*  Yeah.
*  So that's what I'm talking about.
*  Yeah.
*  Now he's in Inception.
*  He's walking down the street in Inception.
*  So is that a treadmill?
*  Yep, that's a treadmill.
*  It's a little treadmill.
*  That's what I'm talking about.
*  Something like that where you're strapped into an omnidirectional treadmill.
*  That looks like you'd fall off it.
*  Look how dope that is.
*  Oh he's strapped in.
*  Yeah, so he can kind of move anywhere.
*  Oh come on.
*  We're getting there kids.
*  We're getting there.
*  Come on bro.
*  How badass is this?
*  Yeah.
*  And if you had ankle weights on and wrist weights, what a fucking workout you would
*  get.
*  That would be pretty...
*  You would work out so much you would die.
*  I don't know if you'd die.
*  Because you'd be so into the game.
*  Be shredded.
*  Yeah, you'd be so into it.
*  Yeah, you'd come back and be addicted.
*  Six months later, I'm like what happened?
*  You told me you had a fucking six pack.
*  What's going on?
*  Yeah, you'd want to play for like hours and hours.
*  Right?
*  I got really into Boomzats on the VR.
*  Boomzats.
*  It's a good name.
*  Boomzats.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, you could figure out a way to turn your addiction into something positive.
*  Yeah, now you're talking.
*  The best way to do it for those video game guys is to become a professional gamer.
*  Or you can actually make a shitload of money playing professional games.
*  But if you could figure out a way for regular people that have no desire to do that, to
*  use it as recreation and then get fit.
*  I know a lot of people got fit with Dance Dance Revolution.
*  It's no joke.
*  No joke.
*  I was exhausting.
*  I was like my little girls were little at the time and were dancing and doing that thing.
*  It was like I had to sit down on the couch.
*  Dude, sometimes you go to an arcade like at a bowling alley or something.
*  You watch some dude who's like an expert at that shit.
*  You're like, oh, okay.
*  You're Riverdancing.
*  You're like one of those guys.
*  Remember those Riverdance commercials?
*  Yeah.
*  There was a funny, wasn't like a Nick Swartz movie.
*  Like when he was really good at that and Dance Dance Revolution in the arcade.
*  He was like real intense.
*  Prot was it a Sandler movie?
*  I think so.
*  If he was in maybe.
*  I think so.
*  But yeah, no, that stuff.
*  Yeah.
*  You're playing the Wii when we would do the Wii and play tennis and all that stuff together.
*  You're moving.
*  What happened?
*  This one can hold your weight.
*  I was going to see around.
*  Look, she's swimming.
*  Look at that.
*  I told you it's set at weight a thousand pounds.
*  So that gets into like, it's going to be an issue getting them into a place where you
*  could use it.
*  Uh huh.
*  This is a little smaller.
*  I don't even know what this is called.
*  Silver cord, I guess, but she's kicking.
*  It's holding her weight up.
*  This is why she's doing the breaststroke.
*  She's been pretty crazy.
*  Hung in the air doing the breaststroke.
*  That is wild.
*  That's cool.
*  You can walk in VR.
*  I feel like the next step is you're going to want to be able to jump.
*  And if you can't physically jump, you have to hit a button to jump.
*  That makes that move your weight back out.
*  Right.
*  You get to jump and land on things like bam.
*  Wow.
*  Oh my goodness.
*  They're getting there.
*  Yeah.
*  Come on, tech.
*  It's a perfect sort of mesh, the perfect mixing of a healthy activity with an addictive activity.
*  Right.
*  You can turn a positive into a negative because the negative has always been, for me at least,
*  they're just a massive waste of my time.
*  I get crazy with video games.
*  I can't fuck with them.
*  I know.
*  Jamie and I talked about it with the new place.
*  When we go to Texas, we're going to bring the video games.
*  No.
*  I can't.
*  Because you can't just play a little bit.
*  No.
*  No.
*  To me, it's like a cocaine addict.
*  I came in one day when you were in that back room playing and you were in a frenzy.
*  I was like, I'm just going to wait over here.
*  You were like.
*  Well, they're so fun.
*  They're so good.
*  And they're so well.
*  I mean, it's too good.
*  It's too exciting.
*  Right.
*  It really is.
*  Yeah.
*  It's too good.
*  And you had really high tech stuff.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  One of the graphics today.
*  Yeah.
*  They're just amazing.
*  What they can do today with video games is just so special.
*  When people get shot, they explode.
*  You see blood splatter all over the place.
*  And they don't look like people either.
*  Right?
*  They look like ogres with mechanical arms.
*  And so they make noise like.
*  If only you could do it for 20 minutes.
*  And be satisfied.
*  Yeah, please.
*  It'd be good.
*  Well, the way to do it would be to make sure that you get exhausted doing it.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  So that you could only play because you're running on this omnidirectional treadmill.
*  And if you did that, put like 10 pound weights on your arms.
*  Yeah.
*  10 pound weights on each arm.
*  10 pound weights on each leg.
*  Bro, you'd be beat.
*  Yeah.
*  You'd be beaten down.
*  Even five pounds.
*  Fuck, even a pound.
*  No, I know.
*  It's a lot.
*  A pound on each limb.
*  If they just made you simulate carrying the guns you're running around in the game with,
*  you'd be tired as shit.
*  That's a real good point.
*  Right?
*  Give you a real metal thing.
*  Like a heavy metal gun with a trigger.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Like a fucking cannon.
*  Don't, don't, don't, don't.
*  With something that kicks.
*  Body armor plus body armor plus your pack.
*  Haptic feedback.
*  The whole deal.
*  You get hit.
*  You get zapped a little bit.
*  Have you ever seen, you know what sandbox is?
*  No.
*  Dude.
*  Sandbox is a very similar situation.
*  It's a VR game that you go to a warehouse and they have it set up so you have the parameters
*  of the game and you put on a haptic feedback vest.
*  You have VR goggles and they hand you guns and these different things and then you go
*  and you duke it out with zombies.
*  Like there's this one Deadwood Mansion it's called.
*  See if you find the dead.
*  Yeah.
*  See this is, this is what it looks like.
*  I've done this a bunch of times with my family.
*  It's awesome.
*  It's awesome.
*  Really?
*  With your family?
*  Yeah.
*  You have fun.
*  You go missions together.
*  You shoot aliens and zombies.
*  And you feel like you're all in that reality?
*  I mean kind of.
*  It's obviously fake but it looks like that.
*  Like when you see the video of it it looks like that.
*  But it looks good.
*  It's really cool.
*  It's certainly discernible.
*  Like this is Deadwood Mansion.
*  So the zombies come running at you and you gun them down.
*  Like look at them.
*  Ah!
*  Dude it freaks you out.
*  And you get a shotgun.
*  Apparently that's the new update.
*  You get a shotgun with the Deadwood Mansion.
*  But they're running at you and you're fucking gunning them down.
*  Look at them.
*  That's what they look like.
*  You're like.
*  And like does someone die?
*  Like does your wife go down and she's out of the game and you guys keep going?
*  No she's not out of the game.
*  You can bring her back to life but you have to hold onto her shoulder and you recharge
*  her with your energy.
*  That's pretty great.
*  So when you see them when they're down they turn black and white.
*  And then when you grab them you go.
*  You can bring them back to life.
*  And you get killed.
*  You see in black and white so you know you're dead.
*  I have not gone.
*  But I'm wondering.
*  That's pretty cool.
*  Have you ever gone with them to like a VR haunted house or does that exist yet?
*  Because if it doesn't that's going to be.
*  And they probably can't do it this year obviously.
*  Right.
*  Good call.
*  Of course.
*  That would be great.
*  That would be a good call.
*  Really creepy.
*  Walk around an entire place that's made for it.
*  Well they had at Universal they had a Walking Dead attraction.
*  And they had actors.
*  And so they had people like full on Walking Dead makeup.
*  And like some of it was like mechanical and some of it was like.
*  In the haunted house?
*  And then you would come out.
*  But it was like a real person.
*  I walked through that.
*  No.
*  My daughter lost a flip flop and I had to go back for it.
*  She ran and left her flip flop.
*  She left her flip flop.
*  She was probably ten.
*  Oh my god.
*  You brought her in at ten.
*  And she was too scared to go back.
*  So I had to go back and get it.
*  Pardon me.
*  Going the.
*  Right.
*  And everybody thought I was a thing.
*  Oh my god.
*  All the other people.
*  I'm like just walking through like looking for this flip flop.
*  This is the scariest one yet.
*  The scary dead.
*  Oh my god.
*  Oh my god.
*  It's that guy from Italy.
*  Yeah.
*  So funny.
*  What's his name again?
*  Carlo Verdoni.
*  It's Carlo.
*  Verdoni.
*  He's dead.
*  He's dead.
*  He's coming for the killers.
*  Carlo.
*  We miss you.
*  And I got the.
*  And I found it.
*  Found the flip flop.
*  Came back like a hero.
*  Oh.
*  Congratulations.
*  What a low bar there is for being a hero in 2020.
*  Did you get the flip flop you fucking hero?
*  I got the flip flop.
*  I did it.
*  Oh man.
*  I feel like things will probably get weirder before they correct themselves right?
*  See look at this.
*  This is the constant narrative.
*  We're having a good time and it goes back to COVID.
*  I wasn't even thinking COVID.
*  I was thinking like aliens coming or Halloween decorations coming to life and hunting us
*  down.
*  There's a couple more curve balls waiting for us.
*  Well the Trump getting COVID I thought was like wow this movie is lit.
*  I was like this is a crazy fucking simulation.
*  Whatever we chose.
*  Because I'm like if he dies.
*  That's what I was thinking.
*  If he dies and Nancy Pelosi becomes president and Pence and Pelosi are battling over who
*  wears the crown.
*  Oh god I know.
*  I mean that was really what could have happened.
*  Pence would have become vice president.
*  Would have become president.
*  But then.
*  Then he gets it.
*  What happens when there we know a month later is the election.
*  And then the election is not going to be we're going to find out November 4th who the
*  winner is.
*  It's going to be weeks.
*  Unless it's a landslide.
*  But I don't think you're going to see a landslide.
*  If it's a landslide then you'll find out that night or the next day.
*  I don't believe that's true.
*  If it's not a landslide then.
*  If it's a landslide I'm sorry if it's a landslide with in-person voting.
*  Right but it's not going to be.
*  It's going to be so many mail-in ballots.
*  You don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  Well you know everything.
*  You told me already you know.
*  But I have to pretend that I don't.
*  So the conversation keeps going.
*  What do you think is going to happen.
*  Who do you think is going to win.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I mean they're saying that Biden's up like 16 points.
*  But I mean we've been through this before right.
*  It was 96 percent chance that Hillary was going to win.
*  So I can't look at any of those.
*  Biden is up in polls.
*  Polls are only answered by people so fucking stupid they answer polls.
*  You always have to take that into consideration.
*  Here's what I say to people.
*  Have you ever responded to a poll.
*  Right.
*  Have you?
*  Nope.
*  There you go.
*  No one with a life.
*  It's really true.
*  So people who are dumb think Biden should be president.
*  Great.
*  What is the numbers we're talking about?
*  How many people?
*  Yeah you don't know.
*  We only hold people with flat tires in white neighborhoods.
*  I do kind of.
*  They're waiting for AAA.
*  It's the only time we can get them to talk to us.
*  Like who's being polled.
*  I've never even seen a poll.
*  I don't know.
*  No one's asked me to poll.
*  I don't know anybody who's been asked to poll.
*  Nope.
*  Never.
*  I don't know if people.
*  I want more choices.
*  Oh yeah that would be amazing.
*  That's what I want.
*  I want better choices.
*  I don't want this polarization.
*  I hate it.
*  No they should put together teams of like mixed.
*  These four people and these four people of mixed ideas and get the best ideas and then
*  they're going to run as a platform rather than as an individual.
*  I think initially the idea of representative democracy and the idea of a Republican party
*  and a Democratic party was a great idea.
*  But I think the problem is people form this loyalty to this side and this blind loyalty.
*  Blind loyalty to their team and then they have confirmation bias and everything this
*  team does that's good.
*  That's all you focus on and you decide that this team's narrative is correct and you subscribe
*  full on to the ideology and the other people are the enemy and the other people are sexist
*  and racist or the other people are Marxist and leftist or whatever you decide is wrong
*  with the other people.
*  Could you imagine.
*  I think what I'm getting at is I think the problem is groups.
*  That's right.
*  The problem is identifying in any group whether it's Antifa or Proud Boys or the fucking whatever
*  that figure out a group.
*  Pick a group.
*  The idea of identifying with a group is a terrible idea.
*  Could you imagine being so all in with either party.
*  Like could you imagine that you're just blindly following everything they say just because
*  they're that color.
*  Yeah because I know a lot of people.
*  I know a lot of people that are all blue all they do.
*  I do too.
*  Up and down.
*  It's insane though.
*  I've seen it on people's Twitter page.
*  I vote blue across the board.
*  Yeah it's like you stop thinking.
*  It's just nuts.
*  You just stop thinking for yourself.
*  It's ridiculous.
*  And the idea that only bad people vote Republican is ridiculous too.
*  Or only dumb people or weak people or bad people vote Democrat is ridiculous too.
*  And this narrative gets reinforced by the fact that there are these two opposing teams
*  and that you have to pick a side.
*  And it's also reinforced by social pressure like your neighbors and your friends and coworkers.
*  Well and also the industry that you're in.
*  In certain industries it's frowned upon to vote left.
*  In certain industries it's frowned upon to vote right.
*  And you want to succeed in that business.
*  And so you sort of like.
*  I mean you know.
*  It's got to break up at some point.
*  Do you think so?
*  Yeah I do.
*  I think it has to.
*  I don't think.
*  One of the reasons I think that I don't think if I would go out on a limb that I think Trump
*  is going to lose is because people just can't deal with the anxiety.
*  It's like we were saying earlier like it can't be at a hot boil.
*  We've been at a hot boil for four years and people are exhausted.
*  They just want it to go back to someone calm.
*  Just calm this shit down.
*  Just calm it all down.
*  Well it would be nice if there was someone we thought was going to calm it down.
*  I don't know.
*  I think anybody but Trump would calm it down.
*  Honestly.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  Put Romney in.
*  Put anybody in.
*  Oh that I think.
*  Put anybody.
*  I do think that if Romney was a.
*  He is a much more measured.
*  Yeah.
*  Much more calm guy.
*  Joe compared to Trump everybody is.
*  And the funny thing was against Obama he looked like some sort of weird religious radical.
*  I know.
*  You remember?
*  I don't.
*  I do.
*  People are like get Romney the fuck away from us.
*  Right exactly.
*  Romney?
*  You want Mitt Romney?
*  I'd vote for him tomorrow.
*  That weirdo.
*  I know.
*  That weirdo.
*  He's a Quaker or some shit I heard.
*  Yeah he wears magic underpants.
*  He wears magic underpants.
*  We can't have him in there.
*  He's a Mormon.
*  I know.
*  Just a gentleman.
*  Just a gentleman who has a nice family who is just mellow.
*  He's in a really nice cult.
*  If you're going to be in a cult.
*  Yeah.
*  The Mormons are the nicest cult members.
*  So nice.
*  They're the kindest sweetest people.
*  They're so nice.
*  They're really family oriented.
*  Oh my god.
*  Like all the cult members.
*  I had neighbors that were Mormons.
*  All kidding aside.
*  They were so kind.
*  They were so friendly.
*  A hundred percent.
*  So nice.
*  Delightful.
*  Yes.
*  I'm not kidding.
*  But genuinely nice.
*  Yeah.
*  They believe the dumbest shit.
*  I mean it was like we talked to them about what they believe.
*  Like oh my goodness.
*  Yeah.
*  But you're like who cares.
*  God bless.
*  Who cares.
*  Yeah.
*  He found golden tablets.
*  He obtained the lost work of Jesus and only he could read it because he had a magic rock.
*  Is that what you're saying?
*  I don't care about that part of it.
*  I just care about how he acts in the parking lot with me.
*  I was just down in Salt Lake a couple weeks ago.
*  Yeah.
*  And I was driving on the street and I saw these two dudes with white shirts with ties
*  on the clipboard walking door to door.
*  Yeah.
*  God bless them.
*  Yeah.
*  You got to go out and do it.
*  God bless them.
*  I know.
*  Exactly.
*  Worse things in the world than that.
*  There's worse things in the world than that.
*  I don't care about what they're into.
*  Just mellow it out.
*  And I honestly do believe that you could take almost anybody that's in office and run them
*  and it'll be more mellow.
*  They may not agree with everything that they're doing but it will just turn this temperature
*  down and I don't think people are exhausted.
*  They're exhausted.
*  We can't live at this pace, at this level, at this nonsense.
*  But you think this is all because I think a lot of this when you go back to the social
*  dilemma, I think a lot of this is going to happen no matter what.
*  I think Trump is a particularly polarizing figure because he's got that fuck you attitude
*  and you come at him, he comes at you harder and he's just a battler.
*  So it doesn't help.
*  He's more than a battler.
*  It doesn't help anything.
*  There's no soothing from him.
*  There's none.
*  But I think-
*  That's your job as a leader.
*  But I think we would be polarized no matter what right now.
*  There's definitely lines drawn.
*  We're definitely polarized.
*  But if it's at the top, you had a real Republican just saying chill out, let's go to work on
*  this stuff.
*  Like who?
*  Give me an example.
*  It wouldn't be this heightened thing.
*  Give me an example.
*  Other than the cult member.
*  Other than Romney?
*  Is there anybody out there that stands out as someone that you would want to be representing
*  that side?
*  I don't know.
*  Kasich was kind of normal.
*  Yeah, he seems normal.
*  He seems measured.
*  Yeah, he seems like he's just going to be a grown up.
*  Just be an adult.
*  Just get me a mellow adult.
*  He's going to do the right things.
*  I'm waiting for Dan Crenshaw.
*  Crenshaw?
*  Yeah.
*  He's been on podcasts several times.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Navy Seal, Lost An Eye in Combat.
*  Oh yeah, Oklahoma.
*  Or Patch.
*  No, Texas.
*  It's in Houston.
*  Texas.
*  Yeah.
*  Great guy.
*  Super, like reasonable, intelligent, rational, well thought out.
*  Really enjoy talking to him.
*  That's good.
*  Really enjoy talking to him.
*  I'm going to look him up.
*  It makes sense.
*  I don't always necessarily agree with him, nor do I think I should.
*  I think there's room for disagreement.
*  But the way he communicates is very rational, very sensible, very intelligent.
*  And the man is like a legitimate American hero.
*  The guy that you're ... That guy in that office shouldn't be as frantic and stuff as anybody
*  on the edges.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like that guy's got to be the measured adult that kind of takes in all of those people
*  and makes sense of it and translates it and leads and keeps us all united.
*  Makes everybody ... The most upsetting part of this run has been just turning Americans
*  on Americans.
*  That's never happened in my life where we're making each other the enemy and we're not.
*  You and you tour and you see people that are not each other's throats.
*  They just want to raise their kids, make their money, live their lives.
*  We're not the enemy.
*  And painting other Americans as a threat, as a foreign threat, has been so upsetting.
*  Trump.
*  How's he doing that?
*  Painting other Americans as a foreign threat?
*  Yeah.
*  Constantly says that the left is just out to destroy and those people ... I mean, everything
*  he says is painting it that way.
*  Well, it's not everything he says.
*  Sure.
*  Kind of might be exaggerating a little bit there.
*  Well, it's always inflaming and it's always ... He runs as ... There's no foreign power
*  as the enemy.
*  It's the others in this country are the enemy.
*  I think China's the enemy.
*  He does think there's real issues with China.
*  That's true.
*  And I think there are real issues economically with China.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't understand any of that.
*  It's all above our pay grade, right?
*  Yeah.
*  I don't understand any of that.
*  I don't understand the nuance of ...
*  We're a couple of touring joke slingers.
*  Right.
*  Talking shit about global politics.
*  I don't understand healthcare.
*  But I do know when somebody is turning us against each other and he likes doing that.
*  Well, he certainly likes the battle.
*  That was what I admired most about Obama, is that the way he commanded respect was just
*  with grace.
*  The way he handled himself at press conferences, the way he discussed things.
*  Yeah.
*  He earned your respect.
*  He was very measured.
*  Even when he was attacked, he would be measured.
*  He was a statesman.
*  Right.
*  Cool.
*  Just keep your head.
*  That's what we need.
*  And it makes us all calm down.
*  Yes.
*  That's what we need, really, legitimately.
*  If the dad in the house is an alcoholic and he comes home and you don't know who's coming
*  in that day, is he going to attack me or is he going to ... Everyone's nervous.
*  That's kind of the way the country feels.
*  If dad just comes home and he's home at six and just has dinner and watches the ball game
*  and he just sits there and he's nice ...
*  I like your simplistic way of describing it.
*  I don't think it's accurate, but I understand what you're saying.
*  It's an analogy.
*  It's an analogy.
*  I think we all need to get on mushrooms.
*  I really do.
*  When's the last time you took mushrooms?
*  I think we need mushroom rituals a couple weeks ago.
*  A couple weeks ago?
*  Well, I've been to Texas, so more than a couple weeks.
*  Where did you do it?
*  What was the atmosphere?
*  My studio.
*  I did some during the Post Malone podcast.
*  You did?
*  Yeah, we did mushrooms together.
*  I didn't know that.
*  Yeah.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  Did you get giggly in the middle of the podcast?
*  Yeah, we got pretty silly.
*  Oh, I got to listen to that.
*  I think people need something that connects them to some sense that there's something
*  more to life than just what we're experiencing in front of us.
*  I've said it before and I'll say it again.
*  We need some religious ritual.
*  We need something that transcends ...
*  Transcendental meditation.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm not kidding.
*  I know you're into that.
*  It is that.
*  But I don't like the results with you.
*  I'm not impressed, so ...
*  It hasn't really been compelling.
*  I see what you're saying, but I'm like, I'm not buying it.
*  Guys over there just drinking pour over and sitting on his couch thinking it all is awesome,
*  complaining about Trump.
*  I don't see any enlightenment over there.
*  Him and Frank on the couch.
*  Me and Frank hanging out.
*  Making bread.
*  But it is that thing that you're talking about.
*  It's the same thing that drugs access.
*  It's the same thing that religion runs after, but without any dogma, without any leaders,
*  without any thing.
*  Clarity.
*  It's just a kind of a sense, a growing sense as you do it over time, that there is a bigger
*  consciousness, that there's something that is more compelling and more uniting with all
*  of us than what we're shown on the surface.
*  Well, I've been doing a lot of breath exercises, breathing exercises.
*  The one that I enjoy the most, because it puts me in kind of a trance, is six long seconds
*  in, six deep breath, like a six second deep breath, and a six second exhale.
*  I just do this in a cycle.
*  I count one, two, three, four, five, six.
*  One, two, three, four, five, six.
*  I do it like I try to be as honest I can, but the most important thing is to get it
*  rhythmic.
*  Six seconds in, six seconds out.
*  Six seconds.
*  Dude, it's crazy.
*  I'll sit there and I'll think 10 minutes has gone by and it's 45 minutes later.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  I'll check because I set a timer when I do it and I just decide at a certain point in
*  time to stop.
*  It's anxiety scrubbing.
*  It's like I'm cleaning my mind of extraneous bullshit.
*  That's just things that are not necessary, that are getting in the way of noise, crackling,
*  life noise.
*  I'm very busy.
*  I do a lot of shit.
*  I've got a lot of things going on and I have this mind that tries to find things to think
*  about.
*  I'll lie in bed and I'll get a thought in my head about asteroids or something nutty
*  that I don't need to think about right now.
*  Or I'll think about the volcanoes under Yellowstone.
*  What happens if one does erupt?
*  How does one deal with that?
*  And then all of a sudden it's fucking two hours later and I'm lying in bed consumed
*  with this thought.
*  The brain goes after it.
*  For me the best way to stay present is through these breathing exercises.
*  I found it's a great relief to me.
*  That's the way I describe it.
*  Anxiety scrubbing.
*  It scrubs away.
*  It's very similar to the way I describe it.
*  Yours is you have a mantra, right?
*  You just keep repeating that mantra and it just gives your brain a cue basically that
*  it's allowed to, it's going to start thinking about this and going a little deeper and leaving
*  all of that stuff up here.
*  Leaving all of that dates and anxiety and all that stuff that you're thinking about
*  here in the world that you need to think about.
*  But it's just giving your brain permission, like a little portal to go to a different
*  state of consciousness.
*  And you just kind of hang there.
*  And sometimes it's still busy, the thoughts will still kind of come in, but 20 minutes
*  pops off and you come out and it's exactly what you're describing.
*  You scrub your nervous system free.
*  You reset.
*  You reset the computer.
*  We operate too much on momentum and I think thoughts and little ideas, maybe anxiety,
*  a little way, they cling to you as you're going along and then they're stuck with you.
*  And then you've got all these things that are stuck with you, whether it's bills or
*  relationships or struggle or commitments, things you have to do, things you have to
*  resolve, things that you're, you know, requirements of you, things, all these different things,
*  focal points of attention.
*  And you can carry them around like weights.
*  And what the meditation does, it doesn't make those disappear, but it makes you able
*  to carry those.
*  Yes.
*  There's a different perspective in carrying all that.
*  It cleans.
*  For me, I feel like if my brain was like a cylinder, like a standing cylinder, it would
*  have all this shit stuck to it all over the place that maybe I don't need to be aware
*  of all the time because it doesn't help.
*  No.
*  Right?
*  Breathing exercises for me allows me, I really do go into a trance.
*  It's really strange.
*  And I like the fact that I'm doing a breath exercise as well.
*  So it's meditation, but it's also breathing.
*  It's like both things are happening at the same time.
*  So there's an exercise aspect to it because breathing exercise is like when you're sitting
*  there, I'm like, here, this is what I'm doing.
*  How long is he going to do it?
*  I keep going.
*  I keep going.
*  I'll do that for 45 minutes, but exactly at that pace.
*  And when I'm doing it like that, it does, it puts me into a trance, but it's also an
*  exercise for my lungs.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  The breathing thing is good.
*  It's heavy.
*  Yeah.
*  You need to do it because there's a lot to carry for all of us, for every single person.
*  Especially you.
*  Mine's pretty light.
*  All the things we talked about today.
*  It's pretty light.
*  It's all pretty light.
*  What about the bread?
*  The bread's going well.
*  Bread is meditation.
*  It is a little bit, right?
*  Yeah.
*  It's probably in a craft, like making delicious bread.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like stand up.
*  It's like you're always working on perfecting this craft and letting your mind go and just
*  deal with that.
*  And when you're doing that, you're not thinking about anything else in the world.
*  I need to be there right when it comes out of the oven and cut into it and then put butter
*  on it right then.
*  That's probably the best.
*  That's bad ass.
*  It is.
*  Is that the best?
*  Like right then?
*  Not right then.
*  How much do you weigh?
*  I mean, it's pretty close.
*  It's like a steak where you let it rest?
*  Yeah, you let it rest.
*  How long do you let it rest?
*  Some people say let it rest like another couple hours.
*  Who are those fucking people?
*  What do they want?
*  Cold bread?
*  People who are so fat that they're filled up with bread.
*  Have you ever had bread for a few hours?
*  I'm still chewing the one from last night.
*  I've got jam in my teeth.
*  I've got seeds.
*  Warm bread though.
*  It's so good.
*  It's only one way to get warm bread.
*  You can't wait for it to cool off.
*  A friend of mine gave me this butter that he got from, that he found here that he had
*  had in France.
*  Oh my God.
*  Butter from France.
*  This butter on that bread was just insane.
*  It's all I've been doing during the pandemic.
*  I just keep baking bread and driving it to comedians.
*  I've seen every comedian you know.
*  And delivered bread?
*  And delivered bread.
*  That's cool.
*  It's become like my little...
*  That's such a nice thing.
*  Getting out of the house and you go drive up and see Allie Wong and hang and give her
*  her bread.
*  I miss our treats.
*  Go see Leslie Jones and hang with her and give her her bread.
*  I'm just running around LA feeding people.
*  Bert, Tom.
*  It's beautiful.
*  It is.
*  That really is.
*  That's cool.
*  It's a cool thing to do.
*  It is.
*  It keeps you connected.
*  You're giving people...
*  I'm making too much of it.
*  You know what I mean?
*  How often are you doing it?
*  Like twice a week.
*  So that's four loads.
*  Are you still doing it for a podcast as well?
*  Are you still doing that?
*  I'm still doing the Breaking Bread podcast.
*  So you're making bread doing that as well?
*  Well, I don't do...
*  No, for the podcast we just talk and eat.
*  But you were doing something where you were making bread.
*  I was making...
*  Yeah, on my YouTube channel I show people how to bake bread.
