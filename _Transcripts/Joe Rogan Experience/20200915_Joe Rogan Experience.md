# Joe Rogan Experience #1536 - Edward Snowden
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [September 15, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rl82OQDoOc)
*  Good to see you again, man.
*  Good to see you.
*  Thanks for having me.
*  It's been like a year since we last talked.
*  It's been like a year, believe it or not.
*  You look exactly the same and the studio looks exactly the same.
*  You might be on another part of the world.
*  No one knows.
*  Yeah, it's just my apartment that I rent.
*  I don't like to give out a lot of information about where I'm at and that kind of stuff.
*  So it's just a plain wall that I've got the lights down low so it looks kind of a nice
*  gray.
*  At least I think it's nice.
*  I think it's beautiful.
*  It looks amazing.
*  First of all, congratulations on the recent ruling.
*  Was it the 9th District Court of Appeals?
*  Is that what it was?
*  It said that what you exposed with the warrantless wiretapping was in fact illegal.
*  And there are many people that are calling for you to be pardoned now.
*  Yeah, so much has happened.
*  This is actually not the first time the federal government has or the appeals courts have
*  struck down some of the federal surveillance programs as unlawful.
*  But this one is really important because it happened from an appeals court.
*  It wasn't from a single judge.
*  It was from a panel of judges.
*  And what they had ruled was that the NSA's bulk collection of Americans' phone records
*  was illegal.
*  And this is the very first sort of mass surveillance program that I and the journalists, really,
*  that the news was broken back in 2013.
*  So this is a huge victory for privacy rights.
*  What it means is there was this provision of the Patriot Act.
*  Remember the Patriot Act?
*  Remember like a zillion years ago?
*  I do.
*  Everybody was like, Patriot Act, Patriot Act.
*  Your friend Alex Jones, you know, I think he was worried about the Patriot Act.
*  It's a terrible name.
*  There's a real problem with that name because if you're against the Patriot Act, it's like
*  against babies.
*  This is the Pro Baby Act, but meanwhile Pro Baby Act, they get to look through your email.
*  You know what I mean?
*  The word Patriot is attached to that in a very disingenuous way.
*  Calling that the Patriot Act is really creepy that they could do that.
*  It should have like a number, like Bill A-1, you know what I'm saying?
*  So you can debate the merits of it.
*  It's just so much propaganda attached to that name, like the Patriot Act.
*  This is one of the funny things because it should be a warning for anybody who's in like,
*  you know, just anywhere in the country and they hear on the news they're talking about
*  like the Save Puppies Act.
*  There's actually one that's been, they've been trying to push through recently, which
*  is basically outlawing meaningful encryption from the major internet service providers.
*  Like if Facebook or Google for whatever reason got out of bed in the morning and they actually
*  wanted to protect the security of your communications in a way that even they can't break.
*  Like right now, Google and Facebook, they do a great job keeping other people from spying
*  on your communications.
*  But if Google wants to rifle through your inbox, right?
*  If Facebook wants to go through all your direct messages and give that to the federal government,
*  like you tap one button and boom, they've got all of it.
*  It happens every single day.
*  Well, companies like Facebook have recently realized this is a real problem for them because
*  first off they get all these censorship demands that you've seen where like there's deplatforming
*  requests and it happens in one country, right?
*  Like if the US government is allowed to decide what can and can't be said by this person
*  on this platform or the US goes, look, we got a court warrant.
*  They said, a judge said, we think this person's a criminal.
*  We want you to hand over everything you have on this person.
*  And they do it, right?
*  Facebook does this.
*  Well guess who's next, right?
*  The Russian government shows up at the door the next day.
*  The Chinese government shows up at the door the next day.
*  And if these companies don't play ball, they get shut down in that country.
*  They can no longer operate.
*  And so the idea that a lot of them have that they've considered, and this has actually
*  become a bigger thing in the COVID crisis where we start talking about like contact
*  tracing.
*  These companies want to know where everybody is at all the time so they can hand this over
*  to medical authorities or whatever.
*  There's this idea called end to end encryption, which what it means is that when you send
*  a message, when Billy sends a message to Bobby, Billy and Bobby both have the keys
*  to unlock that message.
*  And it could be sent through Facebook.
*  It could be sent through Google.
*  It could be posted on a bulletin board in the town square.
*  But without that key, which the people who run the bulletin board, the people who own
*  the bulletin board, Google, Facebook, they don't have that key.
*  Only the phones at the end, the laptops at the end, the people who own those, they're
*  the only people who have the key.
*  So if somebody comes to Facebook and says we want to see that information, Facebook
*  hands over the encrypted message, right?
*  And Facebook goes, well, here you go.
*  Here's our copy, but we can't read it.
*  You can't either.
*  Now you've got to actually do some work on the government side and go get that key yourself.
*  And then you can read it, right?
*  But we can't read it.
*  Congress is trying to stop the basically proliferation of that basic end to end encryption technology.
*  And they're calling it like the Child Online Predator Act or something like that, where
*  they say it's all about protecting the posting of like child exploitation material and really,
*  really horrible stuff.
*  But that's not actually what the law is about.
*  The law is about making it easier for spies and law enforcement to reach deeper and deeper
*  into your life with a simple warrant stamped by any court.
*  Now the funny thing is this never used to be the way law enforcement worked in the United States.
*  I mean, when you hear about a warrant, what does that mean to you?
*  What can the cops get with a warrant?
*  Well usually I think it means that they can come in your house and search.
*  The real issue with warrants when it pertains to encryption, like when you're talking about
*  the Child Safety Act or whatever they're calling it, anyone would say, yes, we have
*  to stop child predators.
*  But the problem with having the ability to use something like that to stop child predators,
*  in my eyes, I start thinking, well, if I really wanted to look into someone, what I would
*  do is I would send them some malware that would put child pornography on their computer
*  and then I would have all of the motive that I need to go and look through everything.
*  Like say if they were a political dissident, if they were doing something against the government
*  and you were someone who was acting in bad faith and you decided, okay, we want to look
*  into this guy but we don't have a warrant, what are the laws?
*  What can we get away with it?
*  Well we have the Child Endangerment Act and so because of that we're allowed to peer into
*  anything but we just have to have motive.
*  So we have to, well, do we have motive?
*  All you have to do is, and we both know this, it's very easy to put something illegal on
*  someone's computer if they're not paying attention.
*  It's very easy to install, like you could send someone a text message that looks like
*  a routing number for a package they're going to get, they click on that and then you, what
*  is that, what the Israelis have, Pegasus, right?
*  You've read up on this.
*  Yes.
*  Well, it's from Brian Fogel's new film, The Dissident, which is about Jamal Khashoggi's
*  murder and how the Saudis used that to use, they actually tapped into Jeff Bezos' phone
*  and that's where all of the, this is the suspicion, is that that's where all of those National
*  Enquirer photos came out and all the attacks on him because they had access to his actual
*  phone through this.
*  So someone could easily get into your stuff if you're not paying attention and then they
*  could use, you know, whatever acts they've come up with, whatever it's the Patriot Act
*  or whatever act where they could just get into everything you're doing.
*  Look at your WhatsApp messages, look at your Facebook messages.
*  It's real sneaky and it's dangerous.
*  It's a dangerous precedent to set.
*  Yeah, I mean, there's a lot to this.
*  Let me go into some of that in a little depth.
*  So you mentioned the NSO group and their Pegasus malware set and this is very much
*  a real thing.
*  Like you're a well-read guy.
*  This is like, this company, the CEO's name I think is Shalev Julio is run in Israel.
*  It was previously owned actually by an American venture capital firm.
*  I believe they've been re-bought out, but it doesn't really matter.
*  Their entire business is preying on flaws in the critical infrastructure of all the
*  software running on the most popular devices in the world.
*  The number one target, right, is the iPhone.
*  And this is because the iPhone, as secure as it is relative to a lot of other phones,
*  is a monoculture, right?
*  Like if you have an iPhone, you get these little software update notifications all the
*  time that are like, hey, please update to the most recent version of iOS.
*  And that's a fabulous thing.
*  That's a wonderful thing for security because the number one way that people's devices get
*  screwed if it's not just through user error, right?
*  Like you entering your password somewhere you shouldn't.
*  It's like a fake site that looks like Gmail, but it's not actually Gmail.
*  You just gave the guy your password.
*  Now he uses your password to log in.
*  But to actually break into a device is that it's not patched, right?
*  Patch means getting these security updates, these little code updates that fix holes
*  that researchers found in the security device.
*  Well, Apple's really good about rolling these out all the time for everybody in the world.
*  The problem is basically all these different iPhones, right?
*  You got an iPhone 6, you got an iPhone 8, you got an iPhone X, you got an iPhone, you
*  know, 3, whatever.
*  These are all running a pretty narrow band of software versions.
*  And so these guys go, if they want to target, for example, Android phones like Google phones,
*  like a Samsung Galaxy or something like that, there's like a billion different phones made
*  by a billion different people.
*  Half of them are completely out of date.
*  But what it means is it's not one version of software they're running.
*  It's like 10,000.
*  And this is actually bad for security on the individual level, but it's good for security
*  in a very unusual way, which is the guys who are developing the exploits, the guys like
*  this NSO group who are trying to find ways to break into phones, they now have to have
*  like 50 different handsets running 50 different versions of software.
*  They're all changing.
*  They've got different hardware.
*  They've got different chipsets.
*  They've got different, like all kinds of just technical variables that can screw up the
*  way they attack your phone.
*  And then when they find one, it only works on like this Samsung Galaxy line.
*  It doesn't work on like the Google Pixel line or it doesn't work on like a Nokia line or
*  something like that.
*  Whereas they realize if they find a way to attack an iPhone, which is actually, you know,
*  this is difficult.
*  This is really difficult stuff.
*  Now it works against basically every iPhone.
*  And who has iPhones?
*  All the rich people, right?
*  All the important people, all the lawmakers, all the guys who are in there.
*  So they've made a business on basically attacking the iPhone and selling it to every two bit
*  thug who runs a police department in the world.
*  You know, they sell this stuff to Saudi Arabia.
*  They sell this to Mexico.
*  And there's a group of researchers in Canada working at a university called the Citizen
*  Lab.
*  And these guys are really like the best in the world at tracking what NSO group is doing.
*  If you want to learn about this stuff, the real stuff, look up Citizen Lab and the NSO group.
*  And what they have found is all the people who are being targeted by the NSO group, the
*  classes of people, the countries that are using this.
*  And you know, it's not like the local police department in Germany trying to bust up, you
*  know, a terrorism ring or something like that.
*  It's the Mexican government spying on the head of the Mexican opposition.
*  Or trying to look at human rights defenders who are investigating like student disappearances.
*  Or it's people like the friends and associates of Jamal Khashoggi, who was murdered by the
*  Saudi government.
*  Or it's people like dissidents in Bahrain.
*  And these like petro states, these bad actors nationally will pay literally tens of millions
*  of dollars each year just to have the ability to break into an iPhone for a certain number
*  of times.
*  Because that's how these guys do it.
*  They sell their business plan, they go.
*  We'll let you break into any iPhone just by basically sending a text message to this phone.
*  All you need to find is the phone number of a person who's running an iPhone.
*  And we will exploit something, which will give you total control of this.
*  If that happens to someone, I'm sorry, but if that happens to someone, could they just
*  get a new phone?
*  And does the exploit, is the exploit specific to their account?
*  Or is the exploit on the physical phone itself?
*  Well, the answer to this is it really depends on the exploit.
*  Like the easiest forms of exploit, or rather the easier types of exploits, are where they
*  send you a text message, right?
*  And it'll be like an iMessage or something like that.
*  And it's got a link in it that'll be like, oh gosh, terrible news, you know, your buddy's
*  father just died.
*  And we're making funeral arrangements.
*  Are you going to be there?
*  It's the day after tomorrow.
*  And when you click the link for the funeral arrangements, it opens your web browser.
*  And the web browser on your phone is always the biggest, most complicated process in it,
*  right?
*  There's a zillion lines of code in this, as opposed to an instant messenger, where there's
*  fewer lines of code in it.
*  And they'll find one thing in that, where there's a flaw that lets them feed instructions,
*  not just to the browser, but basically escape the little sandbox that the browser's supposed
*  to plan, that's supposed to be safe, where it can't do anything too harmful.
*  It'll run out of this sandbox and it'll ransack your phone's hardwired operating system, the
*  system image.
*  It'll give them privileges to do whatever they want on your phone, as if they are you,
*  and then as if they have a higher level of privilege than you.
*  They have system level privileges to change the phone's operation permanently, right?
*  And this is the problem is on the phone.
*  You can replace the phone, right?
*  And they'll lose access to that.
*  But if they've already used that to gain the passwords that you use to access, you know,
*  your iCloud or whatever, when they have control of the phone, they've already got your photo
*  roll, right?
*  They've already got your contact list.
*  They already have everything that you've ever put in that phone.
*  They already have all your notes.
*  They already have all your files.
*  They already have everything that's in your message history, right?
*  They can pull that out immediately.
*  And now, because they have all your contacts and things like that, they see that phone
*  stop being active, they know you've changed your phone number.
*  All they have to do is find the new phone number and then they can try to go after you
*  again.
*  The benefit is, with that old style of attack, if you get that message and you don't click
*  that link, you're somebody in a vulnerable class, right?
*  You've had these kind of attacks, I mentioned before, it looks suspicious.
*  You don't know who this person is.
*  The number isn't right, something like that.
*  And you save that link.
*  You don't click the link.
*  You don't do anything with that link.
*  But you send it to a group like Citizen Lab.
*  They can basically use that link to basically use a dummy phone, like a Trojan horse, to
*  go to the site that would attack your phone and catch it.
*  And this is the sort of process that all of their research is based on.
*  There are other more advanced types of attacks that actually don't have these defenses against
*  them that are far more scary.
*  But the bottom line is...
*  Can I stop you for a second?
*  What is Citizen Lab?
*  Citizen Lab?
*  You just said that.
*  Yeah, the Citizen Lab is the name of this research group at the University in Canada
*  who basically studies state-sponsored and corporate malware attacks against civil society.
*  It's run by a guy named Ron Deaver, I believe.
*  You guys will have to fact check me on that one.
*  I think he just published a book, actually, or is publishing a book about all of this.
*  They are the world leaders, in my opinion, in basically investigating these kind of attacks
*  and exposing them.
*  It's true public service.
*  Let's go back to that one thing.
*  I asked you about warrants.
*  And you talked about the fact that people could plant evidence on things and then get
*  motivation or rather they could show probable cause to the court to then investigate you.
*  And then they can get everything.
*  And you said, you know, you thought that a warrant man can go and search your house.
*  And this is the kind of thing that we, you know, modern people are used to thinking of
*  in the context of a warrant.
*  Cops go to a specific place looking for specific things that are elements of a crime.
*  Now you know, you've heard all these things where, like, cops find a way to stop somebody
*  and they are like, oh, I smelled pot or whatever and they try to toss their car or whatever
*  or plain sight doctrines where they open the door and the guy sits down and talks to them
*  and they go, oh, you know, I see a bong or something.
*  You know, that's paraphernalia.
*  You're going to jail.
*  But until I think it was 1967, warrants in the United States could only be used to gather
*  two things.
*  They were called the fruits and instrumentalities of a crime, which meant even if the cops knew
*  you did it, even if the cops knew you, you know, rode the subway or worked for this company
*  or whatever, they couldn't get all the company's records.
*  They couldn't, if they existed, get all the emails that you ever wrote.
*  They couldn't get your friend to turn over like an exchange of letters that you had with
*  this person.
*  The fruits of the crime were the things that they gained from it, right?
*  If they robbed the bank, the cops could get the sack of money.
*  The instrumentalities were the tools that were used, right?
*  Like if you used dynamite or a crowbar or a getaway car that could seize all of those
*  things.
*  But the idea that the cops can get everything, the idea that the FBI can get all these records,
*  you know, all of these things, your whole history, is very much a new thing.
*  And nobody talks about that today.
*  We just presume it's normal.
*  We presume it's okay.
*  But between 1967 and today, think about how many more records there are about your life
*  and how things like how you live, private things about you that have nothing to do with
*  criminality and everything to do with the intimacy of who you are.
*  And the fact that all of that now today is exposed and not just to, let's say you love
*  the US government.
*  Let's say you, you know, you are like throwing cookouts for your local police department,
*  but every other government in the world too.
*  And we really need to ask ourselves how much information do the authorities of the day
*  need to do their job?
*  How much do we want them to have?
*  How much is proper and appropriate and necessary?
*  And how much is too much?
*  If we decide the cops shouldn't have this, if we decide the spies shouldn't have this,
*  why in the hell should Facebook or Google or somebody trying to sell you Nikes, why
*  should they have this?
*  Yeah.
*  And what's the answer to that?
*  They shouldn't.
*  Yeah, I mean.
*  Right?
*  But nobody wants to go backwards.
*  Once you have gained a certain amount of access and you could justify that access, like we're
*  stopping crimes like the Patriot Act and then which later the Patriot Act 2, which was even
*  more overreaching.
*  Once they have that kind of power, they never go, you know what, we went too far.
*  We have too much access to your privacy.
*  And even if you've committed a crime, we shouldn't have unrelated access to all these other activities
*  that you're involved in.
*  Yeah.
*  And I mean, that's exactly the thing about the whole Save the Puppies Act, right?
*  If it's got a name like that, you've got to be like, no, there's something doesn't smell
*  right here.
*  This is this is there's something bad in this.
*  This gets back to that initial topic of what did the court decide?
*  Right?
*  So we had the Patriot Act and the Patriot Act was this giant law that had been written
*  long before 9-11.
*  It was just sitting on the shelf and the Department of Justice, the FBI, they knew they couldn't
*  pass this.
*  They knew nobody would live with it because it was an extreme expansion of government
*  authority.
*  And then 9-11 happened.
*  Right.
*  And that's really where it all started to go wrong.
*  That's where we got the rise of this new authoritarianism that we see continuing in the United States
*  today.
*  Right.
*  Like if you think and you know, like you have problems with what's happening under Donald
*  Trump, but you also had problems under like what was happening with Obama and the expansion
*  of the war on whistleblowing.
*  You had problems with the way drone strikes were going out of control.
*  You go, well, really, where did this all start?
*  Right.
*  Where did it start to go wrong?
*  Personally, I think 9-11 was where we made a fundamental mistake.
*  And that was we were so frightened in the moment because we had had such an extraordinary
*  and rare terrorist attack succeed, which by the way, could have been prevented.
*  And I think we discussed this in the last episode.
*  The Congress, you know, they were, they were just terrified.
*  They said, look, intelligence services, cops, FBI, whoever, anything you want, blank check.
*  Here you go.
*  That was the Patriot Act.
*  And at the time groups like the American Civil Liberties Union, they were like, we are worried
*  that this goes too far because God bless them.
*  That's what the American Civil Liberties Union does.
*  And one of the provisions that they had a problem with was this section 215 of the Patriot
*  Act, which I believe they were calling at the time the Library Records Provision.
*  And what it said basically, this tiny little phrase in the law said the FBI can basically
*  get any records that it deems relevant to a counter and terrorism investigation under
*  a warrant.
*  And the worst thing the ACLU could imagine was that these guys would go to the library
*  and get what kind of books you're reading and like shock horror.
*  This is the worst thing these guys could do.
*  And so they protested and they lost.
*  And this passed and it went on.
*  And lo and behold, 10 years later, we find out in 2013, they had used this provision
*  that people were worried about just going after individuals library records to instead
*  get the phone records of not an individual, not a group, but everybody in the United States
*  who was making calls on US telecommunications providers delivered to the NSA daily by these
*  companies.
*  Right.
*  So no matter who you were, no matter how innocent you were, the FBI was getting these because
*  they said, well, every phone call is relevant to a counterterrorism investigation.
*  And the court went finally, you know, this is seven years after 2013, then went guys,
*  too much.
*  If your definition of relevance is basically anything, anywhere, all the time is relevant
*  to a counterterrorism investigation.
*  The question is, what then is not relevant?
*  What is the limiting principle on this?
*  Where is the end?
*  And this is a very important thing because even if it's not enough, right, even if this
*  doesn't shut down all the programs, the program was actually already stopped a few years ago
*  because of previous court decisions and changes in law.
*  The fact that the courts are finally beginning to look at these impacts of these sweeping
*  new technologies that allow governments to see all of these connections and interactions
*  that we're having every day, they're finally putting limits on it.
*  And that is, I think, transformative.
*  It is the foundation of what we will see in the future will begin to be the first meaningful
*  guarantees of privacy rights in the digital age.
*  Now that you have been, at least according to this court, exonerated or justified, what
*  happens to you and what happens to what they've been doing?
*  And how much of the brakes do they hit on this?
*  What changes?
*  Does anything change in the government's sweeping surveillance?
*  It's a great question.
*  I mean, you would think when you get a court, not even a first level court, but an appeals
*  court that looks at these issues, you know, they're talking about serious stuff, they're
*  talking about counterterrorism investigations, by the way, in the same thing, in the same
*  decision, they said the government has been arguing, you know, for 20 years now, these
*  programs were saving lives.
*  They were stopping terrorist attacks.
*  They said, you know, first they said mass surveillance and stop 54 terrorist attacks
*  in the United States.
*  Then they dropped it to seven.
*  And then they dropped it to one.
*  And the one terrorist attack or terrorist conspiracy, whatever, that they said it did
*  stop was this case that was just decided.
*  And the court found, and this is important, after looking at the government's classified
*  evidence.
*  So this is not just the court deciding on their own.
*  This is the government going, look, here's all the evidence that we have, the top secret
*  stuff, the stuff that nobody can see.
*  Please don't, you know, say our program is ineffective or whatever.
*  The court looked at it and they went, holy crap.
*  This invasion of hundreds of millions of Americans' privacy happening over the span of decades
*  did not make a difference in this case.
*  They said even if, or even in the absence of this program, if it hadn't existed, if
*  government had never done it, they still would have busted this ring because they were already
*  closing in on them.
*  The FBI already had all the evidence they needed to get a warrant, to get the records
*  through traditional means.
*  And the fact the government had been saying, Congress had been saying for years and years
*  and years that this program was necessary.
*  The court says that was misleading, which is legalese for saying the government's effing
*  liars on this.
*  So that raises the question of, okay, like as you said, well, what now?
*  How does this change everything?
*  Well it does mean the government has to stop doing this particular kind of program directly,
*  but that program had already shut down.
*  And the government has a really great team of lawyers for every agency, right?
*  The DOJ has got lawyers, the White House has lawyers, the FBI has lawyers, the NSA has
*  lawyers, and CIA has lawyers.
*  And the only thing these guys are paid to do all day is to look at basically these legal
*  opinions from the court that says all the ways the government broke the law and go,
*  huh, is there any way we can just rejigger this program slightly so that we can dodge
*  around that court ruling to go, all right, you know, the abuses are still happening,
*  but they're happening in a less abusive way, and then it's business as usual.
*  So this is always the process with the courts ruling against the government.
*  This is not an exceptional thing in the case of, you know, it's NSA, it's CIA.
*  What happens is when the government breaks the law, as the court has ruled them to do
*  last week, there is no punishment, right?
*  There is no criminal liability for all the bastards, the head of the FBI, the head of
*  the NSA, who were violating Americans' rights for decades.
*  Those guys don't go to prison, they don't lose their jobs, they don't even see the
*  inside, you know, smell the inside of a courtroom where they're the ones wearing handcuffs.
*  And because of that, it creates a culture of unaccountability, of impunity, right?
*  Which means with each generation of government officials, they study this, they study the
*  cases against them, they study where they won, they study where they lost.
*  And what they do is they try to create exactly what just happened, which is a system where
*  they can break the law for 10 years, you know, 2001 to 2013 basically, and no one even knows
*  that it's happening.
*  Classification protects that, right?
*  Then eventually it gets exposed.
*  There's a leak, of course somebody blows the whistle on it, right?
*  It becomes a scandal, the government, you know, they'll disown this program, they'll
*  change the law there, but somebody like the ACLU will sue the government, and so the courts
*  will finally be forced to look at these things.
*  But the wheels of justice turn slow, right?
*  The government will try to put the brakes on it, the plaintiffs, the civil society organizations
*  that are suing will have to gather evidence, it's really difficult to do because the government's
*  not providing anything, it's all classified.
*  And then basically it takes another five years, another 10 years for the court to get to their
*  verdict and then we have it.
*  But then nobody goes to jail, right?
*  Nobody actually faces serious consequences who is responsible for the wrongdoing, and
*  so the cycle continues.
*  But having said that, like it might feel disempowering, people might go, oh, we can't win.
*  But this is in the context of a system where we lack accountability, where the government
*  does have a culture of impunity.
*  This is what winning looks like, because things do get better.
*  The problem is they get better by decades, they get better by half centuries and centuries.
*  If you look at the United States, you know, 200 years ago, 100 years ago, things were
*  objectively worse on basically every measure.
*  The fact that we have to crawl to the future is a sad thing when we know it could be fixed
*  very quickly by establishing some kind of criminal liability for people like James Clapper,
*  the former director of national intelligence, who lied under oath to Congress and the American
*  people saying exactly this program didn't exist.
*  The NSA wasn't collecting any information on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans
*  when in fact they were doing that every day.
*  Obama did not fire him, right?
*  Obama did not charge him.
*  Obama let him serve out the end of his days and then retire happily.
*  But it's not an Obama problem, right?
*  We see the same kinds of abuses happening under the Trump administration.
*  We saw the same kind of abuses happening under the Bush administration.
*  And the only way this changes materially is if our government changes structurally, right?
*  And that's kind of the issue that I think everybody in the country sees.
*  When you look at the economy, when you look at all the struggle, when you look at all
*  the class conflict and divide and the political partisanship that's happening today, the problem
*  isn't about this law or this court ruling or this agency.
*  It's about inequality of opportunity, of access, even of privilege, right?
*  I know people don't like talking about that.
*  It's uncomfortable.
*  People are like, oh my God, are you like whatever.
*  But the reality is we have a few people in the country, the Jeff Bezos, the Bill Gates
*  that own everything, like 10 people owning half the country and half the country owning
*  nothing at all.
*  And this applies to influence, right?
*  When you have that kind of disproportionality of resources, you have that kind of disproportionality
*  of influence.
*  Your vote means less.
*  Your ability to change the law means less.
*  Your access to the courts means less.
*  And that's how we end up in the situation where we are today.
*  That's very disheartening.
*  Well, it doesn't have to be because the important thing is we can change it.
*  Can we though?
*  I mean, like what can we do and what can anybody change at this point to stop this overwhelming
*  power that the government has to invade your privacy and to all the things that you exposed.
*  When you talk about how the particular program that was in place has been shut down, but
*  all they do is manipulate it slightly, do it so that you can argue in court that it's
*  not the same thing, that it's a different thing, come up with other justifications for
*  it and withhold evidence and then drag the process out for years and years and years.
*  And for you to be so optimistic is really kind of spectacular considering the fact that
*  you've been hiding in another country, allegedly.
*  You might be in Ohio.
*  We don't know.
*  You know, we don't know.
*  But you are essentially on the lam and for exposing something that has now been determined
*  to be illegal.
*  So you are correct.
*  When you go back to Obama's hope and what was his website?
*  Hope and Change.
*  Hope and Change.
*  A big part of Hope and Change was protecting whistleblowers.
*  Do you remember that?
*  And that was all deleted later.
*  Later on, they were like, yeah, let's go back and take that shit out.
*  We didn't know.
*  I didn't know what it was like to actually be president back then.
*  I was just trying to get in there.
*  But the Hope and Change stuff was still there when you were being tried.
*  Was still there when they were chasing you and trying to find your location.
*  When the Guardian article came out, the Hope and Change shit was still online.
*  The fact that you're so optimistic, even though you've been fucked over royally.
*  You are, in my opinion, you're a hero.
*  I really think that.
*  And I really think that what you exposed is hugely important for the American citizens.
*  To understand that absolute power corrupts absolutely.
*  And these people had the ability to look into everything.
*  And they still do.
*  They have the ability to look into everything you're doing.
*  And the fact that through these years, it literally stopped zero terrorist attacks.
*  Zero.
*  So this sweeping, overwhelming intrusion of your privacy had no impact whatsoever on your
*  safety.
*  Well, it wasn't about safety.
*  It was about power.
*  Right?
*  They told us it was about safety.
*  That was, again, it's the Save the Puppies Act.
*  If you see government saying all these things for safety, they're protecting you.
*  And they never establish the efficacy of it.
*  The chances are it probably isn't effective.
*  Because the government leaks all the time.
*  If they say, we saved this person, we did that.
*  Whenever they're being criticized, they go on TV and they very seriously go, oh, that's
*  classified and we can't expose that.
*  You never hear of the successes we do because it's so important that they stay secret.
*  Look, I worked for the CIA, I worked for the NSA.
*  That's bullshit.
*  When they do something great, it's on the front page of the New York Times by the end
*  of the day.
*  Because they're fighting for budget.
*  They're fighting for clout.
*  They're fighting for authority.
*  They're fighting for new laws.
*  Not constantly.
*  So there are no real accomplishments that are in the shadows that they just don't tell
*  us about.
*  I mean, very rarely.
*  Think about when we got Bin Laden.
*  Right?
*  I want a press conference within the next 20 minutes.
*  Again, this is not to bag on Obama.
*  Any president would do this.
*  That's just how it is.
*  Of course, there are some secret successes, but it's about stuff that no one cares about.
*  It's stuff that wouldn't win them political clout.
*  It's like they gained an advantage negotiating position on the price of shrimp and clove
*  cigarettes, which was actually one of the stories that came out of some kind of classified
*  disclosure that I think was from WikiLeaks.
*  That kind of stuff, it actually does happen.
*  But we're never having a conversation of, do you want to give up all of your privacy
*  rights so that we can get better prices on shrimp and clove cigarettes?
*  That would be a very different political conversation than, do you want to give up all of your privacy
*  rights because if you don't, your children will die.
*  Save the puppies.
*  Right, exactly.
*  Save the puppies 2020.
*  This thing you ask about me and optimism, I have been criticized relentlessly for being
*  a naive optimist.
*  My answer is that you don't do what I did unless you believe that people can do better.
*  I took a very comfortable life.
*  I was living in Hawaii with the woman that I loved.
*  I had to do basically no work but go in the office and read spy feeds about people all
*  day long.
*  I could have done that for the rest of my life quite happily.
*  It would have been great.
*  I set that on fire because I believed that what I saw was wrong.
*  I believed that people deserve to know about it.
*  I believed that if people did know about it, that things would change.
*  I did not believe it was going to save the world.
*  I did not believe I was going to get a ticker tape parade and a pardon, be welcomed with
*  open arms.
*  There's actually, if you watch Citizen 4, which is the documentary from 2013 where I
*  was meeting with reporters and Laura Poitras had the camera rolling in the room when we
*  talked for the first time.
*  I said the government's going to say I harm national security.
*  I put everybody in jeopardy.
*  They're going to charge me under the Espionage Act.
*  They really did try to destroy my life.
*  They tried to put me in prison forever.
*  To this day, they are still trying to do the same thing.
*  That's just how it is.
*  This wasn't like- Even though-
*  Even though, yeah.
*  Even though the most recent ruling has showed that you were correct and what they were doing
*  was illegal and you exposed a crime.
*  This is a continuing story.
*  In 2013, when this first came out, President Obama went out on stage because he was getting
*  singed in the press and said, take it from me, nobody is listening to your phone calls.
*  Even though nobody said-
*  Just metadata.
*  Yeah, nobody said they were listening to your phone calls.
*  It wasn't like they had headsets on.
*  300 plus million people in the United States, you'd have to have computers do that.
*  But what they did do was they collected the records of your phone calls and to an analyst,
*  to an intelligence analyst, that's more valuable than the transcripts of your phone calls.
*  We care less about what you said on the phone than who you called, when you called them,
*  what else you were doing, what your phone was doing, the websites that you had accessed,
*  the cell phone towers they were connected to.
*  All of those things, that metadata creates what's called the social graph, your pattern
*  of life.
*  It says based on when your phone becomes active in the morning, when you start calling people,
*  when you start browsing, when you check your Twitter feed, you're scrolling on Instagram,
*  whatever, that's when you wake up.
*  When it stops, that's when you go to sleep.
*  We see where you are, we see where you live, we see who you live with, all of those things.
*  That's just from metadata.
*  You don't need the content of your communications.
*  I don't need to see what picture you posted on Instagram to know you're awake and active
*  and you're communicating with this person at this phone, this place, this area code,
*  this IP address, this version of software, whether they're using Android or iOS, all
*  of these things.
*  Now as we get smartphones, as your cars begin connecting to the internet, it's just richer
*  and richer and richer data.
*  I don't know where I was going with that.
*  Sorry.
*  I got off topic.
*  The bottom line is things get better.
*  They get better slowly.
*  Oh right, sorry.
*  Now Obama was saying, you know, nobody listens to your phone calls, right?
*  That was June 2013.
*  By January of 2014, giving a State of the Union address, he went, although he could
*  never condone what I did, the conversation that I started has made us stronger as a nation.
*  He was calling for the end of this program, the passage of a new law called the USA Freedom
*  Act, another Save the Puppies Act, which was better than the thing it was replacing, but
*  still really bad.
*  And he did that not out of the goodness of his heart.
*  He did that because the court in December of 2013 had ruled these programs were unlawful
*  and likely unconstitutional.
*  And this is again, it's not an Obama thing.
*  It's a power thing.
*  This is how the system works, right?
*  But year by year, step by step, things get better.
*  We make progress a little bit at a time.
*  And the fact that someone is suing, the fact that the ACLU is bringing this case, and we
*  should thank them for that, for years, which is a difficult and expensive proposition with
*  no guarantee of success, means that we have stronger privacy rights seven years later
*  as a result.
*  That doesn't mean we save the world.
*  That doesn't mean we relax.
*  We sit down on the couch, you know, there's the golden sunset.
*  That's not how life works.
*  It is a constant struggle.
*  But when we do struggle, when we do stand up, we believe in something so strongly, we
*  don't merely believe in it.
*  But we risk something for that belief.
*  We work together and we pull the species forward an inch at a time.
*  We move away from that swamp of impunity and unaccountability into a future where,
*  hey, maybe not just the little guy breaks the law and goes to jail, but maybe a senator,
*  maybe an attorney general, maybe a president, right?
*  And that would be a very good precedent to have.
*  Do you wonder whether or not someone will use you as a political chess piece at this
*  point and decide?
*  I mean, I believe, correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure you have overwhelming
*  support of the general public.
*  Most people believe that what you did was a good thing for America and that you are
*  in fact a patriot.
*  I think the vast majority of people and the people that I've talked to, I have talked
*  to a few people that disagree with that, they're misinformed.
*  They were misinformed about what you did and what information you leaked or whether or
*  not people's lives were put in danger because of that.
*  I had to explain the whole chain of events and where the information actually was, how
*  it was leaked and what you had done to protect people.
*  Could you please explain that?
*  Because it wasn't just that the information was dumped.
*  Yeah.
*  So I mean, this is really the subject of our last conversation.
*  It goes on for three hours, but I wrote a book.
*  Yeah, but I just want just to, so this will stand alone.
*  Yeah, I'll go through it.
*  So the idea, and this is the subject of my first book, Permanent Record, which was why
*  I came on last year and actually just this week, the soft cover came out so it's more
*  affordable for people who didn't want to get it before, is this story, right?
*  It's who I am, where I came from, why I did this, how and what it meant.
*  I didn't just reveal information.
*  I gave it to journalists, right?
*  These journalists were only given access to the information on the condition that they
*  would publish no story simply because it was newsworthy or interesting, right?
*  They weren't going to clickbait classified documents.
*  They would only publish stories if they were willing to make an independent institutional
*  judgment and stand by it, that it was in the public interest that this be known, right?
*  And then as an extraordinary measure on top of that, before they published the stories,
*  right?
*  It's not me publishing things, putting them out on the internet or blog or something,
*  which I could have done, would have been very easy.
*  It's not me telling them what to write or not to write.
*  They're doing this, The Guardian, The Washington Post, Der Spiegel.
*  They are then going to the United States government in advance of publication and giving the government
*  a chance, an adversarial opportunity to argue against publication, to go, you guys don't
*  get it.
*  These documents are false.
*  Or he's not lying.
*  And yes, these are true, but these programs are effective.
*  They're saving lives, whatever.
*  And here's what we can show you to convince you, please don't publish this or leave out
*  this detail.
*  And in every case, I'm aware of that process was followed.
*  And that's why now in 2020, remember, we're seven years on from 2013, the government has
*  never shown a single example of any harm that has come as a result of the publication of
*  these documents back in 2013, the Revelation of Mass Surveillance.
*  That's what I wanted to bring up.
*  Yeah.
*  And I mean, it's unscientific, but I've seen polls run on Twitter very recently in the
*  last few weeks when this pardon question came out, where 90%, like 90 plus percent of people
*  were in favor of a pardon.
*  And that's crazy.
*  Even in 2013, when we were doing well, it was like 60% in favor among young people,
*  but it was like 40% for older people.
*  But that's because the government was on TV every Sunday, bringing these CIA suits going,
*  who were there with their very stern faces going, oh, this caused great damage and it
*  cost lives and everything like that.
*  But those arguments stopped being convincing when seven years later, after they told us
*  the sky is falling, the atmosphere never catches fire, the oceans never boil off, we're still
*  alive.
*  And I think people can see through that.
*  And that was, again, exactly what you said.
*  People don't know this history, that 10% who were against it, and actually a lot of the
*  90% who are even in favor of it, they don't know the details.
*  It wasn't well covered by the media at the time.
*  It was all about this person said that, that person said that.
*  Is it true?
*  And I think that's sort of, they were playing on character.
*  They were trying to make a drama out of it.
*  And that's a big part of why I wrote Permanent Record.
*  And it's been tremendously gratifying to see people connect to it.
*  And actually, I mentioned it, we talked on Twitter when we were talking about the possibility
*  of having this conversation.
*  And I was like, I looked back at our first conversation we had, and it's had like 16
*  million views.
*  That's for a three hour conversation.
*  And then probably an equal amount of people just listened to it in audio.
*  Right.
*  And that was just for one clip on YouTube.
*  There were smaller clips talking about cell phone surveillance, and that was like another
*  10 million views, 77,000 comments.
*  The book on Amazon has thousands of reviews.
*  It's got a 4.8 rating, which by the number of people and how it's rated, that's one
*  of the best autobiographies, according to ordinary people, the audience in like years.
*  And to see that after these years of attacks, to me is evidence that despite all these news
*  guys at night going, well, Senator, you know, no one really cares about privacy these days,
*  these kids with their Facebooks and their Instagrams, you know, people do care.
*  What they're actually feeling is kind of what you got to earlier with like this sensation
*  that nothing changes, like even when we win, we lose.
*  But the thing is, you've got to have a broader view of time.
*  You've got to look at the sweep of history rather than the atmosphere of the moment,
*  because right now, yes, things are very bad.
*  And even if you love Donald Trump, because I know some of your viewers do, you got to
*  admit a lot of things in the world suck right now.
*  A lot of things in the country suck right now.
*  But the thing is, they only get better if somebody does the hard work to make them better.
*  And there's no magic wand, there's no happy ending, right?
*  Life is not that simple.
*  But together, we can make it better.
*  And we do that through struggle.
*  Do you, has there been any discussion about someone pardoning you?
*  Has there been, I mean, this was the question initially that led to this, but I wanted you
*  to expand on what actually went down.
*  Has there been any discussion about you being pardoned or someone using you as, like I said,
*  a political chess piece?
*  Because it would be a smart thing.
*  And if anybody has had a problem with the intelligence community, it is Donald Trump.
*  I mean, he's the only president in any memory that has had open disagreements and been openly
*  disparaging of the intelligence community.
*  Well, that's not true.
*  He's JFK.
*  That didn't go very long.
*  That's right.
*  I forgot about that.
*  Good point.
*  Yeah, that went terrible for him.
*  For Trump, it actually seems to be a positive in some strange way.
*  If anybody is going to pardon you, I would imagine that would be the guy.
*  So this idea of the political bargaining chip has actually been used in a different way.
*  There was the idea, and it's funny because this was actually promoted by all these CIA
*  deputy directors and whatnot, who were responsible for these abuses of Americans' rights, who
*  were writing opinion pieces in the newspaper and they were like, you know, what if Vladimir
*  Putin sends Snowden to Trump as an inauguration gift?
*  Wouldn't that be terrible for him?
*  And they were like, hint, hint.
*  I don't think when we talk about this stuff, I don't think there's anything I can do to
*  control it.
*  One of the things people have asked is like, what I accept a pardon from Donald Trump.
*  And I think that in a sense apprehends what a pardon is and how it works.
*  A pardon is not a contract.
*  A pardon is not something that you agree to.
*  A pardon is a constitutionally enumerated power.
*  I think it's Article 2, Section 2, where the reason that it exists is basically a check
*  on the laws and the judiciary, where the laws as written become corrosive to the intention
*  of them.
*  And this is something that I think actually is meaningful.
*  You know, people are like, are you going to ask Donald Trump for a pardon?
*  And the answer is no.
*  But I will ask for pardon for Terry Albury and Daniel Hale and Reality Winner and all
*  the other American whistleblowers who have been treated unfairly by this system.
*  The whole thing that brought this up was two weeks ago, some journalist asked the president
*  like, oh, you know, what do you think about Snowden?
*  Are you going to pardon him?
*  And he said he seemed to be thinking about it.
*  He heard I had been treated very unfairly.
*  It's accurate because it's impossible to get a fair trial under the Espionage Act,
*  which is what I've been charged under.
*  And every American whistleblower since Daniel Ellsberg in the 1970s has been charged under
*  this law, the Espionage Act, which makes no distinction between someone who is stealing
*  secrets and selling them to foreign governments, which neither I nor any of these other people
*  have done, and giving them freely to journalists to advance the public interest of the American
*  people rather than the private interest of these spies individually.
*  And this is the kind of circumstance for which the pardon power exists, where the courts
*  will not or cannot end a fundamentally unfair and abusive circumstance in the United States,
*  either because they're fearful of being criticized, soft on terrorism or whatever, or because
*  the law prohibits them from doing so.
*  The problem with the Espionage Act is it means you can't tell the jury why you did what you
*  did.
*  You cannot mount what's called a public interest offense, where you say, hell yeah, I'm going
*  to break the law.
*  I took a classified document and I gave it to the journalists, and the journalists published
*  it and then it went to the courts and the court said, this guy was right.
*  The government was breaking the law.
*  In the courts, if I were in prison today, as reality winner is in prison today, or rather
*  Daniel Hale, who revealed government abuses related to the drone program, or Terry Albury,
*  who revealed problems with racial policies in the FBI, how they were being abused.
*  When these guys are on trial, all of that stuff is forbidden from being spoken.
*  Daniel Ellsberg's lawyer asked Daniel Ellsberg, why did you do it?
*  In court, in open court, under oath, why did you publish or provide to journalists the
*  Pentagon Papers?
*  And the prosecutor said, objection, objection.
*  He can't say that.
*  And the judge said, sustained, fine, he can't say it.
*  And his attorney looked at the judge like he was crazy and said, I've never heard of
*  a trial where the jury is not allowed to hear why a defendant did what they did.
*  And the judge said, well, you're seeing one now.
*  And this is why the pardon power exists.
*  Well, that's what's so creepy about something like the Espionage Act.
*  If you can't even establish a motive, you can't even explain that you were doing this
*  for the American people, that there's a real precedent that should be set for this kind
*  of thing, especially in regards to what you're being charged with, which has now been determined
*  that you were exposing something that was, in fact, illegal.
*  And this is, it's an incredibly un-American thing.
*  It's very un-American.
*  It really is.
*  It's disturbingly so.
*  We see these kind of injustices happening in the United States every day, and it's not
*  about the Espionage Act specifically.
*  You see it with drug charges.
*  You see it with civil forfeiture, asset forfeiture, where they take an old lady's car because
*  her nephew was selling weed or something like that, and there's no way for her to get it
*  back.
*  Whether we're talking civil, whether we're talking federal, whether we're talking civil
*  or criminal, whether we're talking federal or state, we see where the system of laws
*  in the United States is letting people down constantly.
*  But the question becomes, how do we fix this?
*  How does that get addressed?
*  And you can mount a national campaign.
*  You can try to change the law.
*  But as we talked about before, unless you're Jeff Bezos, unless you're Bill Gates, that's
*  very difficult to do.
*  But the governor can pardon people for state crimes.
*  The president can pardon people for federal crimes.
*  But we have not developed a compassionate culture that actually looks at this.
*  Every president has abused their pardon power or their pardon authority to sort of let their
*  cronies off the hook.
*  We've seen it under this president.
*  We've seen it under previous presidents.
*  But it is very difficult to establish an understanding among average people that it's actually okay
*  for presidents to use this power more liberally when particularly we're talking about nonviolent
*  offenses, when we're talking about things that have not, you know, they're not that
*  controversial.
*  But they are being controversialized because of the political atmosphere of partisanship
*  where everything has to be criticized for political advantage from one side or the other.
*  Everything's become a football.
*  Well, particularly in your case, when you're talking about polls that show 90% of people
*  support you being pardoned and this recent ruling that what you exposed was illegal.
*  I wonder how much the president actually knows about your case.
*  You know, because he's famous for barely paying attention in briefings.
*  And, you know, I mean, I just I can't imagine that in 2013, this was fully on his radar
*  where he investigated it and read all the documents and really got deep into it.
*  I can't imagine he really knows everything that went down.
*  I bet he hasn't seen Citizen Four.
*  I mean, I bet I sure I really you know, I mean, I mean, I just I listen if I had his
*  number I really would.
*  And I do know people who know him and I am going to communicate that after this conversation.
*  I think that would be I literally think that would win him a tremendous amount of political
*  favor.
*  I really do.
*  I think particularly at this point in time where people are really like if there's ever
*  a time where people are fed up about the overreaching power of government, it's during this pandemic
*  lockdown, you know, for good or for bad, whether it's incorrect or incorrect.
*  People are very frustrated right now with power.
*  They're very frustrated right now with the draconian measures that some states have put
*  in place to keep people from working and in their eyes, keep people safe.
*  All this would contribute to the motivation to to pardon you, because I think that it
*  would show people that the president actually does agree that there have been some overreaches.
*  And in your case, not just an overreach, but a miscarriage of justice, a disgusting un-American
*  overreach.
*  I think when you ask this question about like how much does he know about the case, it's
*  fair to say not a lot because he's intentionally being misadvised by his advisors.
*  You've had the attorney general William Barr who says he would be vehemently opposed to
*  a pardon for me.
*  His secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has literally I think said I should be killed, John Bolton
*  at least said I should be killed.
*  And you know, I think when this conversation first came up a couple weeks ago, Mike Pompeo
*  probably hid every pen in the White House because he's trying to make sure things like
*  this don't happen.
*  I think there are a lot of people who try and control the president.
*  But this whole question about what's right for me, what's right for the president in
*  terms of political advantage is the wrong question.
*  This is why I haven't been advocating for pardon.
*  I didn't ask for a pardon from Obama.
*  I did ask for pardon for Chelsea Manning, which we didn't get, but we did get clemency.
*  And that's an important thing.
*  Because what we need is we need for pardons to be made not as a question of political
*  advantage but as a decision taken to further the public interest.
*  And this is why I say pardon all of these previous whistleblowers, Thomas Drake, John
*  Kiriakou, Terry Albury, reality winner Daniel Hale.
*  There are many names, Daniel Ellsberg, right?
*  He wasn't convicted, so he got out.
*  But these people deserve recognition as the patriots who stood up and took a risk for
*  the rest of us that they are.
*  Look at the current cases, right?
*  They don't even require an exercise of the pardon authority.
*  Julian Assange right now, today, is in court in the UK fighting an extradition trial to
*  the United States.
*  For those who don't remember, this is the guy who's the head of WikiLeaks, right?
*  And he really fell out of favor in 2016 because he published the Hillary emails and everything
*  like that, or Podesta emails.
*  But he's not being charged for that.
*  The extradition trial has nothing to do with that.
*  The U.S. government under William Barr, the current attorney general, is trying to extradite
*  this guy and put him in prison for the rest of his life for the best work that WikiLeaks
*  ever did.
*  That has won awards in every country basically around the planet, including the United States,
*  which is the Iraq and Afghanistan war logs, right?
*  Detainee records in Guantanamo Bay, things that are about explicit war crimes and abuses
*  of power, torture and people who were killed who should have been killed, violations of
*  use of force protocols and all of these things, right?
*  And this could all be made to go away if William Barr, the attorney general, simply dropped
*  the charges.
*  And he should.
*  Why isn't he?
*  Well Julian Assange has literally been tortured.
*  I mean the guy was locked in that embassy for how many years with no exposure to daylight,
*  he's completely trapped.
*  And you've seen videos of him skateboarding around the embassy.
*  It looks like he's going crazy in there.
*  And now he's in jail and on trial.
*  The whole thing is, it's so disturbing because when it boils down to like what did he do
*  that is illegal?
*  What did he do that people disagree with, that people in the United States disagree
*  with in terms of the citizens?
*  He exposed horrific crimes.
*  He exposed things that were deeply, that the United States citizens are deeply opposed
*  to.
*  And the fact that that is something that you in this country can be prosecuted for, that
*  they would try to extradite you and drag you from another country, they'd kick him out
*  of the embassy and bring him back to the United States to try him for that.
*  It seems like we're talking about some kangaroo court.
*  It seems like we're talking about some dictatorship where you have these, no protection of freedom
*  of speech, no protection under the First Amendment, no protection under the rights of the press.
*  It's so disturbing that there are workarounds for our constitution, our bill of rights that
*  we all just agree to, just accept that this is happening.
*  There's no riots in the streets for this.
*  No one's up in arms that they're trying to extradite Julian Assange.
*  It's not in the news.
*  For whatever reason, the mainstream news has barely covered it over his current court proceedings
*  in the UK.
*  I think a lot of this comes down to the fact that they see Julian Assange, by this day
*  I mean a lot of the mainstream media, the broadcast outlets, as a partisan figure.
*  It's really sad because the most dangerous thing about the charges against Julian Assange
*  is if they extradite Julian Assange, if Julian Assange is convicted, he's charged under the
*  Espionage Act, the same act that I'm charged under, the same thing that all these whistleblowers
*  are charged under, but he is not a source.
*  The way as abusive as these Espionage Act charges have run in the last 50 years is the government
*  had a quiet agreement.
*  They never charge the press outlets.
*  They never charge the New York Times.
*  They never charge the Washington Post.
*  They don't charge the journalists.
*  They charge their sources.
*  They charge the Chelsea Mannings.
*  They charge the Edward Snowdens.
*  They charge the Thomas Drakes, the Daniel Ellsbergs.
*  But the press, they're left alone.
*  They are breaking that agreement with the Julian Assange case.
*  Assange is not the source.
*  He is merely a publisher.
*  He runs a press organization.
*  People are like, oh, Julian Assange is not a journalist.
*  He's not whatever.
*  There is no way you can make that argument in court in a way that will be defensible,
*  particularly given what we've talked about with the government and how careful they are
*  to avoid prior court precedents and to work around it and create obscure legal theories
*  that are legal fictions.
*  Everyone knows they're a lie.
*  Everyone knows these theories are false.
*  But under the law, they've been just enough that they can pass the argument through and
*  get the conviction they want.
*  You cannot convict Julian Assange, the chief editor and publisher of WikiLeaks, under
*  the Espionage Act without exposing the New York Times, the Washington Post, CBS, ABC,
*  NBC, CNN, Fox, whoever, to the same kind of charges under this president and every coming
*  president.
*  And I think people don't think about that.
*  That is disturbing.
*  There's many things that are disturbing about this case.
*  But another thing that's been disturbing was he was a guy who the left supported up until
*  2016.
*  And then it became inconvenient.
*  When he was dragging Bush, it was great.
*  Then when he's dragging Clinton, it's not so great.
*  Right, right.
*  When the footage was revealed from the, I believe it was a helicopter that was collateral
*  murder.
*  Remember that video that was put out in Iraq?
*  It was a Apache helicopter in Iraq firing on two Reuters journalists who were embedded
*  with local militants or something.
*  Yes, exactly.
*  That was the left's, he was the darling of the left.
*  They were all free Julian Assange.
*  It's so interesting how that narrative can shift so completely to all of a sudden he's
*  a puppet of Russia.
*  And that's what it became in 2016.
*  And that propaganda stuck.
*  And people who were pro-Julian Assange before, now all of a sudden, I've seen these people
*  say, fuck WikiLeaks and fuck Julian Assange.
*  That guy is a puppet of Russia.
*  How much have you looked into this?
*  It's amazing how that kind of propaganda, when you just get the surface veneer of whatever
*  the narrative that is they're trying to push, how well it spreads that all these people
*  who were these educated left-wing people now all of a sudden were anti-WikiLeaks.
*  And I'm like, do you not remember how this whole thing got started?
*  It was the Iraq War, which we all opposed.
*  Do you not remember this whole bullshit lie about the weapons of mass destruction that
*  got us into this crazy war?
*  Julian Assange and WikiLeaks exposed so much of this.
*  And yet here we are in 2016, it turns up on its head, and now he's a puppet of Russia
*  and WikiLeaks is bad because, inconveniently, the information that he released damaged Hillary
*  Clinton's campaign.
*  I think a lot of it comes down to people forgetting what principles are and why they're important.
*  You can hate Julian Assange.
*  You can think Julian Assange is a puppet of Russia.
*  You can think he's the worst person on earth, right?
*  He's a reincarnation of Hitler or Stalin or whatever, and still realize that convicting
*  him harms you.
*  It harms your society.
*  It harms your children's future.
*  People forget about this in today's world where everything's become partisan, but the
*  ACLU cut their teeth.
*  They made their reputation on defending a Nazi march through a Jewish neighborhood.
*  And this is because it's about the right to assembly, the right to freedom of speech.
*  You do not have a right to be free from offense, right?
*  There is no constitutional right to a safe space.
*  But that doesn't mean you do nothing.
*  That doesn't mean you have no opinion.
*  That doesn't mean you have no political power.
*  What it does mean is that you have to recognize that everyone has the right to their own opinion,
*  even terrible opinions.
*  What we have to protect is the speech, is the platform, is the assembly, is the association,
*  is the process that allows us to understand and recognize and identify when people did
*  break the law, when they did harm others to go to a fair trial where the jury can consider
*  why they did what they did, what they did, and not just whether it was legal or illegal,
*  whether it was moral or immoral, whether it was right or whether it was wrong, and whether
*  they are the lowest person, the most ordinary citizen in the country, or the highest elected
*  official hold them to the same standard of behavior, the same rule of law.
*  Whereas today, we call them public officials and private citizens, but with all of the
*  surveillance, all of the data collection, people in power, commercially or governmentally,
*  they know everything about us.
*  And we know nothing about them.
*  We break the smallest law, we go to jail, we get a fine, we get screwed, we can't get
*  a job, we can't get a loan.
*  But if they flagrantly abuse their office, their authority, they get a pass, they go
*  on the speaker's circuit.
*  It's all sunshine and rainbows for them.
*  And the way we change these things is remembering our principles and being willing to stand
*  and defend them.
*  It's also instinctual for people to be partisan, and it's tribal, it's a tribal thing.
*  And in this day and age, people are rabidly partisan.
*  And the rejection of nuance is so disturbing to me.
*  And it's so disturbing that a lot of this happens from the left now.
*  Whereas the left used to be all about freedom of speech.
*  The ACLU is, I mean, it's just, you automatically think of the liberal people when you think
*  of the ACLU.
*  The ACLU, just for the record, is a nonpartisan organization.
*  Yes.
*  But supported overwhelmingly by left-wing people.
*  I mean, obviously they are nonpartisan.
*  But people are so partisan today that this rejection of nuance, it's so easy for people
*  to look at things as left versus right and ignore all of the sins of their team and concentrate
*  on defeating the other side.
*  And it seems to be a giant part of the problem today, so much so that people are in favor,
*  a lot of people are in favor of deplatforming people that just simply disagree with them.
*  And I want to talk to you about that because that seems to be a gigantic issue, not seems
*  to be.
*  It is a gigantic issue with social media, whether it's with Twitter or YouTube or many
*  things.
*  In fact, Unity 2020 is something that my friend Brett Weinstein is putting together, this
*  idea that we should look across both parties for people that are reasonable and rational
*  and look at what we agree with rather than simply sitting on partisan policy, on party
*  lines and only voting blue across the board or red across the board.
*  And let's look at reasonable people from both sides, whether it's Dan Crenshaw and Tulsi
*  Gabbard or whoever it is that are, they represent different parties, but they're both reasonable
*  people, let's get them together and have these communications.
*  They were banned from Twitter.
*  They were simply banned from Twitter for simply saying, reject both Trump and Biden, look
*  for a third choice.
*  So there's nothing offensive about what they did.
*  In fact, they're encouraging choice.
*  They're encouraging this idea that we don't have to be a two party system, that in fact,
*  even though we have had Libertarian and Green parties, we kind of look at it like bullshit.
*  It's like a protest vote.
*  If you vote Green party, you know you're not going to elect that person for president.
*  It's kind of like we tolerate it.
*  But when someone like Ross Perot came around, it threw a monkey wrench into the gears and
*  became very dangerous for both sides because the Republicans lost a lot of votes and that's
*  how Bill Clinton got into office and George H.W. Bush did not get a second term directly
*  because of the influence of Ross Perot.
*  So they changed the requirements for getting into the debates and everything became very
*  different and very more complicated after that.
*  The fact that Twitter would be willing to ban Unity 2020 specifically because they're
*  calling for people to walk away from this idea that you have to either vote for Trump
*  or Biden and trying to get mainstream acceptance of a potential third party candidate is extremely
*  disturbing.
*  But deplatforming in general, I think is extremely disturbing because it's a slippery slope.
*  If you decide that someone has views that are opposite of yours and they bother you,
*  those views bother you, and you could do whatever you can to get them off of a platform, it's
*  very dangerous because someone from the right who gains power or someone from an opposing
*  party that gains power, if they get into a position of power in social media, if they
*  own a gigantic social media company like Twitter or YouTube, and they decide in turn to go
*  after people that agree with your ideology, then we have a freedom of speech issue.
*  And you're literally supporting the suppression of freedom of speech if you're supporting
*  deplatforming people on social media.
*  And I've always thought that the answer to someone saying something you disagree with
*  or someone saying something you vehemently oppose is a better argument.
*  That's what it's supposed to be.
*  It's supposed to be you should expose the problems and what they're doing.
*  And I'm seeing so many people, particularly on the left, that are happy when people get
*  deplatformed and people that just are contrary to their perspective, contrary to their ideology.
*  And I think it's very dangerous and it's too easy.
*  It's too easy to accept.
*  And this goes back to what you're saying.
*  This partisan viewpoint that we have today, fiercely, rabidly partisan in a way that I've
*  never seen in my life.
*  Yeah, I think the question of deplatforming, this is one of the central issues of our time
*  that's really overlooked and it's underappreciated.
*  So many people on both sides are in favor of this when it's somebody they don't like.
*  Right?
*  Yes.
*  The central issue is this.
*  Do we want companies deciding what can and cannot be said?
*  Do we want governments deciding what can and cannot be said?
*  If the answer is yes, it is a very different kind of society than what we have had traditionally.
*  I do think we need to understand where this impulse came from, how it came to be, and
*  why it seemed reasonable.
*  And a lot of people forget this.
*  And it came from ISIS.
*  If you remember, the Islamic State was all over YouTube, they were all over Twitter,
*  they were all over Facebook, and they were literally burning people alive in cages.
*  They were beheading people, pushing people up buildings, just horrible stuff.
*  And that raises a tough question for a lot of these companies.
*  Now, it's very easy to make the argument that, all right, this is a direct call for violence.
*  This is literally supporting terrorism.
*  And as a private company, we have no obligation to let people use our platforms.
*  Therefore, we're closing their accounts.
*  Right?
*  We're shutting this off.
*  We're erasing it.
*  We can do whatever we want.
*  It's our website.
*  Don't like it, leave.
*  Constitutionally, there's no freedom of speech issue implicated there because the Constitution
*  restrains the federal government and the state governments in certain circumstances.
*  Not private companies.
*  But once that precedent had been established, that they would do this for ISIS, they started
*  going, well, what about these other people?
*  What about these things that could be construed as calls to violence?
*  Okay, what if they're not violence at all?
*  What if it's harassment?
*  What if it's abuse?
*  What if it's racism?
*  What if it's, you know, criminality?
*  What if it's drug culture?
*  What if it's pornography?
*  What if it's whatever?
*  And there will always be more what ifs.
*  And the categories of prohibited speech will constantly expand.
*  So we need to ask ourselves, well, who is best placed to make those decisions about
*  what can and cannot be said?
*  Traditionally, the access to broadcast was limited.
*  You had radio, you had TV.
*  If you didn't have that, you had the soapbox on the corner, right?
*  Or the local university, the coffee shop.
*  And somebody owned those places or somebody ran those places.
*  You know, the college president would say this person would be invited to speak, this
*  person wouldn't be invited to speak.
*  And I actually think it's right and proper for people to be able to protest speakers
*  to say this person shouldn't speak at our college.
*  But I think the college itself, the institution has to be willing to make value judgments
*  about why they invite certain people to speak.
*  And if that person is very unpopular speaker, if that person is representing a viewpoint
*  that is not well supported by the college, if it's not necessarily what students want
*  to hear, but the administration believes, like the faculty believes, that it's something
*  students should hear.
*  Isn't that why we have universities?
*  We don't go to class to learn, you know, necessarily like you don't go to a literature course to
*  read the things that you want to read.
*  You just go home and read those yourself.
*  You go to study a curriculum to something else.
*  You want to benefit from the experience from the perspectives of others.
*  The question that people have is how does this expand into the wider audience, right?
*  What happens when you move beyond universities?
*  What happens when you move to news broadcast?
*  What happens when you move to the internet?
*  What happens when everyone everywhere can broadcast?
*  And this is where I think things get really tricky.
*  Not can people say what they want.
*  As long as they're not advocating violence or whatever, I don't think this should be
*  a difficult issue.
*  But this gets complicated when you have things like YouTube's next video suggestion algorithm.
*  Because the idea of universal speech, universal ability to broadcast is exactly as you said,
*  what is the counter for this?
*  You've got freaking Nazis on the internet and I'm not talking like whatever the guy's
*  got a Trump sticker on his truck.
*  I'm talking goose stepping, you know, swastika bearing actual freaking Nazi.
*  You have those people out there on the internet calling for violence, calling for all these
*  terrible things.
*  And normally the way you deal with this, even in the case of something like ISIS, you drag
*  them onto the platform.
*  You discredit their ideas before the world because if you don't, if you drive them underground,
*  if you make them this faction that's hanging out at a radical mosque or they're hanging
*  out at the hardware store, if they're freaking Nazis or whatever, there are places where
*  you create its own community that is sheltered from other perspectives, sheltered from other
*  ideas.
*  And that is where extremism thrives, where it cannot be challenged, where it cannot be
*  exposed for what it really is.
*  But when you've got YouTube going, oh, you like Nazi A, how about Nazi B?
*  How about Nazi C?
*  These people never get exposed to counter speech and this is where things get tricky.
*  It also gets tricky when you decide that someone is saying something that's offensive and you
*  remove them from the platform and then you open the door for other things being offensive,
*  things that maybe aren't offensive to you.
*  The slope gets slippery and then you have wrong speak.
*  You have newly dictated language that you have to use.
*  You have new restrictions on ideologies, things you're not allowed to espouse.
*  Twitter will ban you for dead naming someone.
*  They will ban you for life.
*  Meaning if you transition to be a woman and you call yourself Edwina and I call you Edward,
*  I will be banned for life with no recourse, which is madness.
*  It's mad because I can call you fuck face and no one has a problem with it.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  I could call you a terrible, I could call you that and there's no problem.
*  But if I choose a name that used to accurately represent you as a different gender, because
*  this is some new incredibly important distinction that we've decided.
*  It takes precedence over everything else, including it's more significant than insults,
*  more significance than demeaning of, I can call you a moron, I could demean your intellect.
*  All those things are fine.
*  But if I choose to call you by a name that used to accurately represent you when you
*  were a different gender or when you identified with a different gender because of today's
*  political climate, that is grounds for banning you for life.
*  It shows you how incredibly slippery censorship can get because I would have never imagined
*  that.
*  If you said to me 10 years ago, well, when someone becomes a transgender person, 10 years
*  ago, if you said this to me, if someone becomes a transgender person, you call them by their
*  original name, you could be banned from social media for life.
*  I'm like, get the fuck out of here.
*  They'll never get to that.
*  No one's going to be that unreasonable.
*  That's crazy because you could call some people so many disparaging and insulting names, but
*  you can't say their name that isn't even insulting.
*  Dead naming.
*  That's what it's called.
*  So it just shows you dead naming of today.
*  You agree with that today.
*  That opens up the door for all kinds of crazy shit five years from now, 10 years from now,
*  if we still get more and more rabidly politically polarized and our idea of PC culture gets
*  more and more extreme.
*  You're on a greased hill and if you decide to give up a little ground, the slide is imminent.
*  I think this is, you can argue on that axis, but I think incrementalism and the failures
*  of imagination going, 10 years ago, we couldn't imagine this would have been a banable offense,
*  is the wrong way to go about it.
*  Because if you go back to the founding of the country saying women should have the right
*  to vote, black people should have the right to vote, that was unimaginable.
*  That would get you equivalently deplatformed, not welcomed to the speaking community or
*  whatever.
*  Those are positive and inclusive things.
*  I'm not saying, I'm associating these directly.
*  I'm talking about the principle here.
*  I understand what you're saying.
*  Because you can attack these things in that direction and go, oh, this doesn't seem right.
*  But remember, it's Twitter making these rules, it's YouTube making these rules, there's not
*  a court making these rules.
*  And anybody technically today can decide who can and cannot speak on their platforms.
*  The question is, what should we do?
*  What kind of culture should we promote?
*  How should we have these conversations and how should we make them available?
*  And I think civility is not too much to ask people generally.
*  As you say, calling people fuckface or moron or whatever is completely normal on the internet
*  and that's not really going to get you banned from anywhere.
*  And now you have all of these companies sort of contorting themselves to fit into these
*  blocks to not isolate or sort of anger all of these different demographics.
*  But if we truly want to have a global broadcast, a public commons, the question I think that's
*  more important here is not so much what should and should not be banned, because that's accepting
*  the premise of banning, is how do we create an inclusive platform where everyone can talk
*  and even strictly and harshly disagree with each other without it coming down to name
*  calling, without trying to dox people, without trying to basically dog whistle them or screw
*  them or hurt them or harm them, however.
*  Now look, I am not above calling people bad names on the internet.
*  I've said terrible things.
*  I grew up on the internet, right?
*  I was an asshole.
*  And we all were.
*  And the thing is, the worst things that we say at any moment today, they are permanent.
*  The internet never forgets, right?
*  So when you say these things, and you know, there's a young audience listening right now
*  to like everything, and they think it's cool, they think it's funny, or they don't think
*  it's cool, or they don't think it's funny, but they think they shouldn't be deplatformed
*  for it.
*  They're edgy, you know, they push the lines or whatever.
*  They get that out there and they start emulating this behavior.
*  They start saying mean things.
*  They start saying cruel things.
*  I did it myself, right?
*  Not in this context, but in whatever the equivalent would be, you know, 20 years ago.
*  And that's, there are going to be consequences for that.
*  They're going to be judged by that.
*  Whether they should or should not, whether it was right or wrong, because as you said,
*  there's so much tribalism today.
*  And I think we have to create positive examples.
*  I think you're right.
*  The deplatforming is a huge issue.
*  It is a tremendous issue, right?
*  But we should think about what it is that we're actually fighting against.
*  And I don't think like trans issues or whatever, when it comes down to basically civility,
*  is the hill to die on.
*  Because I think there's better arguments.
*  Well I certainly think we should encourage civility.
*  There's no doubt about it.
*  What I'm getting at is that the idea that you could be banned for life for that is preposterous.
*  I think civility is one of the most important things our culture could ever promote.
*  And I think it's very difficult to promote civility online because of the anonymous aspect
*  of internet interaction.
*  There's no accountability.
*  You're not getting social cues from people.
*  It's just a completely different world when you're interacting with people, especially
*  for kids.
*  You know, I mean, if you had given me the internet when I was 15 years old, I would
*  have said the most horrific things to people, for sure.
*  I'm sure many 15-year-old kids are doing exactly that right now.
*  I think the more we can encourage civility, the better we all are in all aspects of our
*  life, whether it's person to person, face to face, or online.
*  I try very hard to only say things online that I would say to someone's face.
*  And online now, I do not interact with people in any way, shape, or form that's negative.
*  I don't do it.
*  I don't believe in it.
*  I treat it the same way.
*  If it's avoidable, I avoid it.
*  And I think that's incredibly important.
*  But this does bring up an important point, which is, I mean, what it really gets to the
*  core of the issue, failures of civility.
*  The fact that people say bad things, the fact that people don't have accountability, that
*  there are, you know, there's a whole spectrum of people out there, from angels to devils,
*  right?
*  There's ordinary people, and even the best of people have bad days and say terrible things.
*  For sure.
*  We do need people to have some responsibility for having a thicker skin.
*  Look, guys, I've had people literally advocating my murder, right?
*  Torture and murder.
*  Yeah, literally.
*  Horrible things.
*  Yeah, I've seen it.
*  For years.
*  And the people that I've blocked on my Twitter account are the ones who are posting about
*  Bitcoin scams that are like, send me five Bitcoin, I'll send you five Bitcoin back.
*  That's hilarious.
*  And I'm not saying this is the example to emulate.
*  What it is, though, is we have to recognize that some people aren't worth engaging, some
*  people aren't worth listening to.
*  It's a lesson.
*  Right.
*  But that doesn't mean necessarily that you take their voice entirely.
*  Yes, I most certainly agree with that, in terms, particularly in terms of deplatforming.
*  My question to you about this is, and I've raised this question with many people, and
*  I really haven't got a satisfactory answer.
*  Do you think that things that get so huge like Twitter or Facebook or even YouTube,
*  do they become a basic right?
*  Is it like the utilities?
*  Is it like electricity and water?
*  Is like the ability to communicate online seems to me a core aspect of what it means
*  to be a human being with a voice in 2020.
*  And I don't think it's as simple as removing someone from Twitter is simply a company exercising
*  their right to have whatever they want on their platform.
*  I think when it gets as big as Twitter is, I think we've passed into a new realm.
*  And I think we need to acknowledge that, whether it's Twitter or YouTube or Facebook or what
*  have you.
*  I mean, and I think it should be very difficult to remove someone from those platforms.
*  And I think it should probably involve some sort of a trial.
*  I mean, this is a really, really tough issue.
*  It's much larger than just deplatforming.
*  Because what we're really talking about is the Internet as a public utility.
*  The Internet is water and power.
*  As opposed to something-
*  And its ability to shape culture.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  When you talk about something like Twitter and the size of it, when the president is
*  basically directing policy from Twitter, it's clear something has changed.
*  And threatening countries.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  That is, our laws were not designed with that in mind.
*  And unfortunately, we have a legislature that's just fundamentally broken.
*  This gets back to the electoral system, which you talked about earlier.
*  Most countries in the world have a wide swath of parties.
*  But not this two-party binary system where it's just two groups.
*  Largely neocorporate groups that are just handing power back and forth.
*  The president changes.
*  But the actual lawmakers, the actual structure behind the president, the advisors, are largely
*  from the same cohorts.
*  We don't have that legislative, we don't have that governmental structure that allows us
*  to adapt in a way that truly represents, I think, the broadest spectrum of public opinion
*  in a way that allows us to respond to changes in technology in a meaningful way.
*  Which is what's left us stranded today where these companies are sort of deciding things
*  for themselves.
*  It's because there is a vacuum of legislation.
*  Now there's a question of do we want legislation?
*  People on different spectrums, from authoritarian to libertarian, here we'll go, we want lots
*  of legislation, we want no legislation.
*  But there is a push, and there has been a push in Congress for years, actually since
*  the 90s, with the Communications Decency Act and the first crypto war where the government
*  was treating the ability to encrypt your communications to make them secret or private as you communicate
*  with people online.
*  They were treating that as a weapon and saying you couldn't export this code without getting
*  a license from the government and all kinds of craziness.
*  But the Communications Decency Act, the idea that there would be obscenity regulations,
*  some years ago you may remember a scandal involving Backpage which was like a variant
*  of Craigslist that had a lot of prostitution ads on it.
*  Government has been trying more and more to say these kind of things can be done on the
*  internet, these kind of things can be said on the internet, these kind of things can't
*  be said on the internet.
*  And they have been doing this largely under the guise, I would argue, of the Commerce
*  Clause.
*  The federal government, where do they get the Constitutional authority to regulate what
*  we say and do businesses wherever?
*  Well, they go, well, the internet is global, it's international, therefore it's interstate
*  commerce and so we're going to regulate this as if you're shipping bushels of corn from
*  Iowa to Florida.
*  But it's a little bit different than that.
*  I think what we need to recognize is that the internet is a utility and people, individuals,
*  and corporate entities should be criminally liable for the things that they do online.
*  That means if they have caused enough harm that you're willing to put them in prison,
*  they've stolen from someone, they have destroyed some piece of infrastructure, they have caused
*  harm to someone, somebody died or they plotted a murder or whatever, you take them through
*  the courts, you try them on this, the jury considers what they did, they consider why
*  they did, they considered the evidence.
*  And then you let the trial system, the traditional system that we've had for thousands of years
*  work this kind of stuff out over these hundreds of years.
*  But when you get the government and you get officials in Congress, you get officials at
*  the local department of this country or that country, you know, Russia's got a telecommunications
*  censorship bureau, China's got one, France, Germany, the United States, all of these guys
*  have different regulatory authorities, whether it's the FCC in the United States or Roskomnazor
*  in Russia.
*  And you cannot substitute their judgment for the judgment of a jury, for the judgment of
*  the people and the public broadly.
*  And I think it's dangerous that we are trying to have the government pick winners and losers
*  when whether you win or lose determines whether or not you can engage with the world, whether
*  you can have a public presence on the internet because the internet is real life today.
*  Yeah, it is.
*  And could it be that the option would be to extend the First Amendment rights to the internet
*  in general and to if you want to run a social media platform, you know, other than what
*  we're talking about, putting people in danger, doxing people, threatening people's lives,
*  doing things that can cause direct harm to people, but the ability to express yourself
*  in controversial ways, shouldn't we extend First Amendment protections to social media
*  platforms?
*  I think this is a much more complicated question than it appears because you get into the whole
*  thing of obligation of service.
*  There is, like there was a cause celebre, on the right actually, that would seem like
*  a similar issue.
*  Remember, there was the cake shop somewhere where they didn't want to serve like a same
*  sex marriage thing.
*  And again, this gets back to civility.
*  Some people have a very strong fundamental belief here that these people shouldn't be
*  able to do this, that, or the other.
*  And if you impose that on them, that requirement on them, they've got to serve whatever their
*  business is to these people that they don't like or that they don't agree with.
*  There's a compulsion of service there.
*  You start doing this with the internet and then there's a completely different country.
*  Let's say there's a website in Belgium that's now bound by American laws, that's bound
*  by this.
*  Twitter can't ban this person even though they're against them.
*  It seems like...
*  But isn't that a different argument though?
*  All these companies we're talking about, Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube, are all based in America.
*  Now I agree, imposing American First Amendment rights on a country from...
*  Particularly if the US starts changing laws.
*  This is the interesting thing about internet companies is they can headquarter wherever
*  they want.
*  Yeah.
*  Would that be their loophole to get out of that?
*  Just sell it to China?
*  Right.
*  But I mean, more fundamentally, we have to recognize either as a society, we can compel
*  people to standards of civility or we can't.
*  And we need to decide how we handle that because that's what all of these tie around.
*  I think we have forgotten in many ways just...
*  We're not teaching people the golden rule well enough because we are all angry.
*  We are all in competition.
*  And the funny thing is, the guy on the right who's poor and living in a trailer is not
*  much different than the hippie on the left who's scrounging out of dumpsters and raising
*  their black flag to go to a protest.
*  They act like they could not be more different, but their economic circumstances could not
*  be more similar.
*  And the reality is, it's the government, the lawmakers, and the business owners that are
*  setting them at odds.
*  And we are all getting lost in our own ideological differences and losing sight of the things
*  that actually tie us together and that if we work together, maybe we could change in
*  a more meaningful way.
*  And the more people you meet and the more people you talk to, the more you realize how
*  malleable people really are and about how so many of these ideological perspectives
*  that they so rabidly subscribe to, they've adopted because it allows them to be accepted
*  by their community, by whatever neighborhood they're in, whatever group of people they
*  hang out with, and they choose to adopt these ideas about how the world is.
*  So many of those people just don't experience people that are different from them.
*  That is the case with racism, that's the case with homophobia, that's the case with many
*  of the issues that people have with other folks, is that they just don't know people
*  from those other groups and they haven't experienced, they haven't walked a mile in their shoes,
*  as it were.
*  I think civility should be encouraged as much as possible.
*  Also though, I'm a comedian and I talk a lot of shit and that's in the sense of humor,
*  like you can mis- and it's been done against me many times where they've taken things I've
*  said in jest and put them in quotes completely out of context and it looks horrible because
*  that's not the way it was intended and it was intended in humor.
*  Now if you do have laws that not just encourage civility but mandate civility, you're going
*  to have a real problem with humor because you're basically going to cut the ankles out
*  of comedy.
*  Not that I'm saying that all humor has to be mean and vicious, it doesn't, but some
*  of the best is.
*  Well it's also about saying things that can't be said, you know?
*  Yes, yes, saying things that can't be said.
*  I think there's a giant problem with online censorship today and I think it's one of the
*  biggest problems of our era and I do think it is because there is a massive slippery
*  slope and I do agree with you about the cake people, you know, that that was a big issue
*  that caused the labor of the right of these people.
*  They should have the right, a lot of people felt, to not make a cake for someone who is
*  doing something they think is immoral, right, being involved in a gay relationship.
*  But there's also the problem of sensationalizing these things because the people that did find
*  those people that didn't want to make those cakes, they went to a bunch of people that
*  agreed to make the cake first.
*  They went and tried to find someone who didn't want to make that cake and then they turned
*  it into a big story.
*  Even though I just think, I mean I think you should make a cake for gay people because
*  there's nothing wrong with being gay.
*  I think the people that made that decision to not make that, I feel bad for them.
*  I feel bad that they're bigoted in that way and that it's such a foolish thing to care
*  who someone is in love with, whether it's the same sex or an opposite sex.
*  But also, I think it's weird that someone wants to go around and try to find someone
*  who won't make a cake for them, who wants to go from cake place to cake place to cake
*  place until they go, aha, I found a bigot, and then make a big deal out of it.
*  You're searching for victimhood.
*  I mean there's an argument that that's one way to look at it.
*  Another way to look at it is that's activism.
*  They're searching for injustice as they perceive it.
*  Agreed, yeah.
*  I agree.
*  This is the thing.
*  What is right and wrong?
*  This is what people forget is changing constantly when we're talking about public opinion because
*  public opinion is changing constantly.
*  This is why doing right by people, it's so sad that we've lost sight of this basic impulse
*  to do unto others as you would have them do unto you.
*  Because when you talk about the internet, when you talk about deplatforming, when you
*  talk about humor, as you said, people are going back and they're looking at your jokes,
*  they're putting them in quotes, this is a different context, you're being attacked by
*  it.
*  Something you said looks bad.
*  There's things that you've said, things that I've said, things that the person listening
*  right now have said that they believed, that they meant, that they said 10 years ago, that
*  they said one year ago, that they said three weeks ago, that they no longer believe, that
*  they've abandoned, that they've been persuaded otherwise, that they've changed their mind
*  on.
*  I think this is one of the central themes in the book, permanent record, is we are no
*  longer allowed to forget our worst mistakes.
*  They're there, they haunt us, they're used against us, they're weaponized.
*  And this society has become aware of this, and activists on all sides have become aware
*  of this.
*  And immediately they use this to try to attack people on the other side of any issue that
*  they don't like, to go after their credibility, to go after their character.
*  And what we are losing in that conflict, and this is a rational strategy on the part of
*  both sides in the moment because they realize there is a real political advantage to be
*  gained.
*  You can get people canceled very easily nowadays.
*  But the thing is, when we make everyone, we pin everyone to their worst moment, when we
*  do away with the concept of forgiveness, we do away with the potential for growth, for
*  change, for persuasion.
*  And this gets back to those those rat holes of extremism on YouTube, on Twitter, on everywhere
*  else, where they start self-reinforcing and eventually reaching the bottom of the hole
*  at the worst of the worst with everybody else who's been canceled too.
*  Part of that is because they can't climb out, or they think they can't climb out.
*  And there's a question, how do we resolve that?
*  One of the nice things about the pre-internet society was as bad as you were, as ignorant
*  as racist, as exploitative as whatever you don't like, right, as that person, that character
*  was, they could find something, they could read a book, they could meet someone, they
*  could change their mind.
*  And even if nobody in their town would ever forgive them, rightly in some cases, because
*  they had done something truly terrible, something truly unforgivable, they could leave.
*  They could move to a different town, they could move to a different state in that history
*  would not follow them.
*  They could reinvent themselves and they could become someone truly, honestly better, instead
*  of being married to their prior ignorance.
*  That is a very important thing because we all are in a constant state of growth.
*  If you're not, you're really making some fundamental errors with your life.
*  We're all in this constant state of accepting and acquiring new information, gaining new
*  perspectives, learning from our mistakes.
*  And unless you're Dr. Manhattan, unless you're some person who's not making any mistakes
*  and you just have this all-knowing vision of the world, you're a finished product.
*  Please, if you are, share that with everybody else.
*  But most of us are not.
*  Most of us are in this weird state of being a human being on earth where everyone is trying
*  to figure it out in this incredibly imperfect world, incredibly imperfect society.
*  From the structure, the economic structure to the societal structure, everything, down
*  to the very last things.
*  Everything's imperfect.
*  And the idea should be that we're all communicating to try to grow together and that we're learning
*  together.
*  And it's one of the more interesting things about interacting with people online is that
*  you can get different perspectives.
*  And if you can let go of your ego and if you can let go of your preconceived notions, you
*  can learn things about the way other people see and feel and think about the world that
*  could change and enhance your own ideas.
*  And I think that it's important that we not just accept the fact that people are growing
*  and getting better and improving, but that we encourage it.
*  We encourage it and we reward it.
*  I think that's one of the interesting things that we're struggling with.
*  You see this in the context of police violence.
*  You see this in the context of mass surveillance.
*  You see this in the context of cancel culture.
*  You see this everywhere.
*  One of the interesting things about this surveillance machine that has been built around us, the
*  sort of architecture of oppression, the turnkey tyranny, as I describe it, so much is known
*  about every person, regardless of how innocent or how guilty they are.
*  It's all in there.
*  The files are waiting to be accessed.
*  The data just needs to be collated.
*  It's just waiting to be requested and analyzed and used.
*  What this means, like there's this old idea of the panopticon, right?
*  Which is you create a prison that is circular.
*  And in the middle of it, there's this great tower that rises way up.
*  At the very top of the tower, there's a mirrored glass room that the warden sits in.
*  No prisoner knows where the warden is looking because the warden can see out, but they can't
*  see in.
*  So everyone believes that they are watched.
*  The idea is that no one will misbehave because they're all afraid that they'll be retaliated
*  against for breaking the rules or whatever.
*  But what we have seen as this surveillance machine has been built is we all realize,
*  intuitively, innately, inherently, in ourselves, even if we don't recognize it, even if we
*  don't speak to it, we witness it in the news every night, there are records of wrongdoing.
*  Criminality in government at the highest and lowest levels of our government, corporations
*  and, you know, prominent figures in society breaking the rules, ordinary people, jaywalking,
*  littering, you know, polluting, small scale petty stuff.
*  All of that somewhere there is a record of.
*  But in almost all cases, it's not punished.
*  What has happened is we have broken the chain of accountability between knowledge of wrongdoing
*  and consequence for wrongdoing.
*  This happened without a vote.
*  It happened without our participation.
*  We weren't asked whether this was okay.
*  But I think in some way, that is beginning to change the moral character of people.
*  And what we need to do, starting with the top rather than the bottom, because China
*  is trying to do the reverse, they're going, all right, well, there's a simple solution
*  to this.
*  Let's just start screwing everybody who breaks the rules instantly and immediately.
*  You know, you got a social credit score, you protested, so you're going off to a camp,
*  you know, whatever.
*  But imagine what it would mean if we saw people where now any official, the minute
*  they are guilty of the slightest infraction, immediately is exposed in the press, they
*  go on trial, they go on all this stuff, they're ruined, they're disgraced.
*  But it turns out every other member of Congress is going to court in the same week because
*  everybody is in violation of something somewhere.
*  We all have some measure of guilt, large or small, even if we're completely innocent,
*  because our legal code is so complex, there's no way you can make it through a week without
*  breaking some kind of rule about you can't wear a green hat on Tuesday.
*  But if this happened, if there was accountability for infractions of the rules, any time an
*  infraction of the rules was witnessed, the laws would change instantly to enshrine the
*  right to privacy, because the people in power wouldn't want to lose their position of power.
*  They would not want to lose this position.
*  And suddenly, when they have skin in the game, they would realize, oh, everybody deserves
*  this.
*  And I think there's just something interesting to that.
*  I haven't thought this out all the way fully, so this could be, you know, give me some slack
*  here.
*  But I think this is really what has changed.
*  We have built a panopticon, but what sits at the top of it is a computer.
*  That computer witnesses everything we do.
*  In reality, it's a distribution of computers.
*  They're owned by many people and answered to many people.
*  But it does not yet judge us for us.
*  Judge us for it.
*  And what is happening is the audience, society, the people have realized that they can see
*  through this computer.
*  They can see through the panopticon from a certain angle, a certain degree, in a certain
*  direction at any given time.
*  The cops that have been monitoring all of us for years, right, they've got surveillance
*  and drones and stuff that they couldn't have imagined in generations prior.
*  But now every person on the street has a smartphone with a camera, too.
*  And the cops are being witnessed for the first time.
*  And now people are trying to impose upon them the same judgment that has classically been
*  imposed upon us.
*  And this, I think, is one of the dynamics, the changes that is leading to this increasing
*  conflict in society, is when you realize that the people that throughout your generation's
*  youth were told in Hollywood and stories, our common shared national myths, the government's
*  the good guys.
*  The FBIs are going to get the gangsters and the terrorists and things like that.
*  They're the best of the best.
*  The fact that they are people, too, they're not only fallible, but in some cases, small-minded
*  and vicious.
*  They are political.
*  They are partisan.
*  The same way everyone else is, people start questioning power and how it is used, the
*  basic legitimacy, the way it impacts our lives, what the limits of it should be.
*  The people yet have not realized one of the responses to this should be a limitation on
*  the amount of power that government has, or rather not just government, but institution.
*  Institution is a concept, right?
*  Government or corporation.
*  The powers of institution should be limited to interfere in our lives.
*  Instead, what they are trying to do, both sides, you know, blue team, red team, whatever,
*  they're squabbling, they're fighting over who has their hands on the trigger, who gets
*  to aim the weapon rather than should the weapon exist.
*  Are you talking about police violence when you're saying these things?
*  That's a part of it, yes.
*  It's every direction, but police violence is very much the public part of it that we
*  see right now.
*  Yeah, that seems to be one of the most complex abuses of power, because the kind of power
*  that you give someone when you allow them to be a police officer is literally the power
*  to end life.
*  It's not just the power to kick you off Twitter, it's the power to decide this person who's
*  just a regular person, no different than you or I, with all sorts of problems in their
*  own life and stresses and strains and a disproportionate amount of strain and stress for the actual
*  job that they do.
*  I mean, it's a spectacularly stressful position to be in life, but yet you give them the ability
*  to literally, with a finger pole, end someone's life.
*  I think that's being exposed in a way that we've, because of these cell phone cameras
*  and because of social media, it's being exposed in a way that no one ever would have ever
*  dreamed imaginable before, and exposing how almost impossible it is to have that position
*  as a human being.
*  The position of power like that over folks, and just to have a regular person with a normal
*  psychology and not some incredibly brilliant zen master who's in charge of overseeing drug
*  crimes or pulling people over or assault or whatever it is.
*  I don't know the solution to that.
*  There's all sorts of things at play, ignorance, foolishness, racism, anger, but at the end
*  of the day, it's about a human being's ability to have massive amount of power by law over
*  other human beings, which is always going to be a problem.
*  It's just going to be a problem.
*  Yeah, I mean, I think we've known about this, there's aphorisms that go back a zillion years,
*  absolute power corrupts absolutely.
*  You give a monkey a stick, the first thing he's going to do is he's going to look for
*  something to hit with it.
*  But this is also one of the things you asked earlier about how I can be hopeful, how I
*  can be idealistic when I see the scale of the problems, the challenges, the rate against
*  us.
*  When I understand not just that mass surveillance exists, but I understand the mechanics of
*  it, I understand how systemic it is, I understand the resources behind it that want to prevent
*  the change of it and instead want to entrench it and expand it to make it more powerful
*  and have more influence over the direction of our lives.
*  Down to this basic stuff about, you know, we are told that the cops are the best among
*  us.
*  People sign up to be cops, I genuinely believe, because they want to serve and protect more
*  so than they just want to be the big tough cop guy.
*  And some people say, you know, that's naive, some people say that's petty, but I think
*  it's different.
*  I think the reason that I feel this way, the reason that I am okay with seeing how much
*  we fail, seeing how much incivility and violence and just ignorance that we have in the world
*  today is, is I have a lower expectation of the individual at the moment, but a higher
*  appreciation for their potential.
*  And the reality is we are all inherently flawed.
*  I'm a terrible person.
*  I think in a lot of ways, you're not as good as you want yourself to be.
*  But I know that I have become a better person with time.
*  You have become a better person with time.
*  I think we all have and we all can, or those of us who have not, could if they chose to
*  or if they had guidance or if they had love or friendship or someone who cared and directed
*  them and helped them become better.
*  I mean, that is the story of human history because we were all the monkey and then we
*  found a stick.
*  We could use it to beat somebody or we could use it to build a bridge.
*  But if you look around at the world today, there's a hell of a lot of bridges.
*  There are, and I think in terms of police brutality, there's very few reasonable solutions
*  that seem to be actionable.
*  They seem to be something that you could just put into play right away in terms of like
*  how do you deal with these violent encounters that police officers often have with people?
*  How do you deal with the PTSD that I believe a vast majority of these police officers suffer
*  from?
*  Completely stressed out every time they pull someone over.
*  It could be the end of their life.
*  They might not go home to their families.
*  They really don't know.
*  And I think there's also a bunch of them that are emotionally and psychologically unqualified
*  for the job to begin with.
*  And then here we are with these calls in America at least to defund the police, which I think
*  is even more ridiculous.
*  I think if anything, they need more funding and more training and a more stringent process
*  of elimination of removing people that aren't qualified for that job because I believe very
*  few people actually are qualified.
*  I think there's great police officers out there.
*  I really do.
*  Most of them, most of the interactions that people have with police officers aren't horrible,
*  but there's enough of those horrible ones that are captured on video that we have this
*  bias towards these negative results that we see over and over again and we don't take
*  into account the full data set.
*  We're not taking into account all the interactions that people have with police officers because
*  those aren't documented.
*  What we're getting in front of our face day in, day out are the terrible interactions.
*  I don't see nor do I hear a real workable way of improving this.
*  You get people that are either calling to defund the police or you're calling for people
*  to support police officers.
*  That's all you hear.
*  From a few people like Jocko Willink, you see really great suggestions that they should
*  be treated the same way they treat Navy SEALs, where you're spending literally 20% of your
*  time training and you're going through psychological training, you're going through actual real
*  world situations where you're going over what's the correct protocol and how to handle certain
*  situations.
*  I think it's a giant problem in our society today and I think that's an understatement,
*  that every time someone gets shot that shouldn't have gotten shot, particularly if it's a person
*  of color, it becomes a gigantic flashpoint for our society.
*  Let me challenge you on that a little bit because we can have civil disagreements in
*  a way that's why we have discussion.
*  I think there are things that we can do that don't require the idea of shutting down every
*  police department.
*  I think that's sort of far beyond what people talk about when they talk about defunding
*  the police.
*  I think the most common sense measure that is being discussed, and it's not being discussed
*  as broadly in terms of the mainstream news, it should be, is ending police unions.
*  Now, why do we talk about that?
*  This gets back to the same thing that we talked about earlier with the court cases and the
*  government.
*  They get caught doing something wrong, but there's no consequence.
*  People learn from that.
*  Each generation learns from the cases prior.
*  It's in training, people learn the rules, things like that.
*  The reason a lot of police violence occurs, even if it's not all, again, there's no magic
*  wand we wave that saves the world, is the lack of accountability.
*  We know there are cops, and even cops say this, right?
*  There are cops out there who aren't good people.
*  There are cops out there who have abused their authority.
*  There are really tragic cases where a cop has done something straight up criminal, and
*  they have faced no meaningful consequences as a result.
*  Maybe they lost their job, right?
*  But if it was anybody else, they would have gone to prison.
*  So there's a question of how do we remediate this in a way that preserves the legitimate
*  interest of police officers as a class, but it also preserves the rights of the people
*  who are being policed by your own admission, at least some cases, people who are abusing
*  their authorities.
*  And again, I'm not saying all cops are bad or anything like that, but if we recognize
*  there are abuses, and this is a class that is invested, as you said, with the power over
*  life and death, we have to be willing as a society, and the people occupying this position
*  have to be willing to assume a higher standard of accountability than ordinary people, right?
*  And if we can agree on that, everything else follows from it, I think.
*  We don't want to have a gun-toting, immunized class walking among us.
*  And I think even police officers, among themselves, at least, would recognize this.
*  But it is rational for them to resist this from the interests of their class.
*  They're in a privileged position.
*  Why would they give that up?
*  The same way our spies are in a privileged position, why would they give that up?
*  But as a society, we exist to ask more.
*  And you raise valid points, right?
*  There's cops out there go up to a dark car in the middle of the night.
*  They're not going to make it home to their family.
*  That's reasonable and legitimate, right?
*  But being a police officer is a dangerous position that people have signed up to.
*  We give our police officers every advantage that could be given to them today.
*  I can tell you from having lived all around the world, there's no cops in the world that
*  are kitted out like cops in America are.
*  These guys look like something from a sci-fi movie.
*  And if there is a cop...
*  Some of them do.
*  Some of them do.
*  They're going to riots.
*  Fair enough.
*  And look, there's good cops out there.
*  I had a lot of interactions with cops as a young man that were nothing but positive.
*  It's not that police as an idea are the enemy.
*  It is the system that is rotten.
*  And I think even honest cops recognize that the system is fundamentally mentally broken.
*  The question is not...
*  Or the question from their side should not be, can we stop reform?
*  Because if they are...
*  If that's their position, I think they're doing the public a disservice.
*  And I think to themselves, they know they're doing a disservice.
*  It's how do we handle this appropriately?
*  How do we handle this in the right way?
*  And if there's cops out there who legitimately have served...
*  They've been out there for years.
*  They've been exposing themselves to danger to keep people safe at night.
*  They've done a good job.
*  They don't want to walk the beat anymore.
*  That should certainly be an option that's available to them.
*  And from my perspective, as not a cop, but I think when you look at the state of law
*  enforcement in the United States, that very much is an option.
*  Do they want to work on dispatch?
*  Do they want to work on investigation?
*  Do they want to be cross-trained in forensics?
*  There are ways that we can end issues, or at least mitigate some of the issues that
*  we see, with policing today, without saying cops are the worst people in the world, and
*  without saying these guys should be above the law.
*  Well, I don't think anybody's saying they should be above the law, but...
*  But factually today, they really are.
*  Excuse me?
*  I said factually today.
*  Like, as a matter of fact, whether we like to or not, you got to admit, in most cases,
*  cops are bulletproof.
*  Well, I don't know.
*  I don't think I agree with that.
*  If you look at what happened in the George Floyd case, obviously they were caught on
*  camera.
*  So we're fortunate we got to...
*  Not fortunate, but we got to see what happened, and they reacted accordingly.
*  What you were saying before you started this, though, was that we need to stop police unions.
*  Right?
*  And that...
*  But do you think...
*  Police unions aren't only around to protect people from the consequences of terrible policing.
*  They're also to provide health insurance and reasonable amounts of counseling and...
*  This is a great argument for everybody to have health insurance.
*  Oh, for sure.
*  Yeah, no, I agree.
*  I think health insurance is a...
*  I think it's a fundamental right of being a human being in a civilized society.
*  I think it should be treated the same way we treat the fire department.
*  I think it should be something that we all agree we should pay into because it benefits
*  all of us.
*  I mean, I just think if we are a community, and that's what really a country is supposed
*  to be, we're supposed to be a large community, wouldn't we want to protect the most vulnerable
*  members of that community?
*  If you have a small, knit family and something happens to someone in the family, everybody
*  chips in to help that person.
*  That's what I think health insurance should be.
*  I think it should be an important part of a culture, of a community, of a group of human
*  beings that decide they're all on the same team.
*  We have to take care of the most vulnerable people.
*  I think that across the board.
*  And I mean, that's really the argument that I'm making for how we want our police to be.
*  When I say cops are bulletproof, I don't mean in the literal sense.
*  There are a lot of cops who have given their lives to stop very bad people, and we should
*  honor them.
*  We should provide for their families.
*  But the way that we do that is providing a better society that's more fair to police
*  by being more fair to everyone.
*  As long as we've got any occupation that has...
*  It's really this simple.
*  As long as we have an occupation that is invested with exceptional authority, they must be invested
*  with an extraordinary standard of accountability.
*  It's that simple from my perspective.
*  It doesn't have to be a terrible thing.
*  It doesn't have to be an aggressive attack, but it's this basic principle.
*  Today in the world of business, in the world of government, in the world of policing, anywhere
*  you look, it's a common issue.
*  What we have is a disproportionate allocation of influence, a disproportionate allocation
*  of economic resources, a disproportionate allocation of authority without an equal allocation
*  of responsibility.
*  Well, I think we both agree on that, and I think we also both agree that it's not a shock
*  that a disproportionate amount of criminal activity exists in a place where there's a
*  amount of poverty and a disproportionate...
*  And very few economic opportunities.
*  I think that is a real problem.
*  But you're exactly right.
*  When you talk about where terrorist movements arise from, when you talk about where criminal
*  groups really thrive, it's where there is poverty.
*  Poverty breeds desperation.
*  Poverty breeds anger and resentment, and sadly, due to the nature of our species, that in
*  many cases inevitably tends toward violence.
*  If we want to solve the symptoms, which are criminality, because people forget that terrorism
*  is a crime, it's a very grave crime, but it's still a crime, we have to go to the court
*  causes.
*  Yeah, and we were talking about this previously on a different show in regards to the way
*  people reacted to the pandemic in terms of economic support to businesses and trillions
*  of dollars that were allocated to all these various businesses to try to stimulate them
*  and keep them active and alive and keep people working.
*  And my thought was, imagine if that same attention to detail had been to impoverished neighborhoods.
*  And if they had decided, like, listen, there's obviously a disproportionate amount of crime
*  and poverty in these neighborhoods.
*  We've got to figure out a way to lessen that burden and strengthen those neighborhoods.
*  And in a real simplistic way of putting it, the way I've always said, if you want to make
*  America great, you want less losers.
*  What's the best way to have less losers?
*  Have more people with an opportunity to succeed, more people who grow up in an area where it's
*  actually safe, where there's economic possibilities, where you're given more access to education,
*  more access to health care, more access to counseling, more access to community centers,
*  any kind of support that you could possibly give people that gives them more of an opportunity
*  to get by in life.
*  And that this is something that we've conveniently ignored, this need to strengthen these core
*  and significant areas of our culture.
*  But yet we do when something comes along like a pandemic that might close down business
*  and already thriving economic businesses.
*  I think we should have put, I think a long time ago, we should have put similar resources
*  and attention into these impoverished neighborhoods that have been impoverished for decades.
*  And a lot of it because of slavery and a lot of it because of redlining laws and Jim Crow
*  laws, and all the things that happen after slavery.
*  There's so many areas of our country that just don't get better and we don't do anything
*  about it.
*  And we just assume that these crime-ridden areas will remain that way forever.
*  And they send cops there and then you see the videos of the interactions that cops have
*  with people and it just creates more and more anger and more and more frustration without
*  any real, some sort of socially responsible action by the government and some sort of
*  a program where it's explained to people, explained to the general public how this is
*  going to benefit everyone, that we will have less crime, that we will have more opportunity,
*  that we will have more people that are educated and empowered entering into the workforce,
*  will have more competition, will strengthen the country as a whole.
*  It'll be better literally for every one of us.
*  And that this is something that they didn't pursue and they haven't pursued in this country forever.
*  Well, I mean, this gets back to that question that I was asking earlier.
*  It's one that I ask myself.
*  When you look at all the problems of today and for somebody who's focused on privacy
*  and surveillance issues, it's easy to be reminded every day of how deep in the hole we are.
*  Where did these things really...
*  You talked earlier about like a greased hill.
*  Where did the incline increase?
*  Where did things start to really go wrong?
*  Because they've always been going wrong in some area.
*  Again, that's our burden.
*  We've got to make things better because they're never going to be good enough where we start.
*  But in recent decades, things have gotten bad.
*  And I think it goes back to the Patriot Act.
*  When you ask about economy, you talk about poverty, you talk about opportunity.
*  How do we fix this?
*  Everybody is rehabilitating him now as this nice little old guy painting his feet in the bathtub.
*  But the Patriot Act, George Bush, and the Iraq War, and the policy of endless war that
*  is continuing sadly today.
*  It's a bipartisan thing.
*  It continued under Obama.
*  It continued under Trump.
*  We have spent trillions of dollars, trillions of dollars, killing far away people who literally
*  going by the statistics are more likely to be non-combatants than combatants, I think.
*  Collateral damage is a real thing.
*  And even if every one of those people was someone we didn't like, was the level of effort,
*  resources that we invested in it, was the cost to our national soul worth whatever it
*  is we can be said to have gained?
*  And I think the answer is that we have been generationally diminished, not by that president
*  alone, but by the policies that that administration popularized that have been embraced and
*  continued by the administration since.
*  And until we learn that lesson, we, you, me, everyone else will have an obligation to try
*  and change things, to return us to a better path.
*  I agree with you.
*  And I also think there's a real good argument that there's certain aspects of technology
*  that have been implemented in terms of like warfare and how we deal with terrorism that
*  could say short term perhaps might have eliminated some targets, but I would argue long term
*  probably encourage more people towards radical fundamentalism, particularly drones.
*  When I tell people the efficacy of drone attacks and how many people who are killed by drone
*  attacks, when I've gone into with people that really haven't focused on it, the amount of
*  people that are innocent, that are killed by drones and the vast majority of that being
*  the case, that when you're dealing with 100 drone deaths, it might be like 84 of them are
*  innocent.
*  Like, imagine that being anything else.
*  Imagine if the police did that, if they prevented crime by killing 84 percent completely innocent
*  people.
*  You would say that's insane.
*  Like, we have to stop that immediately.
*  But because it's done with a robot that flies through the sky remotely from Nevada by some
*  guy with an Xbox controller and he's launching missiles into some sort of a car convoy, we've
*  accepted this.
*  And I think there's a real argument that it's being accepted because of the remote aspect
*  of it, because we don't see it, we don't feel it, it seems distant and even seems distant
*  from the person that's holding the remote control.
*  They're saying that the people that are doing that, that are responsible for operating these
*  drones are experiencing a new level of PTSD and a very severe form of it.
*  Many of them, they're haunted by the idea of what they've done and the fact that even
*  though their own hands have done it, they weren't there to see it.
*  It's some sort of a bizarre disconnect and that they're murdering literally who knows
*  what percentage, but it's a very high percentage of innocent people.
*  This gets us back to what I was talking about in calling for the pardon of these different
*  whistleblowers is the core issue of Daniel Hale.
*  Daniel Hale is an American who I believe is still on trial.
*  They have yet to be convicted, but the government is going to bury this man if they get the
*  chance for revealing abuses in the drone program and the failures of the drone program.
*  And this also gets, you know, you talk about this question of efficacy and percentages.
*  We talk about mass surveillance.
*  Just last week, this was covered nowhere in media that I've seen so far in a prominent
*  way.
*  I think the Washington Post wrote an article, but it, you know, it was buried.
*  It wasn't like a front page A1 sort of top of the fold splash on the FISA court.
*  A lot of people have heard about the FISA court because of the relationship to the Trump
*  thing.
*  I hope one of your guys who works in production can pull out, you know, a headline or front
*  page or the Twitter thread from Elizabeth Goytien.
*  I think it's at Liza Goytien who went through this.
*  It was published and declassified version of the FISA reauthorization for last year
*  where the court goes through every year and the FBI submits this request for basically
*  a blanket surveillance warrant that they can use on all these different people for all
*  these different sort of categories of behavior that they want to monitor.
*  And the FISA court reauthorizes this annually.
*  And in this annual review, they look at is the system functioning?
*  Is it effective?
*  Were the rules broken?
*  And one of these experts, I think she worked at the Brennan Center for Justice.
*  Correct me if I'm wrong here.
*  But there were thousands of cases in the last year, thousands of cases where the FBI looked
*  people up under the aegis of a FISA warrant.
*  And this is like a mass warrant that's used for multiple people instead of one for everyone
*  else.
*  And we know how bad these FISA warrants can be.
*  And over the course of thousands of cases, the court found that they had been unjustified
*  in looking up these people's background in all but seven cases.
*  I think it was seven cases out of thousands.
*  And this is where it's at.
*  We have created a procedural state, a bureaucratic state, an automated system for policing.
*  And I mean that broadly.
*  I don't just mean, you know, guys in shiny shoes on the ground with a pistol on their
*  waist.
*  I'm talking about is it platform behavior and speech on Twitter?
*  I'm talking about is it surveillance behavior with domestically against American citizens
*  and abroad around the world?
*  We are trying to create a system that observes everyone and judges everyone in a way that
*  we already know is not fair.
*  It is not used properly.
*  It is not used appropriately.
*  It is not used effectively.
*  And I believe does more harm than good.
*  And why are we trying to create a system that sees everything we do and judges us, which
*  is effectively trying to invent God?
*  When we know that it is a dark and vengeful one, we need to think about the kind of technologies
*  that we were putting in place that rule us, but we do not effectively control.
*  Well, I think there has to be repercussions.
*  When you're talking about that where all but seven of them.
*  The court said, oh, yes, the FBI broke the rules routinely.
*  They did it all the time.
*  So we're going to go ahead and reauthorize this for next year.
*  Here's your rubber stamp.
*  Come back in 12 months.
*  Exactly.
*  But what I'm saying is I think we as a society need to demand repercussions for these overreaches
*  because it is a violation of law.
*  And if it's a violation of law with no consequences, then it's not within the we're not talking
*  about law anymore.
*  We're talking about nonsense.
*  We're talking about things you could just get away with.
*  It really is.
*  It's a king class.
*  It's someone who just get away with things.
*  What's a law that doesn't make any sense or a law that's only enforced against the powerless,
*  but not against the powerful.
*  Right.
*  Particularly if you or me or Jamie had done the same thing, we would for sure be in jail
*  for a violation of privacy, for invading someone's privacy, for doing something that is against
*  the law.
*  If we were tried, we would be convicted.
*  We would wind up doing time or pay some extraordinary fine.
*  We would be in real trouble is my point, but they're not in any trouble at all.
*  You cannot have that.
*  We can't have that in a society because if you have that ability to completely bypass
*  any liability and any responsibility for a violation of law, then we've created two classes
*  of human beings.
*  We've created human beings that are the governed and then we've created human beings that are
*  the governors and the governors are exempt.
*  That's not government anymore.
*  Now you're into some, you're into monarchy.
*  You're into craziness.
*  Yes, you're rulers and the ruled and you can't have that.
*  We can't have that because of what you said earlier, absolute power corrupts absolutely.
*  That is absolute power.
*  There's no repercussions whatsoever for violating laws that can greatly impact people's lives
*  in a negative way.
*  That's crazy.
*  You can't have that.
*  We can't have that and we need to agree as human beings, particularly now because of
*  the age that we live in and the access to information that we enjoy, we're aware of
*  this acutely.
*  It's obvious.
*  It's right in front of our faces and it's one of the many reasons why I think you should
*  be exonerated.
*  I think you should be pardoned.
*  I mean, you've exposed this and you've opened people's eyes to this.
*  The exponential increase in people's understanding and appreciation for that based on your work
*  and what the Guardian put out and how you exposed all that, it's changed the conversation.
*  It needs to be changed and the repercussions needs to be changed as well.
*  Well, thank you.
*  I guess there's not much more to say than that, but I hope one day I will be able to
*  come back.
*  I want to see you in real life, man.
*  I want to give you a hug.
*  I'll come on the show and be in the same room for once.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, hopefully COVID will be gone then.
*  We'll test you first.
*  We'll test each other first.
*  But listen, I said it before.
*  I really do believe this.
*  I think you're a hero and I think that what you've done, history will be kind to you.
*  They will look back on what has been done to you and I think our government is on the
*  wrong side of history.
*  I really do believe that.
*  And I think if people really did know the facts, particularly the way you explained
*  it earlier about how the information was distributed and the way it was handled ethically and
*  morally, you did the best you possibly could have done with that situation.
*  And I think it's an incredibly bold move that you've done.
*  And I feel like the time has come.
*  I really do.
*  And I hope Trump listens to this.
*  I really do.
*  I hope he listens to this and I hope he understands also what a political piece it would be.
*  This is a massive, if he pardoned you, I think it would be a massively positive move
*  for his own, the way the United States citizens view him.
*  Well I hope what we see under this administration or any other, but certainly we don't have
*  to wait much longer for, is ending the war on whistleblowers.
*  Because as much as I would like to come home, as much as I would like to see recognition
*  from the system that there are times when the only thing you can do is tell the truth
*  and that should not be a crime.
*  It's not about me.
*  It's about what happens to all of us.
*  It's what happens to the system.
*  It's how we restore or rather realize the ideal of a country that we were always told
*  we had.
*  But in reality, we have never been as good as what we dreamed.
*  But we're getting closer.
*  And the way we do that is by admitting where we were wrong and doing better.
*  Thanks so much for having me on again.
*  I really appreciate it.
*  Thanks for being on man.
*  Those words and that mentality are what make you a hero and your actions.
*  I appreciate you very much man.
*  Thanks so much.
*  Stay free brother.
*  You too my friend.
*  Take care.
*  Bye bye.
