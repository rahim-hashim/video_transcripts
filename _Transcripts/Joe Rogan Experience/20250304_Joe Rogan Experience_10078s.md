# Joe Rogan Experience #2283 - Billy Corgan
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [March 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5.72s)]
*  What's happening man? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=13.32s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=14.32s)]
*  Thank you for having me back. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=15.32s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=16.32s)]
*  How many times a day do you get bombarded by the whole Bill Burr thing? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=17.32s)]
*  When it gets into the family and people I haven't talked to for 20 years. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=21.76s)]
*  Then do you have to break character and tell the truth? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=26.32s)]
*  No, you know the thing is, this is what's crazy. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=29.68s)]
*  Okay, you want the whole setup story? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=34.16s)]
*  Sure, sure, sure. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=37.08s)]
*  So where I tape my podcast is in one of Howie Mandel's buildings and he has another building [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=39.4s)]
*  in this area. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=45.44s)]
*  So I was working on something and I was supposed to go on Howie's show that day. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=47.2s)]
*  And they said Howie will meet you out in the street or something for whatever reason. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=52.6s)]
*  So I go out in the street and the first thing Howie says to me when he sees me he goes, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=55.400000000000006s)]
*  Here comes Bill Burr. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=58.2s)]
*  And I go, you too? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=60.120000000000005s)]
*  Like do you know this story? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=62.400000000000006s)]
*  And he said, No, I don't know about it. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=63.96s)]
*  And I said, you know what? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=65.32000000000001s)]
*  Heck with it. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=67.36s)]
*  I'm just going to tell it on your show. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=68.36s)]
*  So don't ask me anymore. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=69.36s)]
*  And I want to show and I told this story about my how 10 years ago my stepmother came to [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=70.4s)]
*  me and said, Do you know who Bill Burr is? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=73.44s)]
*  I never heard of Bill, didn't know who he was, because I don't really consume much popular [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=75.48s)]
*  culture. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=79.80000000000001s)]
*  I had no idea he was a famous comedian. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=80.80000000000001s)]
*  He could have been the lawnmower guy. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=81.80000000000001s)]
*  Looked up Bill first thing I saw was like, Oh my God, he looks just like daddy. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=83.64s)]
*  When I was 18 years old, at an IHOP, my 18th birthday, my father told me, You have a half [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=87.32s)]
*  brother that I sired at the same time as you whose name is Bill. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=93.11999999999999s)]
*  So suddenly these facts come together. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=97.75999999999999s)]
*  My mother telling me these stories, I talked to my dad subsequently about it. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=99.47999999999999s)]
*  And he was very cagey about it. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=103.24s)]
*  And when I said, Why won't you tell me where this person is or who this person is? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  He said, I'm trying to protect you. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=109.52s)]
*  So when my stepmother had told me, it kind of made sense. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=113.92s)]
*  Like, well, if my half brother is the super famous comedian, my dad in a way wouldn't [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=116.8s)]
*  want me to know because he wouldn't want me to feel like I was number two because Bill [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=122.32000000000001s)]
*  is so famous. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=125.64s)]
*  I know it sounds crazy, right? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=126.64s)]
*  That's why he's trying to protect you. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=129.04s)]
*  Well, I don't know. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=130.36s)]
*  So so fast forward to how he's saying something on the streets. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=131.36s)]
*  I was like, You know what, I'm just going to say something. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=133.64s)]
*  And I swear to God, hand in my heart, last time I was with you in California, I almost [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=135.36s)]
*  pulled you aside after we were on and I was going to tell you the story because I knew [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=139.96s)]
*  you knew Bill and I was going to back channel see if there was anything to the story from [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=143.44s)]
*  Bill's side. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=148.44s)]
*  Wow. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=149.44s)]
*  So imagine seven, I think six or seven years since we talked on your show. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=150.44s)]
*  Yeah, I don't even know. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=153.6s)]
*  2018. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=154.6s)]
*  Somebody said to me today. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=155.6s)]
*  But so anyway, sorry to talk to you. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=156.6s)]
*  But the point is, is so here I am fast forward. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=158.56s)]
*  I'm just sick of seeing memes of my face with Bill's and so I just decide on a spur of the [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=161.52s)]
*  moment, you know, so how he of course loves it. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=165.72s)]
*  But I said on how we show that first time, I don't think Bill's my half brother. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=168.92s)]
*  I don't think I don't think there's anything there other than like an uncanny resemblance. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=173.14s)]
*  Fast forward. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=179.01999999999998s)]
*  The thing comes out, it gets a little bit of social media and then it goes away. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=180.1s)]
*  And I think good. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=182.94s)]
*  And Bill didn't say anything. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=184.17999999999998s)]
*  So I figured Bill was kind of like whatever it was a mild amusement. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=185.17999999999998s)]
*  You know, he could have made a joke out of the whole thing and he didn't. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=188.26s)]
*  So then how he calls me and I'm in LA working recently and how he's like, we've come on [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=191.44s)]
*  the show. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=195.01999999999998s)]
*  Bill's going to be on. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=196.01999999999998s)]
*  And I said, Is Bill cool with it? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=197.45999999999998s)]
*  Oh, yeah, no problem. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=198.85999999999999s)]
*  So then I go there and it's like it turns into this thing that you see happening on [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=200.52s)]
*  camera. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=204.88000000000002s)]
*  It's like it's weirdness times. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=205.88000000000002s)]
*  It's like a like a like a skit, but it's real. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=206.88000000000002s)]
*  And Bill's on me. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=210.62s)]
*  Then Bill's on how we and it gets just OK. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=211.96s)]
*  So I just told you I basically everything I know. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=214.28s)]
*  OK, I have people I've known for 20, 30 years coming up to me going, what do you think? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=217.4s)]
*  And I said, I don't I don't I don't think we're related. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=222.44s)]
*  I mean, yeah, there's a resemblance, but I don't think we're related. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=225.12s)]
*  Well, did you get a DNA test? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=228.32s)]
*  And I'm like, no, I don't. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=231.22s)]
*  There's nothing to get a DNA test for. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=233.46s)]
*  Well, I think he's your brother. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=234.88s)]
*  So people that know me and I'm telling him I don't think he's my brother. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=237.12s)]
*  Now they want a DNA test to prove it. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=239.96s)]
*  That's how much it's taken on a life. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=242.57999999999998s)]
*  It's just because they want a DNA test because it's fun if he's your brother. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=244.12s)]
*  No, no, they're convinced. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=247.68s)]
*  For real, for real. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=249.22s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=250.22s)]
*  Really? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=251.22s)]
*  For real. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=252.22s)]
*  I swear to God. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=253.22s)]
*  I mean, people I'm close to people that were at my wedding. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=254.22s)]
*  I'm like, they like, no, you need a DNA test. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=255.74s)]
*  Did Bill's dad know? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=258.32s)]
*  Well, did your dad know Bill's mom? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=260.56s)]
*  No, my father wouldn't talk to me about it at all. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=264.0s)]
*  OK, some more context. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=267.92s)]
*  My stepmother in that same time 10 years ago when she told me that she thought Bill Burr [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=270.6s)]
*  was my half brother. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=274.16s)]
*  This guy don't know. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=275.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=276.8s)]
*  I mean, it just matched up. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=277.8s)]
*  Hey, hey, you know, Joe Polanski. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=278.8s)]
*  And you look up and it's a famous comedian. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=280.84s)]
*  That's you know, I mean, that. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=282.32s)]
*  So in that same thing with my stepmother, she told me that she thought my father had [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=283.92s)]
*  sired 12 children. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=289.64000000000004s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=291.32s)]
*  You know, all over the place, all over the place. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=292.32s)]
*  He was traveling musician and a whore to his own admittance. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=294.40000000000003s)]
*  So it kind of makes sense. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=297.98s)]
*  He once told me it slept with a thousand women. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=299.72s)]
*  So 12 out of a thousand. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=301.8s)]
*  You know, I mean, it's normal. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=303.92s)]
*  Yeah, the math is actually pretty good. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=304.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=307.92s)]
*  And so when I went to my father and I told him what my stepmother had said, he got really [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=309.32s)]
*  cagey and wouldn't tell me anything. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=313.97999999999996s)]
*  He promised me that he would write down the names of the illegitimate children on a piece [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=315.46s)]
*  of paper so I could find them after he died. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=320.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=322.17999999999995s)]
*  And he died. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=323.17999999999995s)]
*  He's died and there's no paper. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=324.17999999999995s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=325.17999999999995s)]
*  So now I got people wanting DNA tests because they're convinced that Bill is my half brother. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=327.34s)]
*  Is Bill willing to do a DNA test? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=332.84s)]
*  I think that's ridiculous. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=334.29999999999995s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=335.29999999999995s)]
*  It's like. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=336.29999999999995s)]
*  No, you have to do it. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=337.29999999999995s)]
*  No, no, that's what I'm saying. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=338.29999999999995s)]
*  I mean, first of all, to Bill's credit, he's been, everything you saw on camera was his, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=340.46000000000004s)]
*  I think his general irritation on the thing, but he also kind of finds it funny because [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=346.58s)]
*  he's a comedian. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=349.82s)]
*  I thought it was a skit. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=350.82s)]
*  I thought you guys put together a skit. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=352.34000000000003s)]
*  I really did. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=354.5s)]
*  I thought you got, because I thought, you know, Bill does a lot of acting. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=355.5s)]
*  I thought you guys were just fucking around. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=357.94s)]
*  You like pro wrestling. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=359.46000000000004s)]
*  I thought you guys just decided to control the world. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=360.66s)]
*  Let me put it to you this way. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=363.94s)]
*  Have you ever seen it? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=365.82s)]
*  And I'm assuming, but you tell me if I'm wrong. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=366.82s)]
*  Two guys get in the ring to roll around a bit, right? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=369.62s)]
*  They're bros. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=372.82s)]
*  They're going to roll around a bit. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=373.82s)]
*  Emotions kick in and next thing you know, somebody's tapping somebody out. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=376.18s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=378.9s)]
*  Do you ever see that happen? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=379.9s)]
*  For sure. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=380.9s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=381.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=382.9s)]
*  So in the heat of that moment with Bill and Howie egging it on, you know, like the emotionality [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=383.9s)]
*  of the thing came out because it's sort of a weird thing. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=389.62s)]
*  We're suddenly in the middle of a situation. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=394.1s)]
*  It's like a meta situation. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=395.72s)]
*  So yes, on some level we were playing along, but then it starts to become like, wait, this [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=397.86s)]
*  is kind of weird. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=402.38s)]
*  And then it starts to kick in and then Billy Bush is in there and it just, it took out [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=403.38s)]
*  a life of its own. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=407.22s)]
*  So what I'm saying is, is there's enough there that people are all over me to come up with [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=408.74s)]
*  more answers. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=413.86s)]
*  But you see what I'm saying? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=414.86s)]
*  It's like it's spun out of control into its own thing. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=416.86s)]
*  Now it's a DNA test problem, which is a bit on its own. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=419.78000000000003s)]
*  Like we're going to do like a live stream with, I will do it here. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=423.18s)]
*  Me, you and Bill. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=425.7s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=426.86s)]
*  Well, people would trust you if the two of you got together and just both took a DNA [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=427.86s)]
*  test and found out you were brothers. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=431.18s)]
*  I don't think Bill's my half brother, but he looks. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=432.86s)]
*  Well listen, there's a simple way to find out. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=436.5s)]
*  I'll finance it. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=438.34s)]
*  How much is a DNA test? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=439.42s)]
*  How much does a DNA test cost to find out if someone's your sibling? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=441.06s)]
*  Jamie, let's find out. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=444.62s)]
*  It can't be that much money. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=446.26s)]
*  It's 20, 25. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=447.26s)]
*  I'll do it. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=448.26s)]
*  We'll get it sponsored. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=449.26s)]
*  Yes, maybe 23 and me, but didn't they get sell out to somebody, somebody buy them? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=450.26s)]
*  200 bucks. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=454.5s)]
*  200 bucks. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=455.58s)]
*  There you go. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=456.58s)]
*  I'll pay 200 bucks to find out. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=457.58s)]
*  Why wouldn't you want to know? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=458.98s)]
*  If I thought somebody was my half brother, I'd be like, for real? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=459.98s)]
*  I don't think it's necessary. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=464.42s)]
*  If I found out Sebastian Manasalco was my half brother, I'd be like, I could kind of [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=465.42s)]
*  see that. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=470.18s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=471.18s)]
*  Again, all I know is I don't think, but when I look at him, he looks just like my father. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=474.18s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=479.78s)]
*  We look similar-ish, but when I look at him, he's got the same thing as my dad had. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=481.26s)]
*  You would know if somebody looked like your dad. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=486.61999999999995s)]
*  Sure. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=488.21999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=489.21999999999997s)]
*  That's where it's freaky for me. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=490.21999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=491.21999999999997s)]
*  If you want to play the game one step further, you've got two world-class communicators. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=493.71999999999997s)]
*  People might argue against me calling myself a world-class communicator, but I've been [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=497.58s)]
*  doing it for over 30 years. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=500.29999999999995s)]
*  You're a world-class communicator. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=501.7s)]
*  God bless. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=502.7s)]
*  It's not too crazy that you'd have one guy go this way and one guy ... You know what [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=504.58s)]
*  I mean? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=508.09999999999997s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=509.09999999999997s)]
*  Especially when you consider how many different ways you've gone. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=510.18s)]
*  Not just smashing pumpkins, but pro wrestling. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=513.1s)]
*  Now I'm entering your game, which is podcasting. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=516.3000000000001s)]

*  We can't know everything. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=528.48s)]
*  That's why it's crucial to have a support system. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=530.02s)]

*  When you're feeling down, spending time with a furry friend can be a good pick-me-up. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=540.5s)]
*  But I get it. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=544.38s)]

*  For these moments, try therapy. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=549.24s)]

*  Sure, very well. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=616.9s)]
*  So Carrot Top and I have become friends recently. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=617.98s)]
*  He's great. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=620.14s)]
*  Love him. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=621.14s)]
*  This is total sweetheart. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=622.14s)]
*  Sweetheart of a guy. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=623.14s)]
*  And really master ... [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=624.14s)]
*  Genuine. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=625.14s)]
*  Just a great guy to know. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=626.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=627.14s)]
*  But as you know, because you do this for a living, suddenly everybody wants to start [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=628.14s)]
*  pitching you bits. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=631.9s)]
*  So I made the mistake of pitching Carrot Top a bit. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=633.98s)]
*  I thought I had a good bit for him. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=637.74s)]
*  And he didn't respond. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=640.02s)]
*  And then I texted him an hour later and said, hey, did you just get that bit? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=642.06s)]
*  And he goes, yeah, that's why I didn't respond. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=644.6999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, people get tired of that. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=646.5s)]
*  Also it's like most comics, they want it to be their idea. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=650.4599999999999s)]
*  Like the whole idea. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=653.62s)]
*  What you're doing on stage is essentially like here's the world from my eyes. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=654.62s)]
*  Yeah, it's like somebody telling me how to write a song. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=657.9399999999999s)]

*  Right. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=660.9399999999999s)]
*  It's one thing for another. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=661.9399999999999s)]
*  Comics, we give each other tags. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=662.9399999999999s)]
*  Like if someone says something, I said, you know what else you can add to that? [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=665.18s)]
*  Add this. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=667.74s)]
*  Oh, I see. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=668.74s)]
*  A buddy of mine was doing this bit on the guy who tried to shoot Trump. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=669.74s)]
*  We were bantering back and forth and we came up with the perfect line. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=673.62s)]
*  Like, oh! [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=677.3399999999999s)]
*  There it is. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=678.3399999999999s)]
*  But it was already his premise and his bit. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=679.3399999999999s)]
*  Comics add to stuff for each other for fun. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=681.9399999999999s)]
*  It's like we sort of toss the ball around in the green room and then someone will come [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=684.5799999999999s)]
*  up with a new line for you. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=690.26s)]
*  We'll do that. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=691.38s)]
*  But no one ever says, hey, you should go on stage and talk about this. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=692.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=696.0999999999999s)]
*  I've had a couple professional comedians, Carrot Top, preeminent among them kind of [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=699.1s)]
*  let me know you're not that funny. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=703.5s)]
*  It's probably not that you're not that funny. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=705.66s)]
*  First of all, you send a text. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=707.9s)]
*  Premises in text are terrible. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=710.1s)]
*  Oh, right. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=711.1s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=712.1s)]
*  The tone, tone is probably. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=713.1s)]
*  Yeah, it's everything. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=714.1s)]
*  And you really have to be there with the person and you really have to like say it the way [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=715.1s)]
*  you thought it and then they get it. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=718.98s)]
*  Text is just, unless it's just genius, unless it's just like rock solid structure, like, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=722.26s)]
*  oh my God, this joke can't fail. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=726.5400000000001s)]
*  We do have a movie idea that we're working on. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=728.42s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=730.6999999999999s)]
*  And it's a good one. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=731.6999999999999s)]
*  What is it? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=732.6999999999999s)]
*  I can't give it away. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=733.6999999999999s)]
*  I'll tell you privately, but it's a good one. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=734.6999999999999s)]
*  You and Carrot Top? [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=735.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=736.86s)]
*  Oh, nice. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=737.86s)]
*  That he likes. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=738.86s)]
*  Okay. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=739.86s)]
*  He likes my movie idea. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=740.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=741.86s)]
*  I'm telling you a lot of it is that comics don't like people coming to them with a premise. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=742.86s)]
*  They only want, and they only want help from other comics generally. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=747.4599999999999s)]
*  Okay, I get that. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=751.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=753.0999999999999s)]
*  It's just one of those things. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=754.0999999999999s)]
*  And even then it's touchy. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=755.0999999999999s)]
*  I would never help someone that I don't know. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=756.4200000000001s)]
*  I would never go up to them, hey, you should say this. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=758.0600000000001s)]
*  Never, never, never, never, never. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=760.38s)]
*  It's got to be like your friend. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=762.26s)]
*  They know you love them. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=763.82s)]
*  You're fucking around. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=764.82s)]
*  You can talk. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=765.82s)]
*  You can say, did you ever try to say that? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=766.82s)]
*  You know what you left out? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=768.86s)]
*  You forgot, and they're like, oh, I forgot about that. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=769.86s)]
*  Yeah, that's a big part of the bit. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=771.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=774.02s)]
*  I never tried stand-up, so that's- [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=775.02s)]
*  You could do it. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=776.02s)]
*  It seems terrifying to me. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=777.02s)]
*  So singing on stage. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=778.78s)]
*  You could do it. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=780.2s)]
*  It's a lot easier to scream with 50,000 watts behind your voice than tell a joke and it's [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=781.4200000000001s)]
*  bomb. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=786.0999999999999s)]
*  Is it though? [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=787.0999999999999s)]
*  Because you could suck at that and then it's terrifying too. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=788.0999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=790.2199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=791.2199999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's all hard to do. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=792.2199999999999s)]
*  Anything at the highest level, it's hard to do. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=793.2199999999999s)]
*  That's true. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=795.7399999999999s)]
*  You're doing arena shows. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=796.7399999999999s)]
*  I've watched a lot of people perform in front of arenas singing. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=797.7399999999999s)]
*  It's hard. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=800.8199999999999s)]
*  That's a hard thing to do. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=801.9799999999999s)]
*  Most people freak the fuck out. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=802.9799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=804.3s)]
*  That part doesn't bother me, strangely. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=805.8199999999999s)]
*  Well, that's why you're good at it. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=807.0999999999999s)]
*  Right? [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=809.3s)]
*  I feel like I kind of know what I'm doing up there for some reason. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=810.3s)]
*  Well, also I think it's like there's a buildup, right? [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=813.02s)]
*  You start working in small clubs, you make your way to larger places and then eventually [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=815.58s)]
*  you sell more and more records. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=819.82s)]
*  Like Smashing Pumpkins is like they burst on the scene and sort of keep, you guys kept [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=821.74s)]
*  getting more and more popular so you kind of got accustomed to it. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=827.22s)]
*  Yeah, you do normalize to the insanity of standing in front of 10,000 people. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=830.86s)]
*  Same as comedy. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=834.98s)]
*  You normalize. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=835.98s)]
*  What's the biggest show you've ever done? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=836.98s)]
*  Comedy. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=840.0200000000001s)]
*  25,000. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=841.0200000000001s)]
*  That's a lot of people. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=842.0200000000001s)]
*  We sold out the Tacoma Dome and we were standing backstage. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=843.18s)]
*  I'll never forget it. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=847.18s)]
*  He looked at me like right before he goes on stage he goes, not a lot of motherfuckers [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=848.34s)]
*  get to do this. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=852.26s)]

*  For comments. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=860.34s)]
*  In the round too, in the round. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=861.34s)]

*  I actually know Dave from way back in the day. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=865.02s)]
*  He's the best. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=867.54s)]
*  When he first burst on the scene, we used to hang out a little bit. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=868.54s)]
*  I feel like it's cool that I knew him. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=872.02s)]
*  What year is this? [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=873.74s)]
*  Remember he did a couple things on SNL really early on. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=875.8199999999999s)]
*  He was kind of around TV. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=879.1s)]
*  The first year he was on television, I don't remember, I'd see him in New York and he was [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=881.38s)]
*  hanging out with some other, maybe it was because he was hanging out with SNL people. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=885.1s)]
*  I'd see him out in New York back in the late 90s, early 2000s. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=888.66s)]
*  I knew him when, I don't want to say he was a nobody. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=894.02s)]
*  He wasn't famous yet. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=896.46s)]
*  He wasn't a known, I'd seen him on TV but he wasn't a household name like he is now. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=897.46s)]
*  There was this one night where I was out. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=902.94s)]
*  I did a benefit for Roger Waters and military vets. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=905.1800000000001s)]
*  It was amazing in New York. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=909.1800000000001s)]
*  It was all these guys who were single, double, and triple amputees playing Pink Floyd music. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=910.1800000000001s)]
*  So I did this concert with Roger. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=914.98s)]
*  So afterwards somebody came and said, oh, Chappelle's in this hotel. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=919.2600000000001s)]
*  I hadn't seen him for a few years and I said, well, I know him. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=923.74s)]
*  You could see people think, you don't know him. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=926.3000000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=928.7s)]
*  He came by and I was like, oh, it was like that moment. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=929.7s)]
*  Like, see motherfuckers, I do know him. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=931.9000000000001s)]
*  What a great guy though. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=934.34s)]
*  Such a... [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=935.34s)]
*  He's a genuine person. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=936.34s)]
*  He's another sweetheart. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=937.34s)]
*  Just a sweet, sweet guy. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=938.34s)]
*  Easy to hang out with, very fun. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=940.7s)]
*  Yeah, guys with that kind of mind, it blows my mind because they just... [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=942.38s)]
*  I just don't know, I could sit and listen to him for hours. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=948.7800000000001s)]
*  He's also kind of a legend for what he did. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=950.7800000000001s)]
*  Oh, walked away? [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=953.38s)]
*  Left Comedy Central in the height of Chappelle's show, passed up on a $50 million deal, went [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=954.46s)]
*  to Africa, hung out there, and then came back and didn't do standup for 10 years. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=960.58s)]
*  I didn't know that he didn't do standup for 10 years. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=966.34s)]
*  He would do standup occasionally for free. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=968.26s)]
*  So what he would do is he'd bring a speaker to the park and set up a mic in the park in [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=971.54s)]
*  Seattle and just start doing standup. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=975.9399999999999s)]
*  And everybody would be like, holy shit, it's Dave Chappelle. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=977.86s)]
*  Was he making any money or was he just... [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=978.86s)]
*  Nope. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=980.9s)]
*  Nope. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=981.9s)]
*  Just living off of his Chappelle money. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=982.9s)]
*  I didn't know that part. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=984.42s)]
*  He made millions of dollars from the show, passed up on $50 but probably made... [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=985.5799999999999s)]
*  I remember that. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=989.14s)]
*  Remember it became a big conspiracy thing? [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=990.14s)]
*  Yes, it became a conspiracy of why he left. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=992.14s)]
*  He was saying no to the Illuminati and all that stuff. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=994.26s)]
*  Right, right, right, right. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=997.18s)]
*  Those are always funny. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=998.18s)]
*  That's some Alex stuff, right? [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=999.18s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1000.18s)]
*  It's like, you're like, what? [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1001.18s)]
*  Are you sure that's what happened? [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1002.18s)]
*  I kind of know what happened because the people that were running Comedy Central back then, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1004.06s)]
*  I had dealt with. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1008.86s)]
*  The nice folks shouldn't have been running comedy. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1012.5400000000001s)]
*  They shouldn't have been telling comedians what to do. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1014.34s)]
*  And they wanted to kind of... [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1017.02s)]
*  So they were back to telling comedians what to do. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1018.02s)]
*  It was a situation where a bunch of non-creatives had gotten involved in the process. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1019.5s)]
*  I'm sure you're familiar with that. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1024.58s)]
*  This is so dear to my heart. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1026.14s)]
*  It's disgusting. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1028.42s)]
*  It's the worst aspect of show business. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1029.42s)]
*  You start dealing with money people and then they start doing something that they're not [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1031.58s)]
*  supposed to be doing, which was like adding, changing, directing, moving ideas. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1034.78s)]
*  And then you're dealing with literal morons that somehow or another got this job and they're [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1040.98s)]
*  telling you how to do what you're doing, which is what is the best sketch show in the world. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1045.3s)]
*  And still popular. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1051.74s)]
*  It's as good as any sketch show that's ever existed and they only did two seasons. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1053.5s)]
*  So he just decides, I'm just going to be an artist. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1057.22s)]
*  I'm just going to hang out. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1061.38s)]
*  I'm not going to make any money. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1062.66s)]
*  He would show up at open mic nights. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1063.94s)]
*  So they'd have open mic nights for musicians, play folk songs. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1065.8600000000001s)]
*  And at the end of that, like midnight, he would pull up and start talking. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1069.54s)]
*  And by 15 minutes into set, everybody had told everybody that Dave Chappelle's there. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1072.58s)]
*  So then the place is packed. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1076.3s)]
*  And he did this for like 10 years, man. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1077.3s)]
*  I didn't know that part. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1079.74s)]
*  Yeah, he just fucked around. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1080.74s)]
*  You'd hear about him just showing up places and fucking around. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1081.74s)]
*  I love that. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1084.54s)]
*  And then somewhere I think it was like 2013, 14, starts doing standup again. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1085.6999999999998s)]
*  And then boom. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1091.78s)]
*  Yeah, that's really how it all went down. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1093.26s)]
*  It's really a testament to the power of his talent because my wife who's 32, she loves [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1097.34s)]
*  him. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1102.54s)]
*  And it's so cool because we went to see him, I think, at Radio City Music Hall. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1103.54s)]
*  And it's so cool because it's like, I'm 57, she's 32. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1109.06s)]
*  It's like that he can speak to both of us. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1113.3s)]
*  So right to the heart. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1116.06s)]
*  It's really a rare gift. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1118.3799999999999s)]
*  I mean, you got a picture out there, Richard Pryor, who was from Illinois like myself. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1119.86s)]
*  My father loved Richard Pryor. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1125.74s)]
*  And so because of my father's love for Richard Pryor, I paid a lot of attention to Richard [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1127.06s)]
*  when I was a kid. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1129.74s)]
*  And he strikes me. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1131.54s)]
*  He's got that transcendent ability to somehow almost heal the country with his messaging. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1132.54s)]
*  Yes. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1138.62s)]
*  Murphy had that too in his own way. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1139.62s)]
*  But to me, Chappelle's more in the Pryor mode of like somehow he can address issues that [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1141.1399999999999s)]
*  are uncomfortable. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1146.8999999999999s)]
*  And I know a lot of people have issues with what he says. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1148.86s)]
*  But I ultimately see what he's trying to do is heal things. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1151.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1155.5s)]
*  Very much like Pryor. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1157.3s)]
*  Whereas Eddie Murphy was just really, really funny. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1158.54s)]
*  Just really, really funny. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1161.8999999999999s)]
*  And he's still to this day, I'm like, why doesn't that guy come back? [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1162.8999999999999s)]
*  He did this one thing when he got the Mark Twain Award where he did this whole impression [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1167.46s)]
*  of Bill Cosby finding out they had to give away one of his awards because he was caught [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1171.5s)]
*  up in the scandal. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1176.42s)]
*  And so he's doing a Cosby impression. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1177.42s)]
*  And it's fucking genius. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1178.42s)]
*  It's dead on. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1179.86s)]
*  He's doing like brilliant stand up. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1180.9399999999998s)]
*  And he hasn't touched stand up in 25, 30 years. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1182.3799999999999s)]
*  I mean, you would think he would just do one victory lap tour. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1186.4199999999998s)]
*  If he wanted to, it would be sold out. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1188.8999999999999s)]
*  Talk about stadiums. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1190.6999999999998s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1191.6999999999998s)]
*  And I guarantee you that guy would be the best. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1192.78s)]
*  He was so fucking talented, but just decided it was just too much. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1195.6999999999998s)]
*  I'd rather just do movies. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1199.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1201.1799999999998s)]
*  Which is kind of crazy. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1202.1799999999998s)]
*  But Pryor never did, obviously. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1203.1799999999998s)]
*  Pryor kept doing it. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1204.86s)]
*  Has anyone ever tried to pull you in the movie orbit? [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1205.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1208.4199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1209.4199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not interested. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1210.98s)]
*  I'm not interested. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1211.98s)]
*  They only offer me parts like a serial killer. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1212.98s)]
*  I always turn it down. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1215.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1217.54s)]
*  There's been a few tempting ones, but no, I don't have that kind of time. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1218.54s)]
*  And I also don't have the desire to do it. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1222.5s)]
*  It's not something I enjoyed. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1224.6200000000001s)]
*  Sitting on that set all day seems like a... [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1226.3400000000001s)]
*  It's a lot of work. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1228.0600000000002s)]
*  It's hard. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1229.7s)]
*  And to be a real good actor, like a really good actor, you know, the rehearsing and the [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1230.7s)]
*  practicing and the going over the character, it's like I couldn't do it because I don't [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1234.6200000000001s)]
*  have the time. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1238.8600000000001s)]
*  It would require everything I have. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1239.86s)]
*  If you really wanted to do it right, if I really wanted to do a role in a movie where [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1241.9399999999998s)]
*  I played somebody, I would have to fucking really spend time not doing anything but that. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1246.34s)]
*  You know? [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1252.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1253.1s)]
*  It's just not... [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1254.1s)]
*  That's not my jam. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1256.3s)]
*  There's people out there that do it. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1257.3s)]
*  I'm glad they do it because I love movies. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1258.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1260.1s)]
*  But I don't want to do it. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1261.1s)]
*  Did you watch the Oscars? [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1262.1s)]
*  I did not. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1263.1s)]
*  Me neither. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1264.1s)]
*  I never watch award shows. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1265.1s)]
*  I don't think you should give away awards for art. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1266.1s)]
*  I think it's silly. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1268.38s)]
*  I don't get it. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1269.9s)]
*  I think it's dumb. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1270.9s)]
*  I think it's all... [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1271.9s)]
*  Really who's making money is the people that are putting it on television. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1274.8200000000002s)]
*  I mean, that's really what it is. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1277.42s)]
*  It's just a big money grab. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1278.7800000000002s)]
*  They're all just selling advertising and everybody's wearing a tux and it's like... [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1280.22s)]
*  Well certainly the public's growing disinterest in awards shows is some indication that people [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1283.74s)]
*  no longer believe in either the integrity of the process or maybe the intent of the [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1290.42s)]
*  process. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1295.66s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1296.66s)]
*  Maybe the process and the intent are both compromised. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1297.66s)]
*  Right? [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1299.74s)]
*  Because there's people that... [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1300.74s)]
*  You could kind of guess just by the subject of some movies whether or not they're going [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1303.02s)]
*  to win an award. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1306.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1307.46s)]
*  Because people feel obligated to address this very important message. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1308.46s)]
*  The guy who won Best Picture, I was actually in talks with about five years ago because [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1311.9s)]
*  he had made some really cool movies. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1318.1000000000001s)]
*  He made one on cell phones. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1319.3000000000002s)]
*  I think it was called Tangerine about prostitutes working the streets in LA. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1320.9s)]
*  He got two street workers I believe and then he cast them. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1325.66s)]
*  So it was a movie. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1329.42s)]
*  It wasn't a documentary. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1330.42s)]
*  It was a really beautiful movie. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1331.42s)]
*  And then he did that movie called The Florida Project where he at the end of the movie they [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1332.7s)]
*  actually snuck into Disney World and shot stuff and somehow Disney let it go. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1337.26s)]
*  Really? [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1341.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1342.9s)]
*  But it was kind of about the social milieu around a place like Disney World, like what [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1343.9s)]
*  goes on outside the gates. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1347.74s)]
*  People living in motels and kind of perpetual tourist economy, kind of living hand to mouth [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1349.94s)]
*  and kind of using the white whale of tourism to just get enough money because there's always [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1354.82s)]
*  some turnover, whether it's running scams and stuff. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1359.82s)]
*  So he made a really beautiful movie about that as well. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1362.4199999999998s)]
*  So I was in talks with him for a while about doing something and then it just didn't go [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1364.6s)]
*  anywhere. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1367.46s)]
*  Like what kind of scams? [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1368.46s)]
*  I can't remember because it's been a few years since. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1369.46s)]
*  It's just the idea that anywhere there's a tourist economy, there's money to be made. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1371.86s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1376.1s)]
*  There's the guy standing on the corner selling brochures or hustling you into a van to see [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1377.1s)]
*  where the stars live. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1381.1399999999999s)]
*  It was kind of about that. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1382.54s)]
*  About a cast of characters living in the shadow of this idealistic place. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1385.26s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1390.1399999999999s)]
*  Just like those Hollywood tour people that you would get in LA. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1391.1399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1393.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1394.58s)]
*  Those were the weirdest fucking people. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1395.58s)]
*  Well, I always get offended when I walk down Hollywood Boulevard and they think I want [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1397.42s)]
*  to go on it. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1401.1399999999999s)]
*  It's like, I don't know what it is. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1402.1399999999999s)]
*  I feel like I don't want to go on your tour. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1403.1399999999999s)]
*  You look like a guy. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1405.5s)]
*  Totally. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1406.5s)]
*  You would get on a tour. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1407.5s)]
*  Just got off the boat. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1408.5s)]
*  Just came here from Nebraska. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1410.86s)]
*  Totally. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1411.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1412.86s)]
*  I wonder where the stars live. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1414.1799999999998s)]
*  That's such a creepy thing to do. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1415.1799999999998s)]
*  Just drive around and point. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1417.62s)]
*  That's where Ben Affleck sleeps. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1418.82s)]
*  But they've been doing it since the 30s. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1419.82s)]
*  Yeah, forever. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1421.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1422.58s)]
*  I have some of the old brochures, see where Greta Garber lives and all that stuff. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1423.58s)]
*  It's just always been weird. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1427.82s)]
*  Back then it was even weirder because those were the first stars. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1429.3799999999999s)]
*  Back then, they went way out of their way to turn them into gods. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1434.3s)]
*  They airbrushed the shit out of every photo and they cover up scandals. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1439.6999999999998s)]
*  There's that one famous scandal where one of the top male stars, maybe it was Gary Cooper, [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1443.64s)]
*  Cary Grant, ran somebody over in a car. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1448.4s)]
*  Really? [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1450.24s)]
*  You know about that? [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1451.24s)]
*  No. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1452.24s)]
*  You want me to look that one up? [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1453.24s)]
*  I know the fatty Arboca one. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1454.24s)]
*  No. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1455.24s)]
*  It was a top A level star. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1456.24s)]
*  I think he was drunk, ran over somebody in a car and somebody from the studio went to [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1457.24s)]
*  jail for seven years and took the rap so that the star could stay out and the studio paid [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1461.5200000000002s)]
*  the guy a stipend to go to jail. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1466.64s)]
*  Wow. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1468.3200000000002s)]
*  It's a very famous story. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1469.3200000000002s)]
*  Some guy did seven years or something. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1471.56s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1473.96s)]
*  You know, there's a similar story about that in China with the bodies exhibit. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1474.96s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1479.84s)]
*  There was a woman who was married to a mayor of one of the cities in China. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1481.34s)]
*  This woman who was married to this mayor, the mayor was having an affair with a TV newscaster [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1488.44s)]
*  and he got the TV newscaster pregnant. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1494.8799999999999s)]
*  There was a confrontation between the woman and the wife and the lady winds up missing. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1499.8799999999999s)]
*  She gets scrubbed from the Internet. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1506.6599999999999s)]
*  I mean, she's scrubbed. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1508.32s)]
*  There's only like a photo of her on the Internet. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1509.6s)]
*  And then all of a sudden in the bodyworks exhibit, there's an eight month pregnant woman [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1512.76s)]
*  who they believe is this newscaster. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1518.08s)]
*  Here's the other part. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1521.12s)]
*  The woman who's the mayor's wife is also the manager of the local plastination factory [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1522.6s)]
*  where they take the bodies and they emerge them, they immerse them in these solvents [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1529.9599999999998s)]
*  and turn them into statues. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1536.7199999999998s)]
*  This woman was the manager of the place that produced the woman with the eight month fetus [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1538.8s)]
*  in her body. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1544.9199999999998s)]
*  And you can still see it. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1545.9199999999998s)]
*  Like it's on tour. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1548.6s)]
*  You can go see this lady who was most likely murdered. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1549.76s)]
*  So then she didn't just kill that lady. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1553.52s)]
*  She poisoned some British businessman. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1556.56s)]
*  So she poisons this guy and she has to go to trial. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1560.0s)]
*  Well she doesn't go to trial. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1563.8799999999999s)]
*  Some other woman goes to trial who doesn't look anything like her. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1565.84s)]
*  Raises her right hand, the whole thing, goes to jail. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1569.52s)]
*  So she probably paid some family off, some poor family. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1572.1799999999998s)]
*  I'll give you a million dollars. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1576.48s)]
*  Give up your daughter. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1578.32s)]
*  She goes to jail. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1579.42s)]
*  Everybody is rich. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1580.42s)]
*  It's not a bad jail. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1581.42s)]
*  She's going to do yoga, play checkers. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1582.42s)]
*  Have you heard the ones where like, because there's so much plastic surgery in Asia where [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1584.9s)]
*  guys are suing their wives because they marry some women that gets hot and then the kid [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1588.9s)]
*  comes out and the kid's not very good looking. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1592.94s)]
*  Jawline's totally different, different nose. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1594.46s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot of plastic surgery over there. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1596.3400000000001s)]
*  In Korea it's nuts. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1598.42s)]
*  They do their eyes in this strange doll way. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1599.42s)]
*  Somebody told me as much as 75% of the women in South Korea have surgery. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1601.46s)]
*  What? [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1605.0200000000002s)]
*  Is it really? [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1606.0200000000002s)]
*  Somebody who's Korean told me that. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1607.0200000000002s)]
*  I don't know if that's true. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1608.0200000000002s)]
*  We need to find this out. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1609.18s)]
*  This is important information. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1610.18s)]
*  Because last time I was in Korea, I was like, wow, these women here are really hot. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1611.18s)]
*  Like this was like woman after woman after woman. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1614.3799999999999s)]
*  And somebody pulled me aside and said, bro, that's like, that's just all plastic surgery. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1616.9s)]
*  That's not real. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1620.5s)]
*  Wow. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1621.5s)]
*  Wow. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1622.5s)]

*  And I was hanging out with all the cool people at the time. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1896.6599999999999s)]
*  So I'm in the fourth row and it was infamously a draw. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1898.82s)]
*  It was almost all English tourists that had come in for the fight. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1902.3s)]
*  They were booing the national anthem. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1905.6599999999999s)]
*  I mean it was a pretty riotous atmosphere. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1906.9799999999998s)]
*  And I don't know anything about fights, but it was a pretty boring fight. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1911.34s)]
*  This seemed to be a little bit more agile because of youth and all that. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1918.22s)]
*  Anyway, so right when I, you know, whatever they're doing, HBO, they're over there in [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1921.98s)]
*  the corner, they're doing their bit, you know what I mean, they're talking before they go [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1928.14s)]
*  to the scorecards. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1930.6200000000001s)]

*  Don King. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1938.34s)]

*  Right? [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1941.46s)]
*  So I knew it was a draw like 60 seconds before they announced it. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1942.82s)]
*  And I was with a lot of well-known people and I said, run. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1947.8999999999999s)]

*  I said, we gotta run. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1954.6999999999998s)]
*  And I started grabbing people and we ran out of Madison Square Garden. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1955.86s)]
*  And we're almost totally out the building, you know, kind of where you get to the concourse [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1959.62s)]
*  part and you hear the decision and it's like, and people start like, here comes the riot [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1962.86s)]
*  vibe. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1968.2199999999998s)]
*  Really? [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1969.2199999999998s)]
*  So somehow we ended up because it got so- [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1970.2199999999998s)]
*  Was it because the decision was bad? [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1971.2199999999998s)]
*  Well the English people didn't like that it was a draw. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1973.1799999999998s)]
*  Oh. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1975.6599999999999s)]
*  Because Holyfield was on the older side and it's not a well-renowned fight. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1976.8200000000002s)]
*  I can't remember it. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1981.3000000000002s)]
*  It was just a draw. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1982.94s)]
*  It was a stone cold boring fight but because it was a draw and all these English people [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1983.94s)]
*  were mad and Don King was involved, so it was all that typical brouhaha that was going [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1987.74s)]
*  on in boxing at the time. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1991.6200000000001s)]
*  Anyway so because of the, suddenly the riotous or potentially riotous situation, the police [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1992.94s)]
*  started like making people go different ways, like funneling traffic or something. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=1998.98s)]
*  It was almost like they got like code red or something because like suddenly it got [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2003.38s)]
*  really weird. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2006.22s)]
*  So then we couldn't get out of the building. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2007.82s)]
*  So somebody was like, somebody recognized somebody in our party, follow me. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2010.06s)]
*  So then next thing we know, we end up in the VIP backstage part where it's safe. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2013.5s)]
*  And there's Michael Buffer on a chair. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2019.6200000000001s)]
*  And he wasn't talking to me but he's talking to somebody and all I heard was going, that's [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2023.42s)]
*  bullshit. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2026.46s)]
*  Like in that voice. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2027.46s)]
*  That's all I remember. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2028.9s)]
*  That's bullshit. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2030.26s)]
*  So was he talking about the decision? [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2032.26s)]
*  He thought the decision was bullshit. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2033.26s)]
*  You know? [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2035.3s)]
*  Letterman's card was heavy for Lewis. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2036.3s)]
*  Wow, 117-111 Harold Letterman who's always dead on the money. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2038.1s)]
*  Harold Letterman was always right. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2042.62s)]
*  So they were saying as it got called, like this is a travesty. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2044.22s)]
*  Yeah I mean again, I'm not a, I mean I'm not a fight aficionado but I thought Lewis was [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2046.5s)]
*  slightly better. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2052.54s)]
*  Wow, I forgot about this fight. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2053.54s)]
*  I completely forgot about this fight. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2056.22s)]
*  There's so many fights from this era that were incredible. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2058.34s)]
*  That was an amazing era for heavyweights. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2062.22s)]
*  And this is when Don King was still running everything. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2066.18s)]
*  Did they have a rematch? [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2068.2999999999997s)]
*  I honestly don't remember. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2069.2999999999997s)]
*  You don't think so? [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2072.14s)]
*  No I think so. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2073.14s)]
*  I want to type it in. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2074.14s)]
*  That said two. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2075.14s)]
*  Let me see. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2076.14s)]
*  That's bullshit. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2077.14s)]
*  With that great voice. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2078.14s)]
*  With that voice. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2079.14s)]
*  He's still trucking. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2080.14s)]
*  He's still trucking. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2081.14s)]
*  He still announces huge box fights. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2082.3799999999997s)]
*  I wonder what he's like, like, because do you ever get that, like somebody wants you [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2084.54s)]
*  to do their bar mitzvah or anything, do you ever get those requests? [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2089.3399999999997s)]
*  No. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2091.66s)]
*  I get those requests. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2092.66s)]
*  Will you come do my bar mitzvah? [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2094.1s)]
*  Who won this one? [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2095.54s)]
*  Is that the rematch? [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2097.3399999999997s)]
*  Had to be Lewis, right? [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2098.3399999999997s)]
*  I would imagine. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2100.14s)]
*  Oh, similar letterman card. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2101.14s)]
*  Similar card. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2105.14s)]
*  Let's see if they robbed him twice. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2106.14s)]
*  They gave it to him. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2107.14s)]
*  All right. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2108.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2109.14s)]
*  Well they got their rematch. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2110.14s)]
*  No, you get this thing like, hey, will you come do my... [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2111.14s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2114.8199999999997s)]
*  I wonder what Michael Buffer gets to show up somewhere. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2115.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it's probably like Saudi Arabia. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2117.7s)]
*  They have them come over there and introduce someone's birthday. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2119.8999999999996s)]
*  Is it like half a million? [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2122.62s)]
*  Probably more. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2124.62s)]
*  Depends. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2125.62s)]
*  You know, I mean like... [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2126.62s)]
*  You know, in my business we couldn't become privates. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2129.02s)]
*  Right. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2131.42s)]
*  I saw Stone Temple Pilots. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2132.42s)]
*  They played Dana White's 40th birthday party. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2134.02s)]
*  And there was no one in the room other than UFC employees. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2137.94s)]
*  And they put on a show like it was a fucking sold out arena. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2141.8799999999997s)]
*  I mean, full blast. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2145.98s)]
*  They didn't go through the motions at all. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2148.2999999999997s)]
*  It was a phenomenal show. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2150.22s)]
*  That means Dana paid him. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2152.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2153.6600000000003s)]
*  It was a lot of money. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2154.6600000000003s)]
*  I mean, totally. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2155.6600000000003s)]
*  I love those guys. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2156.6600000000003s)]
*  But they were so professional. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2157.6600000000003s)]
*  It was like, it was so impressive. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2158.6600000000003s)]
*  And because they were so like powerful on stage, everybody just started paying attention. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2159.6600000000003s)]
*  Because it kind of broke out in the middle of this party. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2164.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2166.58s)]
*  Where this birthday party where I'll stand around tables, eating food, having fun. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2167.58s)]
*  I've done a few things and it's always a bit awkward. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2170.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2173.02s)]
*  Which is weird because they're all paid gigs. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2174.02s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2175.7000000000003s)]
*  But something about a paid paid gig feels different. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2176.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2179.1800000000003s)]
*  There's a lot of entitlement that's attached to like someone paying you to come perform [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2180.4199999999996s)]
*  at their birthday party. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2185.7s)]
*  Well, and then you see the guy's wife going, who's this? [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2186.7s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2188.2999999999997s)]
*  There's that too. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2189.2999999999997s)]
*  The people that aren't fans are like, oh no. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2190.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2193.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, those are weird gigs. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2194.7799999999997s)]
*  Because then you go, how much? [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2196.7s)]
*  I could have one shitty night for a million dollars. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2197.7s)]
*  I mean, I'd like to tell you, I haven't been there, but I've been there. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2202.62s)]
*  Ron White did one last year in Vegas and he was talking about it. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2209.22s)]
*  He's like, I didn't want to do it. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2212.7s)]
*  I kept saying no and they kept going higher and higher. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2214.14s)]
*  And eventually got to a point where I go, oh, fuck it, I'll do it. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2216.7799999999997s)]
*  And he goes, it wasn't worth it. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2220.66s)]
*  He goes, it was one of the worst fucking nights of my life. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2221.94s)]
*  He goes, all the time I'm doing it, I'm thinking, I shouldn't have fucking done this. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2225.5s)]
*  He said they didn't laugh. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2231.2999999999997s)]
*  They barely paid attention. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2232.2999999999997s)]
*  It's like, why am I here? [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2233.2999999999997s)]
*  But if you're a giant fan, say if you're a giant Ron White fan and you hire Ron White, [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2235.66s)]
*  but your office doesn't give a shit about comedy and they just want to have fun and [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2240.2999999999997s)]
*  drink and eat hot dogs. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2244.8199999999997s)]
*  I went to a billionaire thing once with a guy that hired Diana Ross. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2247.06s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2250.2999999999997s)]
*  It had to at least be a million dollar gig for her. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2251.2999999999997s)]
*  And maybe 700, 800 people. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2254.2999999999997s)]
*  Wow. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2257.02s)]
*  And you're like, wow, basically a private concert with Diana Ross. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2258.02s)]
*  That's pretty dope. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2262.46s)]
*  If you were really into it and people paid attention, it'd probably be fun. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2264.82s)]
*  Small, intimate concert. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2267.26s)]
*  I've done them where they're fun. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2268.26s)]
*  Yeah? [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2269.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2270.26s)]
*  What percentage? [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2271.26s)]
*  Less than 50. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2272.26s)]
*  We don't get asked, to be fair, or not fair, we don't get asked to do it a lot. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2274.5s)]
*  I don't think we're on most people's bingo card for a private event. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2278.02s)]
*  I think my rep precedes me. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2282.54s)]
*  It's like a Beyonce thing. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2285.1000000000004s)]

*  Of course. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2494.68s)]

*  What was he trying to pitch Jimmy John on? [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2547.24s)]
*  Some kind of investment scheme or something. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2550.14s)]

*  Oh boy. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2556.2s)]
*  I call it, he plays billionaire lotto. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2557.2s)]
*  He's hoping that when one of them knocks over, they'll leave him a taste. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2560.88s)]
*  How bizarre. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2566.84s)]
*  He's like a vampire familiar. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2567.84s)]
*  What's interesting about Tommy is his uncle was the founder of Hard Rock Cafe. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2569.96s)]
*  He grew up in a family with money. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2574.8s)]
*  Instead of somebody who you figure was poor and aspirational and want to hang out with [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2578.4s)]
*  billionaires, he actually came from money. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2581.92s)]
*  He knows how to speak the language of wealthy people. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2583.96s)]
*  He's generally welcome in those circles. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2586.8s)]
*  I grew up poor in the suburbs. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2588.8s)]
*  I don't know how to roll in that world. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2591.04s)]
*  Tommy I think he's probably up to about seven or eight billionaires that he counts as friends. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2594.88s)]
*  What does he do for a living? [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2599.36s)]

*  That's his name, Tommy Lipnick. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2609.6800000000003s)]
*  He doesn't like the idea. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2612.08s)]
*  Yeah, I wonder why. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2613.08s)]
*  It just outed him. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2614.08s)]
*  We don't have time for it, but I could make you a list of 50 people that are super famous [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2617.1600000000003s)]
*  like Bono on down who have pulled me aside and go, what's the deal with Tommy? [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2621.4s)]

*  In fact, I have to tell you a story about my father too, but he'll take umbrage with [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2633.16s)]
*  the way I'm portraying him. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2636.36s)]
*  I'm sure he will. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2638.36s)]
*  The story I want to tell you about my father was when I was on your show, I told you a [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2639.72s)]
*  story about how I found a double-barreled sawed-off shotgun under my father's bed. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2643.68s)]
*  It was in a guitar case. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2648.24s)]
*  My father heard the show about a month after I told the story on your show. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2650.08s)]
*  I get this text from my father's when he's still alive, obviously. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2655.6s)]
*  He goes, yeah, I heard what you said on Joe's show. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2658.6s)]
*  And I'm like, you know, you're looking at your phone like here it comes, you know, because [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2661.68s)]
*  I think he's going to be pissed at me. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2664.04s)]
*  He goes, there's one thing you left out of the story. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2665.4s)]
*  Waiting text. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2667.96s)]
*  The shotgun wasn't loaded. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2669.68s)]
*  That's all he wanted me to know. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2671.88s)]
*  Like somehow he made it better. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2673.7599999999998s)]
*  How bizarre. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2676.2799999999997s)]
*  If your father sounds like a fucking character, he was unbelievable. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2677.2799999999997s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2681.24s)]
*  What, what did he play? [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2682.24s)]
*  Guitar. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2684.7599999999998s)]
*  Great, great, great musician. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2685.7599999999998s)]
*  Really, truly great musician. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2687.08s)]
*  He's the classic guy that should have made it, it didn't. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2689.36s)]
*  So when I made it, it made the whole thing really weird. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2691.44s)]
*  Because he looked at me and said, how did my schlubby kid make it? [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2696.2s)]
*  And I didn't. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2700.34s)]
*  He must have gotten lucky. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2702.22s)]
*  He must have done something. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2703.52s)]
*  Because if it didn't work for me, how could it work for him? [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2705.68s)]
*  So that was a weird, a weird thing. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2708.02s)]
*  But he was talented. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2710.72s)]
*  I mean, he really was talented. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2711.72s)]
*  That's great. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2712.96s)]
*  Did he, did you get, did you feel resentment? [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2713.96s)]
*  Did you get along with him after that? [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2716.16s)]
*  My father had a lot of issues with drugs. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2718.2000000000003s)]
*  It was always kind of like it can be with addicts. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2719.88s)]
*  It was like depending on the day. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2722.2000000000003s)]
*  One day he would tell me I was the greatest thing that ever happened to him and I was [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2724.52s)]
*  the number one son and da da da. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2727.4s)]
*  And two weeks later he's telling me he wished I'd never been born and I should have been [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2729.28s)]
*  aborted. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2732.92s)]
*  So it was a weird, it was weird. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2733.92s)]
*  It was a weird thing. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2734.92s)]
*  So that's why that story's funny to me because he didn't mind that I told you about finding [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2736.7200000000003s)]
*  a sawed-off shotgun. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2741.1600000000003s)]
*  He minded that I implied it was dangerous when he made sure that it wasn't loaded so [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2742.6400000000003s)]
*  it was okay. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2746.38s)]
*  That's the way his brain worked. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2747.38s)]
*  Do you believe him that it wasn't loaded? [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2749.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2750.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2751.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2752.54s)]
*  He was, he should have been an arch criminal or something, but he didn't have the nerve. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2753.54s)]
*  So he just became a guitarist? [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2759.26s)]
*  No, he was, he was a drug dealer and he used to run drugs and guns for the mob. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2760.58s)]
*  I mean, really? [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2766.34s)]
*  Oh, he, he would do stuff like Melrose Park is kind of an infamous city just outside the [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2767.34s)]
*  Chicago city limits where a lot of the mob wise guys lived. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2773.66s)]
*  And he was friends with the kid of a wise guy and the kid would dabble because he was [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2777.02s)]
*  protected because his father was a made man. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2781.22s)]
*  So we go over to that guy's house for hours and just hear these crazy stories about the [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2783.8599999999997s)]
*  mob and my dad would pick up something in a satchel and deliver it, you know, like it [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2788.02s)]
*  was, that's, that's, I was eight years old going through all this shit. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2791.58s)]
*  Wow. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2795.8999999999996s)]
*  What a crazy environment. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2797.18s)]
*  So you're eight years old, he's running drugs and guns. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2799.06s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2801.7799999999997s)]
*  Wow. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2803.1800000000003s)]
*  Did you see like a lot of shit? [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2804.1800000000003s)]
*  I saw a lot of stuff, but it was like, you know, when, when adults are trying to hide [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2805.86s)]
*  stuff from you, but not really, you know, so like, for example, they would stay in the [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2810.26s)]
*  basement all night and party, whoever he was with musicians, whatever. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2814.9s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2818.3s)]
*  So I come down at night and it'd be Coke everywhere and rolled up 20s on black Sabbath mirrors. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2819.3s)]
*  I was like seven, 10. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2823.7000000000003s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2825.26s)]
*  So I had a feeling, call it intuition. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2827.2200000000003s)]
*  I had a feeling that he wanted me to clean up, but not the mirrors. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2830.02s)]
*  And he was, and I was like, what's on the mirror that, you know, that you left behind? [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2835.02s)]
*  He was like, oh, that's a, we have a cold or something, but yeah, it's good you didn't [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2838.74s)]
*  get rid of it. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2842.86s)]
*  And they're like, why do you need the rolled up 20? [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2843.86s)]
*  Oh, it's just easier to, you know, it was like, so you knew it was bullshit, but you're [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2846.18s)]
*  10, you don't know what Coke is. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2851.14s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2853.1s)]
*  You don't have any concept of what they're doing, but you know something's going on. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2854.1s)]
*  This was constant. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2856.98s)]
*  This was normal. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2857.98s)]
*  And stuff like he'd take me to lunch with his mistresses and stuff and introduce them [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2858.98s)]
*  as his friends. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2861.94s)]
*  And so it was all kind of in plain sight weirdness, but you know, you'd be driving down the street [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2862.94s)]
*  and suddenly you were in a drug deal and it was, he told me, he told me he was shot at [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2869.5s)]
*  nine times and stabbed three times. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2875.66s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2877.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2878.9s)]
*  You want to hear a, it was one of my favorite stories. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2879.9s)]
*  So the band had a van. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2884.1s)]
*  He had a van and we bought it off and it was our band van for a while. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2888.2999999999997s)]
*  And then after we were, we didn't need it anymore because we got too big. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2891.2599999999998s)]
*  He wanted to buy it back. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2894.46s)]
*  So we sold it to him. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2895.46s)]
*  So one day I went over to his house and if you know, if this is the driver's thing, right [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2896.46s)]
*  behind the drivers where the driver's head would be, but in the middle of the car was [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2902.02s)]
*  a bullet hole. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2906.2599999999998s)]
*  So I said, did somebody shoot at you? [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2908.18s)]
*  He goes, oh yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2910.1s)]
*  What happened? [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2912.1s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2913.1s)]
*  He's like, yeah, I was, I was stopped over there on Narragansett and some guy came up [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2914.1s)]
*  and I thought he needed something like a dollar or something. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2919.42s)]
*  So I rolled down the window. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2921.86s)]
*  As soon as I did, he put a gun through the, put a gun through the window at my head and [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2922.86s)]
*  then, you know, I hit the gas and sped off. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2927.9s)]
*  And so as I went to try to shoot me, but then he missed and the bullet went in behind my [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2931.3399999999997s)]
*  head and I got away. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2934.7s)]
*  That's the story he told me at the time. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2936.2999999999997s)]
*  So years later, the story came back up somehow and he goes, oh, that wasn't the real story. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2938.66s)]
*  So here's the real story. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2942.34s)]
*  So same setup. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2944.38s)]
*  He's sitting somewhere, but it was a drug deal. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2945.6000000000004s)]
*  He rolls down the window and make the drug deal. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2948.1800000000003s)]
*  Guy puts a gun at his head. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2950.7000000000003s)]
*  He does hit the gas. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2952.2200000000003s)]
*  The guy does try to shoot him, but because my father's mad now, he spins the van around [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2953.94s)]
*  and he tries to run the guy over and the guy's trucking down the street and the guy ran into [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2958.7400000000002s)]
*  a gas station. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2964.2200000000003s)]
*  So my dad came barreling at the gas station at full speed in this van and he was going [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2965.54s)]
*  to run the guy over. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2968.98s)]
*  And he said he reached a point where the guy was going to, if the guy stopped, he would [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2970.82s)]
*  run him over, but the guy leapt a fence and the only way to kill the guy was to have to [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2975.2s)]
*  run the fence and ram into a house that was next to the gas station. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2978.9s)]
*  So he hit the brakes and didn't run the guy over. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2981.86s)]
*  So that was the real story. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2984.42s)]
*  So back to the kid thing. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2987.26s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2988.7400000000002s)]
*  That's why it's so hard to pin this whole thing down because there's so much smoke, [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2990.02s)]
*  you know? [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2995.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2996.12s)]
*  And he didn't tell me there was another kid named Bill. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2997.12s)]
*  That's a real thing. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=2998.96s)]
*  And when he told me when I was 18, he lied and said he didn't know where the kid was. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3001.64s)]
*  Well when my stepmother brought up the whole Bill birth thing later and I asked him, he [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3006.2799999999997s)]
*  admitted that he did know where the kid was, but he didn't want to tell me. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3010.64s)]
*  What did Bill think about this? [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3013.8399999999997s)]
*  Like the possibility that his mother had an affair with your dad? [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3015.7599999999998s)]
*  I don't think Bill gives it any credence. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3019.2s)]
*  That's my sense of it. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3021.68s)]
*  Okay. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3022.68s)]
*  He just thinks it's bullshit. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3023.68s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3026.0s)]
*  Honestly, I don't know what Bill thinks, you know what I mean? [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3027.0s)]
*  I can see how you would think it'd be possible because your dad was insane. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3029.36s)]
*  Your dad sounds like a fucking maniac. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3032.92s)]
*  The only way... [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3035.4s)]
*  Like a Scorsese movie maniac. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3036.4s)]
*  Well put this way, if a person doesn't believe that somebody is their father, not their real [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3038.52s)]
*  father that they grew up with, and I do know people who've had that. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3044.02s)]
*  They grew up with somebody and in fact it just happened in my family that a cousin of [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3047.04s)]
*  mine found out that her father was not her father and she's in her 60s because of a DNA [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3050.88s)]
*  test. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3055.88s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3056.88s)]
*  So it is possible that people can find out later in life, oh by the way that guy that [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3057.88s)]
*  you thought was your dad, he ain't your dad. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3061.7200000000003s)]
*  Here's your real dad, right? [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3063.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3064.52s)]
*  So it does happen, but I don't get any sense from Bill that he believes that's possible. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3065.52s)]
*  Got it. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3069.36s)]
*  So the only way would be possible if Bill grew up in some kind of weird lie, you see [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3070.36s)]
*  what I'm saying? [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3076.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3077.0s)]
*  And I don't believe that. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3078.0s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3079.0s)]
*  Well I don't know how much he's talked about his family. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3080.0s)]
*  But I just can't imagine a kid coming downstairs and seeing Coco all over the mirrors and Black [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3085.2400000000002s)]
*  Sabbath albums and people blacked out and empty boos everywhere. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3091.1400000000003s)]
*  Like this is a normal thing at your house, telling these wild parties. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3096.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3100.48s)]
*  And you're a little kid. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3101.48s)]
*  To be fair, I think a lot of people grew up in that atmosphere. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3102.48s)]
*  I think we just don't hear about it. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3103.76s)]
*  Yeah, but not a lot of people grew up with a dad that's running guns and drugs for the [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3105.1600000000003s)]
*  mob. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3108.2000000000003s)]
*  That's true. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3109.2000000000003s)]
*  That's true. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3110.2000000000003s)]
*  That is true. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3111.2000000000003s)]
*  That's so insane. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3112.2000000000003s)]
*  That's such a crazy way to grow up. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3113.7999999999997s)]
*  We would have conversations, we would have conversations, because as you get older you [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3116.56s)]
*  start to ask questions, right? [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3119.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3121.72s)]
*  So I'd say, Dad, aren't you worried if you get pulled over? [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3122.72s)]
*  Because he would carry a lot of fucking weed in the car, just for his own personal use. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3125.8399999999997s)]
*  He smoked constantly, like my whole childhood. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3130.6s)]
*  I mean, I just remember joint after joint all day. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3132.56s)]
*  At the dinner table in the car, I'd contact high and all that. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3135.96s)]
*  So finally at some point I said, Daddy, aren't you worried about if you get pulled over? [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3138.8399999999997s)]
*  And he popped the engine, old cars, when you pop the trunk. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3143.44s)]
*  What is it called? [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3149.7200000000003s)]
*  The hood. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3150.7200000000003s)]
*  He had figured out some system where if you put weed in a thing full of whiskey, he said [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3152.28s)]
*  the dogs couldn't pick up on the scent. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3160.6000000000004s)]
*  So there was like a compartment in the engine compartment, like a thing that was full of [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3162.48s)]
*  whiskey, and then he would put a waterproof baggie with the weed in the whiskey. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3168.72s)]
*  And so if a dog came around the car, it would never smell it. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3173.12s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3176.16s)]
*  So it was like life lessons from Pop. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3177.16s)]
*  But dogs can only smell one thing. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3179.8799999999997s)]
*  They're only looking for one thing. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3181.8799999999997s)]
*  When you train a dog, you train a dog either for a bomb or you train them for heroin. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3183.24s)]
*  You don't train a dog for everything. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3187.08s)]
*  Like what do you got? [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3188.56s)]
*  Three barks for Coke. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3189.56s)]
*  The way they train dogs is it's one thing that they're trained to smell. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3191.4399999999996s)]
*  They have one. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3194.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3195.72s)]
*  If they're looking for bombs, they're only looking for bombs. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3196.72s)]
*  They're not going to stop you for weed. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3198.56s)]
*  Which is like the dumbest thing to train a dog for. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3201.7599999999998s)]
*  If you train a dog for weed. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3203.9199999999996s)]
*  Well now, yeah. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3205.2s)]
*  Now, it's the dumbest. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3206.2s)]
*  But they still do. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3207.64s)]
*  Really? [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3208.64s)]
*  They still have weed dogs. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3209.64s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3210.64s)]
*  If they smell weed, they'll call the weed dog. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3211.64s)]
*  Is weed legal in Texas? [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3213.7999999999997s)]
*  It's not. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3215.3199999999997s)]
*  It's weird. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3216.3199999999997s)]
*  It's decriminalized. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3217.3199999999997s)]
*  There was actually a lawsuit that Ken Paxson tried to stop Dallas from decriminalizing [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3218.3199999999997s)]
*  weed and they just lost in court. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3222.8799999999997s)]
*  So Dallas now, marijuana is decriminalized for personal use. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3225.86s)]
*  It's stupid. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3230.5s)]
*  It should be the whole country. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3231.6s)]
*  It should be legal. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3232.6s)]
*  Just like whiskey is. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3233.6s)]
*  Don't do it if you don't want to do it. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3235.1200000000003s)]
*  But you should probably know what the effects are and we should probably study what the [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3236.86s)]
*  actual correct dose is per person. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3242.2400000000002s)]
*  We know what drinks, one drink is one drink. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3244.78s)]
*  You know what it is. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3247.6200000000003s)]
*  You go to the bar, you get a shot of tequila. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3248.6200000000003s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3251.5s)]
*  It's one shot of tequila. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3252.5s)]
*  Everybody's pretty much, it's standard. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3253.5s)]
*  With weed, you don't know what the. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3255.42s)]
*  Oh, I see. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3256.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3257.9s)]
*  You don't know what's the right amount. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3258.9s)]
*  Like should I take two hits or three hits? [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3259.9s)]
*  You can build up a tolerance like your dad, you're smoking weed. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3262.1800000000003s)]
*  Like if I smoked weed all day long, it'd be a fucking mess. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3264.94s)]
*  I'd be paranoid and freaked out. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3267.38s)]
*  I'd be like, everyone's out to get me. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3269.26s)]
*  But he was. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3271.06s)]
*  And he just kept doing it. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3272.06s)]
*  That's what's even crazier. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3275.3s)]
*  Weed back then was not weed today. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3277.5s)]
*  You probably could get some weed that's commensurate with weed today. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3280.06s)]
*  Acapulco gold or something wacky. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3284.34s)]
*  But generally. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3286.94s)]
*  They have all these crazy strains now, right? [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3287.94s)]
*  Isn't that the. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3289.26s)]
*  Now they have scientists, botanists got involved in the game and they're making super weed. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3290.26s)]
*  I noticed one thing because I was in LA for a couple of months this winter and when they [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3296.34s)]
*  first whatever decriminalized in LA, it seemed like everywhere you went, everybody was smoking [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3300.38s)]
*  weed. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3304.2200000000003s)]
*  It became like a thing. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3305.2200000000003s)]
*  You couldn't go anywhere without smelling the telltale smoke. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3306.2200000000003s)]
*  And now it seems to have calmed down. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3310.2200000000003s)]
*  I think it's almost like now it's like Holland back in the day. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3311.7s)]
*  It's so normal. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3314.54s)]
*  It's no longer a thing to like openly smoke weed. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3316.3399999999997s)]
*  I think it's gone back to a oh, it's not that big a deal, which I think is probably best [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3319.54s)]
*  because there was a beer there where you would go there and everybody was stoned. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3323.58s)]
*  You couldn't get service at a restaurant. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3327.42s)]
*  I mean, it was like people were staring off into space. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3329.18s)]
*  Edibles. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3332.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3333.74s)]
*  Well, for sure, you're going to have like a normalization period after a while. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3334.74s)]
*  It's like weed's normal. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3340.46s)]
*  It's just like everyone's not drunk all the time, even though you can get liquor everywhere. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3341.94s)]
*  You choose when to imbibe and when not to or not to at all. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3345.1800000000003s)]
*  That's you're supposed to have choices. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3349.26s)]
*  You're an adult. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3350.7000000000003s)]
*  You're an adult human being. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3351.7000000000003s)]
*  The analogy I always make is imagine if it was the three of us in a room, just us three, [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3352.9s)]
*  and we were the only people on earth. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3357.64s)]
*  We lived on an island and Jamie just decided he doesn't want to smoke and weed. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3358.7400000000002s)]
*  And so Jamie passed the law and he wants to lock us up if we smoke weed. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3362.94s)]
*  Oh, I see. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3367.46s)]
*  This is ridiculous as 300 million people and one adult decides that the other 300 million [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3368.46s)]
*  people shouldn't be allowed to smoke weed. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3376.62s)]
*  Like do it if you want to do it. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3378.54s)]
*  Don't do it if you don't want to do it. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3379.94s)]
*  But you can't. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3380.94s)]
*  Putting people in a fucking cage for doing something that they want to do that harms [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3381.94s)]
*  no one but you don't want them to do is fucking insane. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3386.06s)]
*  It's just insane. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3390.18s)]
*  I grew up because of my father's life. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3391.18s)]
*  I don't know what age I became conscious of my father doing drugs constantly but let's [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3395.62s)]
*  say I was five years old. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3399.66s)]
*  So that's 1972. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3400.66s)]
*  So I've been in weed culture since 1972. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3402.14s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3404.78s)]
*  So I always thought it was- [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3405.78s)]
*  Those Vietnam War days. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3406.78s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3408.14s)]
*  And I met all those guys too. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3409.14s)]
*  All these guys with PTSD and all that stuff. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3410.14s)]
*  So I guess what I'm after is I never understood what the big deal was and the only thing that [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3413.38s)]
*  freaks me out are people that are really into weed. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3420.66s)]
*  Like you know what I mean? [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3423.5s)]
*  Like the 420 crowd. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3424.5s)]
*  It's their identity. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3425.5s)]
*  Like that's their identity. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3426.5s)]
*  That freaks me out. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3427.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3428.5s)]
*  It's a crutch for some. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3429.5s)]
*  It's a tool for others. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3430.5s)]
*  It's a creativity tool for a lot of people. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3432.58s)]
*  Carl Sagan was one of them. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3436.06s)]
*  Carl Sagan- [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3437.06s)]
*  Carl Sagan was his donor? [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3438.06s)]
*  Oh yeah, huge donor. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3439.06s)]
*  He's got one of the best quotes on states of consciousness that are available to people [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3440.06s)]
*  under cannabis that are not available any other time. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3447.18s)]
*  See if you can find that quote. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3449.58s)]
*  It's a brilliant quote. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3451.7s)]
*  Yeah, Carl Sagan, I mean he kind of had to keep it under wraps a little bit because marijuana [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3452.7s)]
*  was really illegal back then, but he still wanted to talk about it sometimes. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3457.2599999999998s)]
*  It depends on the person. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3464.54s)]
*  It's like everything else. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3467.62s)]
*  There's some people that should not drink. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3468.62s)]
*  They drink and then their eyes turn to shark eyes. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3470.94s)]
*  They're gone and they go away. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3474.18s)]
*  That's it. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3476.62s)]
*  The illegality of cannabis is outrageous and impediment to full utilization of a drug, [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3477.62s)]
*  which helps produce the serenity and insight, sensitivity and fellowship so desperately [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3481.38s)]
*  needed in this increasingly mad and dangerous world. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3485.86s)]
*  That's not the quote. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3488.7000000000003s)]
*  That's a quote, but the other one had to do with states of consciousness that you could [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3490.34s)]
*  achieve. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3495.1s)]
*  It's a very stoner-like thing to say. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3496.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3501.02s)]
*  Well, I'm sure he talked about it a bunch, but either way, he was a regular cannabis [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3502.02s)]
*  user. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3509.78s)]
*  It's supposed to be like everything else. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3511.1800000000003s)]
*  You could have wine in your house. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3513.98s)]
*  It doesn't mean you're going to drink wine all day every day. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3514.98s)]
*  You should not be high all the time. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3518.2200000000003s)]
*  I just don't want the 420 people to hear me. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3520.5s)]
*  Those people like the MAGA people or the fucking Insane Clown Posse people, it becomes their [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3523.86s)]
*  whole thing. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3531.1000000000004s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with going to an Insane Clown Posse show, but if you want to be a [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3532.1000000000004s)]
*  juggalo and that's your whole identity is being a juggalo. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3535.86s)]
*  Juggalo is a whole thing. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3538.98s)]
*  It's a whole thing. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3540.18s)]
*  Because of the NWA, we've done business with the juggalos. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3541.18s)]
*  They seem like fun guys. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3545.26s)]
*  They're great. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3546.46s)]
*  No problem with them. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3547.46s)]
*  Violent Jay, as he's known, was in the NWA for a hot second. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3548.46s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3553.14s)]
*  He's kind of refired his promotion now, juggalo. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3554.14s)]
*  I guess JCW, juggalo clown promotions or something. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3557.06s)]
*  A lot of my wrestlers wrestle for him too. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3561.7400000000002s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3563.82s)]
*  I didn't even know he had a wrestling promotion. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3564.82s)]
*  They did back in the day. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3566.42s)]
*  I know they wrestle for WCW and TNA. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3568.5s)]
*  They were wrestling at the highest level for a while when they were sort of in the 90s [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3572.22s)]
*  times when they were on MTV and all that stuff. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3576.3799999999997s)]
*  I just love that they have a carnival of outcasts. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3580.02s)]
*  All the outcasts have a home in the juggalos. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3585.58s)]
*  They have these gatherings of the juggalos. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3589.9399999999996s)]
*  They look like they're having the best fucking time. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3592.3399999999997s)]

*  A friend of mine, former porn star Sasha Grey, sent me a picture of her at like 17 in the [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3606.18s)]

*  Juggalo makeup. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3618.58s)]
*  Do they dress like insane clown posse? [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3619.58s)]
*  They do very specific makeup. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3622.54s)]
*  Do they have different makeup than the insane clown posse or is it the same kind of makeup? [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3625.3399999999997s)]
*  It seems to me there's a particular way they do the juggalo makeup. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3628.66s)]
*  Jamie, can you please Google juggalo makeup? [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3632.7s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's a black and white. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3635.2599999999998s)]
*  I don't know if there's rules, but it's clown makeup. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3636.8199999999997s)]
*  What does it look like? [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3640.14s)]
*  Like that guy right there. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3641.3399999999997s)]
*  Yes, but that's violent J on the top there. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3642.3399999999997s)]
*  That's violent J there. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3645.3799999999997s)]
*  But they'll do the makeup kind of like how J is. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3646.3799999999997s)]
*  Okay, so some of the people in the audience choose to make their face up. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3649.5s)]
*  I don't see anybody there with face makeup though in that picture. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3653.98s)]
*  It's hot. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3656.3s)]

*  See like the girl there? [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3664.3s)]
*  That split tongue, that dude in the middle, that's a fucking commitment. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3665.3s)]
*  That's a commitment to never having a real job up top. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3667.26s)]
*  That's a lot. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3671.82s)]
*  You got to really hate your parents to split your tongue like that. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3672.82s)]
*  How about the guys who split their cock? [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3678.46s)]
*  Have you ever seen that? [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3679.6600000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3681.02s)]
*  Who does that? [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3682.02s)]
*  Do you remember the early days of the internet? [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3683.18s)]
*  I don't know how much you were on the internet in the 90s, but there was a page called The [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3686.38s)]
*  Style Project. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3691.3s)]
*  Do you remember that? [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3692.3s)]
*  I don't remember that. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3693.3s)]
*  It was all like some of the most fucked up things that this dude could find on the internet. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3694.3s)]
*  He had a whole website. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3700.74s)]
*  You go to The Style Project, you get like just insane fucked up stories about people. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3702.34s)]
*  One of them was Body Modification Extreme. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3707.66s)]
*  I became friends with the guy who ran the site, who's actually that arm wrestler, Devin [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3712.02s)]
*  Laureate. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3720.38s)]
*  I think that was his brother or someone he's related to. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3721.38s)]
*  It was Shannon Laureate. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3725.66s)]
*  I became friends with him and he gave me access to his website. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3727.58s)]
*  It was like a members only access where you could like- [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3730.82s)]
*  So you got the VIP tier of split cocks? [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3733.7s)]
*  Yes. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3736.58s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3737.58s)]
*  It wasn't just split cocks. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3738.58s)]
*  It was crazy stuff. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3739.58s)]
*  Some people, they decided that they wanted to get their arm chopped off or their hand [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3741.98s)]
*  chopped off so they devised a guillotine. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3746.1s)]
*  It was Body Modification Extreme. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3747.9399999999996s)]
*  So it was all different people doing different things like putting horns in their head and [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3751.02s)]
*  splitting their cock. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3757.8599999999997s)]
*  One of them was this horrible story about this guy whose boyfriend turned him into a [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3760.58s)]
*  eunuch, wanted him to cut his dick off for him and be a slave. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3764.54s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3768.54s)]
*  It's like detailing how this guy cut his cock off. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3769.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3773.8199999999997s)]
*  Donnie Fargo, who was a famous wrestler, he was famous for as a party trick. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3774.8199999999997s)]
*  He would put a nail through his cock. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3780.7s)]
*  Ah. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3782.3799999999997s)]
*  That's not nice. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3783.3799999999997s)]
*  I had David Blaine on and he made me stick an ice pick through his arm. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3789.3799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, he's got this trick that he does. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3793.54s)]
*  It's not a trick though. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3796.02s)]
*  I really stuck an ice pick through his arm. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3797.02s)]
*  It's like you can call it a trick, but a lot of things David does is just it freaks you [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3799.74s)]
*  out because you should. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3803.2599999999998s)]
*  But you can survive an ice pick through your arm, but I had to back it out because I hit [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3805.06s)]
*  a nerve and he made me reinsert it. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3810.54s)]
*  So I reinserted it and then the original one just started bleeding and it got a little [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3813.86s)]
*  bit of a hematoma, started swelling up. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3818.7s)]
*  We had to get the medics and we had SEALs working for us. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3820.98s)]
*  They checked it out. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3824.1s)]
*  My wife loves all sorts of weird body talk and she wanted me to send you a message because [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3827.14s)]
*  she's literally about to have a baby right now. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3833.06s)]
*  Oh, congratulations. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3835.54s)]
*  So we were somewhat concerned coming in because it was possible I may not be able to come [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3836.54s)]
*  because of her about to have this baby. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3840.06s)]
*  So when we were talking last night I said, please don't have the baby today. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3842.2599999999998s)]
*  I want to be on Joe's show. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3847.46s)]
*  And she said, you tell Joe that if I start to have the baby I expect him to give you [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3849.3799999999997s)]
*  some of his net checkpoints so you can get home. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3852.9s)]
*  It's a very rich person joke. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3856.06s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3858.02s)]
*  What does that have to do with body modification? [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3859.02s)]
*  Nothing? [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3861.02s)]
*  Because she loves talking about this type of shit. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3862.02s)]
*  Why does she like talking about that stuff? [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3863.02s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3864.5s)]
*  In my family we didn't talk about anything. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3865.5s)]
*  Sex was all just kind of implied. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3868.22s)]
*  Oh, I see. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3870.3s)]
*  I grew up in a family where nobody hugged, nobody kissed, everyone hated each other and [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3871.3s)]
*  nobody talked about the secrets of life, good or bad. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3877.62s)]
*  It was all kind of in the shadows. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3881.86s)]
*  She grew up in a family where it's like, because she has five brothers and a sister, so they [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3885.14s)]
*  talk about everything to the point where just like at dinner you're talking about all this [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3889.62s)]
*  weird body stuff. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3894.14s)]
*  I don't want to be graphic because it turns me off. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3895.14s)]
*  They seem to think it's funny. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3898.74s)]
*  When did you learn to hug people and be like outwardly nice? [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3900.1s)]
*  It's funny you ask me that. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3905.46s)]
*  I didn't grow up with my mother. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3906.54s)]
*  My mother went crazy when I was four and I never lived with her again. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3908.42s)]
*  We started to become close again when I was in my 20s. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3912.66s)]
*  I remember this one time where I walked through her door and it was that thing where I wanted [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3915.14s)]
*  to hug her because I never really hugged her my whole life. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3920.08s)]
*  I just made this decision at 24 like I was going to hug my mother and give her a kiss [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3923.42s)]
*  on the cheek. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3927.14s)]
*  That was the opening of this other life where people hug and kiss each other. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3929.58s)]
*  Obviously I had fooled around with girls, but it was only within the context of being [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3934.06s)]
*  romantic. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3939.7s)]
*  I had no physical affection in my life outside of that. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3941.1s)]
*  Now my kids are all over me. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3944.14s)]
*  I've got nine and six year olds so it's like I'm used to kids like rugrats climbing all [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3945.7799999999997s)]
*  over you, but I didn't grow up in that at all. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3950.66s)]
*  The idea of affection was alien. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3953.98s)]
*  In fact when I first started chasing girls at 17, 18 girls want to hold your hand or [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3956.58s)]
*  hug you in the car and it was so freaky to me. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3961.4199999999996s)]
*  When did you relax? [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3965.3999999999996s)]
*  I'm not sure I ever did. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3966.3999999999996s)]
*  Well I gave you a hug when I saw you today. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3970.2200000000003s)]
*  It seemed pretty normal. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3971.7400000000002s)]
*  No, I'm actually a very naturally affectionate person. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3972.7400000000002s)]
*  It's nice to give you a hug and it's nice to see you and it's nice to love on people [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3976.54s)]
*  that you admire and are your friends. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3980.34s)]
*  That's the great stuff of life, but I came very late. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3983.1400000000003s)]
*  You can even see I'm just uncomfortable. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3985.98s)]
*  I'm sure you know Howie Mandel. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3990.42s)]
*  You must. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3991.94s)]
*  I mean Howie with his ... I made the mistake of hugging Howie once. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3992.94s)]
*  I mean I killed his cat. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3997.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it's like you electrocuted him, like you tased him. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=3999.7799999999997s)]
*  That poor bastard. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4003.18s)]
*  It used to be you could touch knuckles with him. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4004.18s)]
*  Well he'll touch knuckles. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4005.7s)]
*  He will. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4007.06s)]
*  Touching knuckles again. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4008.06s)]
*  I'm close enough to Howie to touch knuckles. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4009.74s)]
*  He stopped touching knuckles and then he would do elbows. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4011.2999999999997s)]
*  You would touch elbows and then he got to air elbows. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4014.98s)]
*  He would just kind of like do that and then put it down. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4017.98s)]
*  I am a lead singer so I do some of these things. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4021.46s)]
*  But meanwhile he's hanging out with us in the green room at the Comedy Mothership and [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4023.54s)]
*  then he's going on stage and there's a comic before him, has the same microphone. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4027.3s)]
*  They're spitting into it. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4032.9s)]
*  He's holding onto it. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4034.0600000000004s)]
*  See, I think I'm secretly a germaphobe. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4035.86s)]
*  Really? [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4039.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4040.86s)]
*  Secretly. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4041.86s)]
*  We just talked about it. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4042.86s)]
*  Can we clip this out? [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4043.86s)]
*  You know like Howie though. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4044.86s)]
*  Howie's like ... [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4047.86s)]
*  That's another level. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4048.86s)]
*  He talks about it though. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4049.86s)]
*  He knows it's a problem. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4050.86s)]
*  He just can't overcome it for whatever reason. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4051.86s)]
*  He manages to sort of like have it and still work his way through life. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4054.7s)]
*  He was fun to hang out with. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4058.54s)]
*  It's not like he's freaking out about other stuff. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4060.22s)]
*  He was cool hanging out with, just talking. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4061.8999999999996s)]
*  I had him on my podcast and we did talk about it. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4064.58s)]
*  He hasn't aired yet but we talked about all his, I guess phobias would be the word, his [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4066.66s)]
*  conditions. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4071.2999999999997s)]
*  I mean there's all these letters. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4072.2999999999997s)]
*  A-D-H-D-O-C-D and this and that. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4073.2999999999997s)]
*  He's very open about it to his credit. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4077.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4079.2999999999997s)]
*  No he is. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4080.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah he talks about it and it's been a battle for him. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4081.2999999999997s)]
*  But it's just like it's so odd because he's so personable. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4083.7s)]
*  You expect that someone like that would be like a recluse, wouldn't like people, like [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4086.42s)]
*  get away from me everybody. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4090.8599999999997s)]
*  But he's not. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4091.8599999999997s)]
*  He's like super friendly. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4092.8599999999997s)]
*  Super friendly. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4093.8599999999997s)]
*  Except when he puts you in front of a professional comedian who's kind of irritated that you're [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4094.8599999999997s)]
*  there and claiming you're his half brother. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4098.7s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4100.54s)]
*  That was probably a bad pairing. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4101.54s)]
*  I feel like both of you are kind of a lot in a good way. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4103.34s)]
*  I would have one of you on by themselves. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4105.78s)]
*  I wouldn't want you and Burr together on the show. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4107.9s)]
*  He's such an alpha. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4111.0199999999995s)]
*  He's just one of those guys. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4112.780000000001s)]
*  He just can't help it. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4113.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4114.780000000001s)]
*  Well he has to make fun of everything too. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4115.780000000001s)]
*  No matter what you say. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4116.780000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4117.780000000001s)]
*  That's a fucking great idea. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4118.780000000001s)]
*  What about this? [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4119.780000000001s)]
*  He can't help himself. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4120.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah at one point he looked at me. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4121.780000000001s)]
*  Actually I was wearing this coat. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4122.780000000001s)]
*  He goes, where did you get that? [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4123.780000000001s)]
*  Like a Moroccan bazaar. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4125.18s)]
*  It's like a regular coat. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4126.18s)]
*  It's like no this is a very expensive coat. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4127.18s)]
*  It's like a normal coat. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4130.540000000001s)]
*  I understand. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4131.540000000001s)]
*  That seems normal. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4132.540000000001s)]
*  I look at that North face or something. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4133.540000000001s)]
*  I'm asking you this in an empathetic way. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4135.54s)]
*  Because you're a professional comedian so maybe it's different. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4140.94s)]
*  When a professional comedian puts their death ray on you and wants to make fun of you, it's [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4143.66s)]
*  a very particular feeling. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4147.5s)]
*  It's like getting carved up by a chef. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4149.9s)]
*  They're so good at Zorro. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4154.18s)]
*  It's kind of cool. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4159.06s)]
*  It's like wow I'm being insulted by Bill Burr. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4160.06s)]
*  It's kind of an honor. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4162.18s)]
*  But at the same time it's really fucked up because they know exactly where to poke you. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4163.820000000001s)]
*  Also you can't fire back. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4168.1s)]
*  You'll get killed. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4169.780000000001s)]
*  Right? [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4170.780000000001s)]
*  If you fire back. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4171.780000000001s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4172.780000000001s)]
*  He's going to chew you apart. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4173.780000000001s)]
*  What am I going to tell him? [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4174.780000000001s)]
*  Make a little joke? [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4176.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah there's not much you can do other than laugh along with it. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4177.780000000001s)]
*  Just have fun with it. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4181.26s)]
*  Just let him make fun of you. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4183.38s)]
*  Have fun. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4185.14s)]
*  That's all you can do. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4186.14s)]
*  But it feels like a death ray. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4187.14s)]
*  Especially a guy like Bill. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4190.1s)]
*  Who's the meanest comedian you ever kind of locked horns on you? [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4192.1s)]
*  The meanest at that kind of stuff, but he's one of my best friends, is Tony Hinchcliffe. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4199.06s)]
*  He's the best at it. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4204.5s)]
*  He's the fucking best. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4206.22s)]
*  I just found one the other day from quite a while ago. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4207.22s)]
*  I'm going to send you this because this is like young fresh faced Tony Hinchcliffe. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4212.22s)]
*  It's fucking hilarious. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4216.8s)]
*  This is just like off the cuff. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4219.5s)]
*  They bring in these dudes and he starts roasting them. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4221.0599999999995s)]
*  Just random dudes? [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4224.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, just two guys. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4225.139999999999s)]
*  And they team up and they start talking shit to him and he just eats them alive. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4226.139999999999s)]
*  Put your headphones on. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4230.9s)]
*  This one's hilarious. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4232.66s)]
*  Alright, here we go. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4233.66s)]
*  He's the best roaster on planet earth. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4234.94s)]
*  Nobody's better than Tony Hinchcliffe. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4237.78s)]
*  That's why I kill Tony so funny. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4239.98s)]
*  Part of the reason is he's so fast. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4241.46s)]
*  Did you get it Jamie? [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4243.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, just one second. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4245.299999999999s)]
*  What the fuck you got on wrestler shoes bro? [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4247.78s)]
*  You guys are mean. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4250.78s)]
*  Jimmy Neutron granddaddy right here. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4251.78s)]
*  You guys look like a before and after for a product that doesn't work. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4253.78s)]
*  What does ADD stand for? [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4256.78s)]
*  A dose of diabetes? [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4257.78s)]
*  Okay. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4258.78s)]
*  I wasn't ready for any of this. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4259.78s)]
*  You guys are wearing sweatpants and sweat skin. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4260.78s)]
*  You guys just completely giving up on pussy? [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4263.78s)]
*  Alright, baby, doughboy. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4266.78s)]

*  Wait, what? [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4270.78s)]
*  His name is doughboy. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4271.78s)]
*  Doughboy? [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4272.78s)]
*  Yeah, I spell it D-O-B-O-Y. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4273.78s)]

*  Wow. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4282.259999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4283.259999999999s)]
*  Just off the cuff. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4284.259999999999s)]
*  Out of nowhere. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4286.259999999999s)]
*  And he does that all day long. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4287.259999999999s)]
*  So he'll do that in the green room. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4289.259999999999s)]
*  He just turns on people in the green room. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4291.259999999999s)]
*  It's fucking amazing. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4292.259999999999s)]
*  We have like, when we do these shows, like Tuesday and Wednesday night or whenever we're there. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4294.259999999999s)]
*  Where everyone's in the room. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4298.259999999999s)]
*  Tuesday and Wednesday nights are a really good night at the club because all the comics that are [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4300.259999999999s)]
*  traveling on the road on the weekend, they come into the club to hang out during the [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4303.74s)]
*  weekday. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4307.14s)]
*  And so there'll be like eight or nine of us in the green room just talking shit about [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4308.14s)]
*  each other. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4311.3s)]
*  And Tony's just cutting up left to right, this one, that one. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4312.3s)]
*  It's so much fun. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4315.62s)]
*  He's the best at it though. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4317.54s)]
*  You do not want to fuck with him. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4319.1s)]
*  You don't want to blow for blow with Tony Hinchcliffe. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4320.5s)]
*  I'm going to say right now, I don't think he's my brother. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4322.5s)]
*  He's definitely not your brother. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4325.18s)]
*  You don't look anything like him. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4326.18s)]
*  It's a completely different gene line. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4327.18s)]
*  Now he'll make fun of me for saying I'm not his brother. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4329.3s)]
*  So did Bill know that you were going to be there with him or was it just like how he [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4331.58s)]
*  just decided to put two of you together? [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4334.54s)]
*  I got the feeling that Bill wasn't really given the heads up. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4336.74s)]
*  Yeah, probably. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4341.02s)]
*  It was a little bit irritating to him. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4342.42s)]
*  Bill gets easily irritated. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4344.86s)]
*  But that's also why he's so funny. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4346.76s)]
*  Like he gets mad. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4348.62s)]
*  Gets mad at everything. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4351.86s)]
*  Yes, and my mind doesn't work like that so it's hard. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4356.86s)]
*  I would have a better time understanding a rocket scientist than a professional comedian. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4361.02s)]
*  Because the professional comedians I've known personally a little bit like Bobcat Goldthwait [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4366.58s)]
*  and Carrot Top, their minds are so different than the average human mind. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4371.02s)]
*  I think the way they process information and they're looking for something that, almost [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4375.46s)]
*  like a meme, coalesces a whole set of ideas. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4380.34s)]
*  That's what makes it funny. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4383.42s)]
*  It works on all these different levels at one time. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4385.2s)]
*  The great comedians, like Dice to me is the greatest. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4387.94s)]
*  And Dice will tell a joke, it works on like eight different levels. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4391.62s)]
*  You know it's like high, low, middle. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4395.98s)]
*  Do you know what Dice's best stuff is? [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4398.22s)]
*  People don't understand that Dice is literally one of the best live performance artists. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4402.04s)]
*  Just random street artists. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4407.78s)]
*  Oh, I watch him. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4410.22s)]
*  You mean when he just goes up to people? [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4411.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4412.22s)]
*  Oh, it's unbelievable. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4413.22s)]
*  And pretends that these people wanted a photo with him and they don't know who he is? [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4414.22s)]
*  It's the face. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4416.34s)]
*  You want the face. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4418.1s)]
*  You want the picture. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4419.1s)]
*  And he just goes, he's fucking, it's so uncomfortable to watch. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4420.1s)]
*  You start pulling your fucking clothes off, like no, don't do this. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4423.9800000000005s)]
*  Like what are you doing? [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4427.5s)]
*  He's the best at that. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4429.5s)]
*  And he does that for zero money. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4430.5s)]
*  He's only doing that for fun. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4433.9400000000005s)]
*  That's it. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4436.26s)]
*  He's just being an artist. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4437.26s)]
*  Like there's no money in it at all and he spends all this time wandering around the [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4438.26s)]
*  streets, going to bars and restaurants and just bothering people, wandering up to people [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4443.34s)]
*  on the street in New York City. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4449.78s)]
*  They're waiting for the light to turn green. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4451.58s)]
*  You want the picture. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4453.38s)]
*  I just love that he'll just double and triple and quadruple down on the bit. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4455.74s)]
*  He just won't give it up. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4461.42s)]
*  He won't give it up. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4462.54s)]
*  Zemuda's the same thing with Tony Clifton. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4463.54s)]
*  Just the discomfort of it all. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4467.18s)]
*  Well Dice is the only guy ever in the peak of his fame to try to bomb on purpose and [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4471.46s)]
*  then release it as a two CD set. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4476.78s)]
*  Is that the night comedy died? [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4479.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4480.74s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4481.74s)]
*  That is so, I love that. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4482.74s)]
*  The day the laughter died. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4483.74s)]
*  The day the laughter died. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4484.74s)]
*  Rick Rubin produced it. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4485.74s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4486.74s)]
*  And Rick, who's a fucking maniac, loved the idea. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4487.74s)]
*  He loved it. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4489.7s)]
*  Of course. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4490.7s)]
*  He's like, what a great idea. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4491.7s)]
*  This is going to be amazing. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4492.7s)]
*  Dice is selling out Madison Square Garden more than anybody alive. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4493.7s)]
*  Like he's just selling out everything. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4498.38s)]
*  In the height of this, he decides to record on a night where no one knows he's going to [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4499.82s)]
*  be there and bomb. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4503.5s)]
*  No material. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4505.54s)]
*  There's talk off the top of his head. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4506.54s)]
*  Sometimes don't even try to be funny. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4509.3s)]
*  I've listened to it multiple times and it's one of the funniest things I've ever heard. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4511.72s)]
*  Its performance are. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4515.5199999999995s)]
*  It's like him on the street going, you want the picture? [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4516.5199999999995s)]
*  And if look, if he couldn't kill regular way, I wouldn't respect it because there's people [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4519.94s)]
*  that do comedy that pretend they're doing like anti comedy because regular comedy is [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4525.0599999999995s)]
*  too easy. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4529.54s)]
*  The problem is they're not good at regular comedy. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4530.54s)]
*  If you're like hilarious at regular comedy and then you say, I'm going to freak these [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4532.62s)]
*  people out by getting hitting them with some, he would do this thing at the comedy store [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4537.46s)]
*  where he would go on stage and see how long he could not talk. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4541.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4545.82s)]
*  I saw him do it once. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4546.82s)]
*  He'll go like five minutes, five minutes. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4547.82s)]
*  He's going to. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4550.06s)]
*  And no one knows what to do. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4551.18s)]
*  And people are like nervously laughing, laughing. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4552.3s)]
*  But he also could fucking kill like in the Rodney Dangerfield special, you know, when [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4554.68s)]
*  he did dice rules, like he could destroy an arena filled with people. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4559.64s)]
*  So it was a choice. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4564.04s)]
*  Who's your favorite all time comedian? [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4566.04s)]
*  I'm just curious. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4567.84s)]
*  God, I don't think I have an all time favorite. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4568.84s)]
*  I think prior probably is the greatest of all time not living with Chappelle being the [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4572.4800000000005s)]
*  greatest living. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4578.92s)]
*  I think that you have to you have to give credit to Lenny Bruce, though, because he [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4580.3s)]
*  really started the art form because before Lenny Bruce, comedy was just a series of jokes. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4585.1s)]
*  It was just jokes. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4590.54s)]
*  And Lenny Bruce came along and all of a sudden he had social commentary, cultural commentary [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4591.820000000001s)]
*  that he turned into humor. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4597.74s)]
*  The way he described relationships, the way he described marriage, the way he described, [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4600.820000000001s)]
*  it was like completely different. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4606.22s)]
*  What is this guy doing? [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4608.179999999999s)]
*  And then I think prior took that and made it funnier. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4610.46s)]
*  Prior took that and that honesty. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4615.74s)]
*  I never made I never connected that dot, but it makes sense when you say it. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4617.74s)]
*  Yeah, because he was just funnier. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4620.66s)]
*  Prior was just better at it. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4622.98s)]
*  But the door was opened up by Lenny. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4625.099999999999s)]
*  It didn't exist before Lenny. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4627.3s)]
*  So Lenny comes along in the 50s and he's getting arrested all the time in the 60s. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4629.639999999999s)]
*  Like he was getting arrested. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4634.3s)]
*  Remember that whole thing where he would just go on and read his court transcripts? [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4635.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that was the end. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4638.46s)]
*  That must have been really out there. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4639.860000000001s)]
*  I watched the videos of that. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4641.74s)]
*  You've seen actual? [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4643.14s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4644.14s)]
*  I bought it. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4645.14s)]
*  I bought a VHS tape that was Lenny Bruce on stage. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4646.14s)]
*  I forget what place it was. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4651.06s)]
*  I think it was somewhere in San Francisco. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4652.62s)]
*  And he was just talking, he was reading his court transcripts and talking about the case. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4654.42s)]
*  And some of the audiences go, we want dirty Lenny. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4657.9800000000005s)]
*  And he's like, man, man, it's not about that, man. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4660.26s)]
*  It's about, you gotta understand what they're doing here, man. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4663.38s)]
*  Like anybody could go back into the court case. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4667.02s)]
*  But it wasn't funny at all. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4669.9800000000005s)]
*  It was just him on stage for a long time just talking about his court cases. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4671.14s)]
*  But you have to, the thing about comedy is a lot of comedy, like even from the 80s, it [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4675.78s)]
*  doesn't hold up. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4682.74s)]
*  It doesn't mean that it wasn't funny at the time. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4684.32s)]
*  It just means the concepts and the culture has shifted so much and they've become so [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4686.4400000000005s)]
*  commonplace that it's not shocking or funny anymore. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4692.6s)]
*  But it was maybe in the 70s or maybe in the 80s. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4695.64s)]
*  And much more so with Lenny Bruce. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4699.0s)]
*  Because you go back and listen to his stuff and people are dying laughing and you don't [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4701.64s)]
*  even find it funny. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4705.52s)]
*  Like it doesn't even make you chuck. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4706.52s)]
*  It's hard to laugh at Lenny Bruce's stuff. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4707.900000000001s)]
*  But it's because we can't put ourselves in the context of being alive watching this guy [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4710.4400000000005s)]
*  perform in 1962. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4715.740000000001s)]
*  See, Red Fox to me is still funny though. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4716.740000000001s)]
*  Still funny. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4719.5s)]
*  But- [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4720.5s)]
*  Like his stuff holds. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4721.5s)]
*  Moms may believe it. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4723.1s)]
*  Yup. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4724.1s)]
*  Some people still hold up. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4725.1s)]
*  Robin Harris still holds up. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4728.1s)]
*  There's some old school comedians from the 70s and the 80s that are just still, you could [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4730.02s)]
*  tell they were, Eddie Murphy, he was special. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4736.98s)]
*  He was like a special talent. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4740.02s)]
*  That still holds up today. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4742.62s)]
*  But some of the stuff doesn't. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4744.02s)]
*  And then I think the next big shift, the big change was Kinnison. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4745.02s)]
*  Kinnison was a giant change in comedy. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4750.54s)]
*  Did you know Kinnison? [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4751.86s)]
*  No. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4752.86s)]
*  I saw him live a few times. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4753.86s)]
*  I was going to say age wise it probably doesn't. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4754.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4756.86s)]
*  No, I was about 21 when I saw him live. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4757.86s)]
*  I saw him live once when I was 19 when I was a security guard at Great Woods Center for [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4760.42s)]
*  the Performing Arts in Mansfield, Massachusetts. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4764.78s)]
*  So I got to see him live there and then I got to see him live at some, I think it was [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4768.74s)]
*  like some weird place in the middle of nowhere and it was like half empty. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4774.42s)]
*  This was like 88, 89. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4779.66s)]
*  So by 89 he was kind of falling off because he had just done so much drugs and partied [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4782.74s)]
*  so hard that he was fucking huge in like 86. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4790.3s)]
*  And then by the time 88 came around the material kind of dropped off. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4794.780000000001s)]
*  And then by the time I saw him it was like 89 or 90, it wasn't so good anymore. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4799.42s)]
*  And then he died in like, did he die like 92? [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4803.56s)]
*  I think he died in 92. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4806.46s)]
*  Yeah, drunk driver, ironically, because he had jokes about drunk driving. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4809.46s)]
*  But he just, I was always hoping he was going to come out with a new album and he would [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4815.299999999999s)]
*  be back. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4819.78s)]
*  He would be back to the kinesin of 86. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4820.78s)]
*  But just the partying and the coke and the women and the fucking no time to write. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4823.0199999999995s)]
*  His brother wrote about it. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4828.82s)]
*  There's a great book called Brother Sam by his brother Bill. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4829.82s)]
*  Bill wrote about the childhood, about him getting hit by a car and becoming this maniac. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4835.62s)]
*  He's like the victim of a head injury. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4839.139999999999s)]
*  And that's what turned him into that fucking maniac. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4841.46s)]
*  The childhood preaching is also part of the... [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4843.34s)]
*  Childhood preaching, tent revival preaching, and he brought that kind of energy to comedy. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4845.82s)]
*  He was a different thing. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4850.78s)]
*  I remember the first time I saw him, I'm like, oh wow, that's comedy too? [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4851.78s)]
*  This is crazy. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4855.0599999999995s)]
*  I remember thinking, well this is a completely different thing. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4857.0599999999995s)]
*  I never thought this was stand up comedy. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4860.0599999999995s)]
*  He was like, to me at the time, he was the rock and roll equivalent of comedy or something. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4862.62s)]
*  And didn't Guns N' Roses take him on tour or something? [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4868.860000000001s)]
*  There was some, I seem to remember, like something like that. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4871.26s)]
*  I think Bon Jovi too. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4874.54s)]
*  I think he was hanging out with those guys too. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4875.54s)]
*  I think Bon Jovi was one of his, because he had a music video called Wild Thing. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4878.46s)]
*  Yeah, I remember he was singing. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4882.780000000001s)]
*  He's kind of trying to be a rock star for a while. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4885.42s)]
*  It's a quick fall from grace, man, because in 86, he's one of the best comics that's [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4888.9s)]
*  ever walked the face of the earth. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4893.78s)]
*  And by 89, he's like a caricature of the guy he was three years ago. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4895.74s)]
*  And I think it's just, it's really hard to maintain, especially in the 80s when no one [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4901.18s)]
*  was famous. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4907.22s)]
*  How many famous comedians were there? [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4908.22s)]
*  There were like five, ten at the most. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4910.1s)]
*  Now there's hundreds. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4911.94s)]
*  But back then, nobody was famous. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4913.3s)]
*  It was all about getting on Carson. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4915.06s)]
*  That was the thing, right? [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4916.78s)]
*  It was about getting an HBO special. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4918.0199999999995s)]
*  That was the big thing. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4919.5s)]
*  Carson was big in the 80s, but for a guy like Kinnison, even though he got on Letterman [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4921.099999999999s)]
*  and he had one of the most brilliant sets ever, his Letterman set's fantastic. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4926.179999999999s)]
*  We played it on the show once. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4930.86s)]
*  It's really good. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4932.0199999999995s)]
*  But I think with Kinnison, it was really the HBO special. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4933.0199999999995s)]
*  It was Rodney Dangerfield's Young Comedians special first, and people got to see him on [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4935.82s)]
*  that. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4940.38s)]
*  And then he did his own hour special. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4941.38s)]
*  You're right, because when Eddie Murphy did his HBO special, that was when he just like... [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4942.78s)]
*  Delirious. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4947.099999999999s)]
*  Then we had that leather suit. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4948.099999999999s)]
*  I remember high school, everybody was like... [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4949.379999999999s)]
*  Norton, I've been looking at you. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4952.139999999999s)]
*  And I know you've been looking at me. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4955.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, he was... [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4957.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's like there was only a few back then, though. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4959.299999999999s)]
*  And then Dice came along, and Dice had a completely different element to it because people wanted [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4963.099999999999s)]
*  to repeat the lines. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4967.179999999999s)]
*  What's in the bowl, bitch? [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4969.339999999999s)]
*  Oh, the whole crowd would go crazy. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4971.099999999999s)]
*  It was rock and roll. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4974.62s)]
*  They sang along. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4975.9s)]
*  Shot through the heart. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4976.9s)]
*  It was like rock and roll. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4977.9s)]
*  Everybody was singing along. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4978.9s)]
*  You give love a bad name. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4979.9s)]
*  The crowd wanted to say that, and the crowd wanted to say, little boy blue. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4980.9s)]
*  Oh, he needed the money. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4981.9s)]
*  Oh. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4982.9s)]
*  I tried to talk my wife into seeing if we could hire Dice to do our wedding. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=4983.9s)]
*  She wasn't having it. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5000.9s)]
*  Who knows what he would have done. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5002.98s)]
*  The vision I had, my wife wanted to do kind of an after party of the wedding. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5005.0599999999995s)]
*  We had it at my house, so the idea was when half the crowd bangs off because it's been [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5009.339999999999s)]
*  a long day, there's still be a crowd that want to hang out and just party. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5014.339999999999s)]
*  And then Dice shows up? [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5017.58s)]
*  And then Dice shows up. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5018.58s)]
*  At 1 a.m. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5019.58s)]
*  And then takes them, puts the death ray on me. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5020.58s)]
*  She just was not having it. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5023.9s)]
*  We used to say Dice had two Dices, but my favorite Dice was Mean Dice because Mean Dice [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5027.179999999999s)]
*  would find a guy in the audience. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5032.0199999999995s)]
*  He knew who could take it, who couldn't, who's smiling and laughing along. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5034.62s)]
*  He'd be like, look at you, and just start tearing this poor fool apart. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5037.62s)]
*  Fun. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5044.62s)]
*  Back then, the beautiful thing was the Comedy Store had no audience, so he could go on unannounced. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5045.62s)]
*  He would show up at midnight on a fucking Monday night or something like that and just [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5051.62s)]
*  torture people for fun. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5056.1s)]
*  Just for fun. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5058.34s)]
*  He was only fucking around. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5059.34s)]
*  I'm having Bill Burr PTSD because that feeling when they put the death ray on you. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5061.3s)]
*  Did it really bother you? [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5065.3s)]
*  No, it didn't bother me. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5066.3s)]
*  It's just I... [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5067.74s)]
*  It's uncomfortable. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5068.74s)]
*  Well, I'm not going to... [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5069.74s)]
*  What do they always say? [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5070.74s)]
*  Don't bring a knife to a gunfight. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5073.5s)]
*  Right? [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5074.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5075.5s)]
*  What am I going to say? [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5076.5s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5077.5s)]
*  Why was he picking on you? [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5078.5s)]
*  I think because he was uncomfortable about the whole setup because at the end of the [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5080.7s)]
*  day, it's my fault. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5083.14s)]
*  I'm the one who said something in public. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5084.18s)]
*  Right. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5085.820000000001s)]
*  So at the end of the day, I do bear the responsibility for initiating this insanity. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5087.34s)]
*  It's taken a life of its own. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5091.82s)]
*  Because I walk through public now and people are like, hey, it's Bill Burr's brother, so [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5093.58s)]
*  he's got to be getting it the other way. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5098.139999999999s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5101.219999999999s)]
*  You're the brother of that weirdo from the Pumpkins. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5102.219999999999s)]
*  We were talking about the other night at the club in the green room, we were convinced [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5109.0199999999995s)]
*  it was a bit that you guys were doing together. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5111.78s)]
*  We were convinced. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5114.139999999999s)]
*  No one disagreed. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5116.1s)]
*  No one was like, I think it's real. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5117.1s)]
*  Most people were like, I think they were fucking around. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5119.820000000001s)]
*  I think it seemed like they made an agreement. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5121.820000000001s)]
*  It's somewhere between a bit and reality and I think that's where it gets confusing. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5124.740000000001s)]
*  That's why I would use the word meta. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5129.5s)]
*  There's this moment if you watch it back where Howie splits and just leaves me and Bill alone. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5132.0s)]
*  And Howie has a band that plays when he does a show, so the gentleman who runs the band [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5138.660000000001s)]
*  starts playing a really sad piano and Bill just starts riffing. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5144.02s)]
*  It's just me and him in this room alone. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5147.700000000001s)]
*  I mean, I don't know Bill at all. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5149.02s)]
*  And he starts talking about our shared dad and it gets really weird because on some level [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5151.3s)]
*  it's like it's possible, right? [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5156.0s)]
*  Even if it's 1%, it's not a zero. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5159.660000000001s)]
*  So that's where it gets kind of, that's why I say meta. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5162.38s)]
*  It's like you're looking down a hall of mirrors and you start almost playing with your mind. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5164.42s)]
*  You think like, it could be possible. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5169.9400000000005s)]
*  It's also the two of you guys doing this publicly is very pro wrestling, which is what you love. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5173.7s)]
*  There's something about... [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5180.94s)]
*  I brought a wrestler with me today who runs the promotions for the NWA. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5181.94s)]
*  But you know what I'm saying? [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5188.7s)]
*  It's like there's something about it. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5189.7s)]
*  It's like, is this K-Fabe? [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5190.7s)]
*  Is this real? [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5191.7s)]
*  Is this a shoot or is this a work? [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5192.7s)]
*  What is this? [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5195.86s)]
*  Well, Tommy, you know Tommy Dreamer? [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5196.86s)]
*  I know the name. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5197.86s)]
*  Tommy Dreamer, famous ECW wrestler, went on to work for WWE and now works for TNA. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5199.0199999999995s)]
*  Tommy's the classic salty veteran, seen it all, done it all, been split in half and the [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5205.38s)]
*  whole thing. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5212.5s)]
*  So there's nothing Tommy hasn't seen. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5213.5s)]
*  And Tommy will say something like, it's all a work. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5216.0599999999995s)]
*  It's all a work. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5220.0599999999995s)]
*  Like basically it's the cynical view that everything you see in the world is fake. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5221.0599999999995s)]
*  Well, if you're a pro wrestler... [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5225.5s)]
*  The CNN is fake, the news is fake. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5227.34s)]
*  It's all a work. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5231.34s)]
*  So once you go there cynically, it's hard to back out of that. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5232.38s)]
*  So I like the... [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5237.660000000001s)]
*  The artist in me likes the discomfort. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5239.14s)]
*  Yes, that's what I'm getting at. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5241.14s)]
*  I really do like the discomfort. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5244.18s)]
*  I remember watching Andy Kaufman on Saturday Night Live circa 78 or whatever. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5245.820000000001s)]
*  It's that idea that you can create a vibration in the room between what's expected and where [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5252.7s)]
*  you're willing to go. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5260.78s)]
*  I have this one friend who was a performance artist and she would do stuff like when she [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5264.22s)]
*  was in college, she would just walk in the cafeteria and take off all her clothes. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5268.18s)]
*  And she would stick a camera in the corner and just film people's reactions. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5271.86s)]
*  And it was interesting to watch because one guy would just keep eating his food and no [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5275.66s)]
*  sell it. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5279.02s)]
*  Like, I'm just going to eat my salad and just pretend this isn't happening. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5280.5s)]
*  Every human being goes in a different direction with the weirdness. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5283.660000000001s)]
*  So as an artist on a stage, there is this crazy power that you have because depending [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5287.580000000001s)]
*  on what comes out of your mouth next to what you do can affect thousands of people. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5296.34s)]
*  And then obviously through a digital medium even more. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5301.56s)]
*  So there's something about flirting with the uncomfortable, but what makes it uncomfortable [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5304.38s)]
*  is it always has a foundation of truth. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5311.4800000000005s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5313.9800000000005s)]
*  Yes, I do know what you're saying. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5315.9800000000005s)]
*  If it didn't have a foundation of truth, it would just be silly. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5317.5s)]
*  The discomfort comes from like, oh, there's something you're doing that I recognize in [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5321.02s)]
*  myself or I know somebody that's like this. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5325.3s)]
*  Well, it makes it much more interesting if there's a 1% chance that it's true. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5327.86s)]
*  If I just think you guys are running a sketch, it's kind of funny, but if it might be true, [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5332.1s)]
*  then it gets to that weird place where it's like this is uncrossed. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5337.22s)]
*  So if I walked out of that room that day after meeting Bill for the first time and it was [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5339.620000000001s)]
*  a 1% chance, now that I walked through life, we're up into like the 10 percentile in the [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5343.860000000001s)]
*  public's mind. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5348.9400000000005s)]
*  Yes. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5349.9400000000005s)]
*  10% of the public is convinced we're brothers. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5350.9400000000005s)]
*  Even if I sat there and told them, no, it's not true. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5353.46s)]
*  More now. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5355.58s)]
*  That's okay. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5356.58s)]
*  But that's what I'm saying. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5357.58s)]
*  Now after this show? [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5358.58s)]
*  That's why it's like when you say it's a bit, yeah, it's a bit to the extent that you're [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5359.98s)]
*  playing with the idea. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5363.799999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5364.799999999999s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5365.799999999999s)]
*  It would be like if I sat down and say, you know, I'm sure you remember the last time [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5366.799999999999s)]
*  it was on your show, but you know, I met you when I was 12 and I told you this whole story [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5371.82s)]
*  about how I met you. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5376.5s)]
*  Like Carrot Top in his show tells this whole story about meeting Gallagher when he's a [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5378.799999999999s)]
*  kid. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5381.98s)]
*  Have you ever heard that? [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5382.98s)]
*  No. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5383.98s)]
*  Gallagher is Carrot Top's hero. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5384.98s)]
*  Sure. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5385.98s)]
*  He does like a thing at the end of his show in tribute to Gallagher. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5386.98s)]
*  He kind of does a watermelon bit or something like that. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5390.7s)]
*  But he tells this thing in the show about how meeting Gallagher when he was like 14 [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5393.099999999999s)]
*  years old and Gallagher like actually gave him some advice that inspired him to be who [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5396.259999999999s)]
*  he became. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5401.179999999999s)]
*  But I mean, for all I know, it's a bit. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5403.58s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5405.58s)]
*  But he says it was such earnestness and it does have some, it feels right. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5406.58s)]
*  But for all I know, it's just another bit. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5411.179999999999s)]
*  Everything's a work. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5413.66s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5414.66s)]
*  Joe, I met you when I was 12. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5415.82s)]
*  You were at an airport. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5417.38s)]
*  You were so nice. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5418.38s)]
*  You signed an autograph. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5419.38s)]
*  There's a part of you that would be like, well, it's possible. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5420.38s)]
*  I mean, you know what I mean? [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5423.58s)]
*  I got a pretty good memory. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5426.139999999999s)]
*  I'd be like, what happened? [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5427.139999999999s)]
*  Where were we? [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5430.139999999999s)]
*  I never been there. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5431.94s)]
*  Sorry. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5432.94s)]
*  I have this plague that I can't get rid of. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5433.94s)]
*  But if you have that Tommy's perception that everything's a work, the whole world gets [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5438.26s)]
*  really weird. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5444.3s)]
*  Well, I think we're there. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5445.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5447.7s)]
*  We definitely are when it comes to politics and the news. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5448.7s)]
*  I think our whole culture has been turned into like, where are we? [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5452.74s)]
*  Right. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5457.18s)]
*  Like, you know, that's why I started calling it like five, seven years ago, a post-truth [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5458.18s)]
*  era. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5461.7s)]
*  Right. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5462.7s)]
*  I mean, we've all been in that situation where somebody in our inner circle will bring up [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5463.7s)]
*  that we know from a factually presented basis isn't true. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5469.22s)]
*  I heard so-and-so did so-and-so and you go, no, that's not true. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5474.9800000000005s)]
*  Let me show you the YouTube clip. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5478.42s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5480.780000000001s)]
*  This didn't happen or no, so-and-so made a left, not a right. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5482.02s)]
*  But because of what they've heard, they believe it. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5486.62s)]
*  And you can literally show them something and say, no, no, look, and they're like, well, [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5489.34s)]
*  that must be AI or edited. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5493.46s)]
*  It's like once somebody becomes convinced of this culture, it's really hard to unconvince [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5495.94s)]
*  them. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5500.379999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5501.379999999999s)]
*  And so from a performing point of view and somebody who's now also in the podcasting [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5502.379999999999s)]
*  sphere, it's like, is it better to play into what people want? [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5505.78s)]
*  Like I really appreciate in Bruce Springsteen's Broadway special when in the first five minutes [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5513.099999999999s)]
*  of the thing, he basically says, I'm not really Bruce Springsteen. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5517.379999999999s)]
*  Have you ever seen it? [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5519.62s)]
*  No. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5521.099999999999s)]
*  It's really worth watching. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5522.099999999999s)]
*  It's when he did his long Broadway run. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5524.7s)]
*  You know about that? [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5526.42s)]
*  He did this thing where it was like he would talk and then play songs. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5527.78s)]
*  No, I didn't even know he did it. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5531.219999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah, it was huge. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5532.82s)]
*  He went on this massive Broadway run. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5533.82s)]
*  Huh. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5535.98s)]
*  And the HBO did it and put it on as a special. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5536.98s)]
*  But he literally in the first five minutes of talking, and it's about 1,200 people a [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5540.62s)]
*  night, so it's a live audience. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5544.0599999999995s)]
*  And he says in the first five minutes, by the way, I'm not Bruce Springsteen. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5545.34s)]
*  Like I mean, that's my name, but the Bruce Springsteen, you think he's like, I don't [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5548.42s)]
*  know how to fix a car. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5552.299999999999s)]
*  He's never been a factory in my life. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5553.3s)]
*  He's serious. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5554.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5555.900000000001s)]
*  Now, I knew that as a performer, I knew that what I was watching wasn't real, but people [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5556.900000000001s)]
*  want him to play John Wayne so bad that he puts his finger in there and says, okay, you [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5564.78s)]
*  want me to be John Wayne? [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5569.5s)]
*  I'll be John Wayne. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5570.5s)]
*  Right. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5571.5s)]
*  But that's audience capture, right? [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5572.5s)]
*  Yes, but now we're in the business of it. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5575.900000000001s)]
*  There's obviously examples, historical antecedents over the last 100 years of media where people [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5579.58s)]
*  would figure it out. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5584.0199999999995s)]
*  Charlie Chaplin or something. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5585.82s)]
*  They wanted him to be the Tramp, so he became the Tramp. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5587.5s)]
*  He wasn't that guy at all. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5590.46s)]
*  He fed into it and obviously connected to something real in him, but he wasn't really [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5592.9s)]
*  a Tramp. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5596.54s)]
*  He was a complete rich Lothario. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5597.54s)]
*  Well, you really see it in the dictator, that movie, The Dictator, where he has that insane [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5599.179999999999s)]
*  speech at the end, uniting the world. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5603.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5605.7s)]
*  Out and out socialist, basically. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5607.179999999999s)]
*  And a brilliant guy. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5608.54s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5610.0199999999995s)]
*  Which is really crazy when you think about how silly his character was. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5611.0199999999995s)]
*  His character was this bumbling, stumbling goof. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5614.9s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5617.9s)]
*  What is more valuable, what the public wants from you or what is true? [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5618.9s)]
*  In the entertainment world, we're used to it, right? [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5623.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5626.26s)]
*  You could play Joe Rogan, the comedian, at the drop of a hat because you've done it. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5627.26s)]
*  Joe Rogan, the UFC announcer. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5631.82s)]
*  I'm not saying it's not who you are, but it's an extenuation. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5634.9s)]
*  We say in wrestling, you turn the volume up to 11. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5638.259999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5640.099999999999s)]
*  It's still Joe Rogan. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5641.099999999999s)]
*  I don't see him as being disingenuous. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5642.099999999999s)]
*  I can't even think of one time I've ever seen you in any media where I thought that he's [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5643.7s)]
*  not playing, he's not Joe Rogan. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5647.12s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5649.0599999999995s)]
*  Right. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5650.0599999999995s)]
*  I've done it. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5651.0599999999995s)]
*  I've played other people. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5652.0599999999995s)]
*  So what I'm trying to say is now we're in this thing where everybody's doing it. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5653.0599999999995s)]
*  I mean everybody. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5658.9s)]
*  We've all looked at some girl on the internet and said, that's not how she really looks. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5661.14s)]
*  You got to go through the Instagram and you find the real picture. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5664.860000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5667.740000000001s)]
*  Everybody's become comfortable with a filter over everything. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5668.740000000001s)]
*  So that's why I mean we're in a post-truth world where the impression is becoming more [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5671.9400000000005s)]
*  valuable than the reality. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5675.5s)]
*  That's really, I think, unprecedented. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5677.02s)]
*  Yeah, I think so too. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5679.62s)]
*  But I also think that authenticity is more valuable now than ever before because it's [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5681.42s)]
*  hard to find. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5685.18s)]
*  Well, that would be my argument for why my band has risen back up because we're one of [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5686.18s)]
*  the only bands left that sort of represents some ideal that's long abandoned. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5690.62s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5696.0199999999995s)]
*  You're not a corporate creation. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5697.3s)]
*  No, we never were. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5699.38s)]
*  Right. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5701.14s)]
*  And we were. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5702.14s)]
*  And there's so many of them now. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5703.14s)]
*  You feel like, you know, like you ever seen Kinnison's bit about the monkeys? [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5704.14s)]
*  The band the monkeys? [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5709.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5710.78s)]
*  Give me the. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5711.78s)]
*  Well, it's a bit about Manson. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5712.78s)]
*  It was and then, you know, he does this bit about the monkeys about they weren't a real [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5713.78s)]
*  fucking band because, you know, they were pieced together by a corporation. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5719.0599999999995s)]
*  The monkeys like one of which were great. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5723.58s)]
*  The monkeys are great. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5725.54s)]
*  I'm a believer. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5726.54s)]
*  They have some great songs, but they were kind of one of the first corporate creations. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5727.54s)]
*  But I actually on my podcast recently interviewed Mickey Dolan's. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5731.54s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5736.34s)]
*  And we talk a lot about this very subject. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5737.34s)]
*  It hasn't aired yet. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5738.82s)]
*  But but he was less interested in the discussion than I was because my argument would be is [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5739.82s)]
*  that the monkeys are actually the template that came. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5744.74s)]
*  Our whole lives, the monkeys were dismissed as an anachronistic thing that went against [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5748.9s)]
*  the integrity of the Beatles. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5752.599999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5753.94s)]
*  But if you actually look now, Beatles versus monkeys, the monkeys are more accurate of [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5754.94s)]
*  what came than the Beatles. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5758.66s)]
*  In what way? [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5760.139999999999s)]
*  Because authenticity is less and less and less important. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5761.639999999999s)]
*  Those who establish authenticity, and I would include myself amongst that and I would include [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5764.179999999999s)]
*  you in that, they're very valuable. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5768.38s)]
*  But you also know because of your public things have gone on, you've had to stand there and [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5770.639999999999s)]
*  take a lot of shit because just even speaking your own truth is inconvenient in a post truth [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5774.74s)]
*  world. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5781.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5782.0599999999995s)]
*  Right. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5783.0599999999995s)]
*  So so it's actually more politically expedient to to create a character that can navigate [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5784.0599999999995s)]
*  this new world. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5788.7s)]
*  And by the way, change on a dime. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5789.7s)]
*  Right. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5790.7s)]
*  Does it make sense the way I'm pausing? [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5791.7s)]
*  Yeah, no, it does make sense. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5793.179999999999s)]
*  So so my argument would be from a rock and roll historical point of view is that the [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5794.42s)]
*  monkeys are actually more relevant now in a particular way. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5797.42s)]
*  The Beatles are this preeminent band. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5801.66s)]
*  That's not the argument I'm making. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5803.22s)]
*  What I'm saying is the model of the monkeys, which was always held up as for a form of [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5804.22s)]
*  mockery. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5808.34s)]
*  Right. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5809.34s)]
*  See, this is what you get when you make plastic music. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5810.34s)]
*  No, no, we live in the age of plastic music now. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5811.34s)]
*  Right. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5814.02s)]
*  The monkeys are the are the four are the grandfathers of this thing. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5815.02s)]
*  Right. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5817.780000000001s)]
*  It wouldn't even be shocking today if the corporation put together a band. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5818.780000000001s)]
*  No one would dismiss the band because a bunch of people, they cast it together with a bunch [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5821.22s)]
*  of good musicians and created a band. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5825.38s)]
*  No, I mean, I used to want Aerosmith. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5828.22s)]
*  We used to want Steven Tyler and Joe Perry Young coming up together playing music. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5832.3s)]
*  That's what we used to want. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5837.22s)]
*  We used to want the Beatles. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5838.22s)]
*  They all got together. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5840.14s)]
*  They formed the band. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5841.14s)]
*  They played in Hamburg until they tightened it up. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5842.14s)]
*  I used to work with the musician and I was I was in therapy at the time and I was having [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5843.900000000001s)]
*  a lot of problems with the musician and the musician was from a wealthy family, but he [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5847.5s)]
*  always he didn't bathe and he wore junkie clothes. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5851.1s)]
*  He wanted people to believe he was somebody that he wasn't. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5855.2s)]
*  Right. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5858.02s)]
*  You know, I was actually from a porish family. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5859.02s)]
*  He was from a rich family pretending to be poor. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5861.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5863.8s)]
*  And my therapist had the great line about him. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5864.8s)]
*  He said he looks like a junkie, he smells like a junkie, but he doesn't have the guts [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5866.48s)]
*  to be a junkie. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5869.34s)]
*  So if you can, if in this culture you can pick up anything you want and adapt it without [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5873.0s)]
*  the downside of actually becoming it. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5878.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5880.76s)]
*  Well, you can see why so many people without courage or chops, it puts them in a game. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5881.76s)]
*  in the social milieu that we all sort of have to navigate. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5887.0s)]
*  So now we're into this place where we're talking to a lot of people who believe that their [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5891.34s)]
*  furry number 463 because that's all that's all their status comes from their digital [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5895.94s)]
*  online group. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5900.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5902.4s)]
*  You know, I'm 57. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5904.6s)]
*  I got two kids, another one on the way. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5906.1s)]
*  I work with animal charities and I have a tea house and a wrestling company and I'm [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5908.24s)]
*  still fighting at 57 with people who want me to be this guy that they believe I am from [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5912.08s)]
*  30 years ago. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5916.64s)]
*  And no amount of empirical evidence will change their minds. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5918.96s)]
*  They're upset with you because you're connected to something that's different than what they [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5922.12s)]
*  want you to be connected to. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5925.5599999999995s)]
*  Like they don't care what you really are. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5927.0s)]
*  They don't want you to like pro wrestling. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5928.94s)]
*  Sam Kenison's second act should have been get sober, get straight and go on another [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5932.28s)]
*  hellacious run. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5936.86s)]
*  Yeah, I suspect Sam was very mentally ill. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5938.32s)]
*  I never met him, but I think one of the reasons why he was self medicating so hard was probably [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5941.6s)]
*  that head injury that he got when he was a young kid. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5947.080000000001s)]
*  Probably really fucked him up because I know quite a few people with some pretty significant [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5949.92s)]
*  head injuries and they're wild and impulsive and aggressive and they do crazy things. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5953.320000000001s)]
*  Like some of them, like they just go off on benders. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5959.52s)]
*  They disappear for days. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5961.68s)]
*  Like I think it's common with people with severe CTS, CTE. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5962.92s)]
*  I'm on the board, I'm on honorary on the board of the Concussion Legacy Foundation, which [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5968.04s)]
*  I'm sure has some tie to UFC too because Chris Nowinski who runs it is my friend. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5973.0s)]
*  One of the main things that happens with people who start to get CTE early in life is lack [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5980.84s)]
*  of impulse control. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5985.66s)]
*  So suddenly you have a 40 year old retired professional athlete who's faster and stronger [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5988.04s)]
*  than 99% of the population who can't control his temper. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5992.68s)]
*  That's what makes that situation so frightening for the families because they lose the ability [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=5997.0s)]
*  to kind of keep it all reigned in. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6001.36s)]
*  Right, right. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6003.8s)]
*  That happens a lot with fighters, football players. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6005.0s)]
*  I'm sure it happens with pro wrestlers. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6007.4s)]
*  Probably happens with a lot of... [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6009.2s)]
*  It's getting better I think with wrestling. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6010.24s)]
*  The awareness is helping. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6011.68s)]
*  In our organization we forbid headshots. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6014.28s)]
*  That's good. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6017.8s)]
*  You know the classic chair to the head does none of that in my world. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6018.8s)]
*  Good, good. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6021.36s)]
*  You don't need it. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6022.36s)]
*  Well for what? [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6023.36s)]
*  Watching people deteriorate is so awful. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6024.92s)]
*  The pain in their eyes where they just can't navigate life anymore and every day they have [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6028.12s)]
*  a fucking headache and they're just in hell and they just want to kill themselves. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6032.679999999999s)]
*  They just can't take it anymore. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6035.96s)]
*  And it gets to a certain point where it sort of accumulates over time. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6037.44s)]
*  Where it doesn't get better, it gets worse. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6040.2s)]
*  Well I think also, and I'm not speaking from experiences but I've heard the stories, you [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6042.08s)]
*  take people who are held up as almost like masculine ideals. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6046.2s)]
*  That fall isn't just the fall physically. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6051.28s)]
*  It's the fall of like, I'm not the person, I'm not the hero that you've made me out to [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6053.64s)]
*  be anymore. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6057.400000000001s)]
*  I'm broken. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6058.400000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6059.400000000001s)]
*  And there's nothing I can do to put the pieces back together. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6060.400000000001s)]
*  That's a very hard journey for championship fighters. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6062.92s)]
*  When they are the fucking man, they're on top of the world and then they have to just [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6065.72s)]
*  integrate society and be one of us. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6069.160000000001s)]
*  When they used to be the dominant and then they go to the fights and they sit there with [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6071.96s)]
*  a paunch and a little bit of a belly. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6074.68s)]
*  Sit there and watch people doing what they used to do. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6078.08s)]
*  And they don't know how to make a living outside of fighting. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6082.04s)]
*  They don't know what to do. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6085.4s)]
*  Very few of them figure out how to transition into some other stage of life. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6086.4s)]
*  The thing about athletics is by the time you're 40 you're essentially done. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6090.48s)]
*  Unless you're a rare Tom Brady type character or Randy Couture who can compete into their [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6093.84s)]
*  40s. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6099.08s)]
*  Bernard Hopkins, great example. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6100.08s)]
*  But at a certain point in time it's over. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6101.88s)]
*  And you have to know when it's over. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6104.24s)]
*  And then what? [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6105.88s)]
*  You put all your eggs in this one basket. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6107.08s)]
*  To be a championship fighter like a Lennox Lewis or a Vanderhole field you have to be [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6110.64s)]
*  all in. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6114.240000000001s)]
*  You can't have like a side gig in a blues band. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6115.240000000001s)]
*  There's no room for you writing books. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6118.0s)]
*  There's no room for you fucking selling things on Etsy. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6120.64s)]
*  I know this is a leap of discussion but that's one of the discussions that's going on internally [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6126.160000000001s)]
*  in my band is I'm 57 and one guy's 56 and one guy's I think 61. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6130.88s)]
*  It's like at what point do you start to dial the thing down? [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6136.96s)]
*  My brain is wired. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6139.64s)]
*  I'm going to go until I run into a brick wall. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6140.64s)]
*  And they're more like well things are pretty good. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6143.6s)]
*  Do we have to keep throwing ourselves into the maw of the public? [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6147.200000000001s)]
*  My argument is it'd be like going into a UFC fight and not fighting to win. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6152.280000000001s)]
*  Fighting not to lose. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6158.280000000001s)]
*  That seems to me far more dangerous. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6159.72s)]
*  And that's kind of my argument is in order to be in the arts you've got to, it's a pail [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6161.4800000000005s)]
*  mail all in. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6166.08s)]
*  All in or all out. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6168.6s)]
*  That's the only gear I know. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6170.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6171.56s)]
*  There's a thing that happens to bands when they get to a point where they never make [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6172.56s)]
*  any new music. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6174.96s)]
*  Right? [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6175.96s)]
*  And they just tour on the old music. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6176.96s)]
*  You're touching on the nerve of my life. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6179.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6181.84s)]
*  How do you navigate that? [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6182.84s)]
*  I just keep working. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6184.08s)]
*  I refuse. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6186.0s)]
*  That's it. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6188.88s)]
*  In my case, back to my daddy for a second, I watched my dad play songs he didn't want [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6191.08s)]
*  to play. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6195.360000000001s)]
*  I watched him doing drug deals rather than make money from music. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6196.8s)]
*  I watched him give up on his talent, his dream, all of it. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6199.72s)]
*  I watched it destroy my father. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6202.6s)]
*  And then if you want to even go further in a kind of a mythical way, my success destroyed [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6205.2s)]
*  him again. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6210.780000000001s)]
*  So if you've watched that, well, then I was lucky enough to have kids late in life. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6215.2s)]
*  My first kid came when I was 48 and we're about to have one again, 57. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6221.42s)]
*  Once my kid came, I was like, this kid is not going to look at me how I looked at my [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6226.36s)]
*  father. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6230.44s)]
*  Like, shoulda, woulda, coulda. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6231.44s)]
*  So I had to get myself up off the couch and get serious again. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6234.679999999999s)]
*  And again, that's that mentality, that killer mentality, like I can still go. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6238.28s)]
*  I'm going to go. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6241.5199999999995s)]
*  So until somebody stops me, I'm going to go. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6242.759999999999s)]
*  Well, that's what got you to the dance, right? [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6245.24s)]
*  Well even doing the podcast. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6248.5199999999995s)]
*  It looks easy to just sit and talk, but it requires prep and mental focus. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6251.44s)]
*  It's a lot harder than I would have thought. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6256.24s)]
*  And I got money. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6259.92s)]
*  I could sit home. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6262.5599999999995s)]
*  I like being in the game. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6263.5599999999995s)]
*  I like the hustle. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6264.719999999999s)]
*  I like having to learn things. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6265.719999999999s)]
*  I like having to... [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6266.96s)]
*  What do you enjoy about podcasting and why did you decide to get into it? [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6268.16s)]
*  A quick story was I did a podcast based on an album that we put out that was 33 songs. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6271.76s)]
*  And I did it for iHeartRadio and they were fine and everything. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6277.04s)]
*  But when it all finished, I started to kind of enjoy it a bit. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6280.04s)]
*  And I poked around as you do to see if anybody was interested. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6283.36s)]
*  It was like crickets. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6286.52s)]
*  Nobody gave a shit about me being a podcaster at all. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6288.32s)]
*  And if any kind of response came back and be like, well, if you want to tell stories [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6292.28s)]
*  about the 90s and get other 90s artists on to talk about the 90s, we'd be cool with that. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6294.88s)]
*  But other than that, we have no use for you. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6299.28s)]
*  So I just thought, okay, not for me. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6301.92s)]
*  Not meant to be. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6303.96s)]
*  And then I did Club Random with Bill Maher. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6305.3s)]
*  And as soon as I was done with the episode and shaking everybody's hands, they said, [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6307.92s)]
*  Bill's starting a podcast network. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6311.24s)]
*  Would you be interested in doing this? [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6312.4800000000005s)]
*  And I said, only if I could do whatever I want to do. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6314.72s)]
*  And they said, tell us what it is. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6317.64s)]
*  And I pitched them the idea that is the show called Magnificent Others Now. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6319.240000000001s)]
*  I said, I want to talk to whoever I want to talk to about whatever I want to talk about. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6323.08s)]
*  But here's the reason. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6326.12s)]
*  And the reason to the heart of your question is I feel there's a lot of people in this [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6327.12s)]
*  culture that don't get celebrated in the way that I would celebrate them because we've [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6329.96s)]
*  become so skewed with influencers and people who are famous that don't do shit. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6335.240000000001s)]
*  And I think there's a lot of value in American culture that can be celebrated. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6341.56s)]
*  So you're talking about like a retired fighter or something. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6346.120000000001s)]
*  So a lot we can learn from a retired fighter. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6349.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6351.72s)]
*  You have a show gun armor out here. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6352.72s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6354.200000000001s)]
*  To me, a retired fighter is like, you think I don't want to sit down with a retired show [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6355.200000000001s)]
*  gun and ask them about what it's like to be in there alone? [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6358.080000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6363.04s)]
*  Recently interviewed Steve Vai, great guitar player. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6365.4800000000005s)]
*  For some reason I had this idea of the classic Sergio Leone, two guys at the end of the street [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6369.719999999999s)]
*  with the gun. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6375.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6376.5599999999995s)]
*  So I said to Steve Vai, who do you fear at the end of the, like, who's the faster gun? [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6377.5599999999995s)]
*  I mean, that's his. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6382.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6384.08s)]
*  I'm projecting, but I'm saying we all have that moment, like, who do we not want to be [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6385.08s)]
*  in the octagon with? [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6388.719999999999s)]
*  Is it Eddie Van Halen? [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6390.12s)]
*  Who was it? [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6391.12s)]
*  For me? [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6392.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6393.12s)]
*  Or for him? [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6394.12s)]
*  For Steve Vai. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6395.12s)]
*  He didn't want to say. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6396.12s)]
*  Really? [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6397.12s)]
*  Well, I think he's a top guy. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6398.12s)]
*  Why would you want to create heat where there's no need to create heat? [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6399.2s)]
*  I mean, he's at an elite level. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6402.28s)]
*  Right. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6403.96s)]
*  I'll tell you what, I wouldn't want to be at the end of the street with him, Steve Vai [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6404.96s)]
*  at the other end of the street. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6407.12s)]
*  No. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6408.12s)]
*  Or Yngwie. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6409.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6410.12s)]
*  Those guys are like insane shredders. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6411.12s)]
*  I mean, yeah. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6412.12s)]
*  I mean, I'm an amateur, you know, compared to those guys. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6413.12s)]
*  So I wouldn't want the woo. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6415.28s)]
*  There's something about that kind of shredding too that's just like so stunning. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6417.08s)]
*  Freakish. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6422.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6423.12s)]
*  I mean, do you still train MMA? [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6424.12s)]
*  I still do martial arts. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6426.96s)]
*  I don't spar though. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6428.92s)]
*  I don't get hit in the head anymore. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6430.4800000000005s)]
*  But there's got to be those times where you see a fighter that just, they just get it. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6432.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6436.160000000001s)]
*  And it looks easy for them. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6437.160000000001s)]
*  And you're like, how is that? [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6438.160000000001s)]
*  Autism. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6439.160000000001s)]
*  Okay, God bless. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6440.160000000001s)]
*  But I'm saying that's the way it is for me with other musicians sometimes. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6441.160000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6443.120000000001s)]
*  I'll look at a guy like Steve Vai or Eddie Van Halen or Ring Van, like, how do you do [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6444.120000000001s)]
*  that? [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6447.8s)]
*  Right. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6448.8s)]
*  Like what it must have been like when Hendrix burst onto the scene. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6449.8s)]
*  My dad had a story actually. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6451.84s)]
*  He was playing a club in Wisconsin. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6454.64s)]
*  He never heard of Jimi Hendrix. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6456.66s)]
*  And Jimi Hendrix was playing the night before they were playing the same club. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6458.94s)]
*  So one of his boys said, why don't we go up, watch this new guy Jimi Hendrix, we'll hang [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6462.38s)]
*  out, we'll play at the gig the next night and we'll drive back to Chicago. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6466.0199999999995s)]
*  So imagine my dad's in a club in Wisconsin with like a thousand people in 1966 or 67 [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6469.14s)]
*  and now he walks Jimi Hendrix. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6475.42s)]
*  My dad said he'd never even heard his music so it split his mind. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6477.54s)]
*  And he said it was so shocking the way he played and how masterful he was at it. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6482.78s)]
*  He said when he got on stage the next night, he felt like he couldn't play the guitar at [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6486.86s)]
*  all. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6489.86s)]
*  Wow. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6490.86s)]
*  It was like an alien instrument. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6491.86s)]
*  And Clapton talks about it. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6494.42s)]
*  Jimi Hendrix blew Clapton's mind. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6497.98s)]
*  And whatever, Roy Albert Hall, whatever it was, he was like, oh my God, what the hell [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6499.74s)]
*  is happening? [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6503.259999999999s)]
*  I think it was Bagonails or something. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6504.259999999999s)]
*  He was like, what am I doing? [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6506.0599999999995s)]
*  And this is when people were spray painting on the walls in London, Clapton is God. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6508.219999999999s)]
*  Here shows up this guy who was on the Chitlin circuit is what they used to call playing [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6513.26s)]
*  for Little Richard and the Isley Brothers. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6516.3s)]
*  He was just in the backup band. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6518.9s)]
*  And he shows up in England, Chas Chandler, the bassist from the Animals goes, this guy [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6520.86s)]
*  could be a star. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6525.5s)]
*  Gets him a record deal. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6526.5s)]
*  He shows up in England and next thing you know he's like, Hey Joe is a number one hit [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6527.5s)]
*  and he's on TV and it's like, I mean, imagine that. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6531.42s)]
*  So yeah, there are those people that's like, it's so shocking. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6535.94s)]
*  Van Halen was the same way. [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6538.38s)]
*  I got to interview him once and sit in his studio for four hours. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6539.66s)]
*  He would just play the guitar and you'd just be like, I don't understand how this is possible. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6542.66s)]
*  You're doing inhuman things and I know how to do what you do. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6546.0599999999995s)]
*  And I can't even come close to doing what you're doing. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6549.82s)]
*  Shocking. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6553.14s)]
*  It's always interesting too that people have a specific sound. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6554.98s)]
*  Like you can hear them and you know who's playing the guitar. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6559.0599999999995s)]
*  Like Stevie Ray Vaughan had a sound. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6562.38s)]
*  Like you can hear him like when he was doing Voodoo Child, you're like, oh, that's a Stevie [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6564.62s)]
*  version. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6567.9s)]
*  Like he played music. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6568.98s)]
*  You play guitar at all? [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6570.46s)]
*  No. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6571.46s)]
*  So the one thing I'll tell you guitar player to non-guitar players, the thing you learned [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6572.46s)]
*  about the great guitar players, it's all in their hands. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6576.82s)]
*  Everybody focuses on what amp, what guitar, the gear. [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6581.299999999999s)]
*  It's somehow it's the way they hit the strings. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6585.94s)]
*  I couldn't even explain it to you. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6588.54s)]
*  They just have a different feel. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6590.0199999999995s)]
*  We call it attack. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6591.0199999999995s)]
*  I have no idea. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6592.0199999999995s)]
*  Stevie Ray Vaughan for example, he played his strings purposely high. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6593.0199999999995s)]
*  He made it harder to play the guitar and still played at that level. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6597.86s)]
*  Now there's a belief with certain guitar players that the higher you put the strings, the more [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6602.139999999999s)]
*  you have to dig out the notes and that's how it becomes more emotive. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6605.219999999999s)]
*  So imagine he's doing it at that level, even he's making it harder to do what he's doing [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6608.62s)]
*  and he's doing it at that level. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6613.58s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6615.58s)]
*  Incredible talent. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6616.58s)]
*  I mean, shocking. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6617.58s)]
*  Again, shocking. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6618.58s)]
*  It's like, where does that come from? [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6619.58s)]
*  Just has it. [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6621.9s)]
*  We have a photo of him in the tunnel leading up to the stage in my comedy club of him on [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6624.14s)]
*  stage at that club in 1980. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6630.06s)]
*  Or at the same place. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6633.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6635.3s)]
*  I think it's 88, 86. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6636.3s)]
*  Somewhere in the 80s. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6638.740000000001s)]
*  He's on that. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6639.740000000001s)]
*  Maybe it's 83, but early in the, sometime in the 80s. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6640.740000000001s)]
*  It's like Stevie Ray Vaughan on stage at that club. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6643.740000000001s)]
*  It's wild. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6647.660000000001s)]
*  It's just wild to think that he was in this room. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6648.660000000001s)]
*  You know, it's Austin where he's from. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6651.06s)]
*  I think about this, because he talked about it. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6654.74s)]
*  There was a point in his life where he was dropping rocks of coke, I think he had whiskey [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6655.74s)]
*  and drinking it and rotten his stomach out. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6658.82s)]
*  And he got sober like in the last year or so of his life and he played even better. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6662.54s)]
*  If you listen to the recordings that he made live, particularly in the last year or so [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6667.379999999999s)]
*  of his life, he's playing even better. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6671.139999999999s)]
*  So that's what I say about Sam Kinison. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6672.78s)]
*  Imagine if he was able to make that left. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6674.78s)]
*  Like I said though, I think Sam was dealing with something. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6679.099999999999s)]
*  I think his demons were internal. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6681.58s)]
*  The Stevie Ray Vaughan thing, what's fascinating to me is, well first of all, he's the only [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6685.86s)]
*  guy that can play Voodoo Child other than Hendrix. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6692.9s)]
*  Like if you're like at some upstart and you want to release Voodoo Child today, like Jesus [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6696.18s)]
*  Christ, like what are you doing? [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6700.7s)]
*  You're trading on hollowed ground. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6702.9s)]
*  You know, like maybe you can do all along the watchtower, because that was actually [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6706.22s)]
*  a Dylan song, right? [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6710.34s)]
*  Maybe. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6712.02s)]
*  But you know why he, you know, this is my opinion, but you know why he plays Voodoo [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6713.02s)]
*  Child so well? [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6716.66s)]
*  Why? [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6717.66s)]
*  Because he had studied the same guys that Hendrix had studied. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6718.66s)]
*  So he's not imitating Hendrix. [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6721.62s)]
*  He's coming from the same wellspring of information. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6724.06s)]
*  Like who were the guys? [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6726.02s)]
*  Albert King, BB King, Albert King, you know, it's muddy waters. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6727.02s)]
*  It's understanding the way those guys played. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6734.66s)]
*  So he's not imitating Jimi Hendrix. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6736.6s)]
*  He's playing from the same spot. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6738.74s)]
*  Have you ever heard of Johnny Thunder? [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6741.26s)]
*  You mean talking about from the New York Dolls? [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6742.66s)]
*  No, Johnny Thunder was an artist in the 1960s and he put out a song called I'm Alive. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6746.5s)]
*  And I think it was 1969. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6754.78s)]
*  And it was also covered by another band. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6756.26s)]
*  But his version is fucking insane. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6759.46s)]
*  It's so good. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6763.34s)]
*  You can't believe he didn't make it. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6764.34s)]
*  Can I play it for you? [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6766.099999999999s)]
*  Right, that's right. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6768.900000000001s)]
*  His version is the cover. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6769.900000000001s)]
*  What was the other version of it? [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6770.900000000001s)]
*  Tommy James and the Shondells. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6773.900000000001s)]
*  Their version, eh. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6776.54s)]
*  But Johnny Thunder, put the headphones on. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6778.14s)]
*  It's in another new commercial I've heard recently. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6780.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, well we started talking about it like a year or so ago. [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6783.660000000001s)]
*  My friend Brian Simpson played it for me. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6786.900000000001s)]
*  And he goes, you're going to fucking love this. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6791.38s)]
*  And he goes, this is a one hit wonder from 1969. [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6793.3s)]
*  Woo! [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6797.7s)]
*  I've never heard of him. [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6798.7s)]
*  I usually know all this stuff. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6801.099999999999s)]
*  Fucking fantastic, right? [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6802.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6803.099999999999s)]
*  I don't even know where he's from. [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6804.099999999999s)]
*  I can't even identify where he's from. [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6805.3s)]
*  The fucking song is fantastic. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6807.5s)]
*  It's so good. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6809.66s)]
*  It stuns you because you hear something like that and you go, how did he not make it? [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6811.66s)]
*  What hope is there? [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6816.54s)]
*  Imagine if you were around in 1969 and you see that guy up at the Whisky a Go Go. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6818.099999999999s)]
*  He gets on stage and plays that song and you're like, holy shit. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6823.139999999999s)]
*  I've never heard of it. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6826.5s)]
*  But to be fair, I saw those people in the 80s and I saw those people in the 90s. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6827.5s)]
*  I couldn't imagine that they weren't going to make it and they didn't. [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6831.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6834.1s)]
*  Isn't that weird? [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6835.1s)]
*  And that was part of the vibe that my father put on me, which was like, well how the hell [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6836.1s)]
*  did you get out? [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6840.1s)]
*  Right, of course. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6841.1s)]
*  Well, the fucking resentment must have been astounding. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6842.1s)]
*  When you're trying and kind of half-assing it and your son comes along and all of a sudden [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6845.7s)]
*  he's doing arenas, you're like, what the fuck? [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6851.7s)]
*  This interview from Rolling Stone by Bob Dylan literally almost has what you guys just quoted [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6854.22s)]
*  like, never heard of it? [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6859.34s)]
*  I can't believe it. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6860.860000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6861.860000000001s)]
*  We talked about this. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6862.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6863.860000000001s)]
*  What year was this? [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6864.860000000001s)]
*  1969. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6865.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6866.860000000001s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6867.860000000001s)]
*  That's right. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6868.860000000001s)]
*  We talked about this. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6869.860000000001s)]
*  Bob Dylan. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6870.860000000001s)]
*  So he discovered it and was asking John Wenner if he'd heard of it. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6871.9400000000005s)]
*  That's so crazy that even Bob Dylan couldn't make it huge. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6875.1s)]
*  So 1968. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6879.02s)]
*  Okay. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6880.02s)]
*  Yeah, Bob Dylan heard it on the radio. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6881.02s)]
*  Wow. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6883.02s)]
*  And then disappeared. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6884.02s)]
*  That's fucking incredible, man. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6887.02s)]
*  Incredible. [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6889.02s)]
*  Because you feel like a guy who makes a song that's that good, oh my God, all you need is [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6890.02s)]
*  good songwriters and that guy's going to be huge. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6894.22s)]
*  There's a fucking billion dollars in there waiting for you. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6897.540000000001s)]
*  Dig it out. [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6901.02s)]
*  But that's kind of what I was saying before is like, it's a curious thing why certain [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6902.02s)]
*  people make it and certain people don't. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6906.580000000001s)]
*  My father, before he passed away, he told me you had the one thing that I didn't have, [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6909.14s)]
*  which was the ambition. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6913.54s)]
*  Like he wanted it. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6915.58s)]
*  He said, I didn't really want it. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6916.740000000001s)]
*  I just wanted it to come to me. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6917.740000000001s)]
*  Well, also, I think if you're involved in a life of crime like that, a lot of cocaine [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6920.3s)]
*  and first of all, there's a lot of bad karma that you have. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6926.54s)]
*  But also it's like you're too distracted. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6929.58s)]
*  You're too in that life. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6933.06s)]
*  You're never going to really be able to go all in on music as an artist. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6934.240000000001s)]
*  So you're never going to really be able to reach your full potential, right? [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6938.62s)]
*  Yeah, that's what he was saying. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6942.18s)]
*  He was admitting to me that he had made some sort of internal decision that he didn't want [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6944.46s)]
*  to do whatever he had to do to do it. [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6949.58s)]
*  He made certain excuses involving the mob. [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6951.74s)]
*  He did say that back then, and it is a known thing in Chicago, that in order to be successful [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6953.82s)]
*  in Chicago, you had to basically sign contracts with the mob. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6958.78s)]
*  about the band Chicago that there were mob ties with their world. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6964.1s)]
*  I'm sure there was a lot of that going on. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6969.660000000001s)]
*  Wasn't that the whole Hendrix thing? [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6971.26s)]
*  You ever know that conspiracy? [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6973.46s)]
*  Well, yeah, I've read about that. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6975.1s)]
*  That gets into other types of complications, and I don't have an opinion on it. [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6977.620000000001s)]
*  It's like saying there's no way to separate the two things at the time. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6985.26s)]
*  Everybody back then, any clubs at the time, particularly in Chicago, they were all mob [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6989.98s)]
*  connected. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6994.339999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6995.339999999999s)]
*  And Los Angeles as well. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6996.339999999999s)]
*  Sure. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6997.82s)]
*  So if you were a comedian or an emcee or whatever you were doing, like, here's Lola the dancer. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=6998.82s)]
*  You were connected. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7004.94s)]
*  There was a Wyat guy standing there, and everybody knew who they were because that's how they [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7005.94s)]
*  did their business. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7010.0599999999995s)]
*  Because if you didn't like what Johnny Rocco was doing, you were going to get in trouble, [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7011.0599999999995s)]
*  and you didn't want to get in trouble. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7014.339999999999s)]
*  And I went to school with a bunch of the mob wise guys' kids and grandkids. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7016.3s)]
*  I worked at a mob club in Connecticut. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7021.18s)]
*  I did stand out. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7024.22s)]
*  And another one in Long Island, there was where the guys were connected by the mob. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7025.22s)]
*  In Boston as well. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7029.860000000001s)]
*  In Boston, Nick's Comedy Stop, they would offer to pay you in cocaine or money. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7031.06s)]
*  We played a club on Long Island once where the crowd was moshing. [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7035.46s)]
*  And in the middle of the four song, the guy on the side of the stage that worked for me [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7040.66s)]
*  was waving, like, stop playing in the middle of the song. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7045.72s)]
*  And I thought, fuck it, stop playing. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7048.240000000001s)]
*  I've got a thousand people out in front of me. [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7050.0s)]
*  And he kind of did one of these, and there were two wise guys standing there with suits [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7052.4800000000005s)]
*  on. [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7057.76s)]
*  Kind of like, you're going to get in trouble with these guys if you don't stop. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7058.76s)]
*  And I said, fuck it, I kept going. [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7061.0s)]
*  So they waited one more song, and then they came out between songs on stage with their [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7063.6s)]
*  backs to the audience, and they pulled their coats open and showed me a gun and said, you [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7066.92s)]
*  better calm the fuck down. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7069.64s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7071.4400000000005s)]
*  Because of the moshing? [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7072.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7074.56s)]
*  Because it was one of those, we used to call them brass and fern bars, you know, like the [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7075.56s)]
*  brass bar and the ferns. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7078.96s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7080.52s)]
*  You know that bar, right? [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7081.52s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7082.52s)]
*  We've all been there. [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7083.52s)]
*  And we were playing one of those places for some reason, and the crowd was going, ape shit, [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7084.52s)]
*  they were bouncing off the wall. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7088.360000000001s)]
*  So they were blaming us for the reaction of the crowd. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7089.400000000001s)]
*  So they wanted us to bring the crowd down. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7091.84s)]
*  But how do you bring the crowd down? [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7094.0s)]
*  So they literally showed me a gun and said, you better calm the fuck down. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7097.0s)]
*  So what did you do? [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7100.84s)]
*  I just kept going. [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7101.84s)]
*  Were they going to kill me on stage? [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7103.12s)]
*  Jesus Christ, what happened when you got off stage? [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7105.04s)]
*  They weren't gone. [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7107.400000000001s)]
*  Really? [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7108.400000000001s)]
*  I mean, there might have been a problem if somebody had done some real damage or something, [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7109.400000000001s)]
*  but there was no problem. [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7113.56s)]
*  But they definitely threatened me on stage. [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7115.4400000000005s)]
*  How did they not know about moshers? [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7117.68s)]
*  This is me at like 180 pounds and like long hair and bad attitude. [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7119.64s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7123.56s)]
*  No, I don't think they'd ever seen anything like moshing. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7124.56s)]
*  You know, this is like 92. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7126.76s)]
*  This is a very, very new phenomenon to the outside world. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7128.52s)]
*  Moshing was going on before that. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7132.68s)]
*  Oh yeah, but it's only in the underground clubs is what I'm saying. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7134.08s)]
*  It's like, that's what I'm saying. [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7136.360000000001s)]
*  You're in a wise guy's club on Long Island with brass rails and ferns. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7137.360000000001s)]
*  I dated a girl in the 80s who went to see the Cramps and came home with a concussion. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7142.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7148.92s)]
*  Poison Ivy. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7149.92s)]
*  From the mosh pit. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7150.92s)]
*  Remember Poison Ivy? [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7152.92s)]
*  She was the guitar player for the Cramps. [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7153.92s)]
*  Oh, right. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7155.4400000000005s)]
*  So great. [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7156.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7157.4400000000005s)]
*  Bad music for bad people. [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7159.6s)]
*  Did you ever kind of encounter the alternative scene when you were a kid? [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7161.28s)]
*  Not really, no. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7163.84s)]
*  Not for you, the freaks? [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7166.6s)]
*  I didn't go to very many, I mean I went to a few concerts when I was a kid, but not a [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7168.32s)]
*  lot. [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7173.56s)]
*  I went to Jay Guile's band. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7174.56s)]
*  I saw George Thorogood. [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7176.4s)]
*  Not exactly the alternative there. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7178.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, no. [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7179.92s)]
*  I never really saw a lot. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7180.92s)]
*  And then once I started really getting into comedy, I didn't really go to see anybody [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7182.76s)]
*  perform. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7186.52s)]
*  I was mostly just performing myself, so I never got to see anybody. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7187.56s)]
*  And I didn't really become friends with band people until I moved to Hollywood. [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7190.52s)]
*  In the late 90s and 2000s, I met a bunch of band people. [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7197.8s)]
*  And it was always weird hanging out with them. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7201.88s)]
*  It was always odd. [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7204.4800000000005s)]
*  It was like, oh, that's that guy from that band. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7205.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7208.120000000001s)]
*  It's a lot of, what do you call it, when the brains don't connect, the brain hemispheres? [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7209.4s)]
*  Bipolar. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7217.599999999999s)]
*  A lot of bipolarity in musicians. [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7218.599999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7221.4s)]
*  Particularly high levels? [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7222.4s)]
*  My theory is the reason they become musicians is they overdevelop one side of their brain. [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7224.0s)]
*  You probably get on somebody who knows what they're talking about. [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7231.36s)]
*  But the idea is that if people's brain hemispheres, and that's why a lot of musicians do coke, [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7233.88s)]
*  is it helps the polarities work. [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7238.8s)]
*  It helps the brain communicate left to right. [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7241.24s)]
*  Really? [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7244.360000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7245.360000000001s)]
*  It's a known thing that coke really helps that, if you have that bipolarity. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7246.360000000001s)]
*  Huh. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7250.4800000000005s)]
*  Is that a medication for people that are bipolar? [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7251.4800000000005s)]
*  Do they give them Adderall or anything like that? [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7254.64s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7256.52s)]
*  I mean, I've worked with people who are bipolar and they've talked about their medications [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7257.52s)]
*  and stuff. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7261.6s)]
*  And it's still kind of an inexact science, bipolarity. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7264.4800000000005s)]
*  It's crazy to think that coke helps fix some things. [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7267.04s)]
*  What I've heard is it helps the brain communications. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7271.76s)]
*  Anybody I've known that's bipolar, as a musician, that did coke, told me they felt normal. [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7274.16s)]
*  It's the first time in their life they felt normal, that their brain worked normally. [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7278.56s)]
*  What a terrible thing. [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7282.48s)]
*  Yeah, it doesn't work. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7283.48s)]
*  Imagine if that's the thing that keeps you together, it's cocaine. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7284.84s)]
*  I wonder if what coca leaves would do, because there's a lot of people like the high altitude [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7289.0s)]
*  hurting populations and people in Peru, they chew coca leaves just for energy. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7294.16s)]
*  And apparently it's a very different thing, like the chewing of the coca leaves. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7300.04s)]
*  Or you can get tea, coca tea. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7304.08s)]
*  I was just in South America and I drank coca tea. [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7306.08s)]
*  I've had that. [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7307.4s)]
*  I've had mate de coca. [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7308.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7309.4s)]
*  It's kind of like you get a little bit of a clarity. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7310.4s)]
*  But the chewing of the leaves is like, it's so normal for them and it's illegal over here. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7312.599999999999s)]
*  Back to the theory, the idea is if you have one side of your brain overdeveloped, it makes [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7320.44s)]
*  you good at something that you wouldn't necessarily be good at. [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7324.8s)]
*  And then bad at life. [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7328.04s)]
*  Yeah, probably. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7329.52s)]
*  Right. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7330.52s)]
*  So you need a handler like Elvis. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7331.52s)]
*  You need a Colonel. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7332.52s)]
*  So if you're meeting a successful musician, they're the graduating class of the bipolarity. [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7333.52s)]
*  Oh, okay, that makes sense. [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7338.64s)]
*  So there's some functional level of acumen. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7340.44s)]
*  That makes sense. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7342.96s)]
*  That makes sense. [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7343.96s)]
*  That's why through the years, as I've heard people give rumor to any number of famous [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7344.96s)]
*  rock stars, it's like I recognize all the behaviors. [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7348.0s)]
*  Most people treat it like, oh, can you believe so and so did this and made this erratic decision? [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7351.76s)]
*  It's like, no, that's a musician. [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7355.2s)]
*  That's how most of their brains work. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7357.56s)]
*  I don't know what it is. [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7358.88s)]
*  And maybe there's a comedic parallel, but it just strikes me that the reason there's [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7360.36s)]
*  such consistent bad behavior with musicians is because their brains don't work right. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7365.8s)]
*  And I'm sure somebody's going to get mad at me for saying that, but I mean it as a compliment. [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7370.76s)]
*  It makes them good at something that they maybe wouldn't necessarily be good at. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7374.44s)]
*  And maybe I don't know. [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7377.4s)]
*  I've never been tested. [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7378.4s)]
*  I don't think I'm bipolar, but. [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7379.4s)]
*  Yeah, I probably I would imagine that a lot of like motivational speakers would not be [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7380.799999999999s)]
*  awesome band members. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7385.16s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7387.799999999999s)]
*  Like people who are completely dialed in with their life. [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7388.799999999999s)]
*  Tony Robbins, my new bass player, you know, they get up in the morning and they do their [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7392.04s)]
*  exercise and yoga and eat well. [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7395.599999999999s)]
*  They stare at the sun as it rises and they get their fucking whole life dialed in. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7397.5199999999995s)]
*  They probably wouldn't be the best band members. [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7401.759999999999s)]
*  Well, especially like there's no good band members. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7403.799999999999s)]
*  That's the problem. [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7407.12s)]
*  Well, how do you guys do? [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7408.12s)]
*  How do you keep it together for all these years? [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7410.0s)]
*  Like what's the key to what we did? [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7412.16s)]
*  That's the thing. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7414.84s)]
*  I mean, we broke up in 2000 and then the German I brought the band back in 2007 and it only [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7415.84s)]
*  lasted two years. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7420.08s)]
*  And then I soldiered on alone as the only original member from 2009 to 2015. [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7421.08s)]
*  And then the drummer came back and then the guitar player who I didn't talk to for 16, [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7427.12s)]
*  17 years came back in 2018. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7430.64s)]
*  So we've been an intact three quarter unit since 2018. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7433.48s)]
*  How come you guys didn't talk for so long? [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7436.64s)]
*  It's just real heat. [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7438.200000000001s)]
*  It was real heat. [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7439.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7440.96s)]
*  That sucks. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7441.96s)]
*  No, it's all resolved now. [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7442.96s)]
*  I mean, it's all good. [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7444.320000000001s)]
*  I mean, I think if you don't talk to somebody for 16, 17 years, there's a beef there that, [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7445.320000000001s)]
*  you know what I mean? [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7450.08s)]
*  It lasts. [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7451.08s)]
*  A real one. [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7452.08s)]
*  But it's interesting to me how people can manage like that. [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7453.08s)]
*  It's always like as comics, we always look at band members going, imagine if all of your [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7458.6s)]
*  fucking success depended on this guy showing up, that guy showing up, this guy's girlfriend [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7463.08s)]
*  not getting in the way, this guy's fucking uncle not trying to manage you guys. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7467.76s)]
*  Like you have all these fucking people and you're trying to put together songs and you're [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7471.48s)]
*  trying to like get out. [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7476.56s)]
*  Come on, we got a tour. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7477.56s)]
*  I don't want a tour. [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7478.56s)]
*  My mom needs me to help her with the fucking business. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7479.56s)]
*  And what are you talking about, man? [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7481.68s)]
*  We're in a band. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7483.0s)]
*  We got it. [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7484.0s)]
*  We have a record deal. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7485.0s)]
*  I'm nodding my head because this is every this is my life experience for 35 years. [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7486.0s)]
*  We as comics, we always talk about it. [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7489.24s)]
*  Thank God we're like a one man show. [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7490.96s)]
*  All we need is other comics to work with us. [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7493.52s)]
*  The problem with the band is the band members have no idea why it works. [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7495.4400000000005s)]
*  We're clueless as to the mystery of why people are attracted to us as a unit. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7502.72s)]
*  We can certainly conceptualize, like I write good songs and I play good guitar, but there's [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7507.68s)]
*  something about bands that creates a kind of a magical. [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7513.12s)]
*  Pete Townsend referred to it as a gang, a gang that you want to be in. [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7515.88s)]
*  That's what makes bands attractive to people. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7521.24s)]
*  That was his opinion. [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7522.72s)]
*  I don't totally. [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7523.72s)]
*  I don't disagree. [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7524.72s)]
*  It's there's something that goes on in those relationships that's kinetic enough that it [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7525.72s)]
*  sustains past whether or not you have a good song or two. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7529.92s)]
*  Yeah, it's all the pieces make the puzzle together. [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7534.68s)]
*  It's not one piece as an individual. [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7539.76s)]
*  All of them together make Led Zeppelin. [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7542.12s)]
*  Yes. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7545.16s)]
*  All together. [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7546.16s)]
*  So if you're lucky and in this new world, you know, you got the Stones playing into [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7547.16s)]
*  their 80s. [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7549.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7550.84s)]
*  The whole economy of music has changed where it's like you're in an elongated state of [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7551.96s)]
*  success. [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7554.96s)]
*  That's just totally unprecedented, by the way. [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7555.96s)]
*  There's no, there's no what's going on with rock bands in their 50s and beyond is there's [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7558.4400000000005s)]
*  no prior parallel in a hundred plus years of recorded music. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7563.4400000000005s)]
*  There's not even one instance you can point to and say it worked that way then. [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7567.16s)]
*  So we're all in uncharted territory and there's nobody that can even really advise you. [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7571.24s)]
*  There's always the material thing of like, well, you're going to make a lot of money [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7575.96s)]
*  and you know, you got this IP and the band and it's like the actual sort of the nuts [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7578.5599999999995s)]
*  and bolts of how to hang together. [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7583.4s)]
*  So for us, it's been really, it's the, I call it the family of the band. [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7584.96s)]
*  There's some sort of pride that's emerged with like, we've all survived. [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7588.92s)]
*  Our relationships are intact enough for us to get on a stage and somehow it benefits [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7592.78s)]
*  our families individually. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7596.28s)]
*  So it has allowed us a sort of pride, you know, that it's because it's less about our [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7598.5599999999995s)]
*  relationship and more about our relationship with our families. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7602.5199999999995s)]
*  It's allowed us to have a sweetness between the three of us that we didn't have when we [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7605.8s)]
*  were young. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7608.72s)]
*  Oh, well that's cool. [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7609.72s)]
*  Well, also probably just growing up and being more mature and appreciative. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7611.2s)]
*  You're really going on a limb there with the growing up. [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7616.2s)]
*  That's here. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7618.400000000001s)]
*  A little bit of gratitude. [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7619.400000000001s)]

*  that goes back to the podcast is like, we're paying tribute to people who haven't done [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7780.96s)]

*  Like you're never going to get to see how your songs impacted other people, the way [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7904.099999999999s)]
*  it impacted them. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7907.98s)]
*  You're not going to feel that the way they feel it. [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7908.98s)]
*  Like hearing that song for the first time, completed, they've never seen you rehearse [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7911.099999999999s)]
*  it. [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7915.0599999999995s)]
*  They don't know how you wrote it. [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7916.0599999999995s)]
*  They don't know how you guys practiced it. [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7917.0599999999995s)]
*  They don't know how you fucked around with the lyrics. [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7918.46s)]
*  He did it a different way. [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7920.1s)]
*  They just get the first, they get the full version done. [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7921.1s)]
*  They're like, holy shit. [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7923.9800000000005s)]
*  And then it's kind of awful that you don't get to experience that. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7925.9s)]
*  Like you created it. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7929.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7930.42s)]
*  The only time I've been able to experience that is when I was really high. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7931.42s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7934.9s)]
*  Like getting so high that I could hear it for the first time. [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7935.9s)]
*  As if it was somebody else singing. [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7939.3s)]
*  What really tripped me out about doing a lot of drugs back in the day was I would hear [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7942.46s)]
*  messages in my music that I didn't even know I was putting in there. [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7947.139999999999s)]
*  And at some point I became conscious of my unconscious ability to put messages inside. [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7950.94s)]
*  Sorry, you look at me like I'm crazy. [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7955.219999999999s)]
*  No, no, no. [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7957.139999999999s)]
*  It's fascinating. [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7958.139999999999s)]
*  So imagine, I'll try to reset up the scenario. [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7959.139999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7961.099999999999s)]
*  You write a song, you think it's about something. [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7962.099999999999s)]
*  You're sure of it. [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7965.0599999999995s)]
*  In fact, you would tell people, sorry, this horrible plague I got. [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7966.0599999999995s)]
*  No worries. [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7969.74s)]
*  You're convinced that this song that you've written is about your ex-girlfriend. [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7971.54s)]
*  And then when you're super high, you listen and you can hear yourself actually singing [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7976.78s)]
*  about something else. [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7980.7s)]
*  So now you have a conscious understanding of something your unconscious has implanted [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7983.62s)]
*  in the art. [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7987.94s)]
*  And once I became conscious of the process, I became more aware of how to unconsciously [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7990.0599999999995s)]
*  plant messages in my music. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7995.0199999999995s)]
*  Does that make sense? [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7997.5s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7998.5s)]
*  You just operate on layers. [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=7999.9s)]
*  You put stuff in there. [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8002.0199999999995s)]
*  Yes, but I didn't know that I was doing it until I did a lot of drugs. [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8003.26s)]
*  That there was this other voice at work, this subliminal voice. [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8006.46s)]
*  Can you give me an example? [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8010.620000000001s)]
*  The conscious mind wants to believe the song's about your ex-girlfriend, but what it's really [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8015.9400000000005s)]
*  about is about being abandoned by your mother. [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8019.38s)]
*  If you came up to me and said, what's that song about? [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8023.900000000001s)]
*  And I trust you and I go, oh, it's just about my ex. [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8025.700000000001s)]
*  I would believe it. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8028.580000000001s)]
*  Like 100%. [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8030.46s)]
*  And then I listen to it high on drugs and I'm like, oh my God, I'm singing about my [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8032.14s)]
*  mother and I'm weeping. [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8035.1s)]
*  And I had no conscious mind when I wrote the song that it was about my mother. [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8036.820000000001s)]
*  And then once I have that kind of agape moment of like, holy shit, then I go back and listen [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8041.14s)]
*  to the music sober and I can totally hear it. [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8045.660000000001s)]
*  And then where it gets really weird is people would come up to me and say, that song, that [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8048.860000000001s)]
*  reminded me of my relationship with my mother. [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8055.660000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8057.740000000001s)]
*  People would come up and respond to me on the unconscious recognition, not what I thought [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8059.139999999999s)]
*  I wrote the song about. [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8063.179999999999s)]
*  That blew my mind that there was this other person in their layer at work. [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8064.86s)]
*  And I gained a lot more respect for, I guess you would call it the shamanic aspects of [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8071.179999999999s)]
*  art. [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8075.9s)]
*  I don't know if you've ever read Castanedus, but do you read Castanedus? [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8076.9s)]
*  Maybe I did in high school, I think. [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8081.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8083.38s)]
*  It was kind of a thing for our generation. [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8084.38s)]
*  Everybody kind of read Castanedus. [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8085.38s)]
*  And it's still to this day debated about whether Castanedus was a real thing. [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8086.94s)]
*  It was a documentary. [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8091.259999999999s)]
*  It was true stories or made up. [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8092.259999999999s)]
*  And did Don Juan, the shaman, was he a real person? [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8093.98s)]
*  Is there really a Don Juan? [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8097.099999999999s)]
*  There's a lot of debate. [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8098.099999999999s)]
*  I think there's even been New York Times articles written about it, about whether Castanedus, [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8099.099999999999s)]
*  this whole thing is a fraud and all this stuff. [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8103.54s)]
*  And I think Castanedus may even still be alive. [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8105.179999999999s)]
*  Really? [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8107.78s)]
*  That might be one to look up sometime. [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8108.78s)]
*  But anyway, I gained a lot more respect that artists have the ability to communicate at [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8110.58s)]
*  subconscious levels that they're not even aware of. [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8116.46s)]
*  I don't know if that resonates the way I'm explaining it, but it moved something to me, [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8120.86s)]
*  allowed me to be a better artist. [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8125.02s)]
*  That's fascinating. [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8128.46s)]
*  And also, you can never guess what kind of an impact, especially if you're too close to it, [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8129.18s)]
*  what kind of an impact your work is going to have on someone who's seeing it for the first time. [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8135.9800000000005s)]
*  And if there's multiple layers that you're operating on that you're not even [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8141.02s)]
*  totally aware of, and then you put out this thing that has this very complex layered message in it, [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8144.46s)]
*  and it just makes people go, oh my God. [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8152.14s)]
*  That's one of the ultimate expressions of art. [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8154.86s)]
*  Music does something very strange that no other art form does. [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8161.1s)]
*  It operates like a drug. [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8164.78s)]
*  Music gives you more energy when you're on the treadmill. [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8167.82s)]
*  If a great song comes on, you're working out, you're like, fuck yeah. [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8170.22s)]
*  You feel it. [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8173.58s)]
*  There's riffs. [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8175.34s)]
*  There's guitar riffs that I swear to God make you stronger. [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8176.7s)]
*  Tool prison sex. [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8180.46s)]
*  That song makes you just fucking raw. [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8186.14s)]
*  There's something to it. [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8188.86s)]
*  It gives you energy. [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8190.0599999999995s)]
*  It's like a drug. [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8191.5s)]
*  It's an audio drug. [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8193.34s)]
*  It fires up your synapses in this very strange way. [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8195.18s)]
*  The best explanation I ever heard that resonated with me was, [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8199.02s)]
*  the entire universe is constructed on waves. [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8204.220000000001s)]
*  Light, everything has to do with waves. [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8207.9s)]
*  So music is the closest thing to the foundational aspects of the universe. [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8210.060000000001s)]
*  That's okay. [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8216.060000000001s)]
*  I know what you're saying. [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8216.54s)]
*  Yeah, well that makes sense. [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8218.060000000001s)]
*  Because it penetrates the cellular. [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8219.58s)]
*  Right. [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8222.300000000001s)]
*  Well, people that go on these shamanic journeys, [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8224.140000000001s)]
*  the ayahuasca journeys, they play these songs that accompany the ayahuasca journey. [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8227.74s)]
*  They're called Icaros. [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8233.1s)]
*  Are they traditional ayahuasca songs? [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8236.300000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8238.86s)]
*  And they have this weird beat to them. [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8239.9s)]
*  When you listen to them by themselves, you're like, I don't get it. [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8242.7s)]
*  But if you listen to them under the influence, [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8245.74s)]
*  the psychedelic experience dances to those songs. [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8248.94s)]
*  And it gets guided by those songs. [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8253.26s)]
*  And it's really wild. [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8254.78s)]
*  And then you go, oh, this is like a technology to interface with the psychedelic experience. [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8257.66s)]
*  Yeah, but you're hitting on exactly what I'm saying. [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8263.5s)]
*  I think artists, and I'll exclude myself from the discussion so I don't make somebody mad, [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8266.78s)]
*  artists have a way of knowing how to do that without anybody teaching them. [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8271.1s)]
*  They just know what music, beats, chords, melodies, lyrics to use to penetrate. [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8276.380000000001s)]
*  And the successful artists, think of it, they do it at scale. [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8283.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8286.939999999999s)]
*  Well, there's this thing that happens when someone's really in it, [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8287.9s)]
*  where you feel it from them while they're performing. [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8292.3s)]
*  And you just get drawn into it like, wow. [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8296.06s)]
*  I remember the first time I saw Mr. Jones in me, [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8300.3s)]
*  first time I saw Counting Crows play that song, [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8303.74s)]
*  the way he was dancing around in the living room, [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8307.18s)]
*  I'm like, that guy is so free. [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8309.34s)]
*  I want to be free like that. [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8311.42s)]
*  I really remember thinking that because it was so real. [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8313.42s)]
*  He was so in the moment while he's singing that song. [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8316.54s)]
*  And I had Adam in here and I asked him about it. [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8320.220000000001s)]
*  I'm like, what is that? [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8322.060000000001s)]
*  You are fucking locked in, man. [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8323.34s)]
*  Like, I remember being a kid, I was probably like 23 or something like that when that song came out. [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8325.900000000001s)]
*  And I was in my apartment in New York watching it going, fuck, [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8331.34s)]
*  watching on MTV going, this guy's just so loose, man. [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8334.94s)]
*  He's so free. [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8339.34s)]
*  I remember thinking, I want to be able to perform like that. [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8340.54s)]
*  Whatever I do, I want to feel like, what's that zone that he's in? [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8343.5s)]
*  Well, part of that is, a lot of shamanic work involves the breath. [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8347.26s)]
*  So think a singer is rhythmically breathing and rhythmically chanting. [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8353.26s)]
*  So that's one thing that most people would not pick up on. [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8359.02s)]
*  There's a ton of expiration of breath. [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8362.060000000001s)]
*  Like, what's the Wim Hof? [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8365.26s)]
*  I do that for two hours. [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8368.54s)]
*  I mean, I'm totally asphyxiated the entire time. [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8370.86s)]
*  It's not natural to scream your head off for two hours. [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8373.980000000001s)]
*  It just isn't. [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8377.1s)]
*  Do you have to get in shape to do it? [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8378.060000000001s)]
*  Do you have to get your lungs in shape? [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8379.42s)]
*  I do. [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8380.78s)]
*  I do to a certain extent, yeah. [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8381.18s)]
*  Do you build up to like a concert performance? [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8382.460000000001s)]
*  You have to to a certain extent. [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8384.86s)]
*  I don't know how to explain it. [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8386.460000000001s)]
*  Like, I'm off cycle right now. [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8390.86s)]
*  So if you came to see me play an hour and a half show tomorrow, I could do it, [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8392.460000000001s)]
*  but I probably couldn't talk the next day. [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8395.900000000001s)]
*  But if I do a week of rehearsals and prep up, then I can do it. [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8397.58s)]
*  So it's like a muscle. [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8401.82s)]
*  Like something, yeah. [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8403.26s)]
*  I don't understand. [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8404.46s)]
*  I don't understand it. [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8405.5s)]
*  It's almost like a trained fury. [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8407.26s)]
*  Like you learn to not go too far. [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8409.9s)]
*  People say you blow your voice out. [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8413.66s)]
*  You have to really know where the line is. [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8415.42s)]
*  By the way, when you're dealing with a ton of adrenaline, [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8417.82s)]
*  like the thing with fighters comes to mind. [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8421.5s)]
*  Like they'll come in, they'll gas in a minute because they're so jacked. [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8423.42s)]
*  Sometimes you see a guy getting rain, they're just like, [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8427.82s)]
*  and they gas in a minute. [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8431.42s)]
*  I know how to see that because of watching wrestlers gas. [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8433.34s)]
*  You learn the body language of somebody getting gas. [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8437.02s)]
*  They kind of start to lose their posture and get a little goosey. [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8439.66s)]
*  They get loose. [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8442.7s)]
*  Okay, same thing for a singer. [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8443.5s)]
*  I mean, you can gas in the first three minutes and you're dead. [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8445.1s)]
*  Oh no. [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8448.86s)]
*  What are you going to do? [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8449.26s)]
*  So you have to almost like have a controlled fury. [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8450.7s)]
*  Like imagine screaming at the top of your lungs, [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8454.06s)]
*  but not totally at the top of your lungs. [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8456.14s)]
*  Right. [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8458.300000000001s)]
*  87%. [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8459.34s)]
*  Like there's the magical line. [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8460.380000000001s)]
*  Well, that's what fighting is the same kind of thing. [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8461.9s)]
*  You don't go 100%. [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8463.9s)]
*  Or the zen of that. [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8464.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8466.220000000001s)]
*  Some of the best fighters, they'll punch like 50, 60%. [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8466.54s)]
*  And that way they could put volume on you. [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8470.7s)]
*  I can't imagine being in there and somebody's on the other side wanting to kill you [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8472.7s)]
*  and being able to be like, I'm going to just going to work my way through these. [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8476.300000000001s)]
*  Well, you have to have serious experience to be able to manage the storm that way. [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8480.06s)]
*  Did you ever have to take vocal lessons to learn how to not blow your throat out? [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8484.7s)]
*  I did. [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8488.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8488.54s)]
*  I work with a lady. [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8488.86s)]
*  It's a funny story. [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8490.62s)]
*  I worked with a lady at one point. [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8491.42s)]
*  They hooked me up with somebody from the opera. [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8492.78s)]
*  Oh, perfect. [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8494.94s)]
*  And she came to my house. [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8495.66s)]
*  Well, no, it's actually she was great, but she came to my house and she said, [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8496.54s)]
*  oh, you sing totally wrong. [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8500.460000000001s)]
*  But here's how to sing right and you won't blow your voice out. [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8502.7s)]
*  And it was all about the right posture and all this stuff. [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8505.9s)]
*  And the first time I tried to do it a concert with four thousand kids going nuts, [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8508.06s)]
*  I tried to do what she taught me and it didn't work because I just I was in the deep end of the [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8512.3s)]
*  pool and I ended up having to go back to all my old bad habits. [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8516.46s)]
*  So eventually I found a woman who was used to working with rock singers and she explained [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8519.58s)]
*  to me a bunch of theories about I think her memory. [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8523.019999999999s)]
*  I think she said the human body has eleven folds of tissue in the throat. [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8526.3s)]
*  And if rock singers don't warm up all that tissue, that's how they damage their singing. [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8531.1s)]
*  And she had and she'd also worked with Steven Tyler. [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8535.5s)]
*  She said the thing about rock singers is you guys sing wrong because that's the way you want to sound. [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8538.06s)]
*  It's part of your gimmick. [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8544.859999999999s)]
*  You know, right. [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8547.1s)]
*  I'm sure Steven Tyler and myself, we could sing like choir boys if we wanted to, [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8548.46s)]
*  but that's not what attracts people to us. [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8552.779999999999s)]
*  It's the razor's edge in the voice or something. [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8554.46s)]
*  So you have to learn how to warm up to sing like an idiot, basically. [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8557.1s)]
*  And that's the sound that people are attracted to with rock singers. [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8561.98s)]
*  And even the gentleman you played before, [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8564.779999999999s)]
*  he's totally abusing his voice. [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8566.7s)]
*  That is not proper singing. [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8568.140000000001s)]
*  Right, right, right, right, right. [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8569.660000000002s)]
*  And there's physical techniques to create that sound. [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8570.94s)]
*  Like there's Axl Rose, for example, like, you know, he sings a very particular way, [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8575.18s)]
*  the way he uses his throat in a particular way that makes it. [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8582.86s)]
*  You could say that's the Axl sound or whatever. [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8585.740000000002s)]
*  It's not natural, but it's awesome when he does it. [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8588.300000000001s)]
*  It's kind of the thing. [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8590.86s)]
*  Yeah, that has got to be really hard to maintain. [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8592.300000000001s)]
*  I saw them play in Athens, Greece, and they did a three hour show two years ago. [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8595.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8602.3s)]
*  At like, how old is he? 60, 60 something? [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8602.94s)]
*  I think Axl is about seven years older than me. [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8605.34s)]
*  So yeah, because I remember Welcome to the Jungle was huge when I was in high school [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8607.26s)]
*  or just out of high school. [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8612.3s)]
*  89, 88, 89. [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8613.42s)]
*  Was it? [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8616.54s)]
*  Okay, so I graduated 85. [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8616.94s)]
*  So it was like a couple years after high school. [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8619.18s)]
*  Welcome to the Jungle. [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8620.94s)]
*  I was like, oh my God. [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8621.82s)]
*  This song, like I remember watching the music video. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8623.18s)]
*  Remember when he had that teased up hair back then? [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8627.02s)]
*  Yeah, the big hair, yeah. [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8629.02s)]
*  Yeah, the huge hair. [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8629.74s)]
*  That was the poison hair era. [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8631.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8633.02s)]
*  Yeah, so singing like that is, it's wrong, but that's what makes it right. [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8634.94s)]
*  Right. [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8639.980000000001s)]
*  Well, you can't say what's wrong or what's right. [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8640.62s)]
*  It's just like what's sustainable. [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8642.62s)]
*  Trust me, no one can tell you. [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8643.74s)]
*  You're surrounded by a lot of people with a lot of opinions. [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8646.060000000001s)]
*  I was told when I was very young, [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8649.02s)]
*  that voice you sing with will never sell records, ever. [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8651.02s)]
*  And most people that don't like my music will often cite my voice [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8654.78s)]
*  as the reason they don't like my music. [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8657.9s)]
*  But that's the way that my voice is the reason that people who do like my music, [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8660.300000000001s)]
*  like my music. [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8664.54s)]
*  Right. [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8665.34s)]
*  It's a weird, it's like a, like what do you do with that? [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8665.82s)]
*  Well, you can't do it for other people. [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8669.1s)]
*  No, no, but I'm saying I sing the way I sing and it's like, it's like don't sing that way. [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8671.5s)]
*  Well, I don't. [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8675.74s)]
*  That's the whole idea of like you can't do it for other people. [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8677.66s)]
*  You can't do it for them. [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8680.14s)]
*  You can't do it the way they want it to. [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8681.5s)]
*  No, there's going to be people who like it the way you want. [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8683.34s)]
*  You like it. [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8685.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8686.38s)]
*  You just have to find out what that thing is. [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8686.779999999999s)]
*  And you have to fit like you have to what whatever your internal compass is that guides you [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8689.099999999999s)]
*  towards this particular style, this particular way of expressing yourself. [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8694.06s)]
*  It has to be authentic. [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8697.98s)]
*  Well, singing against a wall of guitars is a particular skill set. [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8698.939999999999s)]
*  It's like singing against three airline jets at the same time. [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8704.46s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8707.82s)]
*  We have three guitars in our band playing at the same time. [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8709.42s)]
*  So my voice has to cut like a razor through that wall of noise. [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8712.220000000001s)]
*  Voices are there. [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8719.42s)]
*  Some voices are so fucking compelling. [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8721.66s)]
*  Like you listen to them like Amy Winehouse. [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8724.140000000001s)]
*  Perfect. [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8726.060000000001s)]
*  You hear her sing once and you just like, whoa, there's something about it. [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8726.78s)]
*  OK, so back to my argument about the unconscious thing. [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8732.140000000001s)]
*  Certain voices convey an unconscious information. [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8734.54s)]
*  Tonally, it registers in the public as a certain authority or wisdom or sorrow. [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8739.099999999999s)]
*  Some voices just have so much sorrow in them. [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8746.859999999999s)]
*  Like for our generation, when Kurt would sing and I saw Kurt many times live, [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8750.779999999999s)]
*  it sounded like it was like the literal howl of our generation. [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8756.06s)]
*  It had this great connectivity to what we were experiencing as latchkey kids. [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8760.06s)]
*  Yes. [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8765.18s)]
*  I don't want to say tantrumish, but it had a certain kind of anger, [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8767.42s)]
*  but it was the anger of disaffection. [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8771.5s)]
*  It wasn't the anger of a hardcore band like Screw Capitalism. [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8773.74s)]
*  It had a sorrow somehow in it. [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8780.220000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8782.7s)]
*  And authenticity. [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8785.02s)]
*  Like Kurt was the master of authenticity. [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8786.78s)]
*  He killed hair bands. [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8790.300000000001s)]
*  He really did. [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8792.86s)]
*  He killed hair bands. [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8794.06s)]
*  I remember when I was a kid, Nevermind came out and I was with a couple of friends of mine [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8795.34s)]
*  and this guy goes, have you seen this? [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8801.5s)]
*  And he shows me this fucking cassette with a baby on the cover. [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8803.74s)]
*  I go, what is it? [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8806.939999999999s)]
*  He's like, this is Nirvana. [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8808.06s)]
*  And he plays to me Nirvana for the first time over his house. [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8809.98s)]
*  I was like, holy shit. [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8812.46s)]
*  Like this is crazy. [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8814.539999999999s)]
*  For our generation, it was the door getting kicked open. [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8817.82s)]
*  Yes. [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8821.66s)]
*  Everything after just got easier. [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8822.14s)]
*  That's the thing. [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8824.06s)]
*  These unique artists that come along and transform the medium. [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8824.699999999999s)]
*  Like I said, Lenny Bruce, Pryor, then Kinnison. [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8828.699999999999s)]
*  There's a few examples of that in music where someone comes along like Hendrix or Kurt [[02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8831.82s)]
*  or even Elvis. [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8837.02s)]
*  Someone comes along and everybody's like, what the fuck is going on? [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8838.06s)]
*  The Beatles. [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8841.1s)]
*  What is happening? [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8842.14s)]
*  This is crazy. [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8843.1s)]
*  What strikes me, and this is a business point, but that's where all the money is. [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8844.779999999999s)]
*  And yet the music business is not to nurture those talents. [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8850.14s)]
*  In fact, the music business works against those talents. [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8853.82s)]
*  It's almost like they blow up their business model so it becomes inconvenient. [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8856.46s)]
*  Well, what do you think the music business nurtures? [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8860.779999999999s)]
*  Control. [[02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8863.66s)]
*  They want control. [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8865.26s)]
*  The biggest problem I've seen in the music business is they don't understand why [[02:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8868.06s)]
*  musicians can't be as supple in the business part of the equation as a guy who makes cookies [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8872.38s)]
*  or something. [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8877.74s)]
*  Like this is what it costs. [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8878.699999999999s)]
*  Here's your quality control. [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8880.46s)]
*  The public wants more chocolate chips. [[02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8882.3s)]
*  Can't you just put more chocolate chips in there? [[02:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8884.06s)]
*  None of that is what attracts the public to great artists. [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8887.5s)]
*  It's like completely counterintuitive. [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8891.98s)]
*  So they sit there and you just end up as a name on a piece of paper or an inconvenient [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8894.779999999999s)]
*  problem. [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8899.099999999999s)]
*  I've said this a few times publicly, but it bears repeating here is I've been in [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8901.66s)]
*  meetings where they're complaining to me about me. [[02:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8905.58s)]
*  Like how so? [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8909.02s)]
*  Like what do they say? [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8912.380000000001s)]
*  That basically the person that I am in the world is inconvenient to their business. [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8913.26s)]
*  The things I'm saying, the things I'm doing, the music I'm making is inconvenient to the [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8917.82s)]
*  business. [[02:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8921.34s)]
*  And could I temper those things more in the direction that they want? [[02:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8921.9s)]
*  What particularly were they talking about? [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8925.34s)]
*  It doesn't, you name it. [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8927.1s)]
*  Like give me one example. [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8928.380000000001s)]
*  It could be anything from you're too negative to your songs are too weird to your [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8931.02s)]
*  voice is too weird to your guitars are too loud. [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8936.94s)]
*  They just want to sell more. [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8939.42s)]
*  So to them, it's an intellectual thing. [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8941.34s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8944.140000000001s)]
*  Be like, Joe, if you could just make more jokes about the economy, you'd sell two stadiums, [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8944.78s)]
*  not just one. [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8950.94s)]
*  This is what happened with Dave Chappelle while he left the Chappelle show. [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8952.060000000001s)]
*  Same exact kind of thing. [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8955.02s)]
*  You know, a different version of it. [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8957.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8961.1s)]
*  So it's this weird thing where you're sitting there and then you're like, [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8961.34s)]
*  and what I always try to tell them is I didn't get here with that type of thinking. [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8964.38s)]
*  And I do think, and I don't want to name names, but you can, I would say this to your [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8971.02s)]
*  great audience, you can pretty much tell who got to the dance on their own. [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8975.74s)]
*  And somewhere along the way between the second and the fourth album decided [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8980.46s)]
*  that the compromise had a bigger yield. [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8984.14s)]
*  And off goes the organic switch and on goes the, oh, you want me to be [[02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8988.38s)]
*  the next door neighbor or, you know, romantic movie ballads, whatever. [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=8993.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9000.62s)]
*  Aerosmith went through that for a while. [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9001.1s)]
*  But to their credit, I didn't understand at the time, it was a brilliant move because [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9003.02s)]
*  they'd gone about as far as they could go. [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9007.58s)]
*  And the one thing and they're super influential and including on alternative music. [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9009.34s)]
*  And it ended up being a really smart watershed moment for them to do what they did. [[02:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9014.3s)]
*  At the time they were doing SNL skits. [[02:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9018.22s)]
*  You remember Adam Sadler used to come out and he would do that. [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9019.82s)]
*  I think it was Adam Sadler, we could do like the seven Aerosmith ballads in a row. [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9023.019999999999s)]
*  And it was like, I'm crying. [[02:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9027.019999999999s)]
*  I'm really crying. [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9028.22s)]
*  They would just play and he'd just sing all those songs like Steven Tyler. [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9030.38s)]
*  But I think looking back, it was really smart what they did. [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9034.619999999999s)]
*  Well, also maybe they're allowed to do whatever they want to do. [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9038.3s)]
*  Like artists change their whole thing. [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9042.06s)]
*  Like they went from Mama Kin to some of those ballads. [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9044.46s)]
*  As far as I know. [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9050.14s)]
*  Same band. [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9050.859999999999s)]
*  And your Hearst Stute assistant over there would probably check. [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9051.42s)]
*  But I think Aerosmith is the biggest selling American rock band of all time. [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9056.06s)]
*  Whoa. [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9059.5s)]
*  So if you're Aerosmith, did they make a wrong turn? [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9060.54s)]
*  My argument would be no. [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9063.66s)]
*  No, it's not a wrong turn. [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9064.78s)]
*  I mean, obviously you're allowed to change what you're interested in too. [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9066.62s)]
*  There's a lot of bands that sort of reinvent themselves with almost every album. [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9071.66s)]
*  Like my friend Sturgill Simpson. [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9076.78s)]
*  He sort of reinvents himself with every album. [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9078.54s)]
*  Every album's different. [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9081.02s)]
*  He just gets bored with stuff. [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9082.86s)]
*  Aerosmith, the best selling American hard rock band of all time, [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9084.78s)]
*  having sold more than 150 million records worldwide, [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9087.66s)]
*  including over 85 million records in the United States. [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9091.9s)]
*  So yeah. [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9097.42s)]
*  That's pretty good. [[02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9098.220000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9099.18s)]
*  So that's what I'm saying is only the bands can really know what the right direction to go in is. [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9099.66s)]
*  Because at some point, what seems so obvious to the audience or some guy in an office [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9105.1s)]
*  isn't necessarily what drives the band forward. [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9109.82s)]
*  Well, then there's weird cases like David Lee Roth leaves Van Halen, [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9111.98s)]
*  Sammy Hagar takes over, and it becomes- [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9116.86s)]
*  They got bigger. [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9119.74s)]
*  Bigger in a totally different way. [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9120.38s)]
*  But if you talk to the average Van Halen fan, they want to hear the David Lee Roth Van Halen. [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9123.02s)]
*  Well, especially if you grew up with that. [[02:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9128.3s)]
*  The thing is, like what you started out with is always what you want to see. [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9130.14s)]
*  Right. But I'm saying there's no obvious argument of which is superior. [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9133.58s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9137.66s)]
*  No, there's no superior. [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9138.22s)]
*  Once so more records, one is sort of held more in people's hearts because of a particular [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9138.7s)]
*  generational thing, which would be our generation. [[02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9143.42s)]
*  But some people love the Sammy Hagar version better. [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9145.900000000001s)]
*  It's okay. [[02:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9149.820000000002s)]
*  You're allowed to. [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9150.54s)]
*  Taylor Swift sells a lot of fucking tickets. [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9151.740000000002s)]
*  If you're not into it, it doesn't mean it's wrong. [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9155.42s)]
*  Everybody has a weird- the way they interface with the world, and some things get in there [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9158.94s)]
*  and really lock on you and like, wow, this is amazing. [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9165.1s)]
*  You could take the same concert and another person that you like goes to it. [[02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9168.939999999999s)]
*  They say, this sucks. [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9174.619999999999s)]
*  And you're like, this is fucking amazing. [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9175.9s)]
*  How can you say this sucks? [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9177.9s)]
*  Well, I think you're about to see that Nickelback and Creed are about to go on a huge run of [[02:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9178.939999999999s)]
*  business. [[02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9183.019999999999s)]
*  Really? [[02:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9184.06s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9184.38s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9185.179999999998s)]
*  Nickelback took a lot of shit. [[02:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9186.939999999999s)]
*  That's kind of my point is they've survived it. [[02:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9188.699999999999s)]
*  And now here comes the inevitable moment of like, oh, yeah, it was really good. [[02:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9192.22s)]
*  And they wrote a lot of great songs. [[02:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9197.66s)]
*  They had some fucking great songs. [[02:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9198.7s)]
*  That rock star song, that's a great song. [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9200.3s)]
*  But it was one of those weird things where they had become like a punchline. [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9203.74s)]
*  And for whatever reason, everybody thought that it was okay to shit on Nickelback and [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9207.58s)]
*  comics would shit on them. [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9211.02s)]
*  And it was like a thing that people would mock the success of Nickelback. [[02:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9212.06s)]
*  Meanwhile, they're selling out arenas every fucking night of the week. [[02:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9217.1s)]
*  So yeah, I think history has a way of sorting out the bodies is the way I look at it. [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9221.18s)]
*  That's kind of how I feel. [[02:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9226.3s)]
*  I mean, this is selfish for me to say this, but this is kind of how I feel about my musical [[02:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9227.1s)]
*  life. [[02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9230.460000000001s)]
*  I think time will tell my story much better than I did. [[02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9230.7s)]
*  You will you seem at peace with that. [[02:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9235.5s)]
*  I am. [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9236.86s)]
*  It doesn't seem to bother you at all. [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9237.58s)]
*  I made my peace with it. [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9239.1s)]
*  I mean, it bothered me when it bothered me because it felt unfair or yeah, it felt like [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9240.140000000001s)]
*  I was being sort of made to pay for the sins of the people who are no longer here. [[02:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9245.98s)]
*  Because in particularly in Gen X, we've had so many great talents die. [[02:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9249.98s)]
*  Oh, so you felt like you weren't getting the credit you deserve because you survived? [[02:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9253.42s)]
*  There was part of that. [[02:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9259.98s)]
*  That's this let's call it the simpler version. [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9261.82s)]
*  The more complicated version is generations move with a collective energy. [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9263.82s)]
*  And by the mid 2000s, the collective energy of Generation X had mostly dissipated in the [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9270.54s)]
*  musical thing. [[02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9277.18s)]
*  There were bands out playing, but a lot of the lead singers had died. [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9278.06s)]
*  So it's hard to sort of stand and carry a flag for something that people feel very [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9281.82s)]
*  sentimental about if there isn't an army around you carrying the same flag. [[02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9286.54s)]
*  So you start to people start to put on you this like a set of cultural and generational [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9291.18s)]
*  expectations that you don't want. [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9296.380000000001s)]
*  You become you become the emblem of like the living version of what does it work. [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9299.58s)]
*  But the other guys or girls aren't there to grow old with you and achieve, you know, [[02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9303.58s)]
*  receive the same discernment or criticism. [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9311.42s)]
*  Like one time a guy tried to goad me into an argument of comparing myself to one of [[02:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9316.78s)]
*  the top people in musical people in my generation. [[02:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9320.46s)]
*  I don't want to say who, but you understand the flow on this. [[02:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9323.18s)]
*  So and they and they and they said, can you compare, you know, like who do you [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9326.22s)]
*  think's better? [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9330.22s)]
*  So it was like a real cheese setup. [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9330.78s)]
*  And I said, I said, well, I think they were more talented. [[02:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9333.019999999999s)]
*  And they said, but I said, I feel I'm in the conversation. [[02:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9337.259999999998s)]
*  And they said, why are you in the conversation? [[02:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9340.539999999999s)]
*  I said, because I'm alive. [[02:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9342.06s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[02:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9346.14s)]
*  Yeah, I'm here. [[02:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9347.179999999998s)]
*  Well, it's also like you can't deny that Smashing Pumpkins didn't have some fucking [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9349.099999999999s)]
*  bangers like anybody who denies that. [[02:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9353.019999999999s)]
*  Well, Joe, that's a that's a whole other episode because the band is probably one of [[02:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9357.179999999998s)]
*  the most misunderstood. [[02:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9361.34s)]
*  I mean, they're probably one. [[02:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9364.06s)]
*  We're probably one of the most misunderstood bands in the history of rock and roll. [[02:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9364.94s)]
*  I mean, that's sounds like a resting statement, but it's fairly accurate. [[02:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9367.58s)]
*  What do you think that's from? [[02:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9372.54s)]
*  I think it has a lot to do with the issues of Gen X and it has a lot to do with a [[02:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9374.7s)]
*  relationship that I set into motion with the media when I was a very young person [[02:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9379.98s)]
*  playing kind of a funny game, like doing my own my own version of Andy Kaufman or [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9383.66s)]
*  Bob Zamuda. [[02:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9388.94s)]
*  You understand? [[02:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9389.66s)]
*  Uh huh. [[02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9390.460000000001s)]
*  Because I thought it was all shitty. [[02:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9391.1s)]
*  So I was just like, I'm just going to play with this like a toy because I think it's [[02:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9393.58s)]
*  kind of funny. [[02:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9396.7s)]
*  I didn't realize that the coming culture was going to kind of almost be attracted to [[02:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9397.66s)]
*  people who are willing to emulate themselves on the public stage. [[02:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9401.74s)]
*  Does that make sense? [[02:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9406.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9406.86s)]
*  Most people who are attracted to fame, they want to run towards the shiny part of it. [[02:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9407.58s)]
*  Right. [[02:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9412.54s)]
*  I was attracted to the non-shiny part, which is, okay, I'll light myself on fire. [[02:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9412.86s)]
*  Let's see what happens. [[02:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9416.78s)]
*  Or I'll light you on fire and let's see what happens. [[02:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9418.06s)]
*  So it kind of worked in the nineties when everybody was rolling and moving along. [[02:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9420.859999999999s)]
*  Well, here comes Napster, the music business, craters. [[02:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9424.38s)]
*  Then a bunch of people die. [[02:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9428.859999999999s)]
*  And there you are standing, you know, now at 40 years old, you're supposed to carry [[02:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9430.779999999999s)]
*  some flag for a generation that doesn't even know who it is anymore. [[02:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9434.699999999999s)]
*  How do you navigate that? [[02:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9440.38s)]
*  Like, does that, did that trouble you at the time? [[02:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9441.42s)]
*  Was it difficult to work as an artist? [[02:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9444.539999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's very difficult. [[02:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9446.939999999999s)]
*  The simple version is, and I had some of the top, top people in the music business, [[02:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9448.779999999999s)]
*  sit me down one on one in a room and say, just give them what they want. [[02:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9453.1s)]
*  Jesus. [[02:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9456.699999999999s)]
*  Your life will be a lot better. [[02:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9458.3s)]
*  You'll make a lot more money and you could put your head on your pillow at night and [[02:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9459.5s)]
*  I'd have to think about all these things. [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9463.1s)]
*  And my response every time was that I don't give a fuck. [[02:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9464.619999999999s)]
*  And I used to quote Popeye, I am what I am. [[02:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9468.38s)]
*  I'm here. [[02:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9473.74s)]
*  I'm here because I'm a freak. [[02:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9474.699999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[02:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9477.82s)]
*  And I ain't changing for anything. [[02:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9478.22s)]
*  Good for you. [[02:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9480.38s)]
*  And part of that goes back to my daddy. [[02:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9481.18s)]
*  Okay. [[02:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9484.22s)]
*  I watched a man literally broken by the business. [[02:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9484.539999999999s)]
*  So I'm the last person who's going to fucking bow down for that shit. [[02:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9488.619999999999s)]
*  Fuck off. [[02:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9492.539999999999s)]
*  Well, the beautiful thing is too, you always had an audience. [[02:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9493.1s)]
*  So you didn't have to. [[02:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9495.58s)]
*  Well, there is that. [[02:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9497.18s)]
*  But, but, but at the end of the day, how can I explain it? [[02:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9498.3s)]
*  Everybody in the music business will tell you your value is, is, [[02:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9502.779999999999s)]
*  is exponentially related to your success. [[02:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9505.42s)]
*  So your biggest song is here and your next biggest song is here. [[02:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9508.3s)]
*  And there's like a pyramid. [[02:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9510.94s)]
*  And as you go down, you lose value. [[02:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9512.14s)]
*  Your aging becomes part of that loss of value. [[02:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9515.18s)]
*  How do you maintain value relevancy? [[02:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9517.5s)]
*  You no longer have the record business that used to exist. [[02:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9520.06s)]
*  You no longer have the structure. [[02:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9522.22s)]
*  I mean, the music business is basically a touring business first now. [[02:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9523.34s)]
*  And everything else is in support of the touring business. [[02:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9526.619999999999s)]
*  We're lucky in that we continue to be a very large touring band. [[02:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9528.38s)]
*  So you're told over and over again, almost in a, in a, in a [[02:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9532.539999999999s)]
*  propagandistic way that your value is related to what's on a piece of paper. [[02:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9535.34s)]
*  And then somehow I woke up in the middle of it and I thought, no, no, that's, [[02:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9540.380000000001s)]
*  that's actually not my value. [[02:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9543.1s)]
*  And so the minute I started saying, no, I know what my real value is. [[02:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9545.34s)]
*  It's that I'm an independent artist who like a voice in the wilderness represents something. [[02:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9548.3s)]
*  And I know it's not for everybody. [[02:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9553.02s)]
*  Trust me. [[02:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9554.460000000001s)]
*  I've got been getting that message since I was a little kid, including from my own family. [[02:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9554.86s)]
*  But I know what I represent represents something that's valuable. [[02:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9559.98s)]
*  I can't quite put my finger on it, but I see the consistency of the kind of, [[02:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9563.82s)]
*  let's call it the communication between myself and somebody who's interested in what I do. [[02:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9567.18s)]
*  And once I started doubling and tripling down the value, my business started going back up. [[02:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9571.82s)]
*  Wow. [[02:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9576.22s)]
*  The way I would say it in a crass way is I reasserted my brand, [[02:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9577.5s)]
*  not the brand I was being handed in 40 plus brand. [[02:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9581.9s)]
*  You know, you're an oldies band, you're an oldies artist. [[02:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9586.38s)]
*  You play these songs. [[02:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9588.619999999999s)]
*  Well, you just kept and reinforced your true voice. [[02:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9590.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9594.539999999999s)]
*  But I had to live it. [[02:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9595.66s)]
*  Which brought you to the dance in the first place. [[02:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9596.94s)]
*  It seems silly, but that's what I had to figure out. [[02:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9599.34s)]
*  I had to figure that out on my own because there was nobody telling me that. [[02:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9601.5s)]
*  I mean, you got to understand. [[02:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9604.94s)]
*  And you're a man of the world. [[02:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9606.86s)]
*  So you know what I'm saying? [[02:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9608.46s)]
*  When you're in a room with somebody who runs the fucking world, [[02:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9609.5s)]
*  in my case runs the music business, the guy who can get shit done, [[02:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9613.02s)]
*  the guy who can get you canceled, the guy who can fucking make stuff happen. [[02:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9617.26s)]
*  And that guy tells you, here's your value. [[02:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9621.1s)]
*  It's awfully hard to go back to Chicago, Illinois and convince yourself that he's wrong. [[02:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9623.66s)]
*  Right. [[02:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9627.66s)]
*  Right. [[02:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9629.5s)]
*  There's nobody. [[02:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9629.74s)]
*  And who do you talk to about it? [[02:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9630.38s)]
*  Especially if fame is fleeting. [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9631.58s)]
*  It comes and goes. [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9633.82s)]
*  Album sales come and go. [[02:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9635.02s)]
*  And there's a new big thing right now. [[02:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9636.78s)]
*  There's the new thing. [[02:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9639.5s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9640.38s)]
*  You're not the new thing anymore. [[02:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9640.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9642.3s)]
*  And then someone's coming along. [[02:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9642.7s)]
*  Listen. [[02:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9643.74s)]
*  You've got to listen to us. [[02:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9644.539999999999s)]
*  We know how you can be back on top. [[02:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9646.3s)]
*  I don't read comments, but I have a social media person [[02:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9647.9s)]
*  who occasionally relays what she sees. [[02:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9650.14s)]
*  Oh boy. [[02:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9652.22s)]
*  Well, we kind of keep it on the positive, but my favorite comment of the last few years was [[02:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9653.74s)]
*  she started poking around with young fans, 16, 18 year olds, who were suddenly seeming to come out [[02:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9658.38s)]
*  of the woodwork and liking the band and me. [[02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9663.74s)]
*  Almost like a cuddly bear or something. [[02:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9666.78s)]
*  They suddenly were attracted to me in a way that the 16, 18 year olds of the previous generation [[02:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9668.46s)]
*  weren't. [[02:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9673.34s)]
*  So I asked her, I said, why don't you poke around with these people and ask them what's interesting? [[02:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9674.619999999999s)]
*  And my favorite comment, and it became kind of common amongst the feedback that she got was, [[02:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9678.539999999999s)]
*  I like him because other people told me not to like him. [[02:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9682.7s)]
*  But what that says to me, anybody can interpret the way they want, what it said to me is, [[02:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9689.58s)]
*  we need people in the zeitgeist of the culture who don't represent the collective yes. [[02:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9694.7s)]
*  There's always room for somebody on the corner saying no. [[02:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9701.740000000002s)]
*  And that goes back to Lenny Bruce. [[02:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9705.26s)]
*  As crazy as all that was, you still need that guy going, no, no, no, no, no. [[02:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9707.820000000002s)]
*  And you can call them whatever disruptors or whatever. [[02:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9713.58s)]
*  Well, authentic voices. [[02:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9715.740000000002s)]
*  That sounds nicer than disruptor. [[02:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9718.060000000001s)]
*  I like disruptor because that's what I do. [[02:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9719.34s)]
*  Well, it does disrupt, but it disrupts because it's an authentic voice, [[02:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9721.980000000001s)]
*  because it bucks the idea of creating some manufactured thing for the market. [[02:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9726.7s)]
*  I've told many people in the music business, I know that you don't want me in this business, [[02:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9734.86s)]
*  but I'm here. [[02:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9739.02s)]
*  And I've made a lot of money and I've made a lot of people a lot of money. [[02:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9740.619999999999s)]
*  What's the problem? [[02:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9743.58s)]
*  Also, you make great songs. [[02:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9744.38s)]
*  But most people are in the business for the music. [[02:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9747.26s)]
*  But the idea that somebody wouldn't want you in the business when you've been very successful [[02:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9749.26s)]
*  in the business is just insane. [[02:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9755.02s)]
*  It doesn't even make any sense. [[02:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9757.02s)]
*  It doesn't make sense to me. [[02:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9759.5s)]
*  Well, that's the weird thing that you guys have to deal with. [[02:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9760.7s)]
*  You deal with this whole layer of non-artistic people that have influence over art. [[02:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9763.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9770.06s)]
*  Having heard you many times do commentary for UFC, [[02:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9771.26s)]
*  what I love about you as a commentator is you take me into the passion of the moment, [[02:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9775.66s)]
*  the feeling of like two warriors are going to enter this thing and only one can emerge. [[02:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9781.42s)]
*  There's a feeling there that's like, and I've been to some of the events, [[02:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9786.06s)]
*  it's like it has that like, it's sort of a life affirming, like here we are, [[02:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9788.539999999999s)]
*  and you know because you're behind the scenes, the training that went in, [[02:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9793.26s)]
*  the injuries the guy had overcome or the girl or whatever. [[02:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9796.46s)]
*  Or the crazy girlfriend and they got the training camp and all of it and there it is the clash. [[02:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9799.74s)]
*  It's no different for the musician. [[02:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9804.539999999999s)]
*  I sit in a room for a year and make songs with only three, four people hearing them. [[02:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9808.78s)]
*  I have to believe that I'm going to walk into my version of that octagon [[02:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9813.82s)]
*  and what I'm going to offer is not going to get me killed. [[02:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9817.5s)]
*  What is it like when you release an album? [[02:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9819.58s)]
*  What is that feeling like? [[02:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9821.58s)]
*  I want to curl up in a ball and just die because here it comes. [[02:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9823.98s)]
*  Here it comes. [[02:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9828.22s)]
*  And sometimes I'm pleasantly surprised, but I've had more negative experiences than positive ones. [[02:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9829.18s)]
*  But positive from the fans, is it non-fans that are the problem? [[02:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9834.460000000001s)]
*  It's like the people on the outside peering in. [[02:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9841.26s)]
*  20 years ago I would have given you a different answer. [[02:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9843.98s)]
*  Now it's nobody's the problem. [[02:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9845.74s)]
*  It's ultimately the game is you versus yourself. [[02:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9847.58s)]
*  I don't know if there's any commonality in the fighting world or the comedic world. [[02:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9851.34s)]
*  Yes. [[02:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9854.7s)]
*  It's you versus yourself. [[02:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9855.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9856.460000000001s)]
*  It's not the audience's fault. [[02:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9856.62s)]
*  It's not the guy at the radio station or the girl at the arena. [[02:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9858.380000000001s)]
*  It's nothing to do with them because the one thing you do know is if you find that value [[02:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9863.26s)]
*  that makes a wheel turn that prints cash, they don't care who you are. [[02:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9869.660000000002s)]
*  They'll push you right back under the spotlight. [[02:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9875.660000000002s)]
*  So once you can figure that game out, that's the game. [[02:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9879.34s)]
*  The game is you versus you. [[02:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9882.300000000001s)]
*  It's not you versus them. [[02:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9883.58s)]
*  In fact, that's the sucker's game. [[02:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9885.18s)]
*  So it's you just trying to create the best version of what you have inside your head. [[02:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9890.06s)]
*  Let's do a simple math and anybody wants to have a problem with it, I don't care. [[02:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9895.18s)]
*  My band in over 30 years has been in the top 0.1 percentile of touring artists in the world. [[02:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9901.5s)]
*  Period. [[02:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9911.58s)]
*  You would think that if you were in that business and you were at that elite level, [[02:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9916.06s)]
*  you would think the whole business would rally around you and try to get you to do more and [[02:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9921.26s)]
*  make more. [[02:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9925.58s)]
*  Not even close to that. [[02:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9926.46s)]
*  There is no system by which you get that kind of support. [[02:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9929.74s)]
*  You are completely on your own. [[02:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9932.539999999999s)]
*  But is that universal with successful artists? [[02:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9935.42s)]
*  I think so. [[02:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9937.66s)]
*  I hear different stories about the top pop artists, but I think that's because they're [[02:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9939.179999999998s)]
*  making so much money. [[02:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9942.22s)]
*  It's like they're like a multinational corporation. [[02:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9943.179999999998s)]
*  Most bands, their experiences are similar to ours. [[02:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9945.9s)]
*  You're kind of on your own. [[02:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9948.859999999999s)]
*  You have your team of people and then you walk into the arena with what you got, [[02:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9950.06s)]
*  what you think is going to work. [[02:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9954.06s)]
*  But I hear about the modern pop stars. [[02:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9956.38s)]
*  I mean, I hear stuff that sounds like they're running a Fortune 500 company [[02:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9958.06s)]
*  because they are literally printing cash. [[02:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9961.66s)]
*  Also, the percentage that the actual artists get versus what they should be getting. [[02:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9965.02s)]
*  It hurts. [[02:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9970.460000000001s)]
*  It's crazy. [[02:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9971.5s)]
*  It hurts. [[02:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9972.300000000001s)]
*  It's crazy because they do everything. [[02:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9973.02s)]
*  They create the music. [[02:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9976.54s)]
*  They perform the music and yet they're not making the money. [[02:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9978.140000000001s)]
*  People are coming to see them perform the music, yet they're not making the money. [[02:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9982.140000000001s)]
*  There's some bizarre vampires that have attached themselves to the veins. [[02:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9986.78s)]
*  It's changing. [[02:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9991.34s)]
*  I think in the next 20 years, you're going to see a very different music business. [[02:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9992.14s)]
*  In what way? [[02:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9997.42s)]
*  Peer-to-peer ability to create commerce. [[02:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=9998.14s)]
*  Right. [[02:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=10002.38s)]
*  And then also the fact that you could release things. [[02:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=10002.779999999999s)]
*  So like Oliver Anthony, he put out that Rich Men North of Richmond and then it's [[02:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=10005.82s)]
*  fucking gigantic. [[02:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=10010.3s)]
*  100 million views on YouTube. [[02:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=10011.9s)]
*  It's like it's crazy. [[02:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=10014.14s)]
*  But like 20 years ago, your success and who you work with would have been unthinkable. [[02:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=10015.18s)]
*  Right. [[02:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=10021.34s)]
*  And you're an independent voice. [[02:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=10022.38s)]
*  You've built it. [[02:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=10023.74s)]
*  I mean, it's yours. [[02:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=10024.46s)]
*  Right? [[02:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=10026.46s)]
*  So that's what I'm saying. [[02:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=10026.859999999999s)]
*  That's coming for music. [[02:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=10027.58s)]
*  This is coming for music. [[02:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=10029.74s)]
*  Right. [[02:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=10031.5s)]
*  Well, that's good. [[02:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=10031.9s)]
*  Yes. [[02:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=10033.1s)]
*  I think ultimately will benefit the fans of the artist and they'll get more of what [[02:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=10033.42s)]
*  they want and less of what they don't want. [[02:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=10037.1s)]
*  Hear, hear. [[02:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=10040.22s)]
*  All right. [[02:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=10041.66s)]
*  Let's wrap it up. [[02:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=10042.46s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[02:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=10043.58s)]

*  Thank you, Jim. [[02:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=10046.22s)]
*  Tell everybody what your podcasts call, where they can get it. [[02:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=10046.779999999999s)]
*  The Magnificent Others. [[02:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=10050.06s)]
*  You can get it on YouTube or anywhere. [[02:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=10051.9s)]
*  Thanks, sir. [[02:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFt_pIzTrHU&t=10053.9s)]
