# Joe Rogan Experience #2285 - Andrew Schulz
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [March 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day! [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6.0s)]
*  Oprah's doing an episode on psychedelics. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=10.0s)]
*  God bless. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=15.0s)]
*  How about that? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=16.0s)]
*  God bless. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=17.0s)]
*  That means she's definitely done it. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=18.0s)]
*  Yeah, you don't do a fucking... [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=19.0s)]
*  Are we rolling yet? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=21.0s)]
*  Are we rolling? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=23.0s)]
*  Yeah? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=24.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=25.0s)]
*  Yeah, you don't do an episode on psychedelics unless you fucking visited the Maya. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=26.0s)]
*  Unless you dabbled. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=29.0s)]
*  Unless you got in there. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=30.0s)]
*  You think it's ayahuasca or mushrooms? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=31.0s)]
*  Most of those fancy people like to do the ayahuasca. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=33.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=36.0s)]
*  You know, because then you can claim spirituality above all other people. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=37.0s)]
*  Oh, you think there's like a pretentiousness? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=41.0s)]
*  Oh, 100%. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=43.0s)]
*  There's a, I've done it. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=45.0s)]
*  I've done it. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=47.0s)]
*  I've experienced the mother god. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=48.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=50.0s)]
*  The god. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=51.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=52.0s)]
*  I've experienced Gaia. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=53.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=54.0s)]
*  It's like, I think people do really do experience that, but also there's a certain type of [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=56.0s)]
*  personality that wants to let you know that they're enlightened. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=62.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=66.0s)]
*  They're further down the road than you, Andrew. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=67.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=69.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=70.0s)]
*  And like, one way to get like instant street cred in the psychedelics world is to say you [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=71.0s)]
*  do ayahuasca. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=76.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=77.0s)]
*  You know, if you do mushrooms, you might just be some asshole at a party. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=78.0s)]
*  You know, you and your friends are just fucking giggling nonstop on the couch. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=80.0s)]
*  It could be that. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=83.0s)]
*  There's no points in mushrooms. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=84.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=85.0s)]
*  You don't get points for that. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=86.0s)]
*  You can say, you say you took a heroic dose, you'll get points amongst the learned. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=87.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=92.0s)]
*  But the casuals don't give a fuck. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=93.0s)]
*  The casuals don't give a fuck. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=94.0s)]
*  You do ayahuasca, we're going to pay attention a little bit. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=95.0s)]
*  Yeah, the casuals are going to go, why did you eat eight grams? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=97.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=99.0s)]
*  That seems crazy. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=100.0s)]
*  But the other people are going to go, whoa, what was that like? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=101.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=104.0s)]
*  Oh, my Oprah's out here. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=105.0s)]
*  Oprah's out here pushing it. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=106.0s)]
*  I wonder if it's like a... [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=107.0s)]
*  I mean, this is my friend Mark Bell's page, Mark Smelly Bell. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=109.0s)]
*  He said, what fucking year are we living in? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=118.0s)]
*  Like, what is happening here? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=120.0s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=122.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=123.0s)]
*  I wonder if the ayahuasca thing is for some like a quick fix. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=124.0s)]
*  You know, they're looking for like immediate life change. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=128.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, for sure. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=130.0s)]
*  And also, sometimes your life has been such a colossal series of failures [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=132.0s)]
*  that you want like some symbolic reset. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=137.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=141.0s)]
*  And probably there's a lot of value in like a real, like a set and setting like a ritual. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=142.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=149.0s)]
*  Like, I'm a new person. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=150.0s)]
*  At least maybe that bullshit will give you some momentum. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=151.0s)]
*  For real. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=155.0s)]
*  To kind of get on the right track. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=156.0s)]
*  I was talking to Neil about this. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=158.0s)]
*  You know, Brennan, you know, he did it. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=160.0s)]
*  He's done a lot of different things. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=162.0s)]
*  Yeah, because he was trying. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=163.0s)]
*  You know, he was really battling this stuff. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=164.0s)]
*  He needs to get off that vegan diet. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=166.0s)]
*  Yeah, maybe that's it. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=167.0s)]
*  What if it's just chicken is all he needs? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=168.0s)]
*  What if it's a rib eye? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=170.0s)]
*  He's down in Costa Rica licking toads. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=171.0s)]
*  For real. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=174.0s)]
*  If I had that dude over my house and cooked him some elk steak, I'll change his fucking life. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=176.0s)]
*  If you make an agreement, just eat this with me. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=181.0s)]
*  He takes one bite and he's like, I am worthy. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=184.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=187.0s)]
*  But I think he was talking about it and he was, you know, one of his superpowers is his cynicism, right? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=190.0s)]
*  And it's really debilitating. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=197.0s)]
*  And I tell him this all the time, but it's also amazing because he's hyper aware of what the most negative thing could be. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=198.0s)]
*  Right, so for joke writing, it's amazing. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=204.0s)]
*  It's like he's constantly wondering, what would his biggest hater think? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=206.0s)]
*  I actually think it was one of the reasons why Chappelle's show was so successful because it's like, to create things, you need to be super confident. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=209.0s)]
*  You need to not worry about who's going to criticize you. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=217.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=219.0s)]
*  So if you can outsource your criticism, so if Dave can like think about these things and be like, okay, this is awesome. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=220.0s)]
*  And then Neil can be like, yeah, yeah, but this would be said if we do this. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=227.0s)]
*  And then together you have this like perfect combination of like uber confidence and then this insecurity. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=231.0s)]
*  And then you make these things that are just masterpieces. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=237.0s)]
*  And hyper analytical insecurity. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=239.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=241.0s)]
*  You know, like intelligent. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=242.0s)]
*  When you're smart and insecure, it's even worse. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=243.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=245.0s)]
*  When you're dumb and insecure, you can manage. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=246.0s)]
*  But then he said he did the ayahuasca and he was like, he had gave me this like, I don't know, feeling of connectedness or whatever people experience through it. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=248.0s)]
*  And he's like, it was really liberating. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=257.0s)]
*  I think I did my best work afterwards because I wasn't constantly beating myself up. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=259.0s)]
*  Like I was able to create. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=263.0s)]
*  So I think there is value in it. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=265.0s)]
*  But I do think sometimes people are looking for like the quick, okay, my life has changed now and now I connect with the world and we're perfect. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=267.0s)]
*  You can always tell the guys who beat themselves up because they beat other people up too. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=275.0s)]
*  What is it? I hurt people hurt people. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=281.0s)]
*  Yeah, the guys, the guys who beat themselves up, they're always like super critical of other people. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=283.0s)]
*  Look at him. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=286.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=287.0s)]
*  Fucking bullshit. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=288.0s)]
*  Did you ever go through a stage like that? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=289.0s)]
*  Not really. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=290.0s)]
*  Never. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=291.0s)]
*  No, I figured it out when I was 21. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=292.0s)]
*  Real lucky. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=294.0s)]
*  I talked about this the other day. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=295.0s)]
*  There was one time it was an open mic night and the guy went on after me. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=296.0s)]
*  I was hoping that he would bomb. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=300.0s)]
*  And I remember thinking that like what a bitch ass way to think that is. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=301.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=305.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=306.0s)]
*  But there's such a bitch ass way to think. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=307.0s)]
*  And I completely shifted my perspective because like you don't think like that with martial arts. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=308.0s)]
*  Like you can't think like that. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=313.0s)]
*  You know, you can't think like that. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=315.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=316.0s)]
*  You can't think like that ever. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=317.0s)]
*  That's like a weak ass thought. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=318.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=319.0s)]
*  And then I realized like, oh, this is like your brain trying to occupy itself with, you know, this time that's going to be between you and your body. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=320.0s)]
*  Between you and your goal of doing something in comedy. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=330.0s)]
*  And it's so far away. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=334.0s)]
*  You suck. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=335.0s)]
*  You're 21 years old and you suck. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=336.0s)]
*  So everybody else got to suck. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=338.0s)]
*  So you want people to fail and you want to do better. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=339.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=342.0s)]
*  It's like it's just a total scrambly. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=343.0s)]
*  I don't know what I'm doing with my life thought. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=345.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=347.0s)]
*  I realize I was like, oh, that's a bitch ass thought. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=348.0s)]
*  But that is very normal for human beings. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=350.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=352.0s)]
*  I feel like it's. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=353.0s)]
*  There's a lot of bitches out there. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=354.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=355.0s)]
*  We're kind of bitch made in general. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=356.0s)]
*  Like it takes more effort to not be a bitch actually, especially if you have a job. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=357.0s)]
*  So if you have a regular job job, like an office job, you will pretend to be a whole different person for eight hours a fucking day every day of your life that you're there. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=362.0s)]
*  Yeah, that is a lot of time bullshitting. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=372.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=374.0s)]
*  And when you get out all that bullshitting, there's not much you left. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=375.0s)]
*  Whatever could have been you never grew because whatever could have been you was stifled by fluorescent lights and a fucking monitor. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=379.0s)]
*  You're watching Severance, right? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=387.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=388.0s)]
*  I mean, clearly it's a metaphor for there's a lot of things that go on to a lot going on. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=389.0s)]
*  And also, shout out Ben Stiller. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=394.0s)]
*  I didn't even know Ben had this like level to him. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=395.0s)]
*  I've always respected Ben. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=398.0s)]
*  I thought he was hilarious making great comedy movies, but I didn't know he was like an avant-garde storyteller. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=400.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=406.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=407.0s)]
*  I mean, this is the way it's shot. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=408.0s)]
*  It is brilliant. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=409.0s)]
*  The first episode, every shot. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=410.0s)]
*  I don't know who the DP is. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=413.0s)]
*  Like, we should find out who that guy is. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=414.0s)]
*  But every shot has like perfect symmetry. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=415.0s)]
*  Did you notice that? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=417.0s)]
*  I didn't notice. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=418.0s)]
*  You could cut the screen in half every single shot. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=419.0s)]
*  It is is masterpiece. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=422.0s)]
*  And but I think about that like this idea of like severing yourself. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=424.0s)]
*  A lot of people are doing that at work anyway. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=429.0s)]
*  A hundred percent. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=431.0s)]
*  And that's what you were describing. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=432.0s)]
*  They're this other person at work for eight hours a day. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=433.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=435.0s)]
*  They aren't theirself. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=436.0s)]
*  They're like they're self. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=437.0s)]
*  There's a different identity. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=438.0s)]
*  They make up these little terms like, oh, it's my work wife. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=439.0s)]
*  It's like, yeah. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=441.0s)]
*  That's why it's so easy to push like crazy woke nonsense into an office space because [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=442.0s)]
*  people are already bullshitting. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=447.0s)]
*  Oh, so for already pretending here, what else are we going to pretend? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=448.0s)]
*  What else do I have to do to keep this job? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=451.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=453.0s)]
*  What do I have to do to get a promotion? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=454.0s)]
*  What do I have to do? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=455.0s)]
*  Do I have to pretend that trans kids? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=456.0s)]
*  What is it? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=457.0s)]
*  Drab Queen shows? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=458.0s)]
*  OK, I'm in. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=459.0s)]
*  I'm in. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=460.0s)]
*  Healthcare? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=461.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm my dick. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=462.0s)]
*  Whatever you want to call it. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=463.0s)]
*  Gender affirming. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=466.0s)]
*  Was that what we're calling it? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=467.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=468.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=469.0s)]
*  And it's interesting to see how little pushback there is from the workers now that all these [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=470.0s)]
*  programs are being wiped away. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=474.0s)]
*  Well, the people that are losing their job are complaining hard. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=475.0s)]
*  And then the senators are complaining hard. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=478.0s)]
*  But everybody else is happy. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=480.0s)]
*  The people who have been faking it at work that are still working there are not like, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=482.0s)]
*  damn it. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=486.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=487.0s)]
*  They're just going, all right, I get to be a little closer version to myself. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=488.0s)]
*  Well, they're probably going to get fired. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=491.0s)]
*  At Disney? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=493.0s)]
*  You're saying at Disney? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=494.0s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=495.0s)]
*  I'm saying all these programs have come out, maybe not Disney, but Zuckerberg comes out [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=496.0s)]
*  and goes, yeah, Meadow, we're not going to do the DEI shit. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=500.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=502.0s)]
*  I think Amazon even came out and said it. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=503.0s)]
*  I thought you were meaning government jobs were cut by USAID. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=504.0s)]
*  No, I'm talking about corporate jobs, people who have corporate jobs. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=506.0s)]

*  Could be DEI. It could just be anybody working there in general. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=592.0s)]
*  There's a bunch of people that got jobs, and their whole job was to make sure that the company was diverse. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=595.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=602.0s)]
*  And it's like, do you remember the Rainbow Coalition? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=603.0s)]
*  You remember Jesse Jackson back in the day? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=605.0s)]
*  Jesse Jackson used to... [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=608.0s)]
*  I know Jesse, but I would like to know... [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=610.0s)]
*  He had this thing where he would go to businesses, like if they had some sort of a dispute. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=611.0s)]
*  Like say if there was some sort of an issue, like maybe some black executive got fired, maybe shouldn't have, or someone put something on the wall in the bathroom, something. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=616.0s)]
*  Jesse Jackson will come in for a nominal fee. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=626.0s)]
*  For a nominal fee. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=629.0s)]
*  He will come in and straighten your business out. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=631.0s)]
*  What does straighten your business out mean? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=633.0s)]
*  Then, we'll make sure that you guys are on the right track, give a little speech, collect a little check. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=635.0s)]
*  So basically say you're not racist? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=639.0s)]
*  Absolutely. You can't be racist. You're hiring Jesse Jackson, and we're on the right track. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=642.0s)]
*  So he comes along, gives you the rubber stamp. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=646.0s)]
*  Legend. What a legend. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=649.0s)]
*  And he's like balling. Like balling out of control, just giving the rubber stamps to these companies. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=651.0s)]
*  And then on top of that, what they do is then they would have jobs for people to oversee this activity in a large corporation. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=656.0s)]
*  So it's basically like No Show Jobs, the mob used to give out at the Javits Center. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=665.0s)]
*  I had a buddy of mine who had one of those. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=669.0s)]
*  Do people know what the Javits Center is here? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=671.0s)]
*  It's a big convention center in New York City. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=673.0s)]
*  In New York City, this is where like Comic Con would be and all these different things. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=676.0s)]
*  Big stuff. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=678.0s)]
*  And it was mobbed up, right? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=679.0s)]
*  Mobbed up. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=680.0s)]
*  So they would have all these fake jobs that you could give to the guys around the block. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=681.0s)]
*  And everybody's getting paid and is probably supported by the city in some way, right? [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=685.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't want to say his name because he's still around, but he was an actor. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=688.0s)]
*  And I was working with him, and he was explaining he's got a No Show Job. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=693.0s)]
*  Do I know who you're talking about? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=698.0s)]
*  Probably not, but I'll tell you afterwards. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=700.0s)]
*  Fucking great guy. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=702.0s)]
*  But afterwards everybody was like, that guy's like so mobbed up. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=703.0s)]
*  He's got a fucking No Show Job. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=707.0s)]
*  You know what's funny? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=710.0s)]
*  You get like 200 grand a year, you don't even have to work. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=711.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=714.0s)]
*  I mean, there's a lot of construction jobs and stuff. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=715.0s)]
*  This is kind of how things work. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=718.0s)]
*  USAID is finding. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=720.0s)]
*  USAID found this place in San Antonio that they spent billions of dollars on. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=721.0s)]
*  And no one was there. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=726.0s)]
*  Completely empty. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=728.0s)]
*  To me, this is not shocking. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=729.0s)]
*  Bro, the numbers are shocking. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=731.0s)]
*  No, the numbers can get shocking, but it's funny that Jesse Jackson thing is an actual job. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=733.0s)]
*  Because I remember, I had a joke that it could never work out, but the idea was based on, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=737.0s)]
*  it was Black Lives Matter when Ukraine started popping. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=744.0s)]
*  So everybody had the Black Lives Matter posters in their windows in New York. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=750.0s)]
*  And when Black Lives Matter kind of came down. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=755.0s)]
*  Well, it's once those ladies got caught buying houses. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=758.0s)]
*  Of course. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=761.0s)]
*  That put a dent in it. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=762.0s)]
*  It wasn't great. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=763.0s)]
*  So now there's all these white people in New York that have Black Lives Matter in their window, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=764.0s)]
*  but they're like, I got to get this out of my window. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=767.0s)]
*  So I had this idea for a joke where it's like, if I was a black dude, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=769.0s)]
*  I would set up a business where we will take down your Black Lives Matter poster for you [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=772.0s)]
*  and then replace it with like a Ukraine flag. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=776.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=779.0s)]
*  So like, you're still a good person. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=780.0s)]
*  Jesse was doing it in the fucking 70s. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=781.0s)]
*  I had no clue the Rainbow Coalition already worked. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=783.0s)]
*  That is what it's called, right? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=786.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was the Rainbow Coalition. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=788.0s)]
*  He had a bunch of other things he would call it under. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=789.0s)]
*  But the whole idea was to make sure that people weren't doing the wrong thing. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=792.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=796.0s)]
*  Do the right thing. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=797.0s)]
*  You got to do the right thing. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=798.0s)]
*  You got to do the right thing. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=799.0s)]
*  You always got to do the right thing. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=800.0s)]
*  But the problem with that is it gets hijacked. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=801.0s)]
*  Obviously, there should be no racism. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=802.0s)]
*  There should be zero racism. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=804.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=805.0s)]
*  There should be zero discrimination. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=806.0s)]
*  Everything should be merit based. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=807.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=808.0s)]
*  But the problem with that is, and this is a real problem, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=809.0s)]
*  the country is not merit based in terms of like where you're born. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=811.0s)]
*  Like you didn't earn your birth spot. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=815.0s)]
*  You didn't earn your family. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=818.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=819.0s)]
*  You either roll the dice. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=820.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=821.0s)]
*  And you get real lucky or really fucking unlucky. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=822.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=824.0s)]
*  And as a community, as a country, we pay zero attention to the completely downtrodden. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=825.0s)]
*  I think this is the biggest mistake that the Democrat Party has made, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=831.0s)]
*  is not making it a class issue. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=838.0s)]
*  Like the most successful people in the party, like Bernie, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=841.0s)]
*  and you like her politics or not, but like AOC, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=844.0s)]
*  they make it a class issue every single time. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=847.0s)]
*  I think AOC pulled the same as Trump in her district. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=849.0s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=852.0s)]
*  Because people think that she wants to help. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=853.0s)]
*  And Bernie has just been taking shots the entire time. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=855.0s)]
*  He's like, look at all these billionaires. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=857.0s)]
*  They got a lot of money. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=858.0s)]
*  You don't have enough money. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=859.0s)]
*  Campaign finance is fucked up. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=860.0s)]
*  We need to stop that. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=862.0s)]
*  There's too much influence with people with money. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=863.0s)]
*  And it resonates with people. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=864.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, man. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=866.0s)]
*  We feel like you want to help. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=867.0s)]
*  I mean, I feel like you were like a big Bernie dude. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=868.0s)]
*  Dude, that was the first time I really got canceled, was over Bernie, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=870.0s)]
*  because they didn't want Bernie to win. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=874.0s)]
*  And so they started calling me racist and homophobic. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=877.0s)]
*  And I was like, where is this coming from? [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=880.0s)]
*  When Bernie started popping, what did they say? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=882.0s)]
*  Right. They had to, I don't know who they is. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=884.0s)]
*  You could call whoever the fuck they want. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=886.0s)]
*  But like there was this idea that they had to like thwart his success. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=887.0s)]
*  And these articles started coming out where it was like the Bernie bros. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=891.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=895.0s)]
*  Bernie's got a problem. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=896.0s)]
*  His fans or supporters are sexist, they're racist, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=897.0s)]
*  and they're these bros that are fucked up and they're radioactive [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=901.0s)]
*  and they're bad people. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=904.0s)]
*  And he's got a real problem. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=905.0s)]
*  So they're trying to make him radioactive. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=906.0s)]
*  And I remember seeing the reaction to Trump coming on the pods. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=908.0s)]
*  And it was the exact same playbook. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=912.0s)]
*  It was like the Manosphere pods. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=914.0s)]
*  They're sexist, they're racist. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=916.0s)]
*  Look how fucked it is. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=918.0s)]
*  Like you're doing the same thing. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=919.0s)]
*  You're making it about identity politics. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=920.0s)]
*  I think Americans are kind of simple in that like we want abundance, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=922.0s)]
*  but we want access. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=926.0s)]
*  So if eggs are expensive, I can't care about your bathrooms. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=927.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=931.0s)]
*  And you need to tap into that feeling right there. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=932.0s)]
*  So from the Democrats, I'm just this is a class issue. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=935.0s)]
*  But I feel unfortunately a lot of them are in the pockets of these wealthy people. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=938.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=942.0s)]
*  It's all a hustle. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=943.0s)]
*  If we had the entire time, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=945.0s)]
*  if we had brilliant people working for the betterment of the United States, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=948.0s)]
*  it'd be a far better place to live it. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=952.0s)]
*  We've had a bunch of people that are capitalizing off of the fact [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=954.0s)]
*  they get in this position of extreme influence and wealth. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=956.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=959.0s)]
*  And they make insane amounts of money for people with a hundred seventy thousand dollar year salary. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=960.0s)]
*  And they keep it rolling. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=964.0s)]
*  So how do you do that? [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=966.0s)]
*  Like how do you find, okay, how do you find someone who wants power, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=967.0s)]
*  but is also benevolent? [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=972.0s)]
*  Because you got to get rare human beings. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=974.0s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=976.0s)]
*  Most people who want power don't exactly want to give back. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=977.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=980.0s)]
*  It's a bottomless pit. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=981.0s)]
*  Bro, have you ever seen people get like a little bit of power and lose their fucking marbles? [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=982.0s)]
*  Like who? [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=985.0s)]
*  Well, I can't say. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=986.0s)]
*  I can't tell a story. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=987.0s)]
*  It's real obvious what I'm talking about. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=988.0s)]
*  But it's not one of our friends. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=990.0s)]
*  I just don't want to say it publicly. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=992.0s)]
*  It's not, you don't even know. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=993.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=994.0s)]
*  But I've seen people with just like you get a job or you're the boss now [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=995.0s)]
*  and you just become a cunt and a half. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=999.0s)]
*  Like what happened? [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1001.0s)]
*  Do you think it exposes who they always were [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1002.0s)]
*  or do you think it actually changes their character? [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1004.0s)]
*  It's probably both. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1008.0s)]
*  It's probably both. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1010.0s)]
*  They probably had weak character to begin with, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1011.0s)]
*  but they could get away with it if they were not in situations that, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1014.0s)]
*  you know, caused a lot of anxiety or stress. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1019.0s)]
*  But then as soon as they do get in a situation causing like if you're the boss of some workplace somewhere. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1022.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1028.0s)]
*  I've just seen people just completely lose their shit when people rely on them and depend on them. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1029.0s)]
*  They just become tyrants. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1034.0s)]
*  Do you think that they resent the dependence? [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1036.0s)]
*  I don't know what it is, man. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1039.0s)]
*  I don't know what it is. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1041.0s)]
*  You have a lot of people that depend is, yeah, I would say depend is tricky [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1043.0s)]
*  because they have the autonomy to not do that. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1049.0s)]
*  But there are a lot of people that definitely rely on you. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1051.0s)]
*  And yeah, do you feel pressure from that? [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1055.0s)]
*  Me? [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1059.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1060.0s)]
*  No. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1061.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1062.0s)]
*  No. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1063.0s)]
*  I feel like you took care, like before you opened the comedy club, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1064.0s)]
*  you were taking care of these people that you asked to come out here and work for you. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1066.0s)]
*  So you must have felt this concern for them. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1070.0s)]
*  Didn't you hire them? [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1073.0s)]
*  Weren't you paying them even before the club was open? [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1074.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, they were all unemployed out of L.A. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1076.0s)]
*  So I said, listen, we're going to open up a club. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1079.0s)]
*  We're going to find a spot. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1081.0s)]
*  But you could start immediately. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1082.0s)]
*  So you just get paid. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1084.0s)]
*  Enjoy Austin. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1086.0s)]
*  Kick back. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1087.0s)]
*  Relax. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1088.0s)]
*  We'll call you in about a year and a half. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1089.0s)]
*  It was around two years. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1091.0s)]
*  But you felt a responsibility. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1092.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1093.0s)]
*  But it didn't burden me. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1094.0s)]
*  Got it. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1095.0s)]
*  It wasn't like, oh, this is a heavy responsibility. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1096.0s)]
*  It was like, this is smart. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1099.0s)]
*  We could do this. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1100.0s)]
*  This is the right thing to do. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1101.0s)]
*  This way, we already have the best people that, you know, got fired from the comedy store [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1102.0s)]
*  because the comedy store couldn't open because L.A.'s retarded. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1107.0s)]
*  And so we got them all to come out here. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1110.0s)]
*  And it's like, look, the right thing to do is to like pay them now. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1112.0s)]
*  And we'll figure that out. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1115.0s)]
*  We just had to figure out where the spot was. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1117.0s)]
*  And then obviously, once we got the spots, like, this is going to be a long, [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1119.0s)]
*  we're going to have to put some construction on this bitch and do a lot of shit. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1122.0s)]
*  It's going to take some months. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1125.0s)]
*  So you knew it was going to take time. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1126.0s)]
*  You're like, OK, I'm going to take care of them in the interim. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1128.0s)]
*  But again, it's so you're not burdened by people feeling like they rely on you or anything. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1130.0s)]
*  No, it doesn't bother me. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1134.0s)]
*  No. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1135.0s)]
*  If it burdened me, like if it was something where I was worried I was going to run out of money, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1136.0s)]
*  like if I was like stretched real thin, I'd be like, fuck, there's so many people working for me. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1140.0s)]
*  This is a problem. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1145.0s)]
*  I got to like figure something out. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1146.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1148.0s)]
*  But I'm not. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1149.0s)]
*  So it's OK. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1150.0s)]
*  It's just it's like to decide what you think about in this life. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1151.0s)]
*  What do you mean by that? [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1154.0s)]
*  Decide what you think about in this life. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1155.0s)]
*  Are you going to do something that's going to change the way you feel about having a bunch of employees? [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1156.0s)]
*  Or are you not? [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1163.0s)]
*  Are you just going to freak out about it? [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1164.0s)]
*  Like, decide what you think about things. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1166.0s)]
*  What are those two philosophies like a determinism and free will? [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1168.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1172.0s)]
*  Are you a huge free will guy? [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1173.0s)]
*  Do you believe in determinism at all? [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1175.0s)]
*  Will is real. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1177.0s)]
*  OK, I know it's real because it exists in me. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1179.0s)]
*  The idea, though, is that it's fleeting and it's dependent upon a multitude of factors. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1182.0s)]
*  Your will is really dependent upon your hormone levels, your genetics, how much sleep you've had, [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1188.0s)]
*  what positive or negative experiences have shaped you in your life. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1195.0s)]
*  There's a lot going on that that like forces you into this position where you have to decide whether or not will is real. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1198.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1206.0s)]
*  But will is real. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1207.0s)]
*  I believe it's real. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1208.0s)]
*  It's 100 percent real. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1209.0s)]
*  Like, I know it's not determinism that makes David Goggins run harder than anybody else. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1210.0s)]
*  It's will. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1218.0s)]
*  It's 100 percent will. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1220.0s)]
*  His knees are destroyed. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1221.0s)]
*  It's only will that just gets you up off the couch if your knees are destroyed and you run a tidy 30 miles that day. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1223.0s)]
*  That's not determinism. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1230.0s)]
*  That's bullshit. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1233.0s)]
*  If it was determinism, there would be tons of those guys out there. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1235.0s)]
*  There's only a small Cameron Haynes, small little fucking handful of these like psychotic people who have incredible will. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1238.0s)]
*  World champion fighters, you know, Gordon Ryan and Jiu Jitsu. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1247.0s)]
*  Like, Gordon Ryan works out every fucking day of the week, 365 days a year. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1251.0s)]
*  It's a huge sacrifice. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1258.0s)]
*  If you want to be really great at something, you kind of have to be out of your fucking mind. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1259.0s)]
*  But you also have to have an iron will. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1264.0s)]
*  You don't want to work out every day. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1266.0s)]
*  There's going to be days you just want to eat cake and sleep. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1269.0s)]
*  But if you want to get past the guy who eats cake and sleeps, you don't eat cake and you don't sleep. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1272.0s)]
*  That's will, dude. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1278.0s)]
*  That's will. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1280.0s)]
*  Your determinism could suck my dick because it's never, there's no just like accidental amazing people. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1281.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1290.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1291.0s)]
*  It's like, you know, it's like a lot of similar stories. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1292.0s)]
*  You know, single bomb, you know, started doing this and started doing the invented something when he was 18. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1294.0s)]
*  Do they all come from trauma, you think? [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1299.0s)]
*  I think a lot of people that are hyper ambitious come from a shitty environment. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1301.0s)]
*  And what is that connection? [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1304.0s)]
*  I think it's probably wanting something better than you're experiencing and knowing that it's possible that it's out there and knowing the pain of living in the ghetto or the pain of being on food stamps, the pain of poverty. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1306.0s)]
*  And then the fact that like when you're poor and you're young, you wonder whether or not you're going to have food. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1319.0s)]
*  You know, that's a scary thought for a child. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1324.0s)]
*  That's motivating. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1327.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1328.0s)]
*  It puts a kind of fire in you. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1329.0s)]
*  Like you don't get a Mike Tyson if he grows up in Brentwood. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1331.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1335.0s)]
*  You know, you get them when they grow up in Bedford-Stuyvesant. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1336.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1338.0s)]
*  You know, you don't get them when they have an awesome dad and an awesome mom who was there for their baseball games. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1339.0s)]
*  Tells them what a great job they did and consoles them when they get hurt. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1345.0s)]
*  And like, no, no, no. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1348.0s)]
*  You have like a life of pain and then you got some pain to dish out after that. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1349.0s)]
*  I also, but I feel like it's not completely dependent on that. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1354.0s)]
*  You know, like I wouldn't say that I had this like life of pain. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1357.0s)]
*  Like I've dealt with my shit, you know, but I feel incredibly competitive and ambitious. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1360.0s)]
*  Well, you're an artist. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1365.0s)]
*  It's a different thing. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1366.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1367.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1368.0s)]
*  The reason why it's a different thing is you're an artist in a very specific genre, which is talking shit. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1369.0s)]
*  You're a shit talking artist. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1374.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1375.0s)]
*  Like shit talking. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1376.0s)]
*  I'm not distilled to that. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1377.0s)]
*  It is what it is. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1378.0s)]
*  It is what it is. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1379.0s)]
*  It's beautiful. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1380.0s)]
*  It's a professional shit talkers. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1381.0s)]
*  My favorite art form. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1382.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1383.0s)]
*  And shit talking artists, they want to be around a bunch of people and have a good time. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1384.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1389.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1390.0s)]
*  So you don't need to come from trauma to be ambitious and be a shit talking artist. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1391.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1396.0s)]
*  What you need to do is like be someone who admires success and who wants to progress and keep getting better at this thing that they love that has given them so much. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1397.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1407.0s)]
*  You also have to sacrifice and you have to commit to things. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1408.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1411.0s)]
*  You know, I do feel like it takes like I mean, I didn't I mean, in the beginning, like I don't think I celebrated a birthday for like a decade. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1412.0s)]
*  Like I don't think I ever considered like taking a vacation or anything. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1419.0s)]
*  I was just so hungry to get after it, to get good, to be like undeniable. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1423.0s)]
*  That was like this goal. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1427.0s)]
*  Like how can I be undeniable? [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1428.0s)]
*  I would see these guys go up like fucking Greer Barnes or Mike DiStefano and I'd just be like, they're just undeniable. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1429.0s)]
*  And yeah, I don't know. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1438.0s)]
*  I just I didn't even fucking drink. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1440.0s)]
*  I think for like a decade, I was like, I got to get better at this. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1442.0s)]
*  I got to just kind of work. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1444.0s)]
*  And maybe that comes from like watching my parents work hard or something. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1446.0s)]
*  I'm sure that helps. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1450.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1451.0s)]
*  Like really hard workers. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1452.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1453.0s)]
*  And that's like the expectation of work. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1454.0s)]
*  Well, also, you have a lot of gratitude. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1456.0s)]
*  And I think if you have gratitude, you realize how fortunate you are to have the ability to work hard. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1458.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1463.0s)]
*  Because that's a real thing. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1464.0s)]
*  Oh, dude. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1465.0s)]
*  Especially working hard at something that you're actually successful at. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1466.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1468.0s)]
*  Like once you're actually successful, keep that foot on the gas motherfucker. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1469.0s)]
*  It is. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1472.0s)]
*  Keep that foot on the gas. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1473.0s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1475.0s)]
*  That's like the balance. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1476.0s)]
*  Like you just put something out. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1477.0s)]
*  So I imagine you took a little time off afterwards. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1479.0s)]
*  Yeah, I did. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1481.0s)]
*  I got like 25 minutes right now. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1482.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1484.0s)]
*  So you're building back. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1485.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1486.0s)]
*  And like I find in order for the next thing I do to be different, I have to take time away. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1487.0s)]
*  Uh-huh. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1493.0s)]
*  Because I have to like reflect on the changes in my life. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1494.0s)]
*  And if I keep going like earlier in my career, I would just go, go, go, go. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1497.0s)]
*  And I found I was writing different versions of the same jokes. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1501.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1504.0s)]
*  Like they were different jokes, but it was same topic, same kind of reaction. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1505.0s)]
*  And I think it was, I just wasn't. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1510.0s)]
*  You're trying to fill time. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1511.0s)]
*  I'm on the road. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1512.0s)]
*  I'm like, I got to go back to Albany next year. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1513.0s)]
*  You got to do another hour. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1515.0s)]
*  I'm making $1,500 a weekend. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1516.0s)]
*  I got to go. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1517.0s)]
*  And then you get connected to that material because you've been doing it for a while. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1518.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1521.0s)]
*  And then it doesn't really resonate with you. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1522.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1523.0s)]
*  And then, yeah, so it's like. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1524.0s)]
*  I think Louis took a whole year off. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1525.0s)]
*  I think I really respect that. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1526.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1529.0s)]
*  I think it's wise. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1530.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1531.0s)]
*  I think taking time and thinking about it is really wise. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1532.0s)]
*  And thinking about like what are the things that are on your mind? [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1535.0s)]
*  Like what is, what is, how do you really feel about this world that we're living? [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1538.0s)]
*  This, this world that seems more and more like it's not real, more and more like it's a fucking simulation. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1543.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1549.0s)]
*  I'm kind of convinced now. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1550.0s)]
*  What it is a simulation? [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1552.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1553.0s)]
*  There's something going on. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1554.0s)]
*  There's something more to reality than what meets the eye. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1555.0s)]
*  There's more to it than what you could put on a scale or what you could put a rule or two. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1559.0s)]
*  There's more to this thing. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1564.0s)]
*  This thing is made out of like some very bizarre energy that's attached to consciousness. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1565.0s)]
*  That's what I think. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1570.0s)]
*  What do you mean by this? [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1571.0s)]
*  I think that like, I think it's really possible. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1573.0s)]
*  First of all, it's inevitable that one day they will achieve a simulation that is indiscernible from reality. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1580.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1588.0s)]
*  And no doubt about it. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1589.0s)]
*  They've gotten real close, you know, where you could put on haptic feedback suits. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1590.0s)]
*  You can see things and you feel like you're in a room that, you know, it's crude, but it's like, you know, [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1594.0s)]
*  Nintendo from 20 years ago versus, you know, some modern warfare game now. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1600.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1606.0s)]
*  They're going to get to a point where it's indiscernible. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1607.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1609.0s)]
*  So if it's, if it does happen, how do you know? [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1610.0s)]
*  How do you know when that takes place? [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1613.0s)]
*  Now, here's the question. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1615.0s)]
*  Is that the ultimate progression of technology? [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1617.0s)]
*  Is the ultimate progression of technology transcending physical reality and becoming completely digital life? [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1622.0s)]
*  So if that is possible, how do we know what if it hasn't already happened? [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1632.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1636.0s)]
*  How can we know if it hasn't already happened? [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1637.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1638.0s)]
*  Well, one thing I would say that if this world was scripted, it would be filled with a lot of shit that's exactly like what happened. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1639.0s)]
*  Trump would get shot in the ear and say, fight, fight, fight. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1646.0s)]
*  You would have Elon Musk at the inauguration looking like he's on another planet. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1650.0s)]
*  Now, Joe, I just want to make the point here. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1656.0s)]
*  You're making the argument for determinism. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1658.0s)]
*  No, I'm not. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1660.0s)]
*  I'm making the argument that there's a conscious interface. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1661.0s)]
*  There's consciousness and it's interfacing with something that's not entirely real. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1667.0s)]
*  And that is the life that we're living in. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1672.0s)]
*  And we think it's way realer than it actually is. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1674.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1676.0s)]
*  So is somebody in control of it or they're allowing us to have it? [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1677.0s)]
*  I feel like it might be controlled by the actual things that are inside of it. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1679.0s)]
*  So I think our destiny is truly in our hands. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1687.0s)]
*  I really believe that. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1691.0s)]
*  I like that. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1692.0s)]
*  And then if that is the case, how is that not real? [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1693.0s)]
*  Well, it is real in a sense. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1695.0s)]
*  But I think that the actual way that things happen and work is dependent entirely on the level of consciousness that people have that are experiencing it. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1698.0s)]
*  It sounds like very hippie dippy and wooey. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1710.0s)]
*  And it all comes from a lot of different things. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1712.0s)]
*  But one of it comes from Tom Campbell, who wrote this very fucking bizarre book that I've listened to an audiobook twice now. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1714.0s)]
*  Or he's talking about essentially what we think of as reality is just a simulation. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1721.0s)]
*  The whole entire thing is our consciousness interpreting everything as we experience it throughout the day. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1728.0s)]
*  But when we are not here, that is not the same thing. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1736.0s)]
*  What do you mean when we're not here? When we die, you're saying? [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1740.0s)]
*  Like when we're not, if you're not on Mars, is Mars real? [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1742.0s)]
*  Or is Mars something that we agree is real? [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1746.0s)]
*  We agree it's in a certain space and it'll only be there when we get there? [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1750.0s)]
*  Like if the universe is a true simulation, imagine what a mind fuck. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1754.0s)]
*  You have a simulation where it's perfect in that it has all these galaxies and supernovas. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1759.0s)]
*  The moon aligns perfectly with the Earth to cause eclipses. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1766.0s)]
*  And without the moon being there, our entire atmosphere would fall apart. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1771.0s)]
*  We would never be able to survive. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1775.0s)]
*  So it's like this perfect little thing that's set right there and we spin around and worry which bathroom should we let the guy in a dress go to? [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1776.0s)]

*  But meanwhile, it's just a show that's being put on for our consciousness. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1826.0s)]
*  Okay, so it's a show being put on for our consciousness, right? [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1830.0s)]
*  And then somebody's putting on the show and then we get the ability to go to the moon and then they got to scramble and make a moon? [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1832.0s)]
*  No, there's a moon. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1838.0s)]
*  I mean, it doesn't matter wherever you go. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1839.0s)]

*  It's like our technology gets so good and they're just going, fuck, we got to make this thing real. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1842.0s)]
*  They're on the way. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1847.0s)]
*  I'm well aware if you're like criticizing me. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1848.0s)]
*  This is a dopey way to describe it. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1850.0s)]
*  But I, you know, if the tree falls in the forest and there's no one there, does it make a sound? [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1851.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1857.0s)]
*  I don't even know if the tree falls if there's no one there. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1858.0s)]
*  I'm not convinced. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1862.0s)]
*  I'm not convinced. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1865.0s)]
*  I'm not convinced. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1867.0s)]
*  So the tree. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1869.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1870.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1871.0s)]
*  So I think if you take a trip to the Pacific Northwest, you will find trees. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1872.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1875.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1876.0s)]
*  I just don't know if they're there all the time. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1877.0s)]
*  So they're only there in reference to us looking at them. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1878.0s)]
*  Oh, I get what you're saying. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1881.0s)]
*  I think. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1883.0s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1884.0s)]
*  So you're playing a video game. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1885.0s)]
*  Uh huh. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1886.0s)]
*  And as you move throughout the map of the video game, it presents itself. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1887.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1891.0s)]
*  But you're saying without us accessing it, it isn't presenting itself. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1892.0s)]
*  It might be the whole universe. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1895.0s)]
*  They're saving on data. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1896.0s)]
*  That might be the whole universe. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1897.0s)]
*  The whole universe might be us interacting with something. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1898.0s)]
*  But they exist. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1903.0s)]
*  But it doesn't exist without us. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1904.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1906.0s)]
*  And this is one of those things like what does it matter either way? [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1908.0s)]
*  But exists with us in this moment. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1910.0s)]
*  Like if you jump off a cliff, you will die. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1912.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1914.0s)]
*  Like gravity's real. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1915.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1916.0s)]
*  You'll get pulverized. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1917.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1918.0s)]
*  No doubt. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1919.0s)]
*  But. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1920.0s)]
*  It's because you jumped. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1921.0s)]
*  It's also like your consciousness is the reason why all this is here. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1923.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1928.0s)]
*  Because you're interacting with it. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1929.0s)]
*  That's the manifestation of everything though. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1930.0s)]
*  So I get what you're saying. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1931.0s)]
*  The structure. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1933.0s)]
*  Existentially does it exist if we're not touching it, feeling it? [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1934.0s)]
*  It's what they say about like the Native Americans when they first saw the ships. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1937.0s)]
*  They didn't know what they were. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1941.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's bullshit. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1942.0s)]
*  That's not real. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1943.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1944.0s)]
*  But I wouldn't say that it's not real and that they didn't understand what it was. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1945.0s)]
*  In the distance they think they were like mountains moving closer. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1953.0s)]
*  They probably just saw these giant pieces of wood and was trying to figure out. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1956.0s)]
*  They might not know it's wood. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1960.0s)]
*  But didn't they have structures? [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1961.0s)]
*  I don't know if they're fishing at that time. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1962.0s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1963.0s)]
*  But if you see them in the distance, you see them moving forward. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1964.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1966.0s)]
*  I get the idea. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1967.0s)]
*  Like your brain can't map what that is yet. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1968.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1969.0s)]
*  You'd be freaked out. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1970.0s)]
*  So it's mapping to whatever you know. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1971.0s)]
*  So it's like, oh shit, is it low tide? [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1972.0s)]
*  And there's some like sandbars out there that are slowly approaching. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1973.0s)]
*  What the fuck is that? [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1976.0s)]
*  That's kind of what you're saying. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1977.0s)]
*  We can't under like I can't understand like what a glacier is without knowing what it is. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1978.0s)]
*  When I see a glacier for the first time, I can recognize glaciers everywhere. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1982.0s)]
*  But if I take someone who's never seen a glacier to it. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1985.0s)]
*  I think this guy's going further than that. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1988.0s)]
*  I think he's saying the glaciers are real unless you're there. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1990.0s)]
*  But if someone is there at every point in time throughout the world, then everything is. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=1993.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2000.0s)]
*  And we have enough people where there's some people in Antarctica. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2001.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2004.0s)]
*  So Antarctica is always there. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2005.0s)]
*  There's some people in Alaska. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2006.0s)]
*  OK, so that's always there. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2007.0s)]
*  If we have enough people throughout the world, the world is this congealed substance that [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2008.0s)]
*  we can look at, feel, touch and experience. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2012.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2014.0s)]
*  And it might be like the map of the game is like those NASA satellite photos of Earth. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2015.0s)]
*  That's the map of the game. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2020.0s)]
*  Like if you wanted to like go through a game, a video game, and before you go through the [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2022.0s)]
*  game, it shows you like these are the arenas in which you're playing. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2026.0s)]
*  And you can choose one of them? [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2029.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2031.0s)]
*  You can choose one or you know which level you're going to. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2032.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2035.0s)]
*  Like that's those NASA 3D photos of the Earth. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2036.0s)]
*  That's what the Earth is. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2037.0s)]
*  Earth is like the place where we play this consciousness game. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2038.0s)]
*  When you're sitting at home and you're like thinking about these things, do you like talk [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2041.0s)]
*  to your kids about it? [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2045.0s)]
*  No, that's too weird to talk to kids about. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2046.0s)]
*  What about your wife? [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2048.0s)]
*  Are you like just going, hey? [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2049.0s)]
*  She would go, what? [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2050.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2051.0s)]
*  You know my wife? [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2052.0s)]
*  She'd be like, what the fuck are you talking about? [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2057.0s)]
*  Okay, so you get out of the sauna, you have a nice sweat, you're walking around your house, [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2060.0s)]
*  you're looking at the stars, you see fucking Saturn or whatever in the sky. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2066.0s)]
*  Look, if she wants to talk about something like that, she'll bring it up. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2069.0s)]
*  Like if she wants to talk about something heavy, it's not like I wouldn't talk about [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2073.0s)]
*  something heavy with her. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2076.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2077.0s)]
*  But generally, like I come home from work, she's been with the kids, she's doing this [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2078.0s)]
*  and that. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2082.0s)]
*  She don't need all that. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2083.0s)]
*  We eat dinner, we have fun, how was school? [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2084.0s)]
*  Have a good time, maybe we watch Little Severance together. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2086.0s)]
*  But if she's like, did you ever think that maybe this all isn't real? [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2089.0s)]
*  I'd be like, I'm so glad you brought this up. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2093.0s)]
*  Okay, so do you struggle battling with the, because some people when they think about [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2099.0s)]
*  this stuff, they feel their own insignificance and it's very depressing for them. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2103.0s)]
*  Oh, it doesn't matter. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2108.0s)]
*  So you're unaffected entirely that like your existence in this lifetime over the [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2109.0s)]
*  grand scheme of things could not be important. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2115.0s)]
*  It can be important. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2118.0s)]
*  But it is. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2119.0s)]
*  But it is to you and it is to the people around you. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2120.0s)]
*  And if that makes up our reality, then it's important. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2123.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2125.0s)]
*  But why think about that? [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2126.0s)]
*  Why think about whether or not you're important? [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2128.0s)]
*  I just don't waste any time thinking about whether or not I'm important. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2130.0s)]
*  Maybe important is like a pretentious word. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2132.0s)]
*  Not important, I mean like- [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2135.0s)]
*  Don't think about the end of the game, play the game. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2136.0s)]
*  Don't go, oh my God, it's going to end. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2138.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2140.0s)]
*  My quarter's going to run out. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2141.0s)]
*  Just play the game. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2142.0s)]
*  Some people won't play the game if they know there's no game at all or they know it is [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2143.0s)]
*  a completely game. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2147.0s)]
*  I think that there's this like urgency that is applied. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2148.0s)]
*  Like, okay, I have to create the art that I want to create in this time in my life. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2150.0s)]
*  Like time is something I've been thinking about like nonstop since I had a kid. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2155.0s)]
*  It's like time. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2158.0s)]
*  How do I spend time? [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2159.0s)]
*  Maybe it's a cliche, but it is the thing that I like value the most and everything gets [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2161.0s)]
*  broken up into these little quadrants of time. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2165.0s)]
*  Okay, I'm out here. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2167.0s)]

*  I'm away from my wife. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2170.0s)]
*  How do I get back that time? [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2171.0s)]
*  How can I like create these events? [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2173.0s)]
*  I don't even buy expensive shit. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2174.0s)]
*  I like to take a vacation with my friends. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2176.0s)]
*  I want us all to stay in the villa together because when we're in different hotel rooms, [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2178.0s)]
*  we miss out on those little moments in between. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2182.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2184.0s)]
*  Time, time, time. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2185.0s)]
*  And to me, it's like I'm putting an importance on this, I guess the game you say you're playing. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2186.0s)]
*  I want to experience the most of this game as I possibly can while I'm here. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2191.0s)]
*  And I have all these examples of people like finishing the game. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2195.0s)]
*  My dad, he's got dementia and all this stuff. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2198.0s)]
*  It's like you're seeing your ability to, I guess, manifest that reality. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2201.0s)]
*  You're at the kind of end of your game. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2206.0s)]
*  Not quite what. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2208.0s)]
*  But like, yeah, the idea of like me being important, I don't care about like that in [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2209.0s)]
*  terms of how people see it. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2214.0s)]
*  But in this time I have here, I want to believe it's really important. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2215.0s)]
*  And I want to soak as much of it up as I can. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2219.0s)]
*  And I think sometimes when you're like, oh, it's pointless. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2222.0s)]
*  It's nothing. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2224.0s)]
*  I felt like Jim Carrey was going through that moment. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2225.0s)]
*  Like there are these times where I'd see Jim talking about like the insignificance of [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2227.0s)]
*  the world. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2230.0s)]
*  And I feel like that can kind of like lead people to sadness and depression. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2231.0s)]
*  I feel like sometimes you need the battery in your back of of of importance, not you [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2235.0s)]
*  being important to other people, but the time you spend here being valuable. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2240.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2244.0s)]
*  Well, that's part of gratitude, too. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2245.0s)]
*  That's one of your best traits. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2247.0s)]
*  And having gratitude is you would recognize that you this time is precious, you know, [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2250.0s)]
*  and use it to the best of your ability and really like you enjoy it, like soak it up. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2256.0s)]
*  Did you see everything everywhere all at once? [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2262.0s)]
*  Yeah, I did. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2264.0s)]
*  Like I thought that was a beautiful, beautiful way of showcasing how people look at like [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2266.0s)]
*  the nothingness of life. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2272.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2274.0s)]
*  This girl sees it as potentially nothing and falls into her own kind of I guess you [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2275.0s)]
*  would call it this depression. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2284.0s)]
*  Why is it worth it? [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2286.0s)]
*  What the fuck is going on? [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2287.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2288.0s)]
*  And she kind of sees her father as this like weak guy that's getting like walked over [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2289.0s)]
*  and then comes to realize that like he chooses to deal with the nothingness with kindness [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2294.0s)]
*  and love with everybody. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2299.0s)]
*  And in reality, he's like a hero. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2301.0s)]
*  Like his perspective on the world is the best when confronted with the nothingness of life. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2303.0s)]
*  He chooses to like be compassionate and loving. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2308.0s)]
*  And it's actually like the most heroic stand you can take. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2311.0s)]
*  I think it's very easy to just submit to nothingness. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2314.0s)]
*  You're a determined is maybe the wrong word, but like you like hard shit. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2317.0s)]
*  The day the day you're no longer here is when you can no longer do hard shit. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2322.0s)]
*  I feel like your day is full of it. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2327.0s)]
*  And it's just constant like wake up. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2329.0s)]
*  I'm getting in the fucking ice. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2331.0s)]
*  Like everything I see you do is hard. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2332.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2334.0s)]
*  You could shoot a fucking thing with a gun if you want. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2335.0s)]
*  You shoot animals with a gun. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2337.0s)]
*  I'm surprised you don't run on them with a fucking knife. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2338.0s)]
*  Like literally like I feel like one day I'm going to see you go. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2341.0s)]
*  I'm going knife hunting. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2344.0s)]
*  I'm going bear knife hunting just because it's a difficult thing to do. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2345.0s)]
*  And I don't know. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2348.0s)]
*  Maybe that's how you process the process existence. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2349.0s)]
*  Well, I think if you are a person who enjoys challenges and finds a reward in like working hard [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2353.0s)]
*  and overcoming that resistance inside of you as Pressfield talks about that that thing that wants you to be lazy. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2361.0s)]
*  If you if you have value in that you find value in that and it helps you live like a more enriched more fulfilling life. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2369.0s)]
*  You tend to just keep doing that because this is like if I know for a fact me as much as I work out and take care of myself. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2377.0s)]
*  If I take like three days off, you'll start to get used to it. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2384.0s)]
*  I start getting depressed. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2388.0s)]
*  I start getting anxious. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2389.0s)]
*  I start feeling weird. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2390.0s)]
*  Like I don't feel level like a couple of days off. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2392.0s)]
*  Just like I just feel gross. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2396.0s)]
*  I just like why is the world so weird? [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2398.0s)]
*  And then I'll have one good hard workout. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2400.0s)]
*  And then I'm like, oh, everything's fine. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2402.0s)]
*  And I'm like, how many people need that? [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2404.0s)]
*  And so what is that? [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2406.0s)]
*  It's just a human body has certain requirements because it's designed to run from tigers. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2407.0s)]
*  The human body is designed to constantly be defeated. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2414.0s)]
*  You have to feed it. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2419.0s)]
*  You have to deal with these difficult things because for millions of years, that's how our brains and bodies have been processed to work efficiently. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2420.0s)]
*  And if you don't put in those situations, what is the is the messaging like you're wasting this time here? [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2426.0s)]
*  What is that internal messaging? [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2433.0s)]
*  You can have both right. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2435.0s)]
*  You can have people that have brilliant minds and shit bodies. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2437.0s)]
*  They exist as people that don't take care of their body at all. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2441.0s)]
*  And they're yeah, Stephen Hawking. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2444.0s)]
*  But he you know, he had a disease. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2446.0s)]
*  But but it wasn't like an Adonis before. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2448.0s)]
*  Right. That's true, too. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2450.0s)]
*  Yeah. Right. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2451.0s)]
*  People act like it's a big difference. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2452.0s)]
*  Yeah. But the best way for your brain to work well is if your body is healthy and has energy. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2454.0s)]
*  It doesn't mean you have to be a weightlifter. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2461.0s)]
*  It doesn't mean you have to be you have to do any specific thing. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2463.0s)]
*  If you like running, run. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2467.0s)]
*  If you like tennis, play tennis. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2468.0s)]
*  If you like yoga, do yoga. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2470.0s)]
*  But you should 100 percent do something. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2472.0s)]
*  Find a thing you enjoy doing. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2474.0s)]
*  That's why golf or rather tennis is such a great thing, because it's cardio and it's fun. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2476.0s)]
*  Yeah. Right. You're doing a fun thing. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2481.0s)]
*  You're playing with your friends. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2483.0s)]
*  Also community. Yeah. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2484.0s)]
*  Community. Huge. Yeah. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2486.0s)]
*  But you're you're active. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2487.0s)]
*  If you don't do that, I don't think your body is in sync. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2489.0s)]
*  And I think there's a whole lot of people running out there taking care of things with pills that you could fix weight. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2493.0s)]
*  You could fix way better and feel and look better. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2499.0s)]
*  More importantly, you it would help in every aspect of your life. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2504.0s)]
*  It would help you think clear. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2509.0s)]
*  You'd have less stress. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2510.0s)]
*  You'd be more reasonable. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2511.0s)]
*  Like, go fucking do something with your goddamn body. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2513.0s)]
*  Yeah. And if you if you don't do that, I really believe if you don't do that, you have less potential. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2516.0s)]
*  You can have a genius mind that allows you to overcome that potential, which is just pure intelligence. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2522.0s)]
*  Just a pure insight on the world that's extraordinary. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2528.0s)]

*  What do you like when you're talking to these high functioning dudes, you're talking to like an Elon. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2556.0s)]
*  Is there did they value exercise and stuff like that at all? [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2561.0s)]
*  Like, can he even put that in his day? [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2565.0s)]
*  Like, Elon's a different animal. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2567.0s)]
*  There's no other human I've ever met like him. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2569.0s)]
*  No, I don't think he exercises much. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2572.0s)]
*  I think maybe a little bit. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2576.0s)]
*  I know he was thinking about fighting Zuckerberg, so he did some training. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2577.0s)]
*  He trained with Lex and who else was it? [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2580.0s)]
*  Was it Jorsson and Pierre? [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2582.0s)]
*  Probably. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2584.0s)]
*  They put up a photo of it. It was George, right? [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2585.0s)]
*  So he trains with one of the greatest UFC fighters of all time. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2587.0s)]
*  Lex Friedman, our boy, who is also a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu black belt. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2590.0s)]
*  And I think he just did a little bit of that. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2594.0s)]
*  It was like, fuck this. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2596.0s)]
*  Shout out Lex, man. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2598.0s)]
*  There it is. Look at Lex. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2599.0s)]
*  And John Donahue, the great John Donahue, the greatest Jiu-Jitsu coach of all time. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2600.0s)]
*  So he was like learning some stuff. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2603.0s)]
*  I'll never forget Lex coming to my wedding uninvited and blacking out. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2605.0s)]
*  I'll never forget that. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2609.0s)]
*  I'll never forget that. Thank you, Lex. We really appreciate that. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2611.0s)]
*  In all fairness, it was my fault that he blacked out. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2613.0s)]
*  You forced him to drink. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2616.0s)]
*  I kind of got him a drink and didn't realize the Russian in him had a mind of its own. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2618.0s)]
*  That Russian mixed with that fucking American bourbon motherfucker was off to the races. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2626.0s)]
*  It was so funny. He was like, yeah, I'm going to take Lex. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2631.0s)]
*  I was like, oh, okay, cool. Yeah, I like that guy. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2633.0s)]
*  And then I remember seeing him on like a beach chair just passed the fuck out. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2635.0s)]
*  Oh, dude, we had an adventure. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2639.0s)]
*  Yeah. So you guys went to Vegas later that night, right? [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2640.0s)]
*  We go to Vegas that night because Whitney had a wedding. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2642.0s)]
*  Like a corporate. She had a wedding. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2645.0s)]
*  I thought she had a gig. She had a wedding at someone's house. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2647.0s)]
*  It was a corporate gig. Oh, it was a gig. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2648.0s)]
*  But it was a wedding at someone's house. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2649.0s)]
*  I think it was a wedding or a birthday, whatever it was. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2651.0s)]
*  Party, private party at someone's house. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2653.0s)]
*  Must have been a birthday. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2655.0s)]
*  So we fly from your wedding. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2657.0s)]
*  Hey, congratulations. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2660.0s)]
*  We hang out and then hop on a jet. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2661.0s)]
*  You know, it's only 30 minutes to Vegas. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2663.0s)]
*  We get to Vegas. By the time we land, Lex is lit. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2665.0s)]
*  I mean, Lex is lit. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2669.0s)]
*  He was lit at the party. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2670.0s)]
*  Lit, lit, lit. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2671.0s)]
*  So Whitney performs at this lady's house. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2672.0s)]
*  Didn't you go on? [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2677.0s)]
*  I introduce her. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2678.0s)]
*  Oh, I thought you did like five minutes. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2679.0s)]
*  No, I was drunk too. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2681.0s)]
*  I went up and said happy birthday, whatever, to the lady. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2682.0s)]
*  I forget what it was. I'm pretty sure it was birthday. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2685.0s)]
*  And then I bring up my good friend, one of the most hilarious comics in the world, Whitney. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2687.0s)]
*  And then we get on the plane or we get in the car to go to the plane to head back. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2692.0s)]
*  And there's no plane. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2700.0s)]
*  They never booked a return flight. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2702.0s)]
*  So we try to get a return flight because they either got her a little shitty private jet to get there. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2704.0s)]
*  So then we try to get a return flight. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2711.0s)]
*  We cannot. I call my service. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2713.0s)]
*  The quickest they can do is in the morning. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2715.0s)]
*  Like what do you guys want to do? [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2717.0s)]
*  So we decide that we're going to get a limo. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2718.0s)]
*  And so have a car service drive us back to LA. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2721.0s)]
*  Love it. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2724.0s)]
*  So it's a four hour drive or whatever the fuck it is. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2725.0s)]
*  It's me, my wife, Whitney and Lex. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2727.0s)]
*  I remember you just sending me videos of Lex passed out at different parts of the casino. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2730.0s)]
*  That's at the airport. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2738.0s)]
*  But he's like that for the last 12 hours. He was like that at the wedding. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2743.0s)]
*  He was obliterated. I mean, he went hard. That boy goes hard. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2746.0s)]
*  He goes hard. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2749.0s)]
*  It makes you want to not drink. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2750.0s)]
*  There's certain people around. I'm like, I think I'm done. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2751.0s)]
*  I think I'm done. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2754.0s)]
*  I feel like less people are drinking. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2755.0s)]
*  Well, it's really a good idea. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2756.0s)]
*  That might be your influence. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2758.0s)]
*  It's a good idea to not drink so much. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2759.0s)]
*  I wonder if the like the alcohol companies are concerned. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2761.0s)]
*  They're trying to find something. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2764.0s)]
*  There's always going to be drunks. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2765.0s)]
*  I see it. I see it like beard consumption weighed down. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2767.0s)]
*  The problem is it's poison. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2772.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2773.0s)]
*  But everything's poison. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2774.0s)]
*  It's wonderful, lovely poison. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2775.0s)]
*  My favorite poison is wine. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2777.0s)]
*  I love a great glass of wine. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2779.0s)]
*  Do we have a little like nice little red going on here? [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2781.0s)]
*  Do we have any red wine here? [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2784.0s)]
*  I want to know what you're drinking. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2785.0s)]
*  There's something. Yeah, there's at least some out there for sure. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2787.0s)]
*  Do you want some? [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2790.0s)]
*  I mean, if you're going to have a glass, I'll have a glass. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2792.0s)]
*  I'll have a sip. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2794.0s)]
*  I've kind of cut way back on my alcohol consumption. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2795.0s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2798.0s)]
*  Yeah, way, way back. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2799.0s)]
*  I would go every time I'd go out to dinner, I'd have a drink or two. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2800.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2803.0s)]
*  Every time I'd go to the club, I'd have a drink or two. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2804.0s)]
*  And then one day I sat down, I was like, that's like four days a week, five days a week. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2806.0s)]
*  That's like a drink or two, five days a week. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2809.0s)]
*  Like, how would you feel if you didn't have a drink or two five days a week? [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2811.0s)]
*  So I didn't have any drinks for like two weeks. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2814.0s)]
*  And I feel a lot better. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2816.0s)]
*  Really? So am I breaking your like streak right now? [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2818.0s)]
*  Yeah, you would be breaking my streak. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2821.0s)]
*  I don't want to fucking streak up. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2823.0s)]
*  Well, we don't have to drink it then. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2824.0s)]
*  But actually let's break it. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2825.0s)]
*  I don't mind. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2826.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2827.0s)]
*  I think the key is like all things, it's all about moderation. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2828.0s)]
*  But the reality of alcohol is it's basically poison. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2832.0s)]
*  Yeah, but it's got great social utility. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2834.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2836.0s)]
*  I feel like people undermine the value of alcohol and how. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2837.0s)]
*  It ain't around for all these years because it sucks. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2840.0s)]
*  And like if you travel, you don't get to experience certain cultures in their truest form without them consuming alcohol. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2843.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2852.0s)]
*  Like if you've gone to like Ireland, you go to Dublin. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2853.0s)]
*  Like during the day, there are very different people and they seem kind of like tight and dour. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2855.0s)]
*  And then at night at the pub after like a few Guinness, it seems almost cliche, but everybody's singing and dancing. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2861.0s)]
*  And there's so much like love and connectivity. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2869.0s)]
*  And you see why all this great like literature, music and poetry just comes from this tiny little island. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2871.0s)]
*  And you're like, oh, wow, you really need that. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2876.0s)]
*  Like it is a tough place to live and you've got to stuff everything down. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2879.0s)]
*  You need a release valve. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2883.0s)]
*  Same thing with Russia. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2884.0s)]
*  Same thing with Russia. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2885.0s)]
*  Like when I was in Russia, seeing them on the drink, they're on the drink, on the drink. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2886.0s)]
*  They're warmer. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2891.0s)]
*  There's warmth in the culture. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2892.0s)]
*  It's a great way to explain it though, on the drink. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2894.0s)]
*  For real? [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2896.0s)]
*  We have fancy glasses. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2897.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2898.0s)]
*  What are you thinking, Joe? [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2899.0s)]
*  What is? [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2901.0s)]
*  Which one was the one that you just touched? [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2902.0s)]
*  Grab that one where your hand is. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2906.0s)]
*  That's what we're going to decide. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2909.0s)]
*  So that's the thing. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2911.0s)]
*  Ninety seven is a long time ago. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2912.0s)]
*  How do you like how do you find that balance where like you kind of need it? [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2913.0s)]
*  That's old ass wine, huh? [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2916.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know if I brought it. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2918.0s)]
*  How do you find what balance? [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2919.0s)]
*  Just like it allows people to access this part of themselves that they might feel is like a push down or. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2921.0s)]
*  The problem is if you use it too much. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2929.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2931.0s)]
*  And it's also the problem is like I notice if I drink three or four nights in a week, I don't feel as good. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2932.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2937.0s)]
*  And when I don't drink at all for two weeks and I feel like really good all the time, like what am I retarded? [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2938.0s)]
*  Why am I drinking? [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2942.0s)]
*  Why would I drink? [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2943.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2944.0s)]
*  Like I don't need to drink to have a good time. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2945.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2946.0s)]
*  But you know, when you're at the bar or at the club rather and everyone's being social and Tony's like, who wants a drink? [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2947.0s)]
*  Anybody want a drink? [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2952.0s)]
*  Cheers. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2953.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2954.0s)]
*  It's just about discipline. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2955.0s)]
*  It's just about like if you feel like you're going off the rails, hit the brakes. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2957.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2961.0s)]
*  Settle down. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2962.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2963.0s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2964.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2965.0s)]
*  You got it. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2966.0s)]
*  But a lot of folks don't have any of that, unfortunately. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2967.0s)]
*  And you know, they. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2968.0s)]
*  They'll be sober for a long time and then one glass of Chardonnay later, they're doing cocaine and headed to Vegas. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2969.0s)]
*  Not even the alcohol. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2976.0s)]
*  To his Lex Friedman. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2977.0s)]
*  Flowing rails on a private jet. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2978.0s)]
*  Who does go and passes out? [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2983.0s)]
*  Pass out to a QR. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2985.0s)]
*  This is something so funny about people passed out. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2994.0s)]
*  That's the funniest shit ever. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2996.0s)]
*  They become children. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2998.0s)]
*  They're babies. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=2999.0s)]
*  They're like infants. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3000.0s)]
*  You know, there's just completely out of control of their body. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3001.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3003.0s)]
*  You're not even there. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3004.0s)]
*  Hello. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3005.0s)]
*  Look at you out cold. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3006.0s)]
*  It's just a weird aspect of people that we have to shut off. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3007.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3010.0s)]
*  That's so weird. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3011.0s)]
*  I was just watching this video about this guy who he did a radio broadcast in Times Square where he stayed up for eight days. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3012.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3023.0s)]
*  And this guy started having crazy hallucinations. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3024.0s)]
*  He was having his REM sleep. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3028.0s)]
*  His REM cycles in his brain were going off while he was awake. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3030.0s)]
*  So he's living inside nightmares. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3034.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3036.0s)]
*  I'll send it to Jamie. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3037.0s)]
*  It was crazy. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3038.0s)]
*  I think Duncan sent it to me. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3039.0s)]
*  It's really wild. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3041.0s)]
*  They say that can induce insanity faster than anything, right? [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3042.0s)]
*  Oh, for sure, dude. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3046.0s)]
*  I mean, that without a doubt. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3048.0s)]
*  The sleep deprivation. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3050.0s)]
*  Yeah, sleep deprivation is really bad for you. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3051.0s)]
*  How many hours do you get a night? [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3054.0s)]
*  I try to get at least seven. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3055.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3057.0s)]
*  But if you come home late from the club, you're just... [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3058.0s)]
*  When I do, if it's school days especially, I get up in the morning, I say goodbye, and then I'll maybe go back to sleep for an hour. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3063.0s)]
*  So like I'll get up with them, you know, see them off, and then I'll go back to sleep for like one more hour. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3073.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3079.0s)]
*  Because I can sleep on the ground, dude. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3080.0s)]
*  I can go to sleep on rocks. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3082.0s)]
*  I know how to pass out. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3084.0s)]
*  So like I could go right back to sleep and I'm good. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3086.0s)]
*  But I like seven. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3089.0s)]
*  But I can function on six. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3091.0s)]
*  I had six last night. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3092.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3093.0s)]
*  I had to get up in the morning for a dentist appointment. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3094.0s)]
*  But generally speaking, I'm looking for eight. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3096.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3101.0s)]
*  I like eight. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3102.0s)]
*  Eight's where it's at. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3103.0s)]
*  I don't think I've had eight hours. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3104.0s)]
*  Salute, my brother. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3105.0s)]
*  Salute. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3106.0s)]
*  I haven't had an hour since I had a kid. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3107.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3108.0s)]
*  I didn't either for a while. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3109.0s)]
*  It takes a long time. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3110.0s)]
*  And it's also like your day is way more occupied. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3114.0s)]
*  It's a completely different... [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3121.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3123.0s)]
*  You really realize how much your actual time working on something is precious when you have children because like they just go to bed, you know, like, okay, I got an hour to get some shit done. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3124.0s)]
*  Yep. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3135.0s)]
*  You know, you got one hour. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3136.0s)]
*  You don't have an hour to flip through your phone, check out TikTok. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3137.0s)]
*  You got an hour to get something done. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3139.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3141.0s)]
*  And then you got to go to bed. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3142.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3143.0s)]
*  And then you got to get up in the morning. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3144.0s)]
*  You got to get up early. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3145.0s)]
*  You got to help with this, help with that. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3146.0s)]
*  We're doing this. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3147.0s)]
*  We're doing that. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3148.0s)]
*  We're packing our stuff in here. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3149.0s)]
*  And okay, let's go there. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3150.0s)]
*  And there's a thing after school. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3151.0s)]
*  Remember, it's at 430. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3152.0s)]
*  Don't be late. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3153.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3154.0s)]
*  430. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3155.0s)]
*  And then you got to zoom over from here and go to the... [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3156.0s)]
*  It's like your day is so occupied, but it makes you more disciplined. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3157.0s)]
*  It makes you more disciplined and it makes you feel more productive. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3160.0s)]
*  Like, it's weird. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3163.0s)]
*  It's weird. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3164.0s)]
*  Like, even going out and like, say, having some drinks or whatever and waking up and [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3165.0s)]
*  feeling kind of shitty, without like the kid, I kind of feel guilty by halfway through the [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3168.0s)]
*  day. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3173.0s)]
*  I'm like, what was I doing? [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3174.0s)]
*  Why the fuck did I go out partying? [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3175.0s)]
*  But when I'm like up at seven and I'm fucking tired, I'm hungover, and I'm with my wife [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3176.0s)]
*  taking care of the baby, by 12, I'm like, I'm a good fucking parent. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3180.0s)]
*  Like, I feel like this... [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3184.0s)]
*  I feel like a positive sensation in the place of this like guilt-ridden one that I would [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3186.0s)]
*  used to feel maybe. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3191.0s)]
*  And I think it's that immediate productivity, that purpose. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3192.0s)]
*  There's this human being you love more than anything that is like deeply relying on you. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3195.0s)]
*  And yeah, I feel... [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3199.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3201.0s)]
*  It's also the kind of love you have with them is just indescribable. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3202.0s)]
*  How old were you when you had your first? [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3205.0s)]
*  40. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3207.0s)]
*  Yeah, so I'm 41. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3208.0s)]
*  So I was... [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3210.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's the same thing. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3211.0s)]
*  It's... [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3212.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's every cliche. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3213.0s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3215.0s)]
*  You spend all this time as a comedian, like thinking of unique or different angles. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3216.0s)]
*  And then you're presented with your child, and like every feeling you have is the most [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3221.0s)]
*  cliched feeling that everybody's ever described in having a child. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3228.0s)]
*  Yeah, and then you don't mind when babies are crying on airplanes anymore. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3232.0s)]
*  Dude, it completely... [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3235.0s)]
*  Changes everything. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3237.0s)]
*  It is adorable when they're crying on the airplane. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3238.0s)]
*  You want to like... [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3241.0s)]
*  You almost want to like help the mom. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3242.0s)]
*  Isn't that crazy how when you're a young man, you're like, oh my God, a baby's crying. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3244.0s)]
*  You like look for something to cover your ears with. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3248.0s)]
*  That's also a big city thing. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3250.0s)]
*  I feel like places that... [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3252.0s)]
*  Like country places where they're so used to... [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3254.0s)]
*  Where there's family dynamics and like that's rewarded. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3256.0s)]
*  And I grew up in the city where it just wasn't that rewarded. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3259.0s)]
*  And it's like a rare thing to even like be a kid in the city. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3261.0s)]
*  Well, especially you're a kid in the city, and then you go from that to being a standup comedian. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3265.0s)]
*  So you're a nighttime nightclub guy. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3272.0s)]
*  Like the whole baby crying, like, oh Jesus. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3275.0s)]
*  It's like, whoa, some bad decision making going on over there. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3279.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3283.0s)]
*  But it is... [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3284.0s)]
*  I wish that... [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3285.0s)]
*  I would like us to change that a bit. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3286.0s)]
*  I think that's the thing that's kind of missing in like this masculinity movement is fatherhood. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3288.0s)]
*  I hear a lot of guys talking about... [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3292.0s)]
*  Is there a masculinity movement going on? [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3294.0s)]
*  Apparently on these pods that we do. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3296.0s)]
*  Is that what it is? [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3298.0s)]
*  We're the manosphere, dude. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3299.0s)]
*  This is where fucking men hang out. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3300.0s)]
*  I don't think they consider us the manosphere, honestly. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3302.0s)]
*  I think the manosphere is like those pickup artist type dudes. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3304.0s)]
*  But that's the thing. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3307.0s)]
*  None of those guys have kids or they talk about like what it is to be a man. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3308.0s)]
*  And it's like, buddy, like you're missing out on the most important part of the entire process. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3311.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3316.0s)]
*  Like I want to hear the guys who have a bunch of kids telling me what it is to be a man. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3317.0s)]
*  Like to me, that's way more valuable. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3320.0s)]
*  And I feel like they're missing out on like the defining moment in a man's life. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3322.0s)]
*  Even bitches have alpha bitches. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3327.0s)]
*  There's like a leader of the bitches. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3329.0s)]
*  Oh, that's fire. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3331.0s)]
*  You know, so they're a leader of a movement. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3334.0s)]
*  But what kind of movement are you leading, bro? [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3336.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3338.0s)]
*  What kind of movement are you leading? [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3339.0s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3340.0s)]
*  Yeah. You go to an island full of bitches and you could become the king. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3342.0s)]
*  There's going to be somebody there. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3344.0s)]
*  Just find out who that head bitch is and say, yeah, time's up. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3346.0s)]
*  Those bitches are probably easier to lead. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3351.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, for sure. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3353.0s)]
*  They've been, that bitch has been leading them. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3354.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3356.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3357.0s)]
*  Yeah, just it's like I saw one CNN after the election. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3359.0s)]
*  They were talking about us is specific and they were talking about how there is this network of podcasts that are interconnected that has been financed like this, this huge corporate finance network of Black Rifle coffee. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3365.0s)]
*  It's like, you know, it's actually just a bunch of friends. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3382.0s)]
*  You fucking idiots. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3386.0s)]
*  We just happen to do each other's podcast. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3387.0s)]
*  But they're like trying to sort it out. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3389.0s)]
*  It's so funny when they support each other. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3391.0s)]
*  They go on each other's shows and they're all in this together. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3393.0s)]
*  Well, we need that on the left. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3396.0s)]
*  Like, good luck. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3398.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's cancel each other. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3400.0s)]
*  If you're fucking Ukraine flag is too small. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3402.0s)]
*  Yeah, six by six. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3404.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3408.0s)]
*  I think you guys are out of your mind. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3409.0s)]
*  You're not going to you're not going to sync up together. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3410.0s)]
*  You're you're in a suicide cult. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3412.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think that was the results of the election. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3414.0s)]
*  I don't think that they would like to believe this, but it was a rejection of what was happening. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3417.0s)]
*  I think the assumption is everybody just loves Trump and he's just this populace and every person voted for him is like, I just love everything about this guy. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3422.0s)]
*  But I actually think that a lot of people were just like, I don't like what's happening now. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3429.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3436.0s)]
*  And this current administration is saying that they don't want to change much that's happening now. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3437.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3441.0s)]
*  So I'm voting against that lack of change. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3442.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3444.0s)]
*  And I think it's important for them to realize that I talk about this a lot, especially with Charlotte on the pod. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3445.0s)]
*  And it's just like, you have to be reflective, like what the people are telling you. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3450.0s)]
*  Like when that the man, Gioni thing happened and the reaction by the people was to laugh at it. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3454.0s)]
*  Yeah, they were kind of pumped. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3459.0s)]
*  But you got to look at that and you got to pay very close attention to what people are feeling. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3462.0s)]
*  Don't tell them what they should feel and you know better and oh, we have to lead them to the water because they're too stupid to know how to find it. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3467.0s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3474.0s)]
*  They are disillusioned by the medical system. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3475.0s)]
*  And if you don't meet them there, you're never going to win ever. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3478.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3483.0s)]
*  And I feel like that's at least from talking to Trump. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3484.0s)]
*  That was something that I got from him is like, it doesn't seem like it when you see him on the news and shit, but he's like an acute listener. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3486.0s)]
*  Like he listens to what people are saying. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3492.0s)]
*  And he listens more importantly what they're feeling and he can tap into those feelings. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3495.0s)]
*  And I think that that's what people have had a lot of success in politics were able to do. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3500.0s)]
*  Barack did it. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3504.0s)]
*  Bill Clinton did it. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3505.0s)]
*  Probably maybe the best. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3506.0s)]
*  Bill might have been the best. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3508.0s)]
*  His ability to communicate to people what they were feeling. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3509.0s)]
*  I know you feel pain. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3513.0s)]
*  I do feel pain, Bill. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3514.0s)]
*  I'm here for you. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3515.0s)]
*  You are? [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3516.0s)]
*  I am. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3517.0s)]
*  I would love that. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3518.0s)]
*  You know, it was. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3519.0s)]
*  I'm going to be your leader. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3520.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3521.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3522.0s)]
*  You need to listen. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3523.0s)]
*  Well, I think what Trump's done that's really brilliant is bringing people like Tulsi Gabbard, Robert F. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3524.0s)]
*  Kennedy Jr., Cash Mattel, like bring in those people and you're like, you kind of get the idea of what it's like to be a leader. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3528.0s)]
*  But think about that decision, right? [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3536.0s)]
*  It's like those people are all echoing sentiments that the majority of Americans feel. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3537.0s)]
*  We do not trust the food. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3544.0s)]
*  Here's the guy who says the food is bad. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3546.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3549.0s)]
*  Maybe we should put them in control of the food. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3550.0s)]
*  Kind of like a simple thing. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3552.0s)]
*  I mean, I think that's what we're talking about. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3554.0s)]
*  I think that's what we're talking about. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3556.0s)]
*  I think that's what we're talking about. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3558.0s)]
*  Instead of going, well, this guy is the food doctor and we're going to hire the food doctor because he knows what food is good for you. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3560.0s)]
*  And you guys should just shut up and listen. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3566.0s)]
*  And I feel like there's a lot of this like top down on the left. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3568.0s)]
*  And I'm not trying to just like bag on the left. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3572.0s)]
*  I don't care really about that. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3575.0s)]
*  Like, I don't even care about the politics. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3576.0s)]
*  I care more about like where the cultural liquidity is. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3577.0s)]
*  It's like you can't talk down to people. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3580.0s)]
*  There's this whole thing about the food. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3584.0s)]
*  There's like Ivy League pretentiousness in the Democratic Party, I feel, where they're like, we know better and just you must be stupid if you don't agree with us. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3586.0s)]
*  And it's like, all right, well, I'm stupid. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3595.0s)]
*  I'm dumb. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3597.0s)]
*  I'm dumb, then. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3598.0s)]
*  So why doesn't somebody meet me where I'm stupid and start at least making me feel like I'm not an asshole for the way that I, you know, for my I guess you could say political leanings now. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3599.0s)]
*  Yeah, I feel like they need to meet. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3607.0s)]
*  And it's very, very important. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3609.0s)]
*  Yeah, I feel like they need to meet. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3610.0s)]
*  And it's very simple thing. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3611.0s)]
*  Make it a class issue and I think they win. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3612.0s)]
*  And say what you want about America. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3613.0s)]
*  But I think it's better if we have two president or two people running for president that we're stoked about. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3614.0s)]
*  And it's a really hard decision. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3615.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3616.0s)]
*  That would be wonderful. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3617.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3618.0s)]
*  That's not what we had. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3619.0s)]
*  We had one group of people that legitimately wanted to change things and then we're going to see what happens if they do. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3620.0s)]
*  But you're seeing weird stuff today that you never see before, which is like a real, real thing. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3622.0s)]
*  One of the things you're seeing is, I don't know if you saw the 22 different congresspeople who are all saying the exact same line with the word shit in it. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3625.0s)]
*  What was the line? [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3627.0s)]
*  So it's like, I don't know. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3628.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3629.0s)]

*  It's so nuts. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3681.0s)]
*  This is Think Tank politics. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3682.0s)]
*  When you see them all together, it's just like they have it on screens as tiles and they're [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3683.0s)]
*  all saying the same words. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3687.6s)]
*  They all have their own little flair they put on it. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3688.82s)]
*  Look at this. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3690.92s)]
*  Put your headphones on. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3691.92s)]
*  This is fucking bananas. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3692.92s)]
*  It's terrible. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3693.92s)]
*  It's hard to listen to. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3694.92s)]
*  It's okay. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3696.92s)]
*  It's a shit. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3697.92s)]
*  It's a shit. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3698.92s)]
*  You won't be able to. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3699.92s)]
*  You can't really tell. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3700.92s)]
*  It's like a crowd. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3701.92s)]
*  But when they had three of them, when it was the first three, it was like a huge crowd. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3702.92s)]
*  It was like a huge crowd. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3706.46s)]
*  But when they had three of them when it was the first first three was like it was Chuck Schumer and someone else. Yeah [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3707.46s)]
*  They they're saying the exact Elizabeth Warren and someone else. Yeah, they're saying the exact same words [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3715.54s)]
*  Yeah, the exact same subjects in the exact same order [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3721.2200000000003s)]
*  You guys are all reading off a script and you're trying by putting the word shit in there to be authentic [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3724.82s)]
*  Well shit ain't right to be specifically authentic. They're like, yeah to speak to working class people to the kids [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3730.62s)]
*  Yeah, and it it is kind of like bigoted in a weird way [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3737.16s)]
*  We're like though it feels like they're almost in a think tank like hey, listen these poor dummies [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3740.7599999999998s)]
*  They like it when you curse. Yeah, so if you use a few curse words in your speech [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3745.64s)]
*  They're gonna really relate to you. Yeah, and it's like no no, we actually need somebody disruptive [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3749.6s)]
*  We need somebody on the left that is [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3754.3199999999997s)]
*  They might speak like that [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3756.8399999999997s)]
*  But authentically speaks like that and is willing to disrupt even what's happening the left [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3757.96s)]
*  Because if you look at like what happened with the Trump and the movement like he disrupted the right the right looks very different now [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3761.92s)]
*  Then oh, yeah, no, no five ten years ago, right? Definitely. So I want like like a MAGA [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3766.66s)]
*  Democrat yeah, like for real like and and what is that? [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3771.98s)]
*  Like what do we at the at our baseline want right? We like abundance [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3775.1s)]
*  Tell me how great America is going to be in your version of it. You want to build Clinton talk that shit [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3779.44s)]
*  Like come out talking shit [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3785.66s)]
*  Bernie was talking shit and I want you to come out and if Trump can say we're gonna take Greenland [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3787.8999999999996s)]
*  There can be some den that goes one dollar eggs and straight-up says we're gonna subsidize it [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3792.5s)]
*  Subsidize corn you subsidize dairy you subsidize everything like why can we not subsidize it but say something that's actually gonna impact people now [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3798.7s)]
*  Trump's not gonna take Greenland [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3805.58s)]
*  So maybe you don't get the one dollar eggs, but you get this messaging across that you're actually trying to help people [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3806.86s)]
*  Mm-hmm, and you're gonna have to deal with those lobbies that are bankrolling you and that might piss them the fuck off [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3812.02s)]
*  But that's the disruption we need for you for us to trust you. You know what they really should do [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3817.28s)]
*  What's that? They really should have a strategic plan if we're spending three. What is it? 350 billion dollars went to Ukraine? [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3821.14s)]
*  What was the number? What are they saying? It was I don't know what the numbers some insane [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3827.8199999999997s)]
*  Let's say just let's just be conservative and say 200 billion [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3831.1s)]
*  Imagine if we spent 200 billion dollars in the United States in all of the crime ridden cities of the country [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3834.3399999999997s)]
*  Just completely overhauling them. All right, so here's my concern about that is how much do they spend in California on homelessness? [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3841.7s)]
*  24 billion and then like nothing changed right? No, they got worse. Oh, so good job. Awesome [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3850.18s)]
*  We could spend 36 billion, you know, like so there's also this idea like the current administration in these places [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3856.8199999999997s)]
*  Even with an abundance of money is not gonna make change. So you need somebody from inside from the left to go [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3863.9399999999996s)]
*  Hey, these people are corrupt on my team. We're gonna root out that corruption, but we are gonna take care of homelessness [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3869.62s)]
*  We are gonna make eggs cheaper [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3876.5s)]
*  We are gonna build fucking 10,000 affordable housing units so that the price of you know [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3878.06s)]
*  Your rent can go way down. There has to be something disruptive instead of hey, let's just go back to normal [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3883.58s)]
*  Let's not ruffle any feathers like let's do we shine. I reject the idea though that [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3889.18s)]
*  progress [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3895.02s)]
*  can't be had just because [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3896.38s)]
*  people have been corrupt and they've [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3899.02s)]
*  Abused money before I feel like you could farm it off to private corporations the same way [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3901.22s)]
*  With Halliburton during the Iraq war what did they do with a hell burnt and got no bid contracts to rebuild Iraq [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3906.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, and they did it they actually built built all the power plants that it need [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3912.46s)]
*  There's like a lot of waste and weird shit that went on over there. Yeah, you could do that with the inner cities [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3916.7200000000003s)]
*  But you could have you say did a good job. No [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3920.98s)]
*  I'm just saying like they actually did get paid to rebuild city so you can get a private sector that would would actually make money [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3924.44s)]
*  We've really been being bureaucracy [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3931.6800000000003s)]
*  So you see I'm saying like instead of it being something where it's like, California [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3934.2s)]
*  They're they're taking the homelessness when nothing gets done, but money keeps pumping into it [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3937.68s)]
*  Yeah, no, the only way you get paid is based on results. Oh, so you have a contract with incentives based on results [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3941.56s)]
*  Yes, and that is the problem. There is no you have to lower crime. You have to lower crime. You have to lower [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=3948.72s)]

*  You know, I went to the Carmine Street Recreation Center [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4158.76s)]
*  That's where I played basketball and it was this beautiful place is amazing oasis [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4160.96s)]

*  I'm like I got to like donate money to like [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4174.200000000001s)]
*  They've they created this place where there was a lot of kids in those programs [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4176.44s)]
*  Did they might have ended up doing some fucked up shit man, and they had a place where they could go [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4179.5599999999995s)]
*  there was like a safe haven yeah, and [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4184.62s)]
*  Look at us talking like some libs on this pot. Well, I think we are liberal. Of course we are [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4187.32s)]
*  Misconception of all this is that we don't want this place to be better, but there have to be certain changes [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4193.32s)]
*  I'm socially about as liberal as it gets. Yeah, and I'm a firm believer in a social safety net, too [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4198.08s)]
*  I'm a firm believer in welfare and food stamps. I just think there's a way [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4204.16s)]
*  There's a way to address the root of the problem, which is people with no hope [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4209.84s)]
*  And you got the way to do that is you got to give them hope you have to make it safer for them to live [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4214.68s)]
*  Where they live you have to make it healthier for them to live where they live and then I don't think it would cost [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4219.12s)]
*  That much to provide guidance for a bunch of kids that want guidance [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4223.8s)]
*  And if you have good solid role models that know how to do that kind of stuff [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4227.44s)]
*  And they can all work together and build a program and then what those kids wind up being like really talented musicians or really [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4231.48s)]
*  talented athletes or whatever the fuck it is what's happening the mother shit classes like like what's [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4237.5599999999995s)]
*  What's happening there like I feel like you you've created environment where is like these guys can make enough money to survive [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4243.08s)]
*  Which is a very hard thing to do as a fledgling comedian, right? [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4248.98s)]
*  And some of these guys who are door guys they're starting to get spots around even like some of my guys [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4252.94s)]
*  You know like obviously Derek Poston is like making real money [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4257.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah, right and learning how to flourish as a comedian instead of working 60 hours at a job and then doing comedy [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4260.86s)]
*  when he potentially can right and [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4267.099999999999s)]
*  You hopefully get to see this artistry grow like I've watched Derek explode as a fucking comedian like this guy's so fucking funny [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4270.099999999999s)]

*  But that's the type of environment that I imagine that you can curate now [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4286.58s)]
*  You're very benevolent right, but you would hope that the government can create that same level of benevolence without leaking too much money [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4289.78s)]
*  Yeah [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4296.98s)]
*  It just it has to be done for the right reasons the right way with the right people [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4297.48s)]
*  And that was what we pulled off of the mothership because I was able to get everybody from California [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4301.5199999999995s)]
*  But also I knew that that was the formula because it was kind of like the heart and soul of the store [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4305.82s)]
*  It was like the people that were the coolest people that were running things over there bring them over here [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4310.099999999999s)]

*  Every light turned green right when we got to it every light turned it just none of it makes sense on paper [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4321.46s)]
*  Yeah [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4327.86s)]
*  If you thought about like the idea behind dumping a ton of money in a club and your ultimate goal is to break even [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4328.38s)]
*  But that's government government shouldn't make money right the ultimate goal should be to break even well your ultimate goal [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4339.18s)]
*  Shouldn't be everything is a money venture right so the club is not a money venture right the club is a artistic [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4345.66s)]

*  Got it [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4506.9s)]
*  Like yeah, they'll wear this yeah, my boy Phil found is this dude [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4509.179999999999s)]
*  Who's a private shopper and he found the spot to go? [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4512.7s)]
*  He's like one of them celebrity shopper yes, and he found me the spot so and I was on it and uh [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4515.42s)]
*  So and I'm watching the like in the interviews the interviews are really fun like a lot of these comics are really green and they're [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4521.099999999999s)]
*  Going in there and trying to find something but like the interview portion [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4526.219999999999s)]
*  And I'm probably saying something that everybody already knows, but when I watch kill turn [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4529.38s)]
*  I'm watching it in clip form right so I'm seeing like these like 60 second versions right, but [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4532.58s)]
*  What I thought was really interesting about the interviews is [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4537.34s)]
*  There's a real generosity with Tony right he's I don't know if even the comics realize this like he's trying to get you to [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4541.34s)]
*  Write your first good joke [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4547.3s)]
*  He's asking you questions where you don't have to be funny, but they are funny because you're just speaking truthfully [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4549.58s)]
*  Right and it is generous [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4556.3s)]
*  It's easy to just like you could bang on every single one of the people that go up there right [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4558.38s)]
*  But it's that's not exactly what's happening sometimes of course people are gonna get jokes [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4563.02s)]
*  But there's this moment where like you get to watch some of these guys [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4566.38s)]
*  Like hopefully they're realizing they're like oh I am oh that is a kind of funny thing about me [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4569.9400000000005s)]
*  And that's like the first kernel of like where they'll write their first good joke [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4574.78s)]
*  Yeah, and it's a really cool thing to witness and [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4579.18s)]
*  Yeah, there's a couple guys that went up and like there's one guy like his joke sucked [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4582.7s)]
*  But he had something like I just kept watching him [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4586.34s)]
*  Yeah, and I was like you're gonna be good like I hope you keep doing this because you're gonna be good and like we started [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4589.46s)]
*  Asking the questions and just this Mexican guy from San Antonio [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4595.820000000001s)]
*  He works at like office Depot, and there was something funny about like hold on so like it was like something about like you know [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4598.22s)]
*  He's selling like papers, and it's like oh, so there's like a Mexican guy like people are asking for paper like there's just like [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4603.820000000001s)]
*  It's like [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4608.6s)]
*  So but it was just really cool to see it happen and like it reminded me these early stages of comedy where [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4614.92s)]
*  You're putting together these things that you think are funny and funny is kind of already existing in you you know and [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4621.08s)]
*  Yeah, it was just like it was a cool aspect of the show that I'm sure the people that watch it [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4628.04s)]
*  This is a massively successful show so they're familiar [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4631.84s)]
*  But maybe the people that don't watch it aren't don't know about this [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4634.16s)]
*  They just think Tony's just roasting people and it's he's he's not it's a very generous thing to do [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4638.2s)]
*  Yeah, it is well Tony loves comedy. Yeah loves comedy to the point where he's always writing lines for people backstage [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4643.64s)]
*  She's always like giving people tags and he's always talking about did you do that bit like I love that bit like he's a [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4651.38s)]
*  Super supportive yeah with comedy and he loves when the guys who do his show like William Montgomery [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4658.44s)]
*  When they start to flourish they start killing it on the road he loves that he fucking he he's actually put together a tour now [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4665.16s)]
*  The killers of kill Tony and they're doing like fucking theaters [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4671.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, and they're killing these guys are good man Ari Matty is fucking I was talking to him yesterday man [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4674.7s)]
*  He's fucking smart. He's funny. He's super ambitious. He's great. He wants to be an American so bad. He's a fun hang [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4680.26s)]
*  He's got a perspective on so like [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4687.18s)]
*  Yeah, he's always an MMA fighter. I remember seeing three times Wow Wow Wow. He's a big guy, too [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4690.38s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, but like yeah, I remember like he even had a joke yesterday [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4697.06s)]
*  I mean whatever it will come out [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4700.46s)]
*  But like it was funny like he tapped into something at the end of the bit that he did when he does the minute and then in [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4702.06s)]
*  the interview [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4707.700000000001s)]
*  It really became the thing [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4710.02s)]
*  You know [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4712.820000000001s)]
*  Because what you get to watch is like he's like he's a veteran comic like he's probably been doing it 10 or 12 years [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4714.06s)]
*  right, so like you get into real comedian mode around 10, right and [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4719.46s)]
*  You got to witness live what we do backstage [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4724.74s)]
*  Which is like I like that idea [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4727.74s)]
*  Why did you do this and he said a line at the end of when we're just doing the interview? [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4729.34s)]
*  That that I think is gonna be what this joke builds out into I don't want to give it away [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4734.34s)]
*  Watch it but to me like that part of the process is so fun [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4739.3s)]
*  Oh, yeah, and it is I don't know if people know this about us like it is really fun to like work on someone else's bit [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4742.9s)]
*  Like it there is it's almost there's almost like more freedom because you're less attached to it [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4749.0199999999995s)]
*  You know [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4753.46s)]
*  Like if you have something and you're like telling me the idea [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4754.04s)]
*  Like I'm not you have you're attached like a direction for it [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4756.22s)]
*  And I'm just coming from all these other places and what if my tag bombs it doesn't matter [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4759.18s)]
*  it's you're the one going to do it, but it is this exciting thing when you have a Colonel and [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4762.7s)]
*  Yeah, that this this moment happened with it and you can even see him go. Oh shit. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4767.42s)]
*  You know next level of it. Yeah, anyway, they emerge right? [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4772.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, the new chapters in your bits in new paragraphs. They emerge. It's the best and for me [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4775.86s)]
*  It's like I need to talk to get it out [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4781.38s)]
*  I'm not like a sit at home and like I write the ideas like I need to I need to be I got this idea [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4784.179999999999s)]
*  And what do you think about this and then you have to like give me pushback on it and then right [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4790.099999999999s)]
*  Confronting that pushback is like [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4794.94s)]
*  Where the bit develops for me, right? Right, right? That's the beauty of like the audience not laughing [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4797.38s)]
*  Well, that's why you like New York City when you to Miami you were like, it's too nice [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4802.58s)]
*  No, it was like life was beautiful. Everybody was caring about family and everything and it was just so comfortable [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4806.42s)]
*  And I was like I didn't have any like resistance. I need so funny like I'm using that chaos [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4811.5s)]
*  I need the opposite. What do you mean your whole life is resistance? [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4816.46s)]
*  Yeah, I don't like the resistance with people [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4820.36s)]
*  I don't I don't want to deal with people's bullshit. That's my own bullshit. That's my ice bath. Yeah [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4824.5s)]
*  I do 30 minutes on the sixth rate [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4832.62s)]
*  Bro, we better have a bulletproof vest. Yeah. Yeah the uh, anyway, so you were saying about like hope [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4835.7s)]
*  That it is interesting and I see like I [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4841.34s)]
*  See that for comics, especially here. There's this idea of like getting on the show and seeing a pathway to success [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4844.78s)]
*  It's a real pathway [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4851.54s)]
*  It's a real pathway to a career and you've seen many many many people go through it like Cam Patterson [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4852.7s)]
*  Yeah, David Lucas these guys all have careers now. Yeah, he had a funny bit too. Like Kemp's funny. Yeah, he's funny [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4857.82s)]
*  I think there's a little bit of a hindrance in that one minute a week because it's like you spent so much time working on [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4864.42s)]
*  That one minute that maybe you don't spend enough time tightening up [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4870.66s)]
*  So that's what our whatever you have when you're on the road [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4873.46s)]
*  I was like what you give this minute out and it goes out to the whole comedy world [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4876.38s)]
*  Mm-hmm, and I asked that's what I was asking Ari. I was like, can you still do those bits? [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4881.46s)]
*  Like cuz some of these aren't finished. They're just the fucking beginning of it, right? [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4886.78s)]
*  Right, don't let those go like right build on them as long as you're building on them [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4891.5s)]
*  As long as you got more to it and it's better now. I think people want it [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4895.74s)]
*  I think it also there's this understanding those guys are on the come-up and they're putting it all together and [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4898.78s)]
*  I think there's a certain amount of times you do it where you got to eventually leave [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4905.26s)]
*  I say that but then there's William Montgomery who does it every fucking week [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4909.58s)]
*  Yeah, Williams got this style that even if his jokes suck, it's funny because they even because he gets angry [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4913.18s)]
*  He gets angry at himself. He gets angry at the crowd and then he gets funny, bro [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4918.94s)]
*  Have you been seeing Brian Holtzman lately? No, no, no. Oh my god. He's the sweetest guy by the way [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4923.46s)]
*  I'm he is so different than his onstage monster the onstage Brian Holtzman. He needs a name in a different thing [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4929.4s)]
*  It's like there's a different human that comes out when he's on stage [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4935.46s)]
*  You wouldn't think that he's a complete psychopath in real life. He's just the kindest sweetest guy [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4938.28s)]
*  Wonderful. I love him to death [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4943.92s)]
*  He's all hugs and joy and smiles and he's always helping people into a detriment [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4946.04s)]
*  like one of the things about his show is we've had to like [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4951.62s)]
*  Stop some of the people that he allows open for him [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4953.92s)]
*  Because it's people that haven't done comedy and forever and still know him [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4957.12s)]
*  Yeah, you think I could do a set sure come on [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4960.2s)]
*  Yeah, and then they eat dick for 10 minutes and the crowd gets tortured [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4962.639999999999s)]
*  So Adam had to put the brakes on that but yeah, but he himself is on fire [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4966.76s)]

*  This like random collection of music and then he then this Fetty Wap song comes on right and [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4988.04s)]
*  I want you to be mine again, baby, and I look over at the bar and I just see him kind of mouth [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=4994.04s)]

*  Yeah, I don't think anybody would guess your green room music [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5014.36s)]
*  Like if they walked into your green room and they heard the music playing there's nobody that would go [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5017.56s)]
*  Oh, yeah, Joe picked this song. Maybe nobody it might be one or two songs that pop up 90s like deep cut rap [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5022.58s)]

*  sitting on a toilet on stage pretending he's sitting on a toilet grunting like [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5627.06s)]
*  And then he looks up at the middle people are getting up in droves. Oh, yeah [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5632.18s)]
*  This generally clears the room [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5635.94s)]
*  Like it's right back to it, but I mean it never lost his timing [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5638.62s)]
*  Never lost his composure and it wasn't that it wasn't funny [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5643.94s)]
*  It was me and Fitzsimmons were in the back of the room me and Fitzsimmons were Greg from back in Boston [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5647.46s)]
*  Greg and I started a week apart from each other get out of here. We've been friends since we were like I was 21 [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5652.78s)]
*  I think he was 22 or 23. Yeah [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5657.7s)]
*  Yeah, we've been friends from the very very beginning. Yeah [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5660.099999999999s)]
*  So Greg and I were both open micers at the time and we just knew that Hicks was coming [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5664.0599999999995s)]
*  We wanted to watch and we sat in the back of the room. We were fucking [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5669.26s)]
*  Crying crying laughing. So there was like 50 people left 10 comics 40 savages [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5672.9800000000005s)]
*  I just thought this guy was genius. Yeah, and then the other 200 plus people they all left [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5680.02s)]
*  They all left 200 is crazy to leave bro [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5684.54s)]
*  It was a it was a bloodbath like half the crowd more than half the crowd left [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5687.46s)]
*  Yeah, you know, it's like three quarters of the crowd. That's a large percentage. It was a large percentage [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5692.34s)]
*  It wasn't much left but Fitzsimmons and I fondly talked about that day like he never lost his cool. He almost like [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5697.34s)]
*  He I don't know when he knew he had pancreatic cancer because he died a few years later [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5704.14s)]
*  but he kind of seemed like a guy that [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5709.22s)]
*  Whatever the fear of bombing and whatever this thing of failure that wasn't on his mind [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5713.38s)]
*  Hmm, it didn't bother him. Yeah, I was like when you have limited time. That's I wonder if that's what it was [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5720.26s)]
*  I don't know if he knew already. Yeah, but he was so calm up there. Yeah [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5724.94s)]
*  You know, but funny very funny [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5730.66s)]
*  But just he changed the way people wanted to do comedy because everybody after that wanted to be profound [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5733.179999999999s)]
*  Yes, nobody wanted to be profound before that. Yeah, they just want to get big laughs [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5738.94s)]
*  Yeah, then all sudden everybody wanted to be profound. Yeah, you know, it was interesting like he became like this poet [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5742.46s)]
*  Yeah, you know you see trends like that pop up [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5748.94s)]
*  Oh, yeah stylistically people are so influential that like it changes the way people do their comedy and [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5751.82s)]
*  it's tricky because like [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5757.78s)]
*  You can only be great at the thing you do [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5759.8s)]
*  That's how I feel at least about it [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5763.26s)]
*  Yeah [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5764.94s)]
*  If you are profound and then profound comedy is popular then you will be really good at it [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5765.22s)]
*  But if you're a silly goose, right? It's not worth trying to be profound, right? [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5769.78s)]
*  Because you being silly is gonna be the best version of you and the people will appreciate that the most also [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5775.34s)]
*  You can't trick people they know even even if they're not aware of it. They know they know something's off [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5781.42s)]
*  Yeah, something's off. That's that the honesty in it. Yeah, there's a brutal honesty in it [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5786.14s)]
*  Like we can sometimes they'll even laugh, but they know that you're lying [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5791.82s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, you know, like yeah, they know that it's not real and like it exists for maybe 10 15 minutes [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5796.14s)]
*  But like I think it kind of gets exposed once you get into those hour-long sets. Mm-hmm [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5801.9800000000005s)]
*  For sure you gotta be you gotta be who you are right [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5806.5s)]
*  Yeah, it has to has to gel together with you [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5810.22s)]
*  You have to be into what you're doing if you're not into what you're doing [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5813.74s)]
*  You can't say the same words with the same inflection without the same mindset [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5816.92s)]
*  Like if your mindset is off, they fucking know man. It doesn't matter what your timing is [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5821.22s)]
*  They know they know you're not locked in so they're not locked in like how come you didn't bring me in? [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5826.860000000001s)]
*  You know, yeah [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5831.18s)]
*  When someone's killing like last night when Holtsman was killing and me and Shane were laughing we were locked into whatever this psychopath was talking about [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5832.3s)]
*  He's talking about drowning people. I was like [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5838.74s)]
*  He's so out of his fucking mind. It was so funny. Yeah, it was so funny [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5842.1s)]
*  But you give them that you let them take your mind for a ride if it's real to them [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5847.38s)]
*  Yeah, that's the thing about Joey that I've always admired is like it's it's pure [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5851.22s)]
*  It's authentic like you can kind of get away with whatever you want if it's pure [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5856.5s)]
*  Yeah, and when we know you're faking and and you're doing something that makes me feel uncomfortable now [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5860.14s)]
*  I'm double uncomfortable right I can be uncomfortable if it's real to you [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5866.54s)]
*  Yeah, I can I can sustain that like you might be talking about some shit that makes me feel a little weird [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5870.3s)]
*  But it's real to you. So I go okay. I'm gonna rock with you on this [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5874.860000000001s)]
*  This is this is a pure version of of your art [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5877.58s)]
*  But yeah, you don't want to lie to people man [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5881.3s)]
*  Yeah, also if you do it then you're stuck now. That's how you do art [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5883.860000000001s)]
*  You lie to people you're always trying to like concoct some new [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5888.78s)]
*  fucking weird [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5894.34s)]
*  version of yourself [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5896.66s)]
*  What's what's what what's gonna sell more? You're a pop music star now [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5898.42s)]
*  Like what he's that's what you're like you like doing pop music comedy [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5903.94s)]
*  But there are there there are people that like get attached to what works [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5907.66s)]
*  Yeah, they can't run away [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5910.58s)]
*  They're like scared to run away with and I kind of empathy for it because it's like you probably struggle for so long you find [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5912.22s)]
*  Something that works and you're like, okay, finally, I'm able to make some money finally. I'm able to have some security but [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5916.76s)]
*  You've got to keep growing past it [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5922.84s)]
*  I think generally those people are self-obsessed to in a bad way where they think about themselves and success [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5924.92s)]
*  Rather than the thing they're doing. Yeah, like what is the thing I'm doing? Yeah, the thing I'm doing [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5931.72s)]
*  I'm trying to create something that's good that works [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5936.0s)]
*  I'm trying to make it the best version of whatever fuck it is. Yeah, so how do I do that? [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5938.0s)]
*  You can't be thinking about yourself and do that. That's why thieves can't write [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5942.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, because the mentality being a thief is I want that idea for myself. Yeah, it's not like I want to create [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5946.24s)]
*  You're not addictive to creating right which is like the coolest part about this [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5953.08s)]
*  we have to create whatever the fuck we want and [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5956.96s)]
*  If you get to a point like luckily where you get a couple bucks in the bank [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5959.72s)]
*  Those creations should be even more specific to you [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5964.04s)]
*  Yeah, right because you're not doing it so you can buy another house, right? [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5967.32s)]
*  like I'm doing because you truly spent 20 years your life trying to get good at something and [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5970.5599999999995s)]
*  Then you can create whatever the fuck you want and also those those new things those new things that pop out [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5974.88s)]
*  They feel like gifts from the universe like a new bit. That's a banger [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5981.0s)]
*  It's like where did this come for this came from the universe that should exist before you [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5984.92s)]
*  That's why I always try to say like comedy is there and then we stumble. Yes [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5988.88s)]
*  You gotta find you're not you're not making it and when you're making it it feels too contrived [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5992.6s)]
*  But the comedy exists brah, I gotta pee so bad. Let's pause pause real quick. Yeah right back and pee [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=5997.0s)]

*  You could totally do it you could do that monologue on SNL. Yeah, you stand up [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6029.6s)]
*  Yeah, you could do stand up brave for that monologue. Yeah, there's brave guy. Yeah, cuz he has a lot to lose [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6033.8s)]
*  Perception wise like maybe he doesn't care but that's where like bravery comes in like when you got nothing to lose [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6041.72s)]
*  It's like yeah, you can kind of say whatever the fuck you want. It doesn't really matter [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6046.080000000001s)]
*  He's kind of grandfathered in oh really he's Woody Harrelson, but you don't think it could affect him at all [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6048.64s)]
*  But I don't think anymore [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6054.72s)]
*  I think the world's kind of woken up the the fact that first of all he's accurate like you really can't attack what he's saying [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6055.96s)]
*  Yeah, you know, so like you don't think he should be saying it. Okay. Well, that's kind of debatable. Yeah, that's on you [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6062.2s)]
*  Yeah, I think you can say whatever the fuck he wants in that regard [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6069.16s)]
*  Yeah, you know, yeah, cuz it's like at this point. It's like who doesn't think he's accurate [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6072.36s)]
*  Yeah, like you're in denial if you don't think he's accurate. This is a problem that Democrats have right now [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6077.88s)]
*  Is that the Trump administration what they're uncovering with Doge like all this waste fraud and abuse [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6082.78s)]
*  Whatever whatever you want to categorize it as and I'm sure there's a bunch of things that fall into different categories [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6090.22s)]
*  Yeah, but the the Democrats aren't acknowledging that it's a problem at all [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6094.86s)]
*  Well, they're not saying when you find this building in San Antonio that they spent two billion dollars on it [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6099.42s)]
*  It's completely empty and it's getting you know, a million dollars a month or whatever the fuck it's getting and where's that money going? [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6103.9s)]

*  Like there I don't think there's any American out there that is [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6115.54s)]
*  supportive of waste fraud and corruption [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6119.38s)]
*  It should be a bipartisan issue, right? Right, like it's a very easy thing to get on board with right and this is where I feel like I [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6122.82s)]
*  Feel like Elon's being a little antagonistic [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6131.82s)]
*  I have a lot of respect for you. I don't get me wrong [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6133.86s)]
*  But like it's becoming easier to be a bipartisan issue in the way that it's communicated [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6135.62s)]
*  Whereas like having that like political decorum [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6141.86s)]
*  Like having that ability to pull everybody into this thing might be a little bit more effective on an issue that we can all get [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6145.54s)]
*  Behind there's no American that wants waste fraud and corruption. I hate that this is becoming bipartisan [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6152.78s)]
*  Mmm, it drives me fucking crazy because on the surface nobody wants the waste, right? [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6157.58s)]
*  Like both Democrats should be so this shouldn't be they should be booing or whatever the fuck was happening at that like [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6163.46s)]
*  Hearing last night even hearing he was like addressing the Senate [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6169.34s)]
*  This shouldn't be a union. It should be everybody going. Hey, we agree. This is fucked up [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6171.54s)]
*  This is happening in some of our [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6177.74s)]
*  Regions or whatever it is like where you're responsible for those constituents. What's that called your if you're a congressman your your district [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6180.26s)]
*  We need to be better about this. We need to fix this [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6187.62s)]
*  We got to take this on the chin and we agree and it could be this great [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6189.88s)]
*  Revolution in America that could really support everybody and it's become this fucking bipartisan issue [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6193.66s)]
*  I understand there's like a lot of currency and like making the opposition look radioactive. I get that [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6198.98s)]
*  but this is where you wish that there was like this some sort of [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6203.78s)]
*  Masterful communication version of this instead of a little bit more of like this like putting the knife in and twisting a little [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6208.66s)]
*  Yeah, no, I agree. I agree on both sides. I think [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6214.86s)]
*  People are really foolish [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6219.78s)]
*  Spending all their time just attacking the ideas of the other party instead of promoting really good ideas of your own. Amen [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6221.5s)]
*  and [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6228.06s)]
*  The thing about this whole doge thing is it's such a lightning rod [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6229.3s)]
*  And one of the reasons why it's such a lightning rod is because these politicians are being pressured [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6232.42s)]
*  To try to keep a lot of this spending because a lot of the spending is it's all shenanigans [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6236.900000000001s)]
*  It's moving around thousands of different NGOs and you're talking about billions and billions and billions of dollars that we're going somewhere [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6243.3s)]
*  So people were profiting people were people had jobs and they want to keep all those jobs [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6251.5s)]
*  They want to keep that money flowing in even the bullshit money as much as they can [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6256.1s)]
*  So there's fucking court orders and there's lawsuits and this Supreme Court just stopped a 1.9 billion dollar [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6259.18s)]
*  Freeze on something or something that just came up. It was today. Hmm, so there's like legal battles about all this stuff [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6266.14s)]
*  You're going to have a lot of confusion in that regard [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6273.780000000001s)]
*  But I think it's important one of the things they're doing is they're highlighting the ridiculous things like they're highlighting the [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6277.26s)]
*  250 million dollars on transgender animal studies [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6284.3s)]
*  Yeah [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6287.14s)]
*  Four point seven trillion that they can't account for the way that he was saying it. Did you watch it? I mean, it's hilarious [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6287.780000000001s)]
*  Oh, you gotta watch him talk about it. It's I'm sure it's amazing and I will I will watch I just didn't have I was busy [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6293.580000000001s)]
*  last night, but it's like [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6299.900000000001s)]
*  there's there's also a way to [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6301.700000000001s)]
*  to really clearly [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6305.700000000001s)]
*  Express to people that there's legitimate use for aid and this isn't really USAID [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6307.9s)]
*  It's you a unit United States Agency for International Development. If you're worried about foreign aid, I [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6314.3s)]
*  Fully completely agree. We should spend money in third world countries building wells [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6320.099999999999s)]
*  We should spend money trying to get food to poor people and that's not what this program right? [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6324.86s)]
*  That's not what this is about [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6329.38s)]
*  And if it's about like this is exercising care for people and and providing free clinics for people and impoverished areas [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6330.22s)]
*  Yeah, we should spend on that. But also that's not where this money's going [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6336.9s)]
*  A lot of this is regime overthrowing money. This is regime change money. A lot of this is like money [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6341.0199999999995s)]
*  That's being propped up. They're sending money to the Taliban every fucking week [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6347.099999999999s)]
*  Right, like this is crazy. Like you have to understand what this really is [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6350.44s)]
*  so what we have to do I think as Americans is [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6353.54s)]
*  Look, you got a president. He's your president whether you like it or not. That's your president for four years [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6358.0199999999995s)]
*  Let's hope he does a great job. Yeah, wouldn't you want him to do the great job? [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6362.5s)]
*  The captain of the ship and I want to hit the rocks. Yeah, let's hope he gets us into a beautiful harbor [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6366.1s)]
*  Absolutely. So together that doesn't mean the Democrats can't win in four years, but yeah, you can't win doing this [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6370.620000000001s)]
*  You can't win all saying this shit ain't right and then all of you say the exact same thing [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6376.700000000001s)]
*  Well now I know who's on the take now. I know who's got the script [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6381.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I know who doesn't have a fucking mind of their own [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6385.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you have to read the script that whatever corporate daddy filed onto your desk. It's think tank politics [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6387.820000000001s)]
*  They need a real leader and those real leaders are all pussyhounds and they're all gonna that's the problem [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6393.98s)]
*  They all got skeletons [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6403.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's gotta come from outside [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6405.5s)]
*  Yeah, I wonder like or they got to be a guy like Trump who could take the hits that's and and and keep on trucking [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6407.94s)]
*  You need to have like a very strong Constitution to do that. I don't understand his Constitution mean you go through the same shit [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6413.5s)]
*  Yeah, but his is beyond they shot him dude. Yeah, they haven't shot you [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6419.28s)]
*  Not only they shoot him [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6422.7s)]
*  Inside that's the problem. That's part of the problem. Yeah, but not only do they shoot him [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6426.94s)]
*  But people forgot about it in two weeks. Yeah, and [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6432.18s)]
*  Along he didn't get shot enough to this like people were talking about his ear [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6436.46s)]
*  They're like, oh, but it doesn't look that shot and it's like there's so many people that think that he rigged it that he did [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6440.18s)]
*  It on purpose that he staged it [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6445.8s)]
*  He staged like a bullet coming making his ear like they don't understand accuracy come on especially with iron sights [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6447.94s)]
*  You know, you didn't even have a scope on the rifle [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6455.179999999999s)]
*  So I do you know what iron sights are? Okay. So like say if you have a pistol [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6457.86s)]
*  Yeah, and the back of the pistol where the handle is. Yeah, there's a little thing that you're supposed to look through [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6462.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and there's a little post. Yeah front and you line the two of them up like that [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6466.9s)]
*  Yeah, and he's shooting 140 yards with iron sights. Yeah [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6470.66s)]
*  You can't just nick someone's ear, yeah, you'll hit their fucking head you blow their brains out [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6474.5s)]
*  Accidentally, how much you have to account for gravity at that distance? You don't you know, that's really short. There's a short distance [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6480.26s)]
*  That's why you can like put the post on it [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6485.9800000000005s)]
*  If you wanted to go long distance, then you would want a scope you want a high-powered scope and you would also use ballistic software [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6488.160000000001s)]
*  So ballistic software is like you would apply [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6494.540000000001s)]
*  Like there's like a watch that has it built in actually the Garmin tactics X [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6498.42s)]
*  tactics eight rather [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6503.54s)]
*  So you you would take this ballistic software you calculate the distance [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6505.379999999999s)]
*  So there's a you would use a rangefinder the rate which he had by the way [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6510.7s)]
*  He had a fucking rate. He was walking around with a rangefinder before the they saw him with a rangefinder [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6514.54s)]
*  They didn't even arrest him somebody let him on that roof. They fucking gave him that gun. That's what I think [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6519.219999999999s)]
*  The rangefinder would say 500 yards. So then you would set your sight for 500 yards [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6524.0199999999995s)]
*  Accordingly when you're right. Yeah, so you're you're you're you're [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6531.74s)]
*  Your application. Yeah some scopes you can actually sync up your scope with your app [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6536.139999999999s)]
*  So it'll put the reticle it'll put the crosshairs exactly where you need to aim for the bullet to drop [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6542.219999999999s)]
*  Exactly. Exactly that makes sense. So the reticle does the the X would move up and down accordingly [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6549.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, exactly, but at that distance you're saying that there isn't too much. No, there's no and he's also elevated [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6555.139999999999s)]
*  It's a straight shot. Yeah pre pre me and maybe a very slight drop because it's only like a [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6560.38s)]
*  millisecond [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6565.58s)]
*  Hits him is a very slight drop at that but when you get to like significant distances like 400 yards 500 yards [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6566.22s)]
*  It's a factor. Yeah, like you hold high like say if you have [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6573.54s)]
*  So if you're zeroed say if I'm shooting a deer and my rifle zeroed at a hundred yards [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6578.18s)]
*  That means at a hundred yards it shoots exactly where that crosshairs is but but the deer is 300 yards [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6583.22s)]
*  I'll hold it at the top of his back [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6588.82s)]
*  Because you know that's gonna come down. I know it's gonna drop. This is with bows or this is what knows [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6591.06s)]
*  We're rifle and then with bows. I imagine it's even more with bows [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6594.78s)]
*  It's you have to be very very sure because there's so much drop. There's so much drop. Yeah. Yeah, there's so much drop like I have [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6598.26s)]
*  A rangefinder that's not just a rangefinder [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6607.7s)]
*  It's called a full draw so loop hold full draw five and what it does is it doesn't just [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6610.42s)]
*  Put the reticle and tell me the exact distance says I'm not aiming with this [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6616.22s)]
*  This is just giving me the distance, but it also shows me a line [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6619.9400000000005s)]
*  Where the peak of the arrow height is because the arrow arcs right? [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6623.660000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so what I'm doing is I'm shooting through trees sometimes like I'm trying to shoot an animal [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6628.46s)]
*  And I'm shooting through a gap in the trees so you have to make sure that on the drop it passes through that gap in the [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6634.06s)]
*  tree [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6640.22s)]
*  Exactly yeah, like there's a video of me hunting with cam. We're hunting in Utah [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6643.22s)]
*  And it was for under armor back when he was with under armor. Yeah, and I had to shoot this elk [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6649.58s)]
*  Through trees I threw a shot it through like it's a video you can see the arrow go [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6655.740000000001s)]
*  Right through this it's a month about probably one of the beautiful shots [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6662.22s)]
*  I've ever made yeah, and I made it on camera because I was kind of freaking out [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6665.1s)]
*  I got a hunt on camera like hunting is a big thing for a celebrity to be doing your hunting [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6668.5s)]
*  Yeah, but you're also gonna hunt on camera your camera with a bow and arrow [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6672.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, so I was like super locked in and it was just it was perfect [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6676.38s)]
*  It was just magical how that arrow went right through this gap. Yeah, just thread the needle and right in the heart [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6681.02s)]
*  It was perfect with perfect shot like exactly where you're wrong right behind the shoulder right up here [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6687.22s)]
*  It was like double lungs in the top of the heart [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6692.9s)]
*  Whoo-hoo [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6695.9s)]
*  And then you got to carry that bitch. Yeah, we got to chop it up first. You're not carrying it [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6697.5s)]
*  That's the thing. That's the thing that like I never accounted for I was watching [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6701.78s)]
*  I don't know if it was some video you posted or maybe was cam [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6705.42s)]
*  But like I always thought about the hunting part like okay, let's find it. Let's track it [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6708.219999999999s)]
*  Let's shoot it, but I never thought about getting home with all the meat. Oh, yeah, man. That seems so [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6712.799999999999s)]
*  It's very hard [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6719.66s)]
*  What we do is way easier than what some guys do some guys do public land solo [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6721.06s)]
*  Backpack elk hunting so they're throwing the shit in the backpack. They have a pack so they'll take like a pack like [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6729.9800000000005s)]
*  Great pack is like XO mountain gear. So a great company that makes packs and they have different frames based on your height [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6737.38s)]
*  It's all made so you can carry a lot of weight on your body a lot of it sits on your hips [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6744.1s)]
*  Yeah, it's all like [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6748.78s)]
*  Wait, so you're not just genius Lee and if you pull up like XO mountain gear [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6751.219999999999s)]
*  Backpacks like they have specific packs that are designed so you can carry a hundred pounds on your back, right? [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6757.179999999999s)]
*  Like as comfortably as you can but it's fucking brutal [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6762.66s)]
*  So these guys might hike in yeah, I'm not no bullshit [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6767.38s)]
*  Right, so that's what it looks like. Yeah, see all these packs [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6771.86s)]
*  So [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6774.54s)]
*  Get the picture of those guys when they have it on their back Jamie the one above that [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6775.62s)]
*  Yeah that one right there [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6778.7s)]
*  So that's what it would look like for two dudes who are carrying their whole camp on their back [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6779.74s)]
*  So they probably have their tent in there. They have their sleeping bag in there [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6784.22s)]
*  They have food in there for a week like you got freeze-dried food [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6788.46s)]
*  Generally speaking guys bring like mount like yeah, there's a bunch of different meals like Mountain Ops [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6792.82s)]
*  Not that not Mountain Ops. There's a bunch of different companies. So like this is a guy like carrying an L quarter on his back [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6798.14s)]
*  That motherfucker probably has a hundred pounds on his back right now because he has his bag in his pack [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6804.14s)]
*  Which is probably 50 pounds and they has a giant ass elk leg on his back [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6808.700000000001s)]
*  All right [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6812.660000000001s)]
*  So is there ever like a distance that they deem too far because walking back with the elk it wouldn't be worth it [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6813.3s)]
*  So like I imagine you're tracking for a while. It's not like you just walk in and they're all the Elks, right? [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6820.02s)]
*  You have to find them. Yeah, but you get lucky and find them a couple of miles in and that's that's pretty nice [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6824.58s)]
*  Is there a point where you go I'm not going more than five because five back carrying the elk would be too difficult [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6829.24s)]
*  Yeah, some guys do that [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6834.2s)]
*  But some guys are hard fucking horrible like they'll kill an elk 25 miles in and spend three days bringing it back [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6835.32s)]
*  So and now you have elk carcass. Mm-hmm. You have all the other animals that also you like to die [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6841.4s)]
*  No, no, you string it up in a tree. Got it [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6848.68s)]
*  So getting it it's like what is that old man in the sea? [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6850.48s)]
*  Is that the book where like he he gets the he finally hunts and gets this big fit but fish [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6853.08s)]
*  But he's got to bring it back and by the time he brings it back. It's just like a skeleton [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6858.24s)]
*  Nobody believes he got this amazing big fish [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6861.48s)]
*  Oh, like I get it like you don't ever think about the journey back. Yeah, that seems almost more stressful [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6863.48s)]
*  Well the the right with the best way to do it the backcountry if you have the money is horses [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6869.719999999999s)]
*  They have horses take you back there and the the horses will pack or mules [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6875.4s)]
*  Yeah, this you can pack them up with they they'll keep your camp on their back [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6880.12s)]
*  Yeah, and you will have like several like a train of them [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6884.36s)]
*  Yeah, and then you could load them up with like elk quarters and yeah take them back and for them it ain't shit [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6887.08s)]
*  It's thousands of pounds right like well, it's not really how much is an elk? It's about 400 pounds of meat [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6892.16s)]
*  Oh cuz you're leaving the bones and everything you leave in a lot. You cut it up [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6898.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but you gotta take some of the bones like you want a rib, right? [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6903.5599999999995s)]
*  Like there's you could have the most guys like most guys cut the rib meat out [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6906.24s)]
*  Out of the ribs and you grind it make hamburger or you know chili out of it or things like that [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6910.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah cam [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6916.04s)]
*  He he like makes strips and then chops those strips up like you can there's a lot of different things you could do with [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6918.16s)]
*  With rib meat. It's pretty tender. It's good. It's real good when you cook them like slow over a fire though [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6924.68s)]
*  It's like it's not the most tender meat like when [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6930.78s)]
*  Slow over when you cook them over a fire [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6934.5599999999995s)]
*  Can get pretty tough unless you do it like real low and slow like smoking it almost like you do barbecue [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6936.7s)]
*  Yeah, but it makes great hamburger [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6942.42s)]
*  but like the real the [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6945.82s)]
*  What everybody really loves is like the backstrap? That's that that's like essentially that'd be like the fillet fillet, right? [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6948.26s)]
*  Yeah, loin and then the quarters you make great steaks and you can make what are these guys doing the age out of this? [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6954.7s)]
*  Like what is like yeah, you try not to keep working out [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6963.18s)]
*  But like like an NBA player eventually reaches the end of his professional playing ability [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6967.3s)]
*  You might play in a gym, but like what does it cam do it like 75? [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6972.26s)]
*  Well, he's gonna be bow hunting at 75 but hunt a different thing. No [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6976.3s)]
*  No, he'll be doing the same thing. There's physical limitations. I imagine there are but not as much anymore [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6980.54s)]
*  Not because you can warm replacement [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6986.38s)]
*  Weightlifting you you know like guys like me didn't exist [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=6988.9400000000005s)]

*  Still have 30 year old arms, they're still legit [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7006.18s)]
*  They were real good [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7011.7s)]
*  Everything works real good [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7013.74s)]
*  But you have to you know maintain yourself take care of yourself [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7015.3s)]
*  And if there's something like that that you care about you know like I have a friend [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7018.5s)]
*  Brendan Burns he runs kuyu. It's like a huge outdoor clothing company [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7022.7s)]

*  Yeah, won't even try jujitsu because he doesn't want to hurt himself for hunting [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7033.139999999999s)]
*  Everything is built around like I'm not skiing. I'm not fucking around fuck that [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7037.780000000001s)]
*  I feel like that's my whole workout regimen is just so I could play this sport called paddle. It's not pickleball [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7042.160000000001s)]
*  It's called paddle. What is this? It's a racket sport that I'm absolutely obsessed with I swear to God [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7047.860000000001s)]
*  It's starting at Acapulco, Mexico [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7052.860000000001s)]
*  And then it goes to Spain and it gets blow blown up there, and it's essentially like squash and tennis mixed together, so there's [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7054.780000000001s)]
*  There's there's walls. There's like this glass wall in the back and these like fences on the side [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7061.46s)]
*  Yeah [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7066.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, we played I'm dragging on bro. It is really it is the most obsessed [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7067.34s)]
*  It's the fastest growing sport in the world right now. It will take over tennis spokesperson for paddle [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7071.86s)]
*  I probably am the only person that is talking about at this level [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7076.34s)]
*  This is this is shout out paddle house in New York [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7080.82s)]
*  They got one of Williamsburg and one in Brooklyn and this is the game this is the game [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7083.46s)]
*  I'm so bad. It's unbelievable, so you play with a deflated tennis ball [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7086.94s)]
*  So what essentially what it is you got to show highlights because I'm so fucking horrible that it's not going to do it justice [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7091.0599999999995s)]
*  But the idea behind it is at least for me is [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7096.34s)]
*  There's always hope so the ball gets past you in tennis [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7100.5s)]
*  You're cooked the buckets pass you in paddle it bounces off that back wall, and you're playing it off the back wall [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7103.7s)]
*  So you're never fully out of the game [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7108.5s)]
*  You're constantly it's my it is the only thing outside of like surfing and boxing and then comedy where I'm not look at this [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7111.82s)]

*  You got to watch the chicks play because they don't have the power to smack it out, so it's just pure skill and [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7137.12s)]
*  And cleverness yeah exactly every everything is placement. It's delicate placement [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7143.200000000001s)]
*  So what they're trying to do is I'm telling you is unbelievable and everybody that's playing tennis and squash and all these other racket [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7148.22s)]

*  If you heard this before people I had a rotator cuff tear a full-length rotator cuff tear and went to a doctor [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7518.44s)]
*  Went to the UFC's doctor [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7523.839999999999s)]
*  They sent me to orthopedic surgeon he looks at my MRI you can't believe I can do anything [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7526.2s)]
*  He says I can't believe you can do anything with this shoulder [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7531.0s)]
*  Like this is you have a full-length rotator cuff tear but he does all the stuff with me like push down push up [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7532.92s)]
*  And he goes like you're pretty functional [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7538.82s)]
*  He you know [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7541.04s)]
*  He goes I think it's probably because you have a lot of muscle around the joint because but you're gonna need surgery [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7541.92s)]
*  He goes you could try to rehab it, but you're gonna need surgery. I go really gonna need surgery [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7546.68s)]
*  He goes. Yeah, I go of am I ruining my shoulder by not having surgery. He's like potentially [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7550.12s)]
*  He's like, you know, try your best rehab put it off as much as you want, but you're gonna need surgery [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7555.04s)]
*  So then I go to dr. Roddy McGee in Vegas and this was years ago. He's doing stem cells with the UFC athletes [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7559.8s)]
*  He's a bunch of different people. He's like well, we could try it and I think the stem cells [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7566.72s)]
*  I got them actually aren't even available anymore because they were too good [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7571.160000000001s)]
*  So they injected in my shoulder and then after a couple weeks, it feels pretty fucking good. And then I rehab it [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7575.240000000001s)]
*  I'm doing like bands and all sorts of different stuff [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7581.280000000001s)]
*  I get it to the point where it starts feeling good. I start light like light kettlebells feeling pretty good [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7583.72s)]
*  I go back to him six months later. He does an MRI [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7589.320000000001s)]
*  He says this is the most astounding thing I've ever seen in all my years of being an orthopedic surgeon [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7591.76s)]
*  He goes that tear is gone [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7597.4400000000005s)]
*  Like he just wrote this full-length rotator cuff tear that was gonna need surgery doesn't exist anymore [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7599.4800000000005s)]
*  Like when I say like my shoulder is better, I mean it doesn't bother me at all like at all [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7605.400000000001s)]
*  I do everything I hit the bag. I I [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7611.48s)]
*  Do kettlebells with 70 pounds I do swings and curls and cleans and presses zero pain [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7616.08s)]
*  Not not not a one thing like man, maybe I shouldn't be doing this. It like feels a hundred percent [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7623.04s)]
*  Normal. Yeah, and all stem cells like I should I could have got caught with a swing and they're done didn't do any of that [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7629.879999999999s)]
*  There's a I have a shoulder a little bit of shoulder issue. Actually, I'm curious if the stem cells 100% [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7636.799999999999s)]
*  I'll bring you to ways to well that's in Austin. Yeah, listen, man [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7641.5199999999995s)]
*  They've they've healed so many people that I'm friends with I had a so many guys [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7645.32s)]
*  I know like minimal scapular movement [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7649.5599999999995s)]
*  I think that was the issue so I was making up for the fact that my [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7651.799999999999s)]
*  Scapula doesn't move that much with just stretching out the muscles around it. Does that make sense? [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7654.839999999999s)]
*  So like you're I guess that the scapula is this bone here [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7660.2s)]
*  The scapula is that the one that kind of like hangs? [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7664.24s)]
*  Yeah, and like that's supposed to move up with your arm when you extend it and it was staying there [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7666.76s)]
*  But I was still moving my arm. So I'm stretching all I guess the muscles or tendons or whatever [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7672.8s)]
*  What did happen to your scapula that made it freeze like that? [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7677.64s)]
*  I don't know like some I was told that I might have like a small tear in the rotator cuff [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7679.92s)]
*  Like you hang do you ever hang from your hands? [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7683.72s)]
*  I mean I would do I do like pull-ups as part of like a my you know [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7685.96s)]
*  Exercise routine when I'm doing any hopes a great exercise, but hanging is great for shoulder health [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7689.64s)]
*  So what I do every day for at least a minute [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7695.2s)]
*  Usually more I usually do like a couple of sets of hangs before I do anything [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7700.12s)]
*  but I'll do my warm-ups with like push-ups and bodyweight squats and then what I do is I chalk up my hands and [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7704.68s)]
*  I grab a hold of bar and I just hang and I just try and I feel my back popping like it [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7712.12s)]
*  Decompresses your back because your spine like the weight of your hips and your legs is pulling on your spine for the first time [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7718.08s)]
*  Normally life is pushing down on you gravity. Yeah, the weight of your body's pushing. Wow. Now using gravity to pull it all out [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7724.5199999999995s)]
*  Yes, so I do that I hang that way and then I also do that decks [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7730.04s)]
*  We have a machine out there teeter the company that makes those things where you hang by your ankles [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7734.04s)]
*  Yeah, I've seen it. They have a great one where you it's called the decks [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7738.9s)]
*  I like it better than the ankle one where you you hinge at the hips and you fall forward and then you just it's basically [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7741.66s)]
*  Like your lower body and your hips are carrying [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7747.679999999999s)]
*  Like locking your weight in place and you're leaning forward so the full weight of your upper body is decompressing your back [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7751.92s)]
*  And I'll feel it going like pop pop pop [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7759.08s)]
*  I'll feel like little pops in my back and I stretch it and I move on that thing and it's all just about keeping the the spine [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7761.5599999999995s)]
*  Pliable and keeping the range of motion in your spine, but also in your shoulder joints [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7769.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, it's one of the best things for shoulder joints is to just hang and I'll hang with one arm sometimes [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7773.759999999999s)]
*  I'll hang with both arms. Yeah, but I'm just like letting it all stretch out [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7778.72s)]
*  so it stretches all your your the mobility of your shoulders and [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7783.72s)]
*  Create space in there. Yeah allows everything to move freer and then I'll do my chin-ups [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7788.4400000000005s)]
*  So I do my sets of chin-ups. So that's your stretch essentially. Yes [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7793.92s)]
*  Okay, maybe I have to add that in yeah [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7797.92s)]
*  I also stretch on a bar where I grab the bar and I turn like this and I get it like that [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7799.700000000001s)]
*  Stretch that way and I get a deep stretch the other way and I do that on my back on the ground [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7805.2s)]
*  You should also do these things called it's called crossover symmetry [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7809.639999999999s)]
*  Is these bands and they have varying? [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7813.72s)]
*  Resistance like different colors or different strength resistance [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7817.5599999999995s)]
*  You don't even need a lot of resistance [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7820.32s)]
*  The whole idea is just you're working the tendons and all the connective tissue and it's just doing all these like different shoulder exercises [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7821.48s)]
*  And so they cross like one is attached to a post over here and the other ones here [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7829.28s)]
*  So I'm doing these yeah doing these and I'm doing I'm pitting them against my arm and I'm doing it like that [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7833.12s)]
*  Where I'm just working the rotator cuff muscles and just just to keep everything [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7838.08s)]
*  You're creating the torque on the joint [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7842.96s)]
*  Yeah, whereas like when you're lifting weights, you can kind of manipulate what part of your body is lifting you can and that's how you get injured [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7844.96s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, that's I got to do the because that's my biggest concern right now is I mean, you know to bring it back to your friends [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7851.44s)]
*  How do I play? [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7858.0s)]
*  Like everything I do I like I do PT twice a week shot my boy Mike Helgeson. He's fucking PT twice a week [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7859.92s)]
*  Yeah, it's like I'm lifting but I'm with a guy who is a PT. So if there is an issue we can oh I see [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7865.36s)]
*  I say, but he'll just take me through weightlifting if I'm feeling good [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7870.74s)]
*  and if I'm not then we're doing some work and [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7873.18s)]
*  Have you been able to increase the mobility of your side? [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7875.64s)]
*  My yes and my shoulder was fucked before and he brought it back him and him and this guy Kyle [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7878.24s)]
*  We're like don't do surgery like they they were like it once you do surgery [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7883.34s)]
*  You're fucked and so let's try to work this thing out by building muscle around it [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7886.88s)]
*  Getting mobility into the joint and like they brought the shoulder back like this before [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7891.5s)]
*  Let me say one thing real clear. That's not always true [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7896.1s)]
*  I know a lot of people that have had successful shoulder surgery, okay, and in some cases [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7898.84s)]
*  That's the only thing you can do save yourself. Yeah, there's like Yuri, Prohaska the UFC for light heavyweight champion [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7903.72s)]
*  Yeah, his shoulder was blown apart. They had to put it back together. Yeah, they had to and so there's really effective [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7910.08s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, damn, I mean that Jamal Hill fight. Holy shit. Holy shit. Yeah, so for a situation like that [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7915.0199999999995s)]
*  Shoulder surgery was necessary. Yes. This shit was torn apart [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7922.74s)]
*  Yeah, you can't just heal that with stem cells, but there are things you can heal with stem cells [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7925.419999999999s)]
*  And it definitely helps soft tissue injuries in a way like nothing else I've ever used. Yeah. Yeah, it's it's legit and [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7929.759999999999s)]
*  Brigham Buehler who's the CEO of waste? Well, he's worked so hard on edge [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7938.0199999999995s)]
*  He's been on this podcast a bunch of times and Tucker's podcast a bunch of podcasts [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7943.32s)]
*  Just talking about all these different methods that are available [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7947.08s)]
*  Yeah that are being stifled by the FDA and that's the thing is like once you get something that you're addicted to [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7950.88s)]
*  Longevity exercise or regimens or whatever it is. It are very easy to do [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7957.36s)]
*  Mm-hmm, because you're not really doing them so you can live to a hundred you're like, how do I play this thing next week? [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7962.12s)]
*  right and [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7967.679999999999s)]
*  All the motivation comes from it it's really simple like I actually can't wait to go do the PT whatever it is because I'm [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7969.32s)]
*  Like, okay. I have a game Wednesday and I want to be good to play. It sounds ridiculous. I'm 41 [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7975.78s)]
*  I'm not going pro at this thing, but I love it so much that I would literally I'm looking up the fucking BPC [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7979.42s)]
*  157 I'm like do I need the yeah the Wolverine shit that they say right and it's like do I get that so I can [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7985.719999999999s)]
*  Recover faster. Yeah, get that is it have you tried that's legit. Okay legit. I recommend it to a buddy with no research [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7991.84s)]
*  I was like you should do this and then a couple weeks later. He's like I'm on it and I was like [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=7997.98s)]
*  Did you look up it? I'm not a doctor anything [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8001.299999999999s)]
*  But but he said he did it for his he got an ACL surgery mm-hmm and [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8006.179999999999s)]
*  His doctor he asked about it his doctor goes I take it [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8011.66s)]
*  That's a good doctor because I've had friends where I tell him about their doctors is all you shouldn't do that [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8015.5s)]
*  There's no studies which hold that's the thing. I feel like there's like old guard guys [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8020.339999999999s)]
*  They're a little bit hesitant to use some of the maybe newer technology, and I'm sure they have their reasons [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8023.82s)]
*  I'm not I don't know more than them about the science [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8028.44s)]
*  But there are these new technologies that can maybe extend our playing age again [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8030.299999999999s)]
*  I don't need to be a pro [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8035.42s)]
*  But I love this thing and I want to do it as much as I can I want to get as good as I possibly can [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8036.5s)]
*  Yeah, it feels good to be getting better at something at this age. Well. Let me tell you something [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8043.179999999999s)]
*  There's a reason why you saw to [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8047.0599999999995s)]
*  Didn't let people use in the UFC and now drug-free sport also doesn't let people use in the UFC. It's because it works [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8049.06s)]
*  It's a minute wait. Why would they not wouldn't wouldn't it be advantageous for the athletes exactly? It's really stupid [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8054.580000000001s)]
*  But the idea is that it's performance enhancing because it lets you heal quicker [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8060.820000000001s)]
*  So heal from injuries quicker potentially heal from recovering from training quicker, and and what would their argument? [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8065.38s)]
*  I mean the only argument I've heard is like it increases [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8072.06s)]
*  Well, the idea is like keep everybody on a completely [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8074.66s)]
*  Level playing field. How do you do that? No one's able to take anything [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8078.06s)]
*  You can't take any performance enhancing or make it accessible to all athletes [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8082.46s)]
*  Well, yeah, I think that's the right way to do it. But the problem is that okay, what peptides are we talking about? [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8086.18s)]
*  What about things like HCG which radically increased testosterone production? Are you allowed to do that? [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8091.74s)]
*  Okay, because if you're allowed to do that like what level is that sterile only recovery? [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8096.900000000001s)]
*  I think any recovery drug like obviously there's risks all this like you increase cell growth [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8101.5s)]
*  And if you have cancer got forbidding your body those cells are gonna grow as well, right? [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8106.5s)]
*  There's an argument for that, but I think the real argument is like what's causing cancer, right? [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8109.62s)]
*  The real argument is like eliminating environmental toxins and the issues also there's people that have genetic predispositions to cancer [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8114.46s)]
*  Unfortunately, but the real reality about cancer is unfortunately look what you take into your body has a significant effect [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8122.02s)]
*  Your diet has a significant effect exercise has a significant effect [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8129.42s)]
*  And also do you participate in any recovery activities like sauna, which is huge? [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8133.580000000001s)]
*  They did a study out of Finland again. I apologize if you've heard this before [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8140.18s)]
*  It was a 20 year study [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8144.02s)]
*  They found people use sauna for four days a week had a 40% decrease in all cause mortality [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8146.14s)]
*  All cause meaning heart attack stroke cancer you name it [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8152.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah, 40% decrease just because of the effects of sauna. How do they how do they test that like where's the? [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8157.66s)]
*  What is the what is the term the something group like the group? Well, this is what they did [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8165.7s)]
*  They did this control randomized control trial, right? So they did this study where they took these people and [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8169.82s)]
*  Sauna use in Finland is everywhere. Everybody is the sauna. Yeah, and so they did it based on [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8177.0599999999995s)]
*  These questionnaires do you do the sauna once a week? Do you saw it twice a week? [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8183.339999999999s)]
*  What temperature do you do the sauna and how long do you do it for and they determined? [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8187.86s)]
*  That the people that did the sauna four times a week for 20 minutes at 175 degrees [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8192.14s)]
*  Had a 40% decrease in all cause mortality now when you drop the number of sessions [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8197.66s)]
*  You also drop the the all cause mortality survival [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8203.8s)]
*  So like it's like 20% at once a week, you know 30% so it's like that [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8208.62s)]
*  measurable differences in the amount of [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8215.1s)]
*  People that were healthy and robust who did it four times a week. Yeah, I mean [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8218.300000000001s)]
*  That's interesting because the easiest way to discredit would be like well [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8223.460000000001s)]
*  Yeah, the people that do saunas want to increase their life. But what you're saying is there's an increased amount of [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8226.48s)]
*  Assistance. Yes, you do it more, right? [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8233.62s)]
*  Benefits are legitimate real measurable. It's hermetic stress [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8237.039999999999s)]
*  There's it's heat shock proteins your body produces to deal with the fact that you're you're essentially dying [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8241.36s)]
*  Like you can't stay like I do it at 196. You can't stay there very long [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8247.36s)]
*  I do 25 minutes at 196 have you ever passed out in it? No, okay [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8252.0s)]
*  Is that a thing people do? [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8256.64s)]
*  Get out the smelling salts I stay awake [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8261.8s)]
*  No, you could though. Yeah, I mean if you are the type of person who passes out. Yeah, you've got issues. Yeah [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8265.48s)]
*  Yeah, I think some people pass out just from stress [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8271.48s)]
*  Yeah, I watched a kid black out the other night one of these school things that my kid had to go to really some boy [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8274.24s)]
*  fainted on stage [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8280.119999999999s)]
*  Yeah, sometimes people just [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8281.76s)]
*  Sometimes they just your brain goes too much check, please. I've seen like [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8284.08s)]

*  Exercise so you cold plunge for three minutes and then you exercise and you force your body to heat up while you're working out [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8424.24s)]
*  Mm-hmm [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8432.68s)]
*  massive increase in testosterone to the point where this one guy he had [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8433.88s)]
*  he got his prostate levels checked and his doctor was like this is [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8438.76s)]
*  This is concerning. Yeah, like we want to do this [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8443.72s)]
*  We want to do that and want to put you on this and put you on that and the guy says, you know [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8447.16s)]

*  Which suppress testosterone levels highlighting the importance of timing when using cold stimulation for potential hormonal benefits [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8473.68s)]
*  So what this guy did was he plunged not just the wrist and then [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8480.84s)]
*  Went to the doctor months later and the doctor thought he was on hormones the doctor's like you have [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8486.52s)]
*  1100 testosterone. This is crazy. Like what's going on? [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8492.48s)]
*  Yeah, he tells him I've been cold plunging before I lift weights and the doctor's like well keep fucking doing that [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8495.44s)]

*  I remember the the curve I was driving on when I was talking on the phone to Tony when he was going through his first [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8615.0s)]
*  One yeah, and he's like I just said this is not good, man [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8621.32s)]
*  I'm not doing good and I'm like fuck man, and there's like that was the moment where I was like, please don't kill yourself [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8625.32s)]
*  Oh, wow, you're gonna get better. Yeah, you're gonna be fine. Do not I I didn't say that but that's what you're thinking [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8631.8s)]

*  Going ooh like hearing him on the phone. We were on speakerphone. I'm like fuck man [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8639.88s)]
*  Yeah, you dedicate your entire life to one thing and but it's also it's just like feeling like it's over [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8645.02s)]
*  Everything is over your careers over your life is over as you know, and one stupid thing and now it's over forever and just [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8649.900000000001s)]
*  Can't breathe. Yeah, you can't breathe. Yeah, and you know Tony's tough. He's resilient [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8657.26s)]
*  Yeah, he got through it pretty quick and he was back and then you know a couple weeks later. He was laughing about it [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8662.140000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but some people it you know, they get wrecked and they're not the same ever again [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8666.94s)]
*  I think that does happen to people and then there's a different version of them afterwards [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8672.42s)]
*  Because they don't want to experience that again [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8677.02s)]
*  It is it is weird like I'm not as affected by that kind of stuff now [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8679.86s)]
*  Maybe I haven't gone through on that level [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8684.300000000001s)]
*  But and I also think there's something about having a kid like I just care less about the like I care very the very few people [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8686.74s)]
*  I care what they think about me. It's like really [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8693.1s)]
*  Liberating in a lot of ways, you know, right but um [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8696.02s)]
*  but yeah, there was something about like like are we not gonna be able to get pregnant and then like feeling [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8699.66s)]
*  You feel horrible I also you start like going why would God not want me to have a kid like did I do something bad [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8705.42s)]
*  Like you start thinking like if there's some sort of karmic reason for that shit [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8711.18s)]
*  Also before I knew it was me. I don't want to share it with anybody [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8714.98s)]
*  It's really isolating cuz I thought it was my wife [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8718.02s)]
*  like everybody always thinks it's the woman who's got a fucking problem with their eggs or whatever and [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8720.02s)]
*  That's such a bitch-ass dude thing. No, that's what we think because we don't know it could be us [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8724.58s)]
*  When did you ever like every time I looked at my [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8729.9s)]
*  Arrogant fire [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8732.34s)]
*  Fucking jizz. I'm killing it right like literally so and then and then you think about it and I will say this though like [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8736.34s)]
*  like [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8744.98s)]
*  Finding out that it was me and being able to I felt more comfortable talking about on stage because now I'm not talking about this [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8746.1s)]
*  Incredibly embarrassing thing to this woman who does not want to be an entertainment at all like the most private person [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8751.82s)]
*  Net about me. I was like, oh I can talk about this a little bit and being able to talk about on stage [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8757.7s)]
*  and I would talk about on stage and like there be these dudes that would come up to me after shows and they [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8762.380000000001s)]
*  Wouldn't admit they were going through it, but they'd be like, you know, I was really funny [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8766.22s)]
*  but like yeah, you should keep talking about that shit and then I [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8769.34s)]
*  Would like talk about on tour and I get these fucking DMS and like all these people would start telling me that they're going through [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8773.06s)]
*  IVF and like even close friends start to make yo actually that's how we got pregnant and I didn't realize it was this [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8779.7s)]
*  there's like almost like last taboo thing where [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8786.78s)]
*  There's this incredible isolation it because you don't want to feel the judgment [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8790.7s)]
*  There's all this pressure and obviously have a family [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8793.78s)]
*  You don't feel like you're the person that's like stopping that but I didn't realize and I'm 40 [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8795.78s)]
*  So a lot of older people are probably going through this maybe young people are not but like [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8800.62s)]
*  Everybody in my immediate circle going through this shit. Let me ask you this like first of all, when did IVF [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8805.220000000001s)]
*  become [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8812.140000000001s)]
*  Available to people and how many people a year do you think use IVF? [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8814.460000000001s)]
*  And if they didn't how many less people would there be on Earth brother brother brother? [[02:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8818.98s)]
*  this is like there were three things when I talked to Trump that I wanted to ask him about specifically and [[02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8823.859999999999s)]
*  One of them was securing IVF because I know a lot of people who are against abortion also [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8828.46s)]
*  Look at IVF and like okay, you're throwing out embryos. You're you know, killing people or potential people and they want to use the anti [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8834.46s)]
*  abortion argument to get rid of IVF and [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8842.619999999999s)]
*  Really is that a thing? Yeah, of course it's happening now [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8845.26s)]
*  And what Trump said who's trying to ban that? [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8847.42s)]
*  I guess we could look that up [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8852.1s)]
*  I think that it was in there's a few states that was happening in that seems insane [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8853.62s)]
*  Yeah, why would you not want more people? [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8857.66s)]
*  Well, they look at it as killing people because life starts at conception and the embryos essentially conception which like I understand your logic [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8859.74s)]
*  I don't I don't disagree with the logic behind that but at the same time [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8867.42s)]
*  that is the way that the only way some people can get pregnant and [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8872.1s)]
*  I [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8876.300000000001s)]
*  Will give it a Senate Republicans block IVF bill as Democrats elevate issue ahead of November election [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8877.54s)]
*  But what I'll say is Trump said that they're gonna back it with the full power of the Republican Party and that anybody that goes [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8883.74s)]
*  Against it that they would campaign against and then he even signed that executive order to expand it [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8889.32s)]
*  He wants to expand access to it. Oh, that's great, which is fucking yes incredible people that want to be parents, man [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8893.9s)]
*  I know quite a people few people like yourself [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8899.060000000001s)]
*  They want to be parents so bad and that gave him the ability and now they're so happy and it's the most incredible thing [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8901.42s)]
*  In the world. Yeah, they don't do that. Guess what? There's no babies [[02:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8905.94s)]
*  No, it's like more life will occur if you have if you allow this also [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8908.7s)]
*  We got to deal with the downstream like I'm sure some of this shit is probably it might me [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8913.1s)]
*  It just might be genetic. I don't fucking know but maybe it's microplastics all of my balls [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8917.140000000001s)]
*  Maybe it's my phone like there's a lot of things that are not in our control that are negatively impacting us and then to restrict our [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8920.82s)]
*  Ability to have a family or I feel like it's kind of unfair [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8926.82s)]
*  You like bestowed this thing upon me it has affected our ability or some woman's ability [[02:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8930.039999999999s)]
*  I wonder if it's like more prevalent the issue or the necessity of it with people that live in cities [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8936.119999999999s)]
*  Oh, dude, every time a car breaks [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8941.359999999999s)]
*  Yeah, the amount of microplastics that go into the world are way more than using like a plastic bottle to drink out of yeah break dust [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8943.76s)]
*  Yeah, yes particulates. Absolutely. That's the shit that you wipe off your wheels when you clean your car [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8950.76s)]
*  That's in the air you never watched your car. Nope Jesus Christ. Yeah, I mean I didn't have a car until like a year ago [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8955.640000000001s)]
*  What do you got now got anything good? No, nothing. Well, I got a fun one. I got a really I got a Suzuki Samurai [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8961.56s)]

*  It was yeah, that's a good car to park in the city, too [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8970.640000000001s)]
*  You don't give a fuck what happens. Well, I got it out in the Hamptons. But yeah, what year is it? It's a 87 [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8973.300000000001s)]
*  It's a piece of shit, but it is like it's also just so fun [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8980.36s)]
*  I'm not trying to compete with you on like having like a fancy car or whatever like that [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8984.880000000001s)]
*  I just love how fucking rug I don't care. I turn you on some fucking you you know, the good shit [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8987.92s)]
*  Yeah, you gotta learn it. You gotta learn the appreciation of cars. I got my yeah. There it is [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=8993.6s)]
*  Is it adorable I wouldn't take that thing around the block but wait you're saying you wouldn't get in that car with us did [[02:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9004.12s)]
*  With six go with you guys six guys. Yeah, go with you guys. Shouldn't that be on the cover of every gay magazine? [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9009.220000000001s)]
*  It should be [[02:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9013.86s)]
*  Like if you take this pill, this is what you have you'll have fun with your friends [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9015.980000000001s)]
*  Oh each with a Suzuki samurai so much fun and they're reliable as fuck. That's the thing about them every Japanese car is a lot [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9020.34s)]
*  Yes, they're the best. That's the thing about Japanese culture. Is it like it's refinement culture [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9026.54s)]
*  So like I feel like there any time I said there's this Japanese DJ I saw his name is a Yosuke Yuki Matsu [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9030.94s)]
*  Okay, he had like brain cancer and then like he thought he was gonna die [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9038.300000000001s)]
*  He's like fucking I'm gonna be a DJ with the time I got left and it went into remission [[02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9041.94s)]
*  But he basically quit his construction job [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9045.300000000001s)]
*  He just did this boiler room set and it is just like I could be like putting this energy on it because I want to [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9047.42s)]
*  Believe it or whatever. But the intensity of it is this is my shot and I'm gonna be unrelenting [[02:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9053.54s)]
*  Right. And the second I saw that he's Japanese maybe this my like this is the guy look at him go, but can you [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9059.980000000001s)]
*  like [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9067.02s)]
*  Can you look at this motherfucker be a [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9068.02s)]
*  Japanese person being a DJ before I even listened to the set I was like, oh, this is gonna be the best set I've ever heard [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9071.140000000001s)]
*  Because they would never put themselves out there [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9076.78s)]
*  Be and do it half-ass like every 30 year old model in America is like I'll be a DJ now [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9079.94s)]
*  But in Japan the culture is so like don't bring shame upon your family [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9084.74s)]
*  Don't bring attention to yourself unless you are the greatest. Do you know the term Kaizen? Do you know what that means? [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9088.9s)]
*  No, what is that? [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9094.9s)]
*  Kaizen is a [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9095.82s)]
*  Japanese term for [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9097.94s)]
*  Taking a thing and continuing to refine it until it reaches perfection [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9100.82s)]
*  so [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9106.66s)]
*  Japanese [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9107.98s)]
*  first of all like [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9109.1s)]
*  Supercars were always Italian. It was always you know German [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9111.46s)]
*  Porsche Ferrari that kind of shit and then [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9116.94s)]
*  Nissan created a car that destroyed everybody. What was it the GTR? [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9121.18s)]
*  So the Nissan GTR they've essentially been making the same exact car just [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9125.74s)]
*  Refining it for like 20 years. I have a [[02:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9132.66s)]
*  2024 [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9135.939999999999s)]
*  Nissan GTR Nismo, which is their race package one, which is the most refined version of the GTR [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9137.179999999998s)]
*  They've ever and it's a fucking marvel of engineering and refinement. Yeah, that fucking car is [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9145.42s)]
*  Magical yeah, it's just glued to the road you ever seen one. Do you know show me pull up a black? [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9152.98s)]
*  Nissan [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9158.86s)]
*  2024 [[02:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9160.3s)]
*  GTR Nismo, but culture they can't put out shit [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9161.54s)]
*  It's shameful to put out shit, right? [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9165.1s)]
*  And I feel like they've they're almost like done refining their culture and now they're tapping into other things like well [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9167.22s)]
*  It looks like oh wow. Yeah, it looks like what's the that's not that's a that's a Nismo 300 [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9172.3s)]
*  That's mine. It looks like my car is that Nissan Z was a Z 300 or something like that [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9177.82s)]
*  Um this came out when I was in college. Yeah, 340 Z. There's a bunch of those but that's the that's the GTR [[02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9183.5s)]
*  Yeah, that thing. It's just it's just it's just it you're on a ride [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9189.62s)]
*  Yeah, you're riding a ride everywhere whirs and clinks and clunks [[02:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9195.3s)]
*  Yeah, it's so fun that's a different one that's a 300 Z a 370 Z [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9201.42s)]
*  That's pretty sick too though. That looks good [[02:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9206.46s)]
*  But there's like a whole culture of taking these things like there's guys that make these things they jack them up to [[02:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9208.42s)]
*  2,000 horsepower and they spit fire out of the back of them, but they do that with pizza [[02:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9213.74s)]
*  Like the best pizza I've ever had and I'm from New York City is in Tokyo really the best [[02:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9218.18s)]
*  Pete's ever has in Tokyo. I forget the name of the place. What it my wife and I were in Tokyo and [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9222.98s)]
*  But it was the best steak I've ever had is in Tokyo really and it's something about like doing something half-assed [[02:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9229.66s)]
*  I think is shameful and there's this great honor in like this refinement process now. There is a social cost to that [[02:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9235.94s)]
*  There's a rigidity meaning like it's very here's a perfect example like the oldest hotel in the world [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9244.539999999999s)]
*  I think is this hotel in Japan. It's like starting in 703 year 703. Whoa, and it's oh, I seen that [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9250.26s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, and it's been owned by the same family for 52 generations [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9255.88s)]
*  which is like an unbelievable feat when you think about like [[02:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9259.94s)]
*  American families or British families that like have gotten rich and then three generations. They've squandered it all [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9263.98s)]
*  Like really successful families. It's all been destroyed and there is this thing and I think Japanese culture [[02:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9269.46s)]
*  Which is like there's this great honor in taking on the tradition of your family [[02:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9276.0s)]
*  The cost of that is there was probably a comedian or a chef or somebody that in that line [[02:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9280.14s)]
*  That didn't do the thing that they really were passionate about to honor their family [[02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9286.74s)]
*  But the societal benefit is probably the majority of people don't have those dreams and [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9291.38s)]
*  having purpose in this job is probably better for them and [[02:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9297.34s)]
*  I think there's a middle ground where you can still go dream and do these things [[02:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9301.939999999999s)]
*  But also we have some respect for being a cobbler when your dad was a cobbler and his dad was a cobbler [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9306.18s)]
*  I feel like we've lost that a little bit in like American dream culture [[02:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9312.18s)]
*  Which like if you don't go out and achieve your craziest dream [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9315.699999999999s)]
*  Some people don't have that dream but taking over their dad's business is something that they can feel good about an honor [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9318.5s)]
*  Instead of like oh, yeah, so I just took over the family business [[02:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9323.58s)]
*  Well doing a good job at anything [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9326.7s)]
*  There's a lot of value in that for everybody if you love making shoes and you become a cobbler and you make awesome shoes [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9328.78s)]
*  And you got like Andrew shows up bro. Those shoes are sick. I love them. I want another pair [[02:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9334.72s)]
*  But could you make them in crocodile? Yeah. Oh, let's go. Yeah, that's exciting [[02:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9340.14s)]
*  Like making things and having relationships with the people you sell them to that's super rewarding [[02:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9343.94s)]
*  We do chase that big dream over in America and make it seem like everybody has to have it [[02:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9348.9s)]
*  But the dream of making cabinets that are awesome is a pretty fucking cool [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9354.66s)]
*  Yeah, the dream of being a painter is a pretty cool dream [[02:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9358.82s)]
*  Like there's there's a lot of dreams that don't get the value added to them because of fame [[02:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9361.460000000001s)]
*  Like we we have this weird thing about fame above all in this country [[02:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9367.1s)]
*  Fame above all like moms being a mom isn't really valued like oh, yeah, it's a real I think it's a real problem [[02:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9372.74s)]
*  I think that and it's not all places like I'm sure there are places that are more like family oriented where like like being a mom [[02:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9379.5s)]
*  Is an honored respected thing a lot out here man. I love that. Yeah, like I'm in New York [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9385.74s)]

*  They have careers and want to abandon their career [[02:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9394.9s)]
*  They might shame those moms that decide to stay home and take care of their kids when [[02:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9396.859999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think that that's [[02:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9401.74s)]
*  It would be great if there was less rigidity and there was a lot of honor in that and there was something we really respected [[02:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9403.74s)]

*  It really gets instilled on you like I always had a really good work ethic [[02:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9472.1s)]
*  But becoming a father made me have a much stronger work ethic like there's no I [[02:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9476.9s)]
*  If I was a single man with no responsibilities, who knows if I would work as hard [[02:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9482.94s)]

*  Understanding what life really is because it's this constant cycle of new people entering into the world and eventually you will leave this world [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9573.380000000001s)]

*  It's so weird that you're making a life a human being comes into this world [[02:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9603.16s)]
*  It didn't exist before you and your wife had sex and now there's a human being [[02:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9609.24s)]
*  That's talking to you and you're teaching them stuff [[02:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9613.560000000001s)]
*  They learn things you get to see him laugh and giggle and you get to see him open up Christmas presents and screech and excitement [[02:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9616.0s)]
*  Oh my god, it's it's [[02:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9622.44s)]
*  All the happiness that you get from other things just doesn't compare pales in comparison. Yeah, it's a different happiness [[02:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9624.640000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's a totally different happiness [[02:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9630.84s)]
*  So and it's also it's like an understanding of life itself [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9633.0s)]
*  I said I've talked about this before but I changed the way I think about people you told me this I think about everybody [[02:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9637.04s)]
*  as a baby now [[02:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9643.5s)]
*  everybody's a baby that became a [[02:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9645.320000000002s)]
*  60 year old man with big old wino nose, you know when they get those big crazy fucking gin blossom faces [[02:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9647.36s)]
*  Yeah, like priests. Yep, and you know, I realized like oh, this is just this is this entity [[02:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9653.199999999999s)]
*  At this stage of its journey, but it used to be a baby [[02:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9660.36s)]
*  They used to be someone's cute little baby boy with a little little bow tie on everybody thought it was so cute [[02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9663.6s)]
*  Took a picture of him now. Here he is bad breath and fart [[02:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9668.24s)]
*  I [[02:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9672.12s)]
*  Think old pot belly hating life smoking Paul malls. Yeah, he had a lot of hope that was a baby [[02:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9673.36s)]
*  Yeah, and you know what what what is you have a lot of hope? [[02:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9679.04s)]
*  but like what is the impediment to you achieving a fulfilled life and [[02:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9683.6s)]
*  So many people don't even know where to start or where to begin and what it what to do what? [[02:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9687.32s)]
*  What what which way to go? [[02:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9691.44s)]
*  Yeah [[02:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9693.44s)]
*  And if you haven't been trusting your instincts in your life and you haven't been taking chances then all of a sudden you have to [[02:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9693.92s)]
*  Take one at like 35. Yeah [[02:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9699.4s)]
*  It's hard. Yeah, it's hard. Yeah, that's a muscle you build like endurance [[02:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9701.4s)]
*  You know you build the muscle of being able to take chances and and do difficult things [[02:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9706.119999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you build that like all other muscles all other strengths and virtues that you have. Yeah, it's reinforced with use [[02:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9710.64s)]
*  Yeah, every risk you take that is successful [[02:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9718.119999999999s)]
*  You get a little bit more confidence in taking those risks. Also you understand what's required to make this venture successful [[02:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9721.119999999999s)]
*  You'd have to look at it correctly you can't be delusional you have to be objective and you have to do what actually needs to be [[02:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9728.16s)]
*  Done. Yeah, and some people don't like that responsibility the responsibility [[02:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9734.64s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, so they've sabotaged themselves. They sabotaged their life because it's easier to fail because you're used to it [[02:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9738.88s)]
*  Yeah, so you fall right back into it. I'll pick myself back up again. But right now I'm on the heroin again for a little bit [[02:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9745.32s)]
*  That is the cool thing about [[02:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9751.92s)]
*  Well, yeah, I mean [[02:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9754.64s)]
*  Failure is not an option once you have a kid. No, you have to figure it out [[02:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9756.64s)]
*  Yeah, you have to figure it out. Also. You want the world to be a safer place because you're very vulnerable little people [[02:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9761.8s)]
*  Yeah, you relate. It's a [[02:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9766.119999999999s)]
*  You you just become like a real human being [[02:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9768.279999999999s)]
*  It's it's interesting when I hear people that don't have kids kind of complain about the world [[02:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9771.0s)]
*  Then I'm like, oh you actually don't really understand how high the stakes get right like it [[02:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9774.96s)]
*  The way that I relate to every bit of stimulus is completely changed it's heightened and reduced [[02:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9780.96s)]
*  Yeah, the little frivolous ship. I do not give a flying fuck about yeah [[02:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9786.68s)]
*  Like I really don't care and then the big ticket things I care deeply about [[02:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9790.24s)]
*  You know, how could they impact my kid? Like it's very easy for people to even with like the vaccine shit [[02:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9795.119999999999s)]
*  It's very easy who people who don't have kids to tell you like oh just trust the doctors whatever the second you have a kid [[02:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9800.92s)]
*  It is probably the most terrifying thing you'll ever do in your entire life is injecting something into [[02:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9806.34s)]
*  The most perfect thing you've ever created and then every single day [[02:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9812.859999999999s)]
*  Wondering and listening if she's still smiling and seeing if she's still okay like and feeling responsible if anything negative happens [[02:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9817.18s)]
*  Right and then if you don't do it feeling responsible if she got fucking the measles or mumps or whatever the fuck it is [[02:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9823.66s)]
*  I have so much more empathy and [[02:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9830.46s)]
*  It's something that people just can't understand because they're not put in that position [[02:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9834.22s)]
*  Right every new parent that I talked to is concerned about this shit [[02:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9837.74s)]
*  Every single one so it's like you have to have a little empathy like you've created the most perfect thing you've ever [[02:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9841.34s)]
*  Could ever imagine like nothing comes as close to that and every decision you make could greatly impact that person's life [[02:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9846.78s)]
*  So yeah, we're gonna be scared if we watch a fucking video on the internet that says this thing is bad for them [[02:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9853.26s)]
*  That says this thing is bad for them, right and don't call us some fucking quacks [[02:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9858.3s)]
*  Just call us like parents who care for our fucking kids [[02:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9862.3s)]
*  Well, the reason the what there's a lot of people that want to cover up for their own [[02:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9865.099999999999s)]
*  Actions like what they've done or the the people that want to say like all this is exaggerated [[02:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9869.74s)]
*  There are no vaccine injuries. This could have happened to my child [[02:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9874.699999999999s)]
*  It probably was was going to happen anyway, it was going to happen anyway [[02:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9876.779999999999s)]
*  And you want to really believe that of course you do because you don't want to feel like it's your responsibility [[02:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9880.06s)]
*  Also, you don't want to believe that pharmaceutical drug companies are willing to sell you things that are going to harm your child [[02:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9883.58s)]
*  And they are they are they always have been they always will be their publicly traded companies have responsibility to their shareholders to make as much money as possible [[02:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9890.300000000001s)]
*  And the money people are going to push a bunch of shit through that probably shouldn't go through [[02:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9899.02s)]
*  And they'll tell you you need it like like when they were vaccinating kids with covet [[02:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9903.74s)]
*  There was no reason to do that [[02:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9908.460000000001s)]
*  They knew there was no reason to do that [[02:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9909.98s)]
*  But they wanted everybody to take it because that's where the money is [[02:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9911.18s)]
*  And that's a scary thought that we live in a world that there's people out there that would literally sacrifice the health of children for profit [[02:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9913.74s)]
*  But ultimately that's that's what they do [[02:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9920.779999999999s)]
*  That's I mean, that's a thing that's been done. It will continue to be done unless something happens [[02:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9923.1s)]
*  Who are the people that do that? Why are they not named? Look at the sackler family? [[02:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9927.5s)]
*  Look at those people. So it's like we know one name. We know the sacklers and we don't even know their first name [[02:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9930.779999999999s)]
*  Well, you might but like the average person doesn't like [[02:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9935.1s)]
*  I think that it'd be a lot different if these people's names were public records. It would be a lot different if they went to jail [[02:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9937.42s)]
*  That's the thing. They just get fined. They'll get manjonied [[02:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9944.06s)]
*  Yeah, that would happen. Right that would happen immediately. That's a new thing. That's a verb [[02:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9947.42s)]
*  They're gonna get that luigi treatment immediately [[02:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9951.26s)]
*  It will be that way people don't fuck around with their kids man. It's a different [[02:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9954.380000000001s)]
*  Luigi was wearing loafers with his ankle handcuffs [[02:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9958.220000000001s)]
*  And uh, he was like in a trial and he looks so beautiful. He's a handsome guy [[02:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9961.74s)]
*  My wife and my daughter's like he's adorable. Look at him here. He's so beautiful. Yep. He's so handsome [[02:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9966.779999999999s)]
*  Like a supermodel. Yeah, I think he did porn or maybe that was just a headline that I saw but whatever [[02:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9972.619999999999s)]
*  But it's crazy though that the assassin is a good looking guy becomes a hero [[02:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9982.939999999999s)]
*  Like if he was an ugly fat guy with a maga hat on everybody would want him dead. Yo, look at him. Look at him [[02:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9986.539999999999s)]
*  Wow, look at those brows beautiful. Well, he's wearing a bulletproof vest too. Isn't that wild? [[02:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9991.58s)]
*  Yeah [[02:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9995.9s)]
*  But he's got like a mental health problem. Yeah, apparently and someone said that he took acid and cracked [[02:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=9997.66s)]
*  Yeah, I heard that but who knows how much of that? [[02:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=10004.14s)]
*  Well, we'll find out when the trial happens what yeah what the lore is [[02:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=10007.1s)]
*  But you know a broken clock is right two times a day though [[02:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=10010.86s)]
*  It was real weird when people were like, yeah more of that, please [[02:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=10015.02s)]
*  to me that's just desperation and you get to see it manifested it's like [[02:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=10019.26s)]
*  If you're like a really really really really really rich person with power [[02:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=10024.46s)]
*  You want to make sure the poorest people have enough to survive? [[02:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=10029.18s)]
*  The second they don't feel like they have hope and they don't feel like they have enough to survive [[02:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=10033.26s)]
*  They start storming your estate. Well, especially when you talk when you talk about health care because [[02:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=10037.58s)]
*  There's people whose job is to deny people health care that deserve it. That's how because that's how they save money [[02:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=10043.66s)]
*  Which is that's crazy to think of but that's I mean, what is the alternative socialized medicine? [[02:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=10050.14s)]
*  The problem with that is it doesn't incentivize doctors to be the best. I want my doctor to drive a fucking porsche [[02:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=10056.22s)]
*  Yeah, I want my doctor to have a 911 turbo and a nice watch [[02:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=10061.9s)]
*  It's it's no you're right because you want the smartest people to be the doctors [[02:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=10065.02s)]
*  You don't want them running hedge funds, right? Like there's a lot of probably really smart people running hedge funds [[02:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=10067.74s)]
*  I don't want them doing that shit. Right? Like I want them fixing diseases, right? [[02:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=10071.58s)]
*  You know, I want and if there's not enough money in it. Yeah, they're gonna go to the hedge hedge fund shit [[02:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=10075.02s)]
*  Which is meaningless. Yeah, so it's like [[02:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=10079.18s)]
*  It's a tricky problem [[02:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=10082.300000000001s)]
*  How do you create a you know a system that incentivizes the most brilliant people to be in positions where they help us all? [[02:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=10083.980000000001s)]
*  But how do you make sure that the nefarious actors are not finding ways to squeeze probably the most vulnerable? [[02:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=10090.060000000001s)]
*  How do we eliminate nefarious actors from the world or do we ever you can't you can't they're there and [[02:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=10095.740000000002s)]
*  They will pop into these positions [[02:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=10103.02s)]
*  And I think they're there also to help you appreciate non-nefarious people [[02:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=10105.98s)]
*  Yeah, like we wouldn't know good right unless there is bad. Yeah, that's real. That's a good perspective to have on bad [[02:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=10110.300000000001s)]
*  That's a that's the good and evil struggle forever. That's the yin and the yang [[02:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=10117.1s)]
*  That's at all. It's like that's how the world moves forward [[02:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=10121.74s)]
*  That's how it advances it protects itself against evil and evil tries to find ways through the fucking cracks [[02:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=10124.54s)]
*  They develop better antivirus software [[02:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=10130.140000000001s)]
*  It's a simulation [[02:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=10135.98s)]
*  A little bit man. It might be it's gonna be so maybe it already is and maybe it always was [[02:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=10137.66s)]
*  Maybe it always was and if it's a simulation once it can be a simulation twice [[02:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=10143.82s)]
*  So if we can create the simulation and we were created as a simulation [[02:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=10149.1s)]
*  that means that [[02:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=10153.98s)]
*  We could be like the 20th version of it and we're probably about to create a way better one with ai [[02:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=10155.5s)]
*  That's probably what ai is ai is probably the god of the simulation [[02:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=10161.9s)]
*  We probably lock that motherfucker in turn it on then it figures out how to do everything [[02:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=10166.14s)]
*  Do you have any concern about ai? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah elon says there's a 20 chance everything goes sideways [[02:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=10170.78s)]
*  But an 80 chance it's an overall net good for humanity [[02:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=10176.22s)]
*  But 20 chance like we're fucked. That's a high number. That's not a good number [[02:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=10179.66s)]
*  That's I don't like that if i'm playing rush roulette. I got 10 chambers and I spin that bitch [[02:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=10183.9s)]
*  I don't like there's two bullets in there. Yeah, I don't like that. That makes me nervous [[02:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=10188.779999999999s)]
*  but uh, I also think you've got a lot of like really good smart people trying to [[02:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=10193.66s)]
*  Make sure that at the very least [[02:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=10199.98s)]
*  The people here invented before the people in china, which I think is probably important like whoever [[02:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=10202.859999999999s)]
*  Whoever launches the god first is going to be in charge of a lot of stuff. Yeah [[02:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=10208.939999999999s)]
*  It's kind of getting fucking very strange. Andrew schultz [[02:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=10213.82s)]
*  It's already very strange, but it's going to get even stranger [[02:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=10217.26s)]
*  We'll be here to enjoy it. Yes, sir. We'll be make fun of it my brother [[02:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I&t=10220.86s)]
