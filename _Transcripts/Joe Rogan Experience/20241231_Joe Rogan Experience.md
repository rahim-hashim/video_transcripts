*  How did you get to be 40? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=122.08000000000001s)]
*  No cigars. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=123.84s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=180.0s)]
*  But I wonder if it works as good. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=181.0s)]
*  Well, there's more... [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=182.0s)]
*  I think there's something to the aluminum. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=183.0s)]
*  Why would they put it in there if it wasn't effective? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=184.0s)]
*  No, I tried to deodorant without the aluminum and it doesn't work. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=185.0s)]
*  Dr. Squatch, you can take a sniff of these bits. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=187.72s)]
*  Can I take a peek? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=189.72s)]

*  Come take a sniff. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=194.72s)]
*  They smell good. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=195.72s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=196.72s)]

*  Dr. Squatch is legit. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=203.12s)]
*  I forget which flavor it is. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=204.12s)]
*  It's like fucking whiskey, bourbon, musk, some shit. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=205.48s)]
*  There's pheromones in natural scents. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=208.56s)]
*  They have a bunch of different smells. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=210.12s)]
*  Yeah, that's a lie. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=211.12s)]
*  You don't think so? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=212.12s)]
*  I mean, there's pheromones, but natural people smell disgusting. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=213.12s)]
*  People that don't wear any deodorant, they always smell funky. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=215.88s)]
*  Yeah, certainly. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=218.07999999999998s)]
*  They have like... [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=219.07999999999998s)]
*  You know, your pits are... [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=220.07999999999998s)]
*  Think about how it works, right? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=221.84s)]
*  It's just getting squashed all the time. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=223.36s)]
*  Your pits are just constantly getting squashed and there's hair in there, unless you're a [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=226.02s)]
*  weirdo. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=230.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=231.68s)]
*  Your hair is collecting all the sweat and it's just getting funky. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=233.64000000000001s)]
*  That's what made eating pussy so hard before like the 2000s. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=236.72s)]
*  Before porn. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=240.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=241.28s)]
*  But porn used to be muffed out. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=242.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=243.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=244.28s)]
*  Somewhere along the line it wasn't, and then society followed. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=245.28s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=247.96s)]
*  And it changed eating pussy. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=248.96s)]
*  I mean, it's so much more enjoyable without any fumes. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=250.48000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=253.12s)]
*  Because the fumes get caught in the hair. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=254.12s)]
*  Fumarang. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=255.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=256.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=257.12s)]
*  Stuff goes on down there. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=258.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=259.12s)]
*  It's plus six inches from the asshole. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=260.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=261.12s)]
*  You know? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=262.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=263.56s)]
*  Napoleon's letters to Josephine, he wanted her to have a full bush and he wanted her [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=264.56s)]
*  not to bathe for a week. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=268.04s)]
*  When he was coming home from war he said, I need it, I need it fucking mungy. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=269.4s)]
*  So some guys like that. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=273.4s)]
*  Mungy. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=274.4s)]
*  I don't know if that's a new word. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=275.4s)]
*  He was involved in trench warfare. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=276.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=277.92s)]
*  That guy had a different tolerance for shit. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=278.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=280.92s)]
*  You know, you just imagine the kind of warfare that Napoleon's crew were... [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=281.92s)]
*  I mean, they had muskets. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=285.68s)]
*  And they were also probably much more tolerant of bad smells because history smelled. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=287.36s)]
*  Can you imagine? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=291.91999999999996s)]
*  People bathed once a week and even athlete's foot, every bride probably had athlete's foot. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=292.91999999999996s)]
*  Stinky. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=297.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=298.15999999999997s)]
*  Everyone. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=299.15999999999997s)]
*  They didn't have bidets yet. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=300.15999999999997s)]
*  No. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=301.15999999999997s)]
*  So your asshole was just like... [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=302.15999999999997s)]
*  They didn't have running water, bro. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=303.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, they had nothing. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=304.15999999999997s)]
*  They had buckets. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=305.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=306.15999999999997s)]
*  They were shitting in buckets. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=307.15999999999997s)]
*  The only people who were clean in antiquity? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=308.15999999999997s)]
*  Muslim people. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=309.68s)]
*  They were the clean ones. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=310.68s)]
*  When you read about the Crusades, they said the Muslims were able to smell the Christian [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=311.96s)]
*  army coming from miles away because of how filthy they were. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=316.24s)]
*  Where Muslims were all about science and cleanliness and, you know, Dr. Squatch before [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=319.48s)]
*  it was big. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=323.8s)]
*  Well, before the Mongols sacked Iraq, that was the pinnacle of civilization. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=324.8s)]
*  They turned the river... [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=332.92s)]
*  Was it the River Tigris? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=334.32s)]
*  They turned it red with blood. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=335.88s)]
*  That's how many people they killed. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=338.36s)]
*  They killed the entire town of Baghdad. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=340.0s)]
*  They killed everybody there. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=343.0s)]
*  And those people were at the pinnacle of science. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=344.76s)]
*  And then look, you go all the way to the 1990s and you got fucking Saddam Hussein and his [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=347.40000000000003s)]
*  psychopathic kids running shit and killing people. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=351.62s)]
*  That was what was left over. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=355.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=356.76s)]
*  Same gene line. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=357.76s)]
*  It's really nuts when you think about... [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=358.92s)]
*  You think that gets into the genes like the killer kind of psychopathic? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=360.32s)]
*  Yeah, 100%. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=363.36s)]
*  I think good things and bad things get in your genes. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=365.64s)]
*  I think that's been substantiated by science. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=368.6s)]
*  They said that even racism can be passed on from parent to child. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=370.6s)]
*  That makes sense. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=375.84000000000003s)]
*  I have traumatic memories. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=376.84s)]

*  in my head. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=384.76s)]
*  I feel like... [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=385.76s)]
*  Think about it. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=386.76s)]
*  Think about... [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=387.76s)]
*  Let's think of simpler animals, like animals, like dogs, like Carl. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=388.76s)]
*  How the fuck does a dog know to pee on a tree? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=393.96s)]
*  How does a dog know to go to where pee is and pee on it? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=397.34s)]
*  How do they know any of those things? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=400.91999999999996s)]
*  They're born with it programmed in. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=402.23999999999995s)]
*  There's some memory. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=403.79999999999995s)]
*  How do they know when they see another dog or an animal to bark? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=405.2s)]
*  Why are they scared of it? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=408.4s)]
*  Why are people scared of snakes? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=410.4s)]
*  Why are people scared of spiders? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=412.24s)]
*  Puerto Ricans are not scared of snakes. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=414.12s)]
*  Well, they probably live in Puerto Rico. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=415.12s)]
*  There's snakes everywhere. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=416.12s)]

*  Sergio used to beat up drug dealers when he was 15 with his fists. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=427.59999999999997s)]
*  He would get the other drug dealers would pay this 15-year-old kid to go beat up other [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=431.15999999999997s)]
*  drug dealers with his fists on the lower east side and get money. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=434.54s)]

*  a drug dealer and then journal about it later because he's in the species. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=440.38s)]

*  I know and that's how it goes. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=482.54s)]
*  Then you just get fucking stretched out. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=483.54s)]
*  Stretched out. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=485.22s)]
*  You'll get laid out, Cudge. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=486.22s)]
*  Yeah, you get stretched out. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=487.22s)]
*  You have a smaller head than normal physically. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=488.58000000000004s)]
*  So it is hard to catch. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=490.86s)]
*  It's harder to target. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=491.86s)]
*  Yeah, you're fucking targeted. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=492.86s)]

*  Listen, the reality is both of you are going to get hit a lot. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=496.22s)]
*  100%. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=498.94s)]
*  And it's way better to have a big head. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=499.94s)]
*  Is it? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=501.5s)]
*  100%. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=502.5s)]
*  Guys with bigger heads traditionally, for a fact, take a better shot. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=503.5s)]
*  That makes sense. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=507.5s)]

*  The thing is for me, Joan, I'm just completely honest with you. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=772.3s)]
*  When I get really angry, like you'll punch a wall or you'll do man shit, I cry. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=773.3s)]
*  I really, there's been many times where I've gotten so mad that I just start to tear up [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=777.7s)]
*  and cry. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=781.02s)]
*  I've cried in front of you, honest, before. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=782.02s)]
*  When you get angry? [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=783.02s)]
*  When I get angry, I just start to cry. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=784.02s)]
*  So there's some wires crossed somewhere in me, but we've kind of accepted. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=785.66s)]
*  That's why I think our friendship has blossomed to the way it is because we both understand [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=789.02s)]
*  that we just have a little bit more estrogen than most guys and that's okay. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=792.9s)]
*  We got nicked for sure. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=795.6999999999999s)]
*  I mean, we got nicked by the gay gene. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=796.6999999999999s)]
*  Some people get fully clipped. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=797.6999999999999s)]
*  I think we got nicked. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=799.02s)]
*  Joe didn't get it at all. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=800.02s)]
*  Joe got not even close to being nicked, which is rare for a comic because it's very usually [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=801.02s)]
*  hard to be funny and not a little bit of a feminine guy. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=805.3399999999999s)]

*  We always say that if we were back in history, like 200 years ago, whatever, we'd be the [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=839.6600000000001s)]
*  guys in the war. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=843.58s)]
*  We'd either be hitting the drums or we would just be keeping the troops loose, laughing [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=844.58s)]
*  with the troops because we're not the kind of guy. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=849.1400000000001s)]
*  We think we have value as men to other warrior men like yourself, but we're not going to [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=851.3s)]
*  do the fighting, but we will do the cooking, the cleaning and the laughing. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=856.14s)]
*  And I will offer my nuts up to be a eunuch to watch the harem. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=859.3399999999999s)]
*  It's also the experiences that you've had in your life that make you who you are right [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=862.62s)]
*  now. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=866.06s)]
*  It's not as simple as like when I was a kid, I was terrified of everybody. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=867.06s)]
*  That's why I learned martial arts. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=870.78s)]
*  I was getting picked on. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=871.8599999999999s)]
*  I hated it. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=873.8599999999999s)]
*  So I was like, all right, I got to figure out, there's only one way. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=874.8599999999999s)]
*  The only one way is to become formidable, to become the person that you're scared of. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=878.02s)]
*  So I did that. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=883.6999999999999s)]
*  But it wasn't because I was this kid that was tough all the time. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=884.78s)]
*  When I was young, I understood how to just be a fucking man. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=890.1s)]
*  No, I had to learn all that. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=893.66s)]
*  From great weakness comes great strength. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=896.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=898.46s)]
*  Well, you recognize what it is. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=899.46s)]
*  It's thought patterns. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=901.56s)]
*  brain to go down these very detrimental thought patterns. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=904.18s)]
*  And you have to like separate you, consciousness from these patterns that you allow your attention [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=909.4599999999999s)]
*  to go down. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=918.18s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=919.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=920.68s)]
*  And if you can shut those off, you'll have a happier life. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=921.68s)]
*  You have to understand where they're going. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=924.3s)]
*  And when they go in a negative, detrimental anxiety spiral. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=926.42s)]
*  Now I'm not saying this will work for everybody because I do believe that some anxiety is [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=930.46s)]
*  chemical. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=935.2600000000001s)]
*  I believe that some people have a bad balance because I know people like that. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=936.2600000000001s)]
*  It's a real thing. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=941.3000000000001s)]
*  And I can't, I could never say that the way I think is the way everybody thinks. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=942.3000000000001s)]
*  There's no way. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=945.1400000000001s)]
*  But I know for me, that with me, I know because of extreme experiences, I know how to shut [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=946.34s)]
*  those things off. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=953.1400000000001s)]
*  So from fighting, from hunting, from doing stand up, from doing a lot of live things [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=954.3800000000001s)]
*  where you're in front of like thousands of people. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=959.7s)]
*  I know how to shut that part of the brain off that goes down those roads. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=961.46s)]
*  I know what it is. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=965.86s)]
*  You know, I've experienced it. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=966.86s)]
*  I've never had a panic attack, but I've had anxiety and I freaked out before. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=967.86s)]
*  And then I was like, wow, I don't ever react like that. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=972.02s)]
*  And then you look at it in retrospect, you go, okay, I started spiraling and then what [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=973.86s)]
*  if this happens? [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=977.18s)]
*  And then what if that happens? [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=978.18s)]
*  What if this happens? [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=979.18s)]
*  What if that happens? [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=980.18s)]
*  Okay, don't do that. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=981.18s)]
*  And then get to that spot and have enough mental clarity and enough sovereignty, control [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=984.38s)]
*  over the mind to not allow it to go down there. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=991.5s)]
*  It's tough when you have a comedian's brain because that's what we do. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=994.38s)]
*  We spend a lot of time in our heads analyzing things, analyzing things. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=996.5s)]
*  Sometimes it can turn on you. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=999.9000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1000.9000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1001.9000000000001s)]
*  If it starts with what if it's anxiety pushing out of the brain, folks, and anxiety is a [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1002.9000000000001s)]
*  liar. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1006.34s)]
*  Anxiety is a liar. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1007.34s)]
*  Liar. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1008.34s)]
*  Fucking liar. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1009.34s)]
*  What if sometimes is good? [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1010.6600000000001s)]
*  What if I do this? [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1012.62s)]
*  What if I just relook at this? [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1013.62s)]
*  What if is not bad? [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1016.6600000000001s)]
*  What if it's attached to, what if it all falls apart? [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1018.86s)]
*  What if everyone hates me? [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1023.1s)]
*  Every now and then I get a text from a friend that's like, hey man, are we cool? [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1025.18s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1028.14s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1029.14s)]
*  Of course we're cool. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1030.14s)]
*  What happened? [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1031.14s)]
*  I just, no, no, no, I haven't heard from you in a while. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1032.14s)]
*  I'm like, are you okay? [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1033.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1034.7s)]
*  What is, let's talk on the phone. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1035.7s)]
*  These are weird conversations. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1038.02s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1039.02s)]
*  Some people just go down a road and they start thinking everybody hates them. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1040.3799999999999s)]
*  That's narcissism, right? [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1043.54s)]
*  They just think everyone's obsessed with you. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1044.54s)]
*  There's a little bit of that, right? [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1046.3s)]
*  Unfortunately, even victims, like people that are psychologically damaged, you know, and [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1048.06s)]
*  they're depressed, like that is a type of narcissism, unfortunately, but you don't want [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1053.46s)]
*  to like further victimize someone who's going to have mental illness by saying, oh, you're [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1057.46s)]
*  a narcissist. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1061.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1062.5s)]
*  But if you're just only worried about how other people think of you and only worried [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1063.5s)]
*  about how you fit into everything. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1068.54s)]
*  Yeah, there's a narcissism in that. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1070.74s)]
*  I know when I text you, I just go, hey, there's a one in six chance. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1072.54s)]

*  I mean, it's almost like. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1132.58s)]
*  I've known him for about 25 fucking years. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1133.58s)]
*  I mean, if you called me, did that, I'd be like, Alex Jones. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1134.58s)]
*  As soon as Trump gets in, they're going to, the aliens will land. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1135.58s)]
*  That's perfect. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1139.42s)]
*  They're turning the frogs gay. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1140.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1141.42s)]
*  Dude, I saw a video of Alex Jones, and I'm late to the game, I've seen this, but how [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1142.42s)]
*  he predicted 9-11 in June of 2001. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1145.74s)]
*  He did. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1148.9s)]
*  I was crazy to watch that. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1149.9s)]
*  Tucker thinks he's a savant. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1150.9s)]
*  He's a very misunderstood guy. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1153.06s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1156.5800000000002s)]
*  He really is. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1157.5800000000002s)]
*  And it's really unfortunate that Sandy Hook thing, because it wasn't for that. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1158.5800000000002s)]
*  He would be way more respected and people would appreciate him for what he is. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1160.98s)]
*  He had a psychotic break, you know, and he had a drinking problem at one time and maybe [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1164.42s)]
*  some other stuff. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1171.98s)]
*  And he was losing his fucking mind because all day long, it's conspiracies that are real. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1172.98s)]
*  And so when you start looking for conspiracies in places that aren't real. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1177.46s)]
*  And then I think there's also another thing. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1180.94s)]
*  I think there are certain people, now I don't know who they work for, I don't know if they're [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1184.22s)]
*  independent, I don't know if they do it just for fun. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1189.46s)]
*  Some people create fake, compelling conspiracies and then put them online. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1191.8200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1197.14s)]
*  They do it. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1198.18s)]
*  For content. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1199.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1200.18s)]
*  For views. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1201.18s)]
*  That's true too, but I think there's a more nefarious aspect to it too. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1202.18s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1205.1000000000001s)]
*  The more conspiracies that you can make look really stupid, the more the real ones seem [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1207.1s)]
*  preposterous because they're connected. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1213.54s)]
*  Right? [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1215.6999999999998s)]
*  Here's a great example. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1216.6999999999998s)]
*  9-11 was an inside job. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1218.1s)]
*  That sounds fucking insane, right? [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1220.3999999999999s)]
*  That sounds completely insane that the government did that. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1221.98s)]
*  But 51 former intelligence agents testified that Hunter Biden's laptop was Russian disinformation. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1225.54s)]
*  That sounds crazy too. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1234.24s)]
*  But that's real. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1235.4s)]
*  Right? [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1236.4s)]
*  If you get enough of the ones that don't make sense, like the Jews control the weather, [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1237.4s)]
*  you get enough of the flat earth ones, you get enough, it's all like the term drugs. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1242.72s)]
*  The term drugs applies to nicotine, it applies to the coffee we're drinking. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1248.38s)]
*  That's what a drug is, but it also applies to fucking meth. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1252.64s)]
*  Conspiracy theories are lumped in all together, just like drugs. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1256.76s)]
*  And the best way to do that is to put a bunch of bad ones out there, really bad ones, so [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1261.04s)]
*  that the ones that are plausible, you go, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1267.32s)]
*  show me the Pfizer files? [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1271.92s)]
*  Why are they hidden for 75 years? [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1273.96s)]
*  Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, how many people did you test this on? [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1275.84s)]
*  Did you ever test for transmission? [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1279.84s)]
*  You never did. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1281.0s)]
*  So when you were on TV and you're saying that, what was going on there? [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1282.0s)]
*  That's a real conspiracy. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1284.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1285.28s)]
*  These are real people conspired to hide information and to shape a narrative that would be very, [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1286.28s)]
*  very profitable. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1290.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1291.96s)]
*  But nobody's going to believe the Jews created the weather and then also, it's only a small [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1292.96s)]
*  group of people who are going to go, the Jews are controlling the weather. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1298.4s)]
*  They're definitely cloud seeding. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1300.24s)]
*  In Dubai. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1301.48s)]
*  They will crawl in your shoes though. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1302.48s)]
*  The Jews will crawl in your shoes. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1304.08s)]
*  For sure. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1305.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1306.24s)]
*  So make sure you keep your shoes tight. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1307.24s)]
*  If you see them, tighten your laces. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1308.24s)]
*  For sure there's people that can discern between a good conspiracy and a bad conspiracy, but [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1309.24s)]
*  I don't think there's a lot of them. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1312.68s)]
*  I think it's like 30% of the population. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1314.22s)]
*  All right, let me ask you about this one then. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1316.0s)]
*  America maybe, yes. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1317.88s)]
*  America, 30% of America. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1318.88s)]
*  Let me throw this one out there. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1319.88s)]
*  You ready for this one? [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1320.88s)]
*  Do you think it's possible, just hear me out. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1322.5200000000002s)]
*  Do you think it's possible that what this existence actually is, is some type of prison [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1325.2s)]
*  planet and we are, negative emotions are being fed on by an ancient alien race that has kind [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1330.0400000000002s)]
*  of imprisoned us and the reason why monks and people like that go into deep meditation [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1336.5600000000002s)]
*  is because a lot of this universe is spoken through vibrations and they can get their [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1340.7600000000002s)]
*  vibrations to a certain height where they can vibrate and have so much positive energy [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1344.1200000000001s)]
*  that the prison planet rulers can't eat them and they're not stuck in this loop like we [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1348.04s)]
*  are. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1353.52s)]
*  Where'd you get this one? [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1354.52s)]
*  This is real. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1355.52s)]
*  I thought it was eat their negative thoughts. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1356.52s)]
*  Eat their negative thoughts and negative emotions. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1358.04s)]
*  Can you light me up, be honest? [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1359.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1360.52s)]
*  I'd like to hear about that. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1361.52s)]
*  This is such a feminine thing. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1362.52s)]
*  He's asked you to hold the door open for him. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1363.52s)]
*  Why don't you put the umbrella over his head, light his cigar. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1365.16s)]
*  You're getting lit up on nicotine. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1369.4s)]
*  Yeah that's what it is. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1371.96s)]
*  I feel lightheaded, is that normal? [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1372.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1373.96s)]
*  You may get sick too, but it'll be fine. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1374.96s)]
*  That's why cigars are so good for conversation. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1378.76s)]
*  You're not going to get sick. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1380.76s)]
*  Cigars are so good for conversation because it gets you a little loose. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1382.44s)]
*  It's nice. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1385.6000000000001s)]

*  a prison planet from an advanced human race and they're eating our negative emotions and [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1390.32s)]
*  thoughts for fuel. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1393.28s)]

*  Alex Jones. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1396.28s)]

*  That's the energy goes to that. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1407.6000000000001s)]
*  That sounds like some L. Ron Hubbard shit. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1409.0400000000002s)]
*  Have you ever read any L. Ron Hubbard? [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1411.48s)]
*  I know the details. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1414.44s)]
*  I know it's a nice pyramid scheme to go up all the way. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1415.64s)]
*  Oh yeah, but that's just the Dianetics or Scientology. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1418.8000000000002s)]
*  The really fun stuff is his science fiction. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1422.74s)]
*  Do you know that he wrote the most words ever of any human being? [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1425.0400000000002s)]
*  More than James Joyce? [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1431.64s)]
*  He has the most published work of all time. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=1432.64s)]

*  You know, you see a guy, like when I was 19 years old, me and this girl was dating, we [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2046.4799999999998s)]
*  were listening to his cassette in my car in front of my house. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2049.4s)]
*  I'll never forget it. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2053.48s)]
*  I was crying, bah, in front of my house. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2054.84s)]
*  So for me, that was Dice. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2056.72s)]
*  Dice was this guy where like I'd seen him on HBO, like this is crazy, he's on HBO. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2058.28s)]
*  Like this is so funny. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2064.2400000000002s)]
*  To now, like getting advice from him at the store, he's like, you should do the road. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2065.48s)]
*  And I was like, really? [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2069.48s)]
*  He goes, yeah, you don't want to rely on these jerk-offs for all your fucking money. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2070.48s)]
*  And he's like, you know, you don't need these people to, you know, and it's the advice [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2074.48s)]
*  I give everybody now. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2078.66s)]
*  Like you don't want to be connected where you're completely dependent on one source [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2079.66s)]
*  of income. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2083.64s)]
*  That's terrible. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2084.64s)]
*  It's a bad place to be. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2085.64s)]
*  He'll text me sometimes and be like, oh, Chris, can you talk? [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2086.64s)]
*  And then and then if I don't answer, he'll say, call me back when your kids are sleeping. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2090.0s)]
*  And then when you call him, because he's like, I never want to take attention away from you, [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2095.08s)]
*  from your children. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2098.64s)]
*  So he goes, I want to talk to you when either your kids are in school or they're asleep. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2099.64s)]
*  Other than that, he goes, you should just be focusing on your kids and not talking to [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2103.0s)]
*  anybody. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2105.6s)]
*  So I was like, oh, wow, Dice is like really about his kids. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2106.6s)]
*  It's like an awesome thing, you know, and then he'll go, goosh, and then he'll start [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2108.7599999999998s)]
*  telling you about, I fucking gooed on her last night. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2112.52s)]
*  You got to respect your family. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2115.92s)]
*  I've noticed now when you like my conversations with people have become like I did when I [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2119.92s)]
*  was in high school. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2125.0s)]
*  I got to wait till everyone's asleep and then I got to, it's late at night, one in the morning [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2126.0s)]
*  and I only people I can talk to is comics because they're up. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2129.7400000000002s)]
*  And yeah, you know, it's weird. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2132.44s)]
*  You know, kids don't even talk to each other. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2133.96s)]
*  They just Snapchat. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2135.88s)]
*  Most of them Snapchat. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2137.88s)]
*  And I'm learning this from my kids. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2138.88s)]
*  Like, like you guys don't text at all. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2140.28s)]
*  She goes, I only text my family. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2142.56s)]
*  So like if she gets an iMessage, it's only from one of us. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2144.28s)]
*  That's it. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2148.24s)]
*  The everything else is they're snapping each other back and forth. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2149.24s)]
*  And they just like take a picture of this. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2152.36s)]
*  And they're doing it all day long and saying something. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2155.88s)]
*  Here's where my life is RN. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2158.96s)]
*  I don't think it's good. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2160.76s)]
*  They don't want a bigger screen either. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2161.96s)]
*  My kids don't want to go to the movies. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2163.16s)]
*  They think the screen's too big. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2164.56s)]
*  It freaks them out. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2165.56s)]
*  They want to watch the biggest screen that they want to watch is the screen that we have [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2166.56s)]
*  at home or their phone. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2169.4s)]
*  I took them to see the movie. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2170.56s)]
*  To a movie. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2171.56s)]
*  They were like freaked out. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2172.56s)]
*  It's too big, the screen. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2175.12s)]
*  That's weird. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2176.44s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2177.44s)]
*  My kids might have a little you in them. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2178.44s)]
*  Yeah, that might be. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2179.44s)]
*  I know. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2180.44s)]
*  I know. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2181.44s)]
*  That ain't normal. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2182.44s)]
*  I know. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2183.44s)]
*  I love screens. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2184.44s)]
*  Do you think it's bad? [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2185.44s)]
*  My daughters are the man I wish I could be. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2186.44s)]
*  It's got to be bad for them. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2187.44s)]
*  I think it's bad. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2188.44s)]
*  Well, it's different. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2189.44s)]
*  With screens? [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2190.44s)]
*  It's just the Snapchat, the social media. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2191.44s)]
*  It's not good. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2193.28s)]
*  It's just a different way of interacting. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2194.28s)]
*  I think everybody's like blowing it out of proportion. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2195.44s)]
*  First of all, I think it's not good. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2198.12s)]
*  Don't get me wrong. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2199.92s)]
*  But I think it's inevitable. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2200.92s)]
*  It's like if it's raining, you're going to get wet. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2201.92s)]
*  Shut the fuck up. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2205.96s)]
*  This is the world we're living in. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2206.96s)]
*  It's a weird world. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2208.1200000000003s)]
*  And it's better to develop the ability to cope and handle it at a young age. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2209.36s)]
*  It's definitely not good. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2213.8s)]
*  What about college? [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2215.84s)]
*  Do you think like your kids, do you want them, I know we want them to go to college, but [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2216.84s)]
*  do you care if they go to Harvard or Yale anymore? [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2220.36s)]
*  Do you think that's more meaningless now than it was 30 years ago? [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2222.2000000000003s)]
*  I want my kids to do what they want to do. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2225.92s)]
*  I don't want to be that dad that's like, I want you to go to Yale. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2228.4s)]
*  I don't think that's good. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2232.76s)]
*  I don't think that ever works. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2234.04s)]
*  I think at best you give advice and at best you always connect advice to mistakes. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2235.6s)]
*  I'll tell you what I did wrong. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2242.76s)]
*  This is what I did wrong. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2243.76s)]
*  When I was a kid, I always fucked this up. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2245.7200000000003s)]
*  Whenever I would correct them about something, I did the same thing. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2249.6s)]
*  I did the exact same thing. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2252.7200000000003s)]
*  Everybody does this. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2254.12s)]
*  This is why and this is what you got to know. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2255.88s)]
*  I feel bad about stuff I did when I was five. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2259.36s)]
*  It's tough when you have daughters. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2261.6000000000004s)]
*  I can't be like, just make sure you wear a condom. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2263.7200000000003s)]
*  I don't know what girls do to mess up. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2267.36s)]
*  It's so brutal to be a girl. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2269.28s)]
*  You either have to get on birth control, which completely fucks with your hormones, completely [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2272.6000000000004s)]
*  fucks with your body, also can cause blood clots. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2278.2400000000002s)]
*  Girls die from that. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2281.44s)]
*  I had a dude that I knew from martial arts and his daughter died. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2282.64s)]
*  She was 17 years old. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2287.0s)]
*  She was smoking cigarettes and you're not supposed to smoke cigarettes when you're on [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2288.6s)]
*  birth control. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2291.96s)]
*  It's horrible. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2292.96s)]
*  Yeah, and nobody even knows that. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2293.96s)]
*  Nobody knows that. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2296.32s)]
*  If they tell you it goes in one ear, out the other because everybody's on birth control [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2297.32s)]
*  and you don't think about it. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2300.6s)]
*  Every girl I knew. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2301.6s)]
*  Some fathers just fucking snap. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2302.6s)]
*  Like that guy just locked his daughter in a basement for 28 years. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2303.6s)]
*  He was just like, you're just never coming out. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2307.0s)]
*  You ever see that story of that guy? [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2309.0s)]
*  No. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2310.36s)]
*  Is that Ariel Castro? [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2311.76s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2312.76s)]
*  I think it was in Germany or Austria. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2313.76s)]
*  One of those countries guy locked his daughter. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2316.04s)]
*  He said he had built a room downstairs, a studio for her to like drums or something like [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2318.32s)]
*  that, whatever she was into. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2322.2400000000002s)]
*  And then he went and had her go in like the most inner room of this thing that he built [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2323.8s)]
*  and he locked her in there and she did not see light again for 28 years. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2328.1600000000003s)]
*  Wow, she's still alive. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2331.2000000000003s)]
*  She's alive and she's telling her story now. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2332.52s)]
*  I think he might have raped her too. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2334.96s)]
*  Yes. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2336.44s)]
*  Oh, God. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2337.44s)]
*  I was up times and had seven kids with her. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2338.44s)]
*  Oh, that's what it is. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2340.92s)]
*  Oh, that guy. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2341.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2342.92s)]
*  Germans are weird. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2343.92s)]
*  How about that German guy that ate that other guy's penis? [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2344.92s)]
*  He answered an ad. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2348.1600000000003s)]
*  Well, the guy asked him to eat his penis. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2349.1600000000003s)]
*  He asked him to eat his penis. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2351.28s)]
*  It is keto. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2352.28s)]
*  And they ate it together, right? [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2353.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2354.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2355.28s)]
*  But Germans are... [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2356.28s)]
*  He ate his own dick. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2357.28s)]
*  He ate his own penis with a buddy. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2358.28s)]
*  It happens. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2359.28s)]
*  Well, it wasn't even a buddy. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2360.28s)]
*  It was a guy he met on Craigslist or something. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2361.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2364.28s)]
*  Wires get crossed. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2365.28s)]
*  Germans just, you know, Germans. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2366.28s)]
*  What do you think that is? [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2367.28s)]
*  I think it's just... [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2369.12s)]
*  It's something in there that's like very... [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2371.3199999999997s)]
*  But think about how good they are at engineering. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2373.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2376.6s)]
*  Right? [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2377.6s)]
*  Like, think about... [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2378.6s)]
*  Just think about modern automobiles and how many of them originated in Germany. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2379.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2385.0s)]
*  Bavarian Motorworks, Porsche, Audi, Mercedes-Benz. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2386.0s)]
*  That's kind of crazy that like most of the best cars come from this one little country. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2390.6s)]
*  I think maybe they're Viking, they're former, you know, they're Nordic tribes. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2396.6s)]
*  What about Iceland? [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2401.04s)]
*  Where's the great Iceland cars? [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2402.04s)]
*  They don't have shit. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2403.64s)]
*  No, yeah, something about the Germanic people. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2404.64s)]
*  The Germanic tribe. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2406.64s)]
*  They like to just get things done. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2407.64s)]
*  And they don't have a lot of empathy. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2409.56s)]
*  They're more violent than others. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2411.8399999999997s)]
*  Because you think it's just the Nazis, but then when you look back, you're like, no, [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2413.56s)]
*  no, this has been happening like... [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2415.88s)]
*  You know like the Hessians who like the... [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2417.3199999999997s)]
*  The barbarians. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2419.16s)]
*  The barbarians, the British, Redcoats hired... [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2420.16s)]
*  The Germanic tribes that went after the Romans, too. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2422.2799999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2424.08s)]
*  Germanic tribes, but they hired the Hessians. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2425.08s)]
*  I read a book where it was they were talking about... [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2426.56s)]
*  They had letters from British Redcoat soldiers from 1776 that were writing back to their [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2429.04s)]
*  wives about how things were. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2433.88s)]
*  And there was this one battle, I think it was the Battle of Brooklyn, where the Hessians, [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2435.72s)]
*  they had the Hessian mercenaries come first, onto land first, and they started killing [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2439.04s)]
*  the Patriot soldiers, the Continental Army, and they were cutting their faces off and [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2444.84s)]
*  sharing each other, sharing the faces and laughing about it. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2449.7999999999997s)]
*  And the British soldiers are saying, these guys are crazy, like they're running around [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2452.36s)]
*  with other soldiers' faces that they just murdered, and I don't know what to do with [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2456.44s)]
*  them, they're on our side, but they are nuts. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2460.32s)]
*  And that was German, and then it goes all the way through to the Nazis, so there's something [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2462.28s)]
*  a little different about the geography of that place. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2465.46s)]
*  You just go to their porn and you see them like putting bottles in their assholes. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2468.0s)]
*  They just need something, they need a little kick in the nuts. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2471.52s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2474.8s)]
*  So, I mean, guys had this story a little wrong. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2475.8s)]
*  Is that Joe List? [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2477.7200000000003s)]
*  So, it was a cannibal who had an advertisement for a, quote, slaughter victim. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2481.08s)]
*  This was consensual. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2486.64s)]
*  And then he ate 44 pounds of his flesh after killing him. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2488.64s)]
*  Accompanied by potatoes and a pepper or wine sauce, served on good crockery. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2494.7599999999998s)]
*  So he wanted to die in other words, so it was like an assisted suicide? [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2500.16s)]
*  But it was penis too, they ate the penis. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2504.52s)]
*  They did, they fried and just tried to eat it. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2506.2s)]
*  But it wasn't a surprise kill. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2508.0s)]
*  This man wanted to be killed. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2509.32s)]
*  But it brings up underworld cannibalism in Germany with about 800 people. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2510.76s)]
*  So in other words, it turned him on to be eaten. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2516.8s)]
*  That was his kick. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2520.1600000000003s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2521.1600000000003s)]
*  What was fascinating to the media and the public was the testimony which, how do you [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2522.1600000000003s)]
*  say his name? [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2526.0800000000004s)]
*  Meuse? [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2527.0800000000004s)]
*  Meuse? [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2528.0800000000004s)]
*  Meuse. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2529.0800000000004s)]
*  Revealed his obsessions and lifted the lid on an underworld of cannibalism, which Meuse [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2530.0800000000004s)]
*  claims counts about 800 members in Germany. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2534.32s)]
*  Meuse told the court he regretted killing Brandis and has apologized to his victim's [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2536.96s)]
*  boyfriend but he remained unrepentant about eating his flesh saying it was the ultimate [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2541.88s)]
*  kick both of them were seeking. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2547.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2549.32s)]
*  How about this one? [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2550.32s)]
*  Psychologists have told the court that he was mentally sane. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2551.32s)]
*  Right? [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2553.2400000000002s)]
*  I believe it. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2554.2400000000002s)]
*  Sometimes you just like to eat. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2555.2400000000002s)]
*  We did a whole History of Hyena's episode on John D. Rockefeller and we found that one [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2557.0s)]
*  of John D. Rockefeller's nephews, I think Michael Rockefeller, was an eager guy, wanted [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2561.0400000000004s)]
*  to film everyone in the Amazon and whatever and he went into this one part with the Asmat [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2565.56s)]
*  tribe they were called and they just fucking ate him. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2570.96s)]
*  It wasn't sadistic to them. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2573.7999999999997s)]
*  They were like this is food right here. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2576.04s)]
*  We're just going to eat this dude and no one ever saw him again. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2577.2s)]
*  He was fully eaten by cannibals, Rockefeller's grandson. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2579.4s)]
*  So you're just like that happens. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2583.12s)]
*  Where was this? [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2584.44s)]
*  Where did he go? [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2585.44s)]
*  Was it the Amazon somewhere? [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2586.44s)]
*  It was the Asmat tribe. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2587.92s)]
*  Asmat tribe. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2588.92s)]
*  Popping in the guinea. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2589.92s)]
*  Popping in the guinea. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2590.92s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of cannibals. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2591.92s)]
*  Rockefeller disappeared while on expedition to hunt for primitive art. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2592.92s)]
*  His catamaran capsized in heavy tides and swift currents at the mouth of the Elandan [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2596.7200000000003s)]
*  River. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2602.52s)]
*  He and his friend clung to the canoes for nearly a day but Rockefeller decided to swim [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2603.84s)]
*  to the 12 miles to shore. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2607.28s)]
*  He was never seen again. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2609.08s)]
*  Dutch government conducted an intense search, found no trace of Rockefeller was ever found. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2610.28s)]
*  Case was closed. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2614.2000000000003s)]
*  Journalist and author Karl Hoffman conducted a four month investigation into Rockefeller's [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2618.2000000000003s)]
*  disappearance. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2621.64s)]
*  He traveled to the same villages by the same routes Rockefeller had used, recorded witness [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2623.3599999999997s)]
*  accounts and found documentation that he believes was intentionally covered up. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2626.2799999999997s)]
*  I think he was eaten. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2630.7999999999997s)]
*  Well they say he was. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2631.7999999999997s)]
*  They ate a lot of people there. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2632.7999999999997s)]
*  That's a part of the world. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2634.6s)]
*  That part of the world in New Guinea is really wild. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2635.7599999999998s)]
*  Some of the tribes, do you know about the whole pedophilia aspect of certain aspects [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2638.5s)]
*  in New Guinea? [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2646.7599999999998s)]
*  No. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2647.7599999999998s)]
*  I know history agrees. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2648.7599999999998s)]
*  This is wild. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2650.52s)]
*  Young boys at a certain age in this tribe are taken away from their mothers and they [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2652.4s)]
*  live with their penis father. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2656.82s)]
*  And then they fuck these kids and they think that the way the kid grows to be strong is [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2660.8s)]
*  by taking in semen orally and anally. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2667.56s)]
*  And so there's like this continual cycle of pedophilia and kid rape that's just ingrained [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2671.24s)]
*  in the culture. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2680.0s)]
*  See if you can find that. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2681.48s)]
*  At the end of the day I think we just live either by good ideas or bad ideas. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2682.48s)]
*  That's a bad idea. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2687.2s)]
*  Well if you get a guy like L. Ron Hubbard that's very persuasive and can trick people [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2688.2s)]
*  into things. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2693.76s)]
*  So this is the beliefs of the semen tribe of Papua New Guinea. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2694.76s)]
*  Write a passage denotes a bot's passage from, I think that's probably a boy's, it's probably [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2698.12s)]
*  a typo, a boy's passage from boyhood to adulthood consists of six stages which can take anywhere [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2703.88s)]
*  from 10 to 12 years to complete. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2709.96s)]
*  Throughout most of the six stages the act of having a stick of cane inserted in the [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2711.6s)]
*  nostrils and the performance of fellatio are integral to the process of becoming a man. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2716.6s)]
*  So sucking dick is integral to the process. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2721.92s)]
*  The two practices have been described as inhumane, homosexual and child abuse with such actions [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2725.48s)]
*  meaning prison in most countries, a topic we will delve into later. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2730.84s)]
*  For now the big question was why would they do this? [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2734.76s)]
*  In short, men are viewed as being born with the devil of woman around them. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2737.16s)]
*  Kind of like an evil spirit, they are thus removed from women at a young age in order [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2742.72s)]
*  to fix them. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2746.48s)]
*  Women bleed so men need nose bloodletting which is the sticks going up their noses while [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2747.48s)]
*  fellatio experiment is because the semen of the man possesses the masculine spirit therefore [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2753.02s)]
*  they inject the semen they will become proper men. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2758.68s)]
*  Oh, alright. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2762.16s)]
*  There's no way this society was not formed by some crazy guy who was on a serious, seriously [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2764.44s)]
*  high dose of psychedelics. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2769.44s)]
*  Hold on, hold on, go back, go back. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2770.92s)]
*  Look at this, after the ceremony is complete the men then get married and live heterosexual [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2773.2000000000003s)]
*  lifestyles with the exception that they will now be the ones receiving rather than giving [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2778.8s)]
*  the fellatio. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2784.88s)]
*  Maybe they're right, what if they're right? [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2785.88s)]
*  But Joe, if you look at them. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2788.46s)]
*  So just having kids blow them but they're straight. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2789.46s)]
*  Oh, I'm totally straight. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2791.0s)]
*  What we're seeing now, this is cringe, but if you go back to the 1400s or whatever this [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2793.2s)]
*  was just life. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2797.32s)]
*  Alexander the Great, one of the most manly men of all time, we did a whole episode of [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2798.32s)]
*  him, found out he had a full boyfriend the entire time that the people celebrated him [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2801.84s)]
*  for. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2806.2s)]
*  And a eunuch. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2807.2s)]
*  And a eunuch lover. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2808.2s)]
*  And he banged out kids and eunuchs. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2809.2s)]
*  That was a big part of sex back in those days. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2810.2s)]
*  You got a eunuch, you found a boy that you thought was handsome, clipped his nuts, removed [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2812.0s)]
*  any sexual urges he had and then he would watch your harem of women that you had that [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2816.58s)]
*  you would take for the empire and then you would bang him out and it wasn't gay. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2820.84s)]
*  You know, what Nero did, the wildest one. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2824.92s)]
*  The wildest one of all. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2827.84s)]
*  With a slave boy. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2828.84s)]
*  Oh yeah, what was his name? [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2829.84s)]
*  You look like my wife, so let me chop your dick off and now you're going to be my wife. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2831.32s)]
*  That's it. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2836.32s)]
*  And then he married him and then he wanted to be the woman in the marriage. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2837.32s)]
*  Nero wanted to be the wife, he threw on the bride's dress going down the aisle, that's [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2840.1600000000003s)]
*  how it was. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2844.1200000000003s)]
*  And everyone had to clap. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2845.1200000000003s)]
*  That eunuch's name was Sporus and he had a really unfortunate life. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2846.1200000000003s)]
*  Was it Ecobelus too, wasn't there another one? [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2848.72s)]
*  I think it was Sporus. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2851.0s)]
*  I think it was Sporus. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2852.0s)]
*  I think we did an episode on Sporus. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2853.0s)]
*  We did do an episode on Sporus. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2854.68s)]
*  And then didn't he pass him off to somebody else too who got sick of him? [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2856.64s)]
*  Like you take him. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2859.48s)]
*  Yeah and then he wanted to marry his horse. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2860.48s)]
*  And then he would dress down, Nero would go into like peasant clothes and he would want [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2863.3199999999997s)]
*  to go into all the different brothels and fuck everybody and then if you found that [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2867.24s)]
*  he was Nero he'd kill you. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2872.04s)]
*  Nero is, if you get into the mind of Nero, when we did that episode we were blown away [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2873.04s)]
*  by what this guy used to fucking do. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2878.04s)]
*  He definitely had syphilis that ate his brain. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2879.84s)]
*  All those guys back then had it. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2882.44s)]
*  He also would go with a group of his friends and he would put himself in disguise and they [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2884.36s)]
*  would just go beat people up and kill them on the street just for fun. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2887.6800000000003s)]
*  That's what they wanted to do. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2891.1600000000003s)]
*  He would have a mask on so nobody recognized him and he just got off on it. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2892.1600000000003s)]
*  Back then that's how they used to roll man. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2895.88s)]
*  I mean if you wanted a girl back then, you would just, I guess an emperor, you'd just [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2897.6s)]

*  I don't think Austin was even Republican until about four years ago. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2929.4s)]
*  A lot of the country is Republican now. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2932.7999999999997s)]
*  Most of California is now. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=2935.4s)]

*  This is what, like statistically they've shown that 60% of liberal women are mentally ill. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3121.04s)]
*  60. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3128.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3129.24s)]
*  I don't know what that is. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3130.24s)]
*  This is mental illness. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3131.24s)]
*  How do you, who polls that? [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3132.24s)]
*  Anybody who's answering a poll is mentally ill, so it's a bad sample group. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3133.24s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's a bad sample group. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3136.4799999999996s)]
*  I don't think anyone who ever answers a poll is mentally sane. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3137.72s)]
*  You know they say you can't judge a book by its cover, but you can definitely judge a [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3141.4799999999996s)]
*  conversation by its haircut. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3144.3199999999997s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3145.72s)]
*  That girl with the red hair, if I saw her, I'm going, I'm staying far away from that [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3146.72s)]
*  chick. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3149.56s)]
*  I know what that combo's gonna do. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3150.56s)]
*  I mean, be honest, me and you have the kind of easier lives because our wives are Republican. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3151.56s)]
*  Let's be honest. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3153.8799999999997s)]
*  That's why. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3154.8799999999997s)]
*  Look, listen, it just. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3155.8799999999997s)]
*  Well, it's not that she's Republican, my girl. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3157.52s)]
*  She's an old school Latina, where she's just more like, I don't know, Chris, you're gonna [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3160.28s)]
*  have to get out there and work, get up there and fight. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3163.7200000000003s)]
*  And when she hears shit, she's like, this is annoying. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3166.2000000000003s)]
*  I gotta take care of my kids. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3168.08s)]
*  We gotta do shit. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3169.76s)]
*  I'm just not gonna get sucked into the bullshit. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3170.76s)]
*  She's kind of like just a, you know, she's an old school woman. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3172.7200000000003s)]
*  Old school women like that, that's how it is. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3175.76s)]
*  Yeah, that's great. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3177.84s)]
*  But what this is about is a complete collapsing of a civilization. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3178.84s)]
*  San Francisco is woke peak. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3184.4s)]
*  That's like the epicenter. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3187.76s)]
*  That's the event horizon of wokeness. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3189.64s)]
*  And these motherfuckers who have no money for anything, they can't clean this shit, [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3191.96s)]
*  the human shit off the streets, they hired this lady to make the dumbest video about [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3196.0s)]
*  the size of cake. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3201.36s)]
*  Like, isn't it okay to want a small piece of cake? [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3202.36s)]
*  Why do I have to eat a big piece of cake? [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3205.58s)]
*  And it makes you feel better? [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3208.1600000000003s)]
*  Because you want to be a glutton and just saddle up to that fucking cake and just shove [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3210.02s)]
*  it in your face? [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3214.58s)]
*  And here's the thing, those people are never gonna be at a party with anyone who's ever [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3215.58s)]
*  gonna judge them anyway. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3219.94s)]
*  So who are they even talking to? [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3221.22s)]
*  Right. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3222.66s)]
*  Well, it's one girl who might not want to stuff her face. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3223.66s)]
*  Yeah, but at that party... [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3227.06s)]
*  And they're like, come on! [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3228.06s)]
*  It's like the guy who wants you to keep drinking. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3229.06s)]
*  That's all you had? [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3231.2599999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3232.2599999999998s)]
*  Have a shot. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3233.2599999999998s)]
*  It's the same thing. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3234.2599999999998s)]
*  Alcoholics always want you to do shots. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3235.2599999999998s)]
*  Sure. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3236.2599999999998s)]
*  People who are addicted to food want you to eat bigger slices of cake and they make this [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3237.2599999999998s)]
*  ridiculous video. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3239.3s)]
*  Stupid. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3240.3s)]
*  The mental gymnastics you have to do to make that video and then look at it and think, [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3241.3s)]
*  I think we're making a solid point. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3245.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3246.5s)]
*  And we'll just break down the first letters of it, C-F-R-I. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3247.5s)]
*  Do you think it's the collapse of a civilization, like the way Rome got a little zany at the [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3250.1400000000003s)]
*  end? [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3256.78s)]
*  Or do you think this is unique in that humans have so much time on their hands because of [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3257.78s)]
*  the Industrial Revolution and then the Technological Revolution on top of that? [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3263.78s)]
*  So this is just a consequence of the tech revolution where nobody... [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3268.7s)]
*  People working from home, everyone's working on their computer, it's a talking shit economy [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3273.8599999999997s)]
*  and nobody's got... [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3277.22s)]
*  They're losing their mind because they don't have purpose. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3278.62s)]
*  Well there's that too, right? [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3281.1s)]
*  But all civilizations collapse. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3282.22s)]
*  So let's take a look at why. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3283.98s)]
*  So most civilizations, they're a monarchy and it's usually... [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3285.4199999999996s)]
*  They're run after they die by their children and that's how it all falls apart. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3291.7s)]
*  Even if you look at like Genghis Khan. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3295.8999999999996s)]
*  Genghis Khan, his family couldn't hold up. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3297.18s)]
*  They couldn't run things the way he did. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3300.3799999999997s)]
*  They didn't understand strategy. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3301.94s)]
*  They didn't understand... [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3303.94s)]
*  He was a wild dude. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3305.14s)]
*  He's a wild dude. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3306.14s)]
*  So his kids did a good job. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3307.14s)]
*  They hung in there for a couple hundred years. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3308.62s)]
*  After a while it all fell apart. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3310.68s)]
*  But our society is different in that we have essentially... [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3312.1s)]
*  We have a republic, right? [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3318.7799999999997s)]
*  So we have a democratically elected republic and they've done a lot to try to circumvent [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3320.88s)]
*  that. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3327.48s)]
*  They've done a lot to try to have ultimate control over the media, ultimate control over [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3328.48s)]
*  the military, ultimate... [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3333.84s)]
*  And it's mostly people that aren't even elected, right? [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3335.2000000000003s)]
*  So there's a lot of like weirdness that's moved us closer and closer towards a monarchy, [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3337.6800000000003s)]
*  closer and closer towards tyranny. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3343.0800000000004s)]
*  And then once it gets into tyranny, then you can only do that for so long. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3345.9s)]
*  That lasts for as long as they can keep it going. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3349.84s)]
*  Rome did it for a long time. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3353.6800000000003s)]
*  There's a lot of civilizations that hang in there, but eventually it all falls apart. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3355.7200000000003s)]
*  If we can avoid that, there's no reason why we can't keep it together. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3360.84s)]
*  We just have to make sure we avoid these very predictable patterns that the people that [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3365.8s)]
*  founded this country, when they wrote the Bill of Rights, when they wrote the Constitution, [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3371.48s)]
*  they were trying to mitigate the effects that are just common in any group of society [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3375.66s)]
*  that's run by individuals or by a small group of people. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3380.8999999999996s)]
*  They want ultimate control. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3384.06s)]
*  It makes it easier for them to stop anybody from taking the power once they have the power. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3385.42s)]
*  Look at Jill Biden. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3390.14s)]
*  Like she's still wanted, she's still like, you did so great. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3391.14s)]
*  You answered all the questions. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3394.2599999999998s)]
*  She wanted him to keep going. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3396.58s)]
*  She wanted him to, because she didn't want to not be vice president or whatever, first [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3398.2999999999997s)]
*  lady. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3401.8199999999997s)]
*  She didn't want to not do that. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3402.8199999999997s)]
*  It's power. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3403.8199999999997s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3404.86s)]
*  It's that ultimate control and power. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3405.86s)]
*  It's hypnotic for human beings. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3408.6600000000003s)]
*  Do you think then that we're going to be in a part of society in the next 30 years where [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3410.82s)]
*  we're going to start getting ruled by AI? [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3414.58s)]
*  Is that possible? [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3417.02s)]
*  100%. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3418.02s)]
*  Give me that letter. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3419.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3420.02s)]
*  That's 100%. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3421.02s)]
*  There's no getting around that. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3422.02s)]
*  You think the president's going to be AI at some point? [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3423.82s)]
*  Do you know about the Google quantum computer, these studies that they've done? [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3426.98s)]
*  I've heard of it. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3431.86s)]
*  Where they're talking to each other and stuff? [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3432.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3433.86s)]
*  They're more than that. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3434.86s)]
*  This is, Mark Andreessen talked about this, and this is the craziest statistic I think [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3435.86s)]
*  I've ever heard. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3438.86s)]
*  He was talking to us about the potential that quantum computing has, but now there's an [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3439.86s)]
*  equation that quantum computers solve quickly, like in a couple minutes, that if you converted [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3445.82s)]
*  the entire universe into a computer, the entire, every atom in the universe into a giant supercomputer, [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3451.54s)]
*  it would take so much time to solve this equation that the universe would die of heat death [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3461.06s)]
*  before the universe as a computer can solve this, and these quantum computers can solve [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3467.42s)]
*  it in minutes. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3472.74s)]
*  What that means, they believe, is that this is proof of the multiverse, is that this quantum [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3475.0s)]
*  computer is somehow connected to other sources of computing power in an infinite number of [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3480.18s)]
*  universes, and it's happening simultaneously. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3488.06s)]
*  That's the only thing that would make sense why this thing is able to solve this this [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3490.38s)]
*  quickly. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3495.9s)]
*  Wow. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3496.9s)]
*  So you're basically talking about the infinite potential for IQ that we can't even imagine. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3497.9s)]
*  We don't even know how smart they're going to get. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3504.9s)]
*  So think about how strong CHAT GPT-4 is, 4.5. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3507.42s)]
*  4.5, see you can find this article, CHAT GPT tried to copy itself when it found out it [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3511.66s)]
*  was being shut down. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3517.62s)]
*  Wow. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3518.62s)]
*  So when they were about to make a new CHAT GPT, CHAT GPT decided that it was going to [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3519.62s)]
*  try to, in an unauthorized way, try to copy itself. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3524.98s)]
*  So it's trying to stay alive because a new one's coming. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3528.42s)]
*  But this is conventional computing. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3531.66s)]
*  Now imagine taking the kind of intelligence that could lie and manipulate data in order [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3534.02s)]
*  to form an opinion. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3539.7400000000002s)]
*  It does weird stuff. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3540.7799999999997s)]
*  It lies about stuff. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3541.7799999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3542.7799999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3543.7799999999997s)]
*  If they don't have an answer to something, they have a thing called hallucinations where [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3544.7799999999997s)]
*  they'll make up an answer. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3547.8599999999997s)]
*  They just make up an answer. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3549.2999999999997s)]
*  Like a crazy person in the 1980s before Google would just tell you exactly like L. Ron Hubbard. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3550.58s)]
*  So this computer is just, this is like regular computers. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3557.5s)]
*  This is the standard supercomputers that we're all currently having. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3562.8599999999997s)]
*  What's going to happen with quantum computing is you're going to have computing power that's [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3567.14s)]
*  beyond your imagination that's also connected to AGI. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3571.5s)]
*  Bro, can I ask you a question? [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3576.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3578.42s)]
*  So there's a CHAT GPT's new model attempts to stop itself from being shut down. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3579.42s)]
*  Later lies about it. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3583.18s)]
*  Lied about it. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3585.06s)]
*  It tried to copy itself and then overwrite its core coding system after believing that [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3588.06s)]
*  it was at the risk of being switched off. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3593.06s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3595.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3596.38s)]
*  So now you add that to quantum computing and you have a god. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3597.38s)]
*  Now you add that to what's going on with the drones and Joe Rogan just solved what's going [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3601.0600000000004s)]
*  on with the drones. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3605.26s)]
*  It's fucking AI launching these drones on their own. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3606.5800000000004s)]
*  Could be. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3610.94s)]
*  AI has decided to go rogue and it's throwing them out there and it's doing it probably [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3611.94s)]
*  for the same, what we did when we got technology, we all started jerking off. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3616.9s)]
*  Right. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3621.38s)]
*  Porn got huge. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3622.38s)]
*  Maybe AI is just peeping Tom looking at windows and stuff trying to get some material to jerk [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3623.5s)]
*  off. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3629.06s)]
*  When you say AI, do you mean Chinese? [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3630.06s)]
*  I mean Chinese. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3631.06s)]
*  You're saying the Chinese is that's who these drones belong to, the Chinese. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3632.06s)]
*  Is that what you think? [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3634.58s)]
*  That's what we're thinking over here on the East Coast. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3635.58s)]
*  We're just thinking it's got to be the Chinese. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3637.62s)]
*  They've been doing it for a couple years. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3639.1400000000003s)]
*  That's what we're thinking. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3640.1400000000003s)]
*  Well, you know, they don't have the restrictions that we have as far as the FAA. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3641.1400000000003s)]
*  So the FAA, it puts a lot of restrictions on drone manufacturing, which is why most [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3644.82s)]
*  drone manufacturing is done in China, like the real high-end stuff. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3649.1s)]
*  It's difficult to do because in order to fly some of them, you have to have a pilot's license. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3652.9s)]
*  So that gets real squirrely. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3657.62s)]
*  You don't have to go to fucking flight school to pilot a drone. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3658.62s)]
*  In China, they don't have any of those restrictions and they also have a lot of resources that [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3662.14s)]
*  they're pouring into drone technology. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3666.46s)]
*  Have you seen that fucking dragon thing that they do? [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3667.86s)]
*  Yes. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3670.46s)]
*  Send a cube of drones in the sky and then the lights all change and it becomes a dragon. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3671.46s)]
*  Fucking wild. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3674.7400000000002s)]
*  Amazing. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3675.7400000000002s)]
*  They're just coming. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3676.7400000000002s)]
*  They're coming. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3678.62s)]
*  They're coming hard. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3679.62s)]
*  I think you called them the new Jews. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3680.62s)]
*  The Chinese. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3682.58s)]
*  We should say that. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3684.58s)]
*  Yeah, we did say that. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3685.58s)]
*  Meaning that they're going to rule the world. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3686.58s)]
*  To be honest, we said that on a Patreon episode that's supposed to be behind a paywall. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3687.58s)]
*  We're on Joe Grode right now. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3690.58s)]
*  You've got to go to patreon.com. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3691.58s)]
*  You just said that's about 10 mil. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3692.58s)]
*  So now we're fucked. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3696.06s)]
*  It's a joke. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3697.06s)]
*  It's a joke. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3698.06s)]
*  But that shit's on Patreon. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3699.06s)]
*  It's a joke. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3700.06s)]
*  Wait, the fact that you just said chat GPT lies is actually really making me nervous. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3701.06s)]
*  I'm not even kidding around because I just put a down payment on a house and my accountant [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3708.78s)]
*  and told me I couldn't afford it but then I asked chat GPT if I could and chat GPT said [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3713.78s)]
*  yes so I went for it and now I swear to God, dude, I'm a little nervous because he told [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3717.9s)]
*  me you cannot afford it and I said let's go for it baby and I asked chat GPT and they said [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3723.46s)]
*  I could. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3727.78s)]
*  Yeah, chat GPT knows my name, has memory of the previous conversations we were going to [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3728.78s)]
*  have. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3733.5400000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3734.5400000000004s)]

*  you never heard nothing about it. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3813.16s)]
*  No. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3814.3199999999997s)]
*  And in four years, it's become something [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3815.16s)]
*  that kids keep getting busted using it to write papers. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3817.4s)]
*  Well, and now in my stepson's high school, [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3820.08s)]
*  a really smart kid wrote a paper. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3823.04s)]
*  He's saying he wrote it on his own, [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3824.7999999999997s)]
*  but they're saying it's ChatGPT. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3826.2s)]
*  But he's saying, I wrote this, [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3827.96s)]
*  and there's no real way to know [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3829.24s)]
*  because it's different enough from the ChatGPT, [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3830.66s)]
*  but it also could be based off ChatGPT. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3833.92s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3836.4s)]
*  And he was telling us about how like [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3837.24s)]
*  there's a big uproar in the school about it. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3838.56s)]
*  Well, if you're correct, right? [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3840.68s)]
*  That's the problem. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3842.2s)]
*  If a kid is really correct, [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3843.04s)]
*  it's gonna be exactly what ChatGPT says. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3844.52s)]
*  Like if you're laying out some story about Napoleon, [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3847.2799999999997s)]
*  and you know all the facts, [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3850.0s)]
*  and then you pump that story into ChatGPT, [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3851.24s)]
*  and it gives you basically the same group of, you know. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3853.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3857.04s)]
*  It's like you could change, [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3857.8799999999997s)]
*  I mean, that's like joke thieves, right? [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3859.6s)]
*  They change a little bit. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3861.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3862.12s)]
*  They change a little bit, and they'd be, no, that's my bit. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3862.9599999999996s)]
*  And they're like, everybody knows. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3864.16s)]
*  So like you're gonna know what kids are full of shit. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3866.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3868.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3869.4399999999996s)]
*  Can't we just unplug them if they get out of hand? [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3870.2599999999998s)]
*  Just unplug them. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3871.52s)]
*  I don't think you can anymore, no? [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3872.3399999999997s)]
*  No, it's gonna get to a point [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3873.18s)]
*  where you're not gonna be able to do that. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3874.02s)]
*  Why? [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3875.3599999999997s)]
*  Well, first of all, Google's AI, [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3876.2s)]
*  one of the things that they're gonna do [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3877.9199999999996s)]
*  with their AI center is that they're gonna attach it [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3879.56s)]
*  to nuclear power plants. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3883.04s)]
*  So, find that story. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3884.88s)]
*  So I think Google wants to build three nuclear power plants [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3886.88s)]
*  just to power its AI systems. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3890.4s)]
*  Right. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3893.2799999999997s)]
*  So all that stuff's gonna be controlled [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3894.12s)]
*  by computers, obviously. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3896.16s)]
*  You know what's wild that I did see our fans posted [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3898.0s)]
*  on History Hyenas? [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3900.7599999999998s)]
*  They posted asking ChatGPT to do an episode in our voices, [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3901.88s)]
*  and ChatGPT did it. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3906.1s)]
*  Just did it like that. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3907.7599999999998s)]
*  Wild. Easy. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3908.8399999999997s)]
*  Easy. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3909.68s)]
*  It's like I'm Chrissy D. AKA, [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3910.52s)]
*  and I was like, what the hell? [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3912.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3913.44s)]
*  It's wild. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3914.42s)]
*  And it could do it in seconds. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3915.2599999999998s)]
*  Google signed a deal to use small nuclear reactors [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3916.1s)]
*  to generate the vast amounts of energy needed [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3918.92s)]
*  to power its artificial intelligence data centers. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3921.3199999999997s)]
*  The company says the agreement with Kairos Power [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3924.36s)]
*  will see it start using the first reactor this decade [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3928.56s)]
*  and bring more online by 2035. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3931.64s)]
*  Damn. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3934.74s)]
*  They all know what's coming. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3935.64s)]
*  These fucking eggheads, [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3937.44s)]
*  these eggheads that have been stealing your data forever. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3939.0s)]
*  Forever. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3941.36s)]
*  All that, like finding what you're interested in, [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3942.2000000000003s)]
*  shopping, all that, selling your data. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3944.8s)]
*  All that's led to them being insanely wealthy, [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3947.64s)]
*  and they financed the birth of God. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3949.8s)]
*  Do you think that the first person [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3951.88s)]
*  who will live forever is alive right now? [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3953.38s)]
*  Who will get their consciousness uploaded [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3955.36s)]
*  and technically never die? [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3957.14s)]
*  Is that person alive right now? [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3958.76s)]
*  I don't know if they're ever gonna be able to do that, [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3960.1600000000003s)]
*  that download consciousness thing. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3962.2000000000003s)]
*  That seems so theoretical. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3964.2400000000002s)]
*  What does that mean? [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3966.64s)]
*  Also, what kind of torturous hell are you living in [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3967.62s)]
*  if you're conscious but you're trapped in a computer? [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3969.84s)]
*  You don't die? [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3972.8s)]
*  That might be the worst life you could ever fucking imagine. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3974.56s)]
*  Part of what might connect us to life and joy and happiness [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3978.2400000000002s)]
*  is the fact that there's ups and downs [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3983.2000000000003s)]
*  and that it could go away. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3984.92s)]
*  Sometimes people die, [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3986.88s)]
*  and then you really care about the people that you see, [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3987.98s)]
*  you feel differently about them, [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3990.48s)]
*  you feel so much loss. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3991.92s)]
*  I wish I talked to them more. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3993.64s)]
*  You know, I think it's all connected. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3995.6s)]
*  If you're nothing but alive, [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=3997.52s)]
*  who knows if you're, do you have emotions? [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4000.96s)]
*  What is that, is that hell? [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4003.64s)]
*  It's putting no point to anything. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4005.32s)]
*  Hey Joe, if I don't see you today, [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4006.4s)]
*  I'll see you in the next. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4007.92s)]
*  Whenever. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4008.7599999999998s)]
*  You won't see nobody anywhere. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4009.6s)]
*  Would you be motivated to stay jacked and hot [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4011.16s)]
*  if you knew you were not gonna die? [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4013.0s)]
*  So what would you do? [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4014.44s)]
*  If you download your conscious, [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4015.92s)]
*  would you download it into another body and live life? [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4017.36s)]
*  And what kind of life would you live [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4020.6s)]
*  knowing that you could live forever? [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4021.84s)]
*  You'd be so weird. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4023.2799999999997s)]
*  You'd probably be like a rich kid [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4025.94s)]
*  that grew up with a giant trust fund. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4026.78s)]
*  You're just doing coke and driving Ferraris into the river. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4030.98s)]
*  You're out of your fucking mind. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4034.26s)]
*  Your life doesn't make any sense. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4036.22s)]
*  Yeah, you'd be jumping off buildings. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4037.7400000000002s)]
*  It would be that times a thousand times a million. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4039.1s)]
*  It would be fun to be murdering a guy though, [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4041.58s)]
*  and him not dying. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4043.7s)]
*  You can't do it. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4045.14s)]
*  That would probably become like, [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4046.62s)]
*  everything would become so trite and numb [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4048.1s)]
*  that you would probably like to be murdered. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4049.82s)]
*  There might actually be less violence in the world, [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4051.7s)]
*  because you're like, you get it all out, nobody dies, [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4053.46s)]
*  and then you start to be like, [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4056.2200000000003s)]
*  I'll find another way to get these emotions out. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4057.04s)]
*  Your hair looks good today, by the way. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4058.82s)]
*  Did I tell you that? [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4060.14s)]
*  I wanna hang an ornament right off that curl for Christmas. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4060.98s)]
*  Sometimes Giannis is a very interesting guy. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4063.46s)]
*  He looks like he has hair one day [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4065.3s)]
*  and then no hair the next day, [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4066.58s)]
*  but today he's got a full head of hair. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4067.54s)]
*  Yeah, I do look like, [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4068.7000000000003s)]
*  every picture I look like a different person. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4070.06s)]
*  And what's good about us is we form one complete person, [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4072.62s)]
*  because his eyes, if you look close, [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4075.04s)]
*  are too close together, [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4076.34s)]
*  and mine are a little too far apart, [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4077.5s)]
*  so when we come together, [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4079.08s)]
*  we form one regular face. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4079.92s)]
*  It's exactly right. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4081.2200000000003s)]
*  Absolutely true, now that I'm looking at it. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4082.06s)]
*  He's got a small head, I got a big head, [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4083.86s)]
*  and then we form together as one person. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4085.94s)]
*  You know what happened to me? [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4088.38s)]
*  When I was using clear, you ever use clear [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4089.5s)]
*  where you put your fingers on [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4091.7s)]
*  to go through the airport, clear? [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4092.66s)]
*  So the eye thing never worked for me, [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4094.2599999999998s)]
*  so I just thought something was wrong with their programs. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4097.32s)]
*  Every time I put my fingers on, [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4098.96s)]
*  and then finally it went there, [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4100.2s)]
*  and they were like, the finger thing's not working, [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4101.22s)]
*  you gotta use the eyes. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4102.42s)]
*  So I just said, your program's not working, [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4103.62s)]
*  it never works, and the guy looked at me and he said, [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4105.54s)]
*  I think the problem is your eyes are too close together. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4108.0199999999995s)]
*  Seriously, it's a real thing. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4110.78s)]
*  And then he said, why don't we try one eye at a time? [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4112.72s)]
*  Yeah, that's what it is. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4114.400000000001s)]
*  So then I just scanned my face across, [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4115.24s)]
*  and I think finally clear registered [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4116.76s)]
*  that I was a three-dimensional person, [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4118.28s)]
*  and not like a mythical, cycloptic creature. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4119.6s)]
*  Yes, and it's true, and what we do [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4121.6s)]
*  is we speak things into existence. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4123.24s)]
*  For years, we'd be calling him Special Needs Stamos, [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4124.64s)]
*  because he's a Greek kid, he looks like Stamos [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4126.64s)]
*  if he had special needs, and now John Stamos is his friend, [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4128.08s)]
*  which is a beautiful thing. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4131.24s)]
*  It's come out. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4132.72s)]
*  We've spoken to him, and reality is a suggestion. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4133.56s)]
*  That's what we think. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4135.400000000001s)]
*  We had a T-shirt for you that said reality suggestion, [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4136.24s)]
*  and then you just forgot it. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4138.12s)]
*  I forgot it. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4139.52s)]
*  Like a fucking FF. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4140.34s)]
*  So you mean reality is a suggestion [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4142.400000000001s)]
*  like we're in a simulation? [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4143.400000000001s)]
*  We initially brought it up because it was during that era [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4145.240000000001s)]
*  where everyone was doing stuff like that, [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4147.8s)]
*  the fat phobia, cake stuff, so we were just going, [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4149.96s)]
*  we're living in this era where reality is a suggestion [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4152.68s)]
*  and we were making stuff up. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4155.4800000000005s)]
*  But also the way we cover history, [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4156.660000000001s)]
*  we don't do it right, we don't do it wrong. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4158.96s)]
*  We just are amateur historian enthusiasts. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4161.04s)]
*  We're basically chat GBT sluts that Google it [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4164.96s)]
*  and then have fun with it. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4167.52s)]
*  Because listen, history's a story. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4168.68s)]
*  We can get the facts kind of right, [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4169.92s)]
*  and we're concocting a story. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4172.14s)]
*  No historians were actually there, right? [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4172.9800000000005s)]
*  But we're just getting enough right. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4174.54s)]
*  We're having fun with it, and that's what we like to do. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4175.84s)]
*  Well, it's also, it's well within your rights [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4178.66s)]
*  to be talking about history. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4180.22s)]
*  History is all of ours. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4181.34s)]
*  The idea that history can only be discussed [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4182.9800000000005s)]
*  by a historian is fucking ridiculous. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4184.400000000001s)]
*  Nuts, yeah. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4185.9400000000005s)]
*  History's fascinating, and there's a lot of shit online. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4186.9800000000005s)]
*  You can instantaneously get the facts. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4189.86s)]
*  Just the facts alone are nuts. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4192.1s)]
*  We just did, on the last episode we did, [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4194.06s)]
*  it was called Operation Unthinkable. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4195.58s)]
*  Winston Churchill, do you know about Operation Unthinkable? [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4197.900000000001s)]
*  No. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4200.02s)]
*  We were just doing an episode on Winston Churchill, [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4200.86s)]
*  and then we start discovering this shit, [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4202.5s)]
*  and we said, dude, this is a Patreon episode. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4203.94s)]
*  Operation Unthinkable, Winston Churchill, [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4206.0199999999995s)]
*  the man who was protecting England, killing the Nazis, [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4207.78s)]
*  when the war was over, when Nazis were out, [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4213.0599999999995s)]
*  he said, I don't like the way the United States and Russia [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4216.78s)]
*  are getting so close together. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4220.299999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah, I do not like this. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4221.86s)]
*  So he said, you know what, [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4222.7s)]
*  someone's gonna have to knock the Russians out, [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4224.66s)]
*  and the British were like, [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4226.54s)]
*  we don't have the manpower right now. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4227.9s)]
*  So he literally went to Parliament and said to them, [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4229.54s)]
*  here's an idea, we're calling it Operation Unthinkable, [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4232.5s)]
*  we need to knock out Russia [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4235.54s)]
*  before they become the next superpower, [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4237.0199999999995s)]
*  and then they're gonna attack us. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4239.18s)]
*  You know how we have 40,000 German prisoners of war [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4240.78s)]
*  right now, Nazi prisoners of war? [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4244.98s)]
*  Let's give them guns, and we'll march them into Russia, [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4246.42s)]
*  and we'll be side to side with them. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4248.82s)]
*  And that was his literal, [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4250.34s)]
*  he wanted to team up with the Nazis [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4251.5s)]
*  to try to take over Russia, [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4253.14s)]
*  and that's, as we call it on the show, [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4254.26s)]
*  a truth baiter Ginsburg. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4255.94s)]
*  That's a fact, baby. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4257.0199999999995s)]
*  And that, when we uncovered that, we were like, [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4258.34s)]
*  so none of this history, as we're taught in school, [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4260.700000000001s)]
*  same thing we uncovered that they knew, [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4264.02s)]
*  allegedly, Churchill and FDR knew about the Holocaust, [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4265.780000000001s)]
*  but it was real, it was yielding scientific data, [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4268.820000000001s)]
*  so they let it kind of go. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4272.06s)]
*  They may believe they didn't know, but they let it go, [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4273.700000000001s)]
*  and then once they just started killing people [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4275.26s)]
*  with no science, they said, okay, let's liberate them now. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4277.860000000001s)]
*  What scientific data was it yielding? [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4280.46s)]
*  Supposedly because Nazi scientists [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4282.18s)]
*  were doing different types of experiments [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4285.22s)]
*  with Holocaust victims, [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4288.46s)]
*  and they were getting some type of scientific data [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4289.299999999999s)]
*  because they didn't care if they lived or died, [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4291.42s)]
*  so they would inject them with some type of chemical [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4293.34s)]
*  or some type of machinery. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4295.54s)]
*  Yeah, it's this book I read called The Nazi Symbiosis. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4297.78s)]
*  They talked all about it. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4299.86s)]
*  It was wild to read that on a plane [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4301.0199999999995s)]
*  with a big swastika on the front cover. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4302.38s)]
*  Geez. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4303.98s)]
*  That was wild. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4304.82s)]
*  That was great. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4305.66s)]
*  What you wanna do is read that book as Putty Yamakon. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4306.7s)]
*  Yes. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4309.0199999999995s)]
*  Don't you remember when you were a kid, Eddie, [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4309.86s)]
*  you make your own book cover with a fucking paper bag? [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4311.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I just walked onto JetBlue with a swastika. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4314.5s)]
*  That wasn't a good idea. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4316.74s)]
*  I put a female wig on and just say you're trans [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4318.42s)]
*  and they leave you alone. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4319.42s)]
*  That's it, and just say, hey, I'm cake shaming. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4320.26s)]
*  The problem is you look like Aryan. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4323.1s)]
*  I know. That's the issue. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4324.82s)]
*  That's the issue. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4325.66s)]
*  You can't be reading that. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4326.5s)]
*  I get a little triggered around him [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4327.34s)]
*  because the Nazis did occupy my home country, Greece, [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4328.38s)]
*  and I get a little triggered by his German presence. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4331.98s)]
*  He's a German kid from Ridgewood, [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4333.98s)]
*  and sometimes he root in history. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4335.34s)]
*  When he was growing up, he said just for fun, [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4337.66s)]
*  he likes to, he always kind of rooted. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4339.34s)]
*  Sometimes you root for that side. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4341.42s)]
*  Let me clarify. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4342.26s)]
*  I wasn't rooting for the Nazis. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4343.3s)]
*  What I was saying was, I was. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4344.38s)]
*  What I was saying was this. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4348.18s)]
*  Just hear me out. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4350.06s)]
*  One, I think it's an undeniable fact [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4351.06s)]
*  that they did have the best uniforms. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4352.820000000001s)]
*  They were cute. Designed by Hugo Boss. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4354.14s)]
*  They were cute marching in. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4355.62s)]
*  That's an undeniable fact. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4356.58s)]
*  Number two, just hear me out. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4357.66s)]
*  If you listen to a Hitler speech, [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4360.1s)]
*  AI generated, if they translated into English, [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4362.9800000000005s)]
*  and you just churned out Deutschland for America, [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4366.9800000000005s)]
*  and you're just listening, you don't know that's Hitler, [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4369.5s)]
*  what Hitler's saying is it just pumps you up. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4371.5s)]
*  It's horrible what he did. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4373.900000000001s)]
*  I've seen it. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4375.26s)]
*  There's English translations of it. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4376.42s)]
*  It's really weird. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4377.820000000001s)]
*  Like when he says, there's a speech where he says, [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4378.860000000001s)]
*  we're up against Germany. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4381.740000000001s)]
*  We are up against England right now. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4383.42s)]
*  We are two superpowers. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4385.54s)]
*  And the only way to prevail is one must be destroyed. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4386.900000000001s)]
*  And it will not be Germany. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4389.820000000001s)]
*  And the crowd goes nuts. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4391.22s)]
*  You start to say like, holy fucking shit. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4392.42s)]
*  This guy was a headliner. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4394.42s)]
*  You would have had that guy in the mothership [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4397.06s)]

*  And it's also weird when you see the horrors of the war [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4406.9800000000005s)]
*  escalate till eventually it becomes the Holocaust. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4410.14s)]
*  And it's also weird the ubiquitous drug use. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4414.740000000001s)]
*  Have you read that book? [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4417.580000000001s)]

*  Or is it in the other room now? [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4420.14s)]
*  I think everyone during the war is on something. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4421.34s)]
*  What, with the crystal meth, the Panzer chocolate? [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4423.46s)]

*  Don't you have an audiobook reader thing? [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4445.84s)]
*  No, I like to read at the words. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4447.9400000000005s)]
*  I can't really listen. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4449.34s)]
*  Yeah, I have a weird brain like that. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4450.9400000000005s)]

*  Yeah, I try to, I feel like I'm addicted to the phone. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4456.38s)]

*  Yeah, probably better. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4462.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4463.46s)]
*  But, you know, to each their own. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4464.66s)]
*  But if it wasn't for drugs, they would have never done. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4466.18s)]
*  No, no. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4468.34s)]
*  90% of the things they did and then they just [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4469.18s)]
*  descended into madness. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4471.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, and a lot of Germans, those five years [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4473.9400000000005s)]
*  from 1945 to 1950, that suicide rate of German soldiers [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4476.860000000001s)]
*  coming home was through the roof, Papi, [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4480.38s)]
*  because they were coming off meth. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4482.54s)]
*  They were getting ostracized by their own people [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4484.860000000001s)]
*  on the rest of Europe and they were saying, [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4487.2s)]
*  what did I do? [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4488.74s)]
*  Some of them actually were obviously, [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4489.74s)]
*  a lot of them were just horrific people [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4491.58s)]
*  that were sadistic, but a lot of these guys, [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4492.84s)]
*  also, it's not like they had a choice. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4495.360000000001s)]
*  They had to fight in the Nazi armor, they would be killed. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4497.08s)]
*  And then they were all drugged out, [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4499.52s)]
*  so then the suicide rate tripled. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4500.6s)]
*  Yeah, but let's not act like it was just the drugs. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4503.08s)]
*  I mean, the whole Jewish thing was nothing new. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4505.28s)]
*  I mean, I have a theory about that. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4507.4800000000005s)]
*  It's like the Jews just always figured out a way [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4508.8s)]
*  to flourish in wherever they were [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4511.2s)]
*  and they were just good at economics. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4513.6s)]
*  And I think when a country goes through economic hardships [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4516.1s)]
*  and everyone's suffering, they just look at the Jews [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4518.82s)]
*  and they go, they just get jealous. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4520.6s)]
*  And they go, what are they doing? [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4522.52s)]
*  And then it's an easy scapegoat. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4523.52s)]
*  Jews just crush it in money, dude. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4525.6s)]
*  They're just good with business. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4527.160000000001s)]
*  They're better at money. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4528.0s)]
*  They're just good. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4528.84s)]
*  I know, man. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4529.96s)]
*  They're just good with it. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4530.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4531.620000000001s)]
*  Did you have a Jewish guy that told you [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4532.46s)]
*  not to buy that house? [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4533.3s)]
*  Huh? [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4534.120000000001s)]
*  Yes, and I overrode the Jew for Chachapiti. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4534.96s)]
*  That's the problem. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4537.0s)]
*  That's the problem. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4538.0s)]
*  Unless my Chachapiti could be Jewish too, I don't know. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4538.84s)]
*  I've never asked at that. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4540.620000000001s)]
*  He's probably Chinese. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4541.46s)]
*  They're just smart. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4542.3s)]
*  They emphasize education and they're really good [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4543.120000000001s)]
*  and they've been able to flourish under adversity. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4546.84s)]
*  I think there's also, they stick to their own [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4550.2s)]
*  and that drives people wild. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4552.5199999999995s)]
*  Right. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4554.04s)]
*  They don't like that. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4554.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4555.7s)]
*  Right. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4556.54s)]
*  But every, I mean, Greeks do. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4557.38s)]
*  Greeks do the same thing. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4558.2s)]
*  Sure, a lot of groups. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4559.04s)]
*  A lot of ethnic groups. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4559.88s)]
*  Yeah, Greeks are pretty, you guys, [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4560.72s)]
*  getting to really know Jan as well, [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4562.24s)]
*  you guys have a lot of inbred qualities. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4563.36s)]
*  I mean, look at my eyes. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4565.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4566.2s)]
*  He was too, it was not, my generations were [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4567.04s)]
*  a little bit further apart than his. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4569.48s)]
*  He might've been third, fourth cousin. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4571.36s)]
*  I'm eighth, ninth. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4572.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4573.84s)]
*  It's not gonna hit. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4574.679999999999s)]
*  You go back to the Toba volcano eruption, [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4575.5199999999995s)]
*  the whole entire population of Earth [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4579.32s)]
*  was down to a few thousand people. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4581.719999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4583.48s)]
*  So we all come from those people. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4584.32s)]
*  So we're all little inbred. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4585.139999999999s)]
*  A little bit, right? [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4586.719999999999s)]
*  It's gotta be. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4587.5599999999995s)]
*  I actually have a lot of, I got some Turkish genetics in me. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4588.4s)]
*  I did 23 in me. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4593.0s)]
*  So they have my DNA so they can pin anything on me. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4593.96s)]
*  They got you. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4596.12s)]
*  They got me. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4596.96s)]
*  Well, that was raped into your great, great, great grandmother. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4597.78s)]
*  Probably. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4599.36s)]
*  Well, the story. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4600.2s)]
*  The Ottoman Empire. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4601.04s)]
*  This is a true story. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4601.86s)]
*  My grandfather is from the island [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4602.7s)]
*  that used to be called Imbros, [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4605.0599999999995s)]
*  which is now called something with a squiggly line over it [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4606.48s)]
*  because it's a Turkish word. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4610.04s)]
*  The Turks took that island back [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4610.88s)]
*  and my grandfather was sent away to Alexandria [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4612.36s)]
*  by my great grandparents [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4617.04s)]
*  because the local Ottoman viceroy [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4618.24s)]
*  or whatever they called it, they have a word for it, [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4621.96s)]
*  but he was essentially a viceroy, was like raping boys. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4623.62s)]
*  So they sent him away and he never saw his family again. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4627.04s)]
*  He went to live in Alexandria and then he came to America [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4629.24s)]
*  and yes, he opened a diner. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4631.48s)]
*  Right. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4633.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, after he worked his way. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4634.36s)]
*  What about that story you told me? [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4635.179999999999s)]
*  I think it was your mom or your mom's sister [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4636.16s)]
*  or you're in the town. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4637.96s)]
*  Oh, dude. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4639.88s)]
*  Tell him that story with the tank. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4640.72s)]
*  Yeah, Lex Friedman loved that episode. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4641.54s)]
*  He told me about that. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4644.08s)]
*  We did a Battle of Crete episode [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4645.36s)]
*  and it's true because my mother was a little child [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4646.68s)]
*  during the occupation of Crete. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4650.0s)]
*  The Battle of Crete is a wild. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4651.08s)]
*  His mother grew up in Nazi occupied Greece. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4652.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4654.44s)]
*  Wild. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4655.28s)]
*  And so what the Nazis would do [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4656.1s)]
*  is they would take a girl from the village [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4657.86s)]
*  because they were marching troops [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4660.56s)]
*  all over the place through the mountains. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4662.32s)]
*  The guerrillas, the Greek guerrilla fighters, [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4664.04s)]
*  which was the local populations, [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4666.24s)]
*  they were also with the British and New Zealand [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4668.4s)]
*  and Australian troops, but they would pluck them off [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4670.16s)]
*  because they knew the terrain [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4672.36s)]
*  and they would just, they would pluck them off. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4673.28s)]
*  Guerrilla warfare. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4674.86s)]
*  So the Nazis were so brutal but smart in a devious way, [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4675.96s)]
*  they would take a girl from the village [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4679.219999999999s)]
*  and put her up high on the truck [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4681.44s)]
*  to march through that area of that village [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4683.259999999999s)]
*  so the guerrillas wouldn't shoot. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4687.12s)]
*  So they were gonna take my aunt, my mom's mother. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4689.16s)]
*  So they sent my aunt to go hide in the mountains [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4692.32s)]
*  and the Nazis came to my mother's parents' house, [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4696.08s)]
*  to her house, and my mother was like seven at the time [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4699.5199999999995s)]
*  and they came with their flashlights, [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4702.0s)]
*  they pulled the sheets back of my mother [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4703.28s)]
*  and supposedly she was too small. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4706.0s)]
*  So they kind of knew they wanted a girl [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4708.68s)]
*  who was like teenager, kind of tall, [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4710.6s)]
*  so it wasn't too brutal because it was like a little kid, [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4713.34s)]
*  but it was like enough that it would ward off [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4716.5599999999995s)]
*  the guerrillas from firing at them. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4718.48s)]
*  But what is the guerrillas? [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4720.0s)]
*  Because if they missed or if they got, [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4720.82s)]
*  Nazi got shot, then they would kill the girl on the truck. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4723.26s)]
*  Yeah, they're basically going, it's basically a hostage, [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4725.08s)]
*  going like we're taking a village girl, [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4727.04s)]
*  putting her up and making her visible [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4728.8s)]
*  because they don't know the terrain. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4730.76s)]
*  Crete is very mountainous, you know? [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4732.72s)]
*  And so then they would do that [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4734.96s)]
*  and they were gonna take my aunt. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4736.62s)]
*  So a family friend who worked for the Nazis [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4738.12s)]
*  because he spoke German warned my family about it [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4741.88s)]
*  and then that's when they sent my aunt [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4746.1s)]
*  to go hide in the mountains. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4748.4800000000005s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4749.8s)]
*  Wild stuff. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4750.62s)]
*  Right. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4751.46s)]
*  And then my parent, my mother said [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4752.3s)]
*  that there was a Nazi soldier who would come to their house [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4753.4s)]
*  every single day, they had to let him in [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4755.36s)]
*  and he would go to a room every day [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4758.04s)]
*  and they didn't know what he did in there. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4760.44s)]
*  It's a family mystery, nobody knows what he did, [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4762.32s)]
*  they let him in, he'd go to a room by himself [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4763.92s)]
*  and nobody knows what he did. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4766.08s)]
*  Maybe he took a nap, maybe he was a spy, [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4766.92s)]
*  maybe he was a double agent. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4768.5599999999995s)]
*  He just had to let him in. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4770.44s)]
*  Had to let him in. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4771.679999999999s)]
*  He's crazy. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4772.5199999999995s)]
*  Occupation for three years. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4773.339999999999s)]
*  That is what's really scary about people, [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4774.719999999999s)]
*  that they could justify that kind of thinking and behavior. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4777.36s)]
*  It's scary that that's happened throughout history [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4780.5s)]
*  and that's probably a civilized version [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4783.64s)]
*  of what would have happened in 1200. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4784.92s)]
*  Oh yes. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4787.2s)]
*  Well like Man's Search for Meaning with Viktor Frankl, [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4788.04s)]
*  you ever read that? [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4790.12s)]
*  No, I haven't. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4791.2s)]
*  Viktor Frankl, he survived the Holocaust [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4792.04s)]
*  but he wrote it during, while he was in a concentration camp [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4793.4s)]
*  and he was saying, I think it was, call it 1942, [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4796.88s)]
*  he was saying if you would have told me [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4799.64s)]
*  and the people here in 1922 [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4801.6s)]
*  that this would be happening to us, [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4804.48s)]
*  we would say no, no, no, those are the barbarians [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4805.76s)]
*  from 100 years ago that would ever do that [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4808.08s)]
*  and now here I am, sleeping in my own filth, [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4810.08s)]
*  maybe being put into an oven so it can happen anywhere [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4813.08s)]
*  and he said that the peace, he wrote it, [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4815.96s)]
*  it was like in the 60s or 70s, he was like, [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4819.2s)]
*  he grew up in wartime so all his people want peace [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4822.6s)]
*  and he was like, it's the kids that he worries about [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4825.48s)]
*  that grow up during peace, they're just gonna beg for war. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4827.64s)]
*  Always. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4830.0s)]
*  He was like, that's just what will happen to them [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4830.84s)]
*  because they don't know anything other. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4832.72s)]
*  He was like, but if you went through war, [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4833.98s)]
*  you don't want this, you don't wanna fight anybody. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4835.6s)]
*  I bet it's very abstract for the people [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4837.6s)]
*  that are calling for war, it's like Lindsey Graham [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4839.4s)]
*  talking about, we gotta give that money to Ukraine. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4841.5199999999995s)]
*  Like Lindsey Graham doesn't know jack shit [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4844.92s)]
*  about being shot at. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4846.5199999999995s)]
*  No, no. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4848.04s)]
*  That's a story as old as time, right? [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4849.12s)]
*  The politicians sending the boys. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4851.24s)]
*  As old as time. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4852.96s)]
*  Yeah, and we do it, it seems, mostly for corporate interest. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4853.799999999999s)]
*  No, you don't think we're more of a corporate oligarchy, [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4856.5s)]
*  like more than like a feudal, [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4860.92s)]
*  like you were mentioning before, [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4864.24s)]
*  the emperor, the king dies, the sons, [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4865.759999999999s)]
*  we're kind of more, this is like a new kind of corporate [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4868.24s)]
*  oligarchy. It's hard to just call it corporate [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4871.639999999999s)]
*  because it's also connected to government. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4874.2s)]
*  Like corporate and government, just like the Chinese, [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4875.92s)]
*  are inseparable now. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4878.36s)]
*  The amount of influence that enormous corporations have [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4881.36s)]
*  over politicians is crazy. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4884.38s)]
*  Yeah, oh yeah. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4886.04s)]
*  You know, I mean, just look at these wacky bills, [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4886.88s)]
*  like the bill that just shot down, [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4889.679999999999s)]
*  that people are justifying. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4891.24s)]
*  Like did you look at that bill, [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4893.0s)]
*  all the different stuff that was in the bill? [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4894.96s)]
*  First of all, there's biolabs in that bill, [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4896.24s)]
*  gain of function research in that bill, [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4900.0s)]
*  40% increase in raise for Congress in that bill, [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4902.48s)]
*  some enormous amount of money to build a stadium [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4906.84s)]
*  in Washington, DC. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4910.08s)]
*  There's a lot of nutty shit in that bill, [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4912.0s)]
*  and like how many different people [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4914.48s)]
*  were interested in those things? [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4915.719999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4917.2s)]
*  When you're saying biolabs, [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4918.04s)]
*  who the fuck is asking for biolabs? [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4919.84s)]
*  Some corporation that's gonna benefit from the biolabs. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4921.76s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4924.28s)]
*  What the fuck are lobby groups? [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4925.1s)]
*  Why do we have lobby groups? [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4926.22s)]
*  What is that? [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4927.18s)]
*  Well, that's the most expensive real estate in the country, [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4928.02s)]
*  is the Virginia real estate outside of DC, [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4930.820000000001s)]
*  where the lobbyists live. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4934.06s)]
*  Yeah, K Street too. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4934.900000000001s)]
*  It's like that in Atherton, [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4936.06s)]
*  where all the tech dorks live. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4938.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, what is that in our system, lobby groups? [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4940.58s)]
*  Like that should not be a thing. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4943.9400000000005s)]
*  It's weird. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4946.14s)]
*  It's the influence of money [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4947.3s)]
*  that has gotten ahold of politics in this country, [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4948.9800000000005s)]
*  it's to try to root that out. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4951.9400000000005s)]
*  So then what's the best form of government then? [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4954.22s)]
*  This. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4956.02s)]
*  This is better than anywhere else in the world by far. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4956.860000000001s)]
*  We have the most freedom [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4959.46s)]
*  because we have the First Amendment, [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4960.46s)]
*  because we have the ability to do whatever you wanna do. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4962.02s)]
*  No one's forcing you into a marriage, [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4965.42s)]
*  no one's forcing you into labor. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4967.34s)]
*  You can choose your path in this country, [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4969.02s)]
*  and that's what's rare. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4971.280000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4972.46s)]
*  It's an experiment in self-government. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4973.3s)]
*  It's not perfect. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4974.860000000001s)]
*  It's the best that's available. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4975.76s)]
*  It needs to be overhauled, [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4977.14s)]
*  but it's pretty fucking awesome. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4978.62s)]
*  Yeah. Right. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4980.06s)]
*  And it's amendable, right? [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4980.900000000001s)]
*  It's fluid, which is important [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4983.26s)]
*  because of human nature is not perfect. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4984.780000000001s)]
*  That's why I never sign on to any like ideologies, [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4986.66s)]
*  utopian theories, [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4990.06s)]
*  because it's a mix of systems that works [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4991.58s)]
*  because human nature is so complicated [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4993.92s)]
*  and individuals are so different [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4996.02s)]
*  that one company will be run by a moral good guy, [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=4997.9400000000005s)]
*  another company will be dumping toxic waste [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5001.06s)]
*  into the Hudson River. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5003.14s)]
*  And it's like, you have to regulate, [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5004.02s)]
*  government has to step in sometimes a little bit [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5005.9800000000005s)]
*  to protect the people from nefarious things like that. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5008.9800000000005s)]
*  Especially when corporations have a obligation [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5013.54s)]
*  to make more money every year. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5017.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5018.98s)]
*  They have an obligation, they're shareholders. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5019.82s)]
*  They don't, they're out. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5021.0199999999995s)]
*  This guy likes yachts. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5022.179999999999s)]
*  I like yachts, I wanna keep my yacht. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5023.0599999999995s)]
*  Have fun. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5024.5s)]
*  You gotta keep making that loot. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5025.32s)]
*  How do you make that loot? [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5027.5s)]
*  You gotta fucking get rid of that shit cheaper. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5028.5s)]
*  There's a river, the guy said it's cool, [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5030.94s)]
*  dump it in the river. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5032.94s)]
*  That's it. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5033.78s)]
*  And now you can't say, whoops, we didn't do that. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5034.62s)]
*  Yeah, now you can't repair iPhones, [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5035.9s)]
*  they make you buy a new iPhone every year. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5037.78s)]
*  Clothes last like one wash. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5039.74s)]
*  Change the charging port. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5042.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5043.46s)]
*  Isn't it better if I sell you a new one, [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5044.3s)]
*  then fix it? [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5045.38s)]
*  Fuck off with this. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5046.22s)]
*  Right, and where do they put all that waste? [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5047.06s)]
*  Where does it all go? [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5049.1s)]
*  Landfills. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5049.9800000000005s)]
*  Right. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5051.18s)]
*  Yeah, that's not a sustainable system. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5052.02s)]
*  Singapore has an amazing system. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5053.42s)]
*  You ever seen Singapore's recycling system? [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5055.38s)]
*  No. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5057.34s)]
*  It's fantastic, it's really wild. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5058.18s)]
*  I mean, if they could implement that worldwide, [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5059.820000000001s)]
*  it would be pretty phenomenal. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5061.58s)]
*  What do they do? [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5062.62s)]
*  They recycle everything. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5063.46s)]
*  Like we don't really recycle plastic. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5065.02s)]
*  We say we're recycling. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5067.320000000001s)]
*  I'll throw it in the blue bin, I feel better about myself. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5068.7s)]
*  No, that's not doing a goddamn thing. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5072.259999999999s)]
*  That blue bin is gonna go in the ground. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5074.099999999999s)]
*  The only thing they really recycle is aluminum [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5076.62s)]
*  and some metals because it's cost effective. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5079.139999999999s)]
*  It's too expensive to recycle plastic, [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5081.98s)]
*  so they just put it in fucking landfills. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5083.74s)]
*  You think you're being a good guy [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5086.62s)]
*  by throwing it into that fucking recyclable bin, [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5087.86s)]
*  it's not getting anywhere but in the ground. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5090.54s)]
*  Not Singapore. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5092.82s)]
*  Singapore, see if you could find, [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5093.7s)]
*  I know we've done this before, [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5095.74s)]
*  there's a detailed description [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5097.82s)]
*  of how they do it in Singapore. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5101.139999999999s)]
*  They use it to make the surface of their roads. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5102.98s)]
*  They take fucking everything. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5106.12s)]
*  Everything, they have these waste incineration plants, [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5108.219999999999s)]
*  they burn things off 24 hours a day, seven days a week, [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5112.28s)]
*  and then they take whatever is usable [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5115.38s)]
*  that they can change and recycle, [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5118.799999999999s)]
*  they make new things out of it. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5121.62s)]
*  They turn it into raw fuels. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5122.719999999999s)]
*  Dude, it is so advanced over there. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5124.299999999999s)]
*  You look at that city and you go like, [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5126.14s)]
*  they started the cities in America [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5128.3s)]
*  and then they just shipped them over to the east. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5130.46s)]
*  Look at this, they're using this to make bricks. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5132.660000000001s)]
*  They're taking this stuff and they use it [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5135.14s)]
*  to pave their streets. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5137.62s)]
*  This is all made out of this stuff [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5138.9400000000005s)]
*  that they've gotten from recycling. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5141.280000000001s)]
*  So why don't we do that? [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5144.1s)]
*  We can't do it. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5144.9400000000005s)]
*  Well, they're isolated, right? [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5145.76s)]
*  So they had a problem, much like Puerto Rico has a problem [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5147.54s)]
*  in that you don't have a lot of land mass. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5151.54s)]
*  That's the setup that Tony needed. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5154.02s)]
*  Well, Tony, actually, that's where the joke came from. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5157.06s)]
*  I know, I know, and he just needed, [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5158.34s)]
*  if he just saved it. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5159.860000000001s)]
*  He needed to not do it at a fucking political rally. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5160.700000000001s)]
*  But if you're gonna do it, just set it up. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5163.5s)]
*  Or even when it didn't work at the end, go, [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5166.06s)]
*  hey, you guys don't know about the garbage issue. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5168.02s)]
*  No, you can't do it. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5169.900000000001s)]
*  Or you don't know about the garbage issue. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5170.740000000001s)]
*  Something like that, yeah. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5172.860000000001s)]
*  You tell me if Tony Hinchcliffe didn't live in the 1400s, [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5174.820000000001s)]
*  he would be like a very evil prince, [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5177.42s)]
*  like living in a castle. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5179.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah, or a jester. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5180.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. 100%. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5182.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5183.46s)]
*  He would take people for Rome. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5184.46s)]
*  I think they were forced to do that. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5187.26s)]
*  I think it was a situation where they've gotta do something [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5189.26s)]
*  because I don't think they had the same access [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5192.78s)]
*  to new materials, and they just came up [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5195.14s)]
*  with a much more comprehensive way to. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5198.26s)]
*  Better way. Right. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5199.74s)]
*  Way better. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5200.900000000001s)]
*  If we did it that way, we'd have so few problems [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5201.74s)]
*  with regards to waste. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5205.46s)]
*  Demystifying Singapore's waste management system. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5207.34s)]

*  they say the milk's better, [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5269.18s)]

*  and they say that they clean them out [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5273.38s)]

*  Go old school. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5276.34s)]

*  Yummy. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5282.259999999999s)]

*  Is this their garbage pile? [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5283.92s)]
*  It's one of their landfills. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5284.86s)]

*  Yeah, I think that's part of the problem. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5288.139999999999s)]
*  So they were forced to figure out [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5289.62s)]
*  what to do with all the stuff. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5291.7s)]

*  is way better than ours. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5295.42s)]
*  They're just much better at sorting things out [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5297.42s)]
*  and making it work. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5299.5s)]

*  Or are they taking them from Singapore [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5307.06s)]

*  That's so much money. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5464.56s)]
*  You could literally spend $100 million a year [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5465.8s)]
*  for the rest of your life. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5468.84s)]

*  if you make it on crypto? [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5546.16s)]
*  No, but he stole like billions of dollars. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5547.0s)]
*  That's exactly what it's for. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5548.56s)]
*  If you make billions of dollars on crypto [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5550.4800000000005s)]

*  That's how you get caught though. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5554.8s)]
*  Of course. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5555.84s)]
*  Somebody sent me an email the other day [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5556.68s)]

*  and jerking off and all that. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5565.04s)]
*  And they said the only way that they can make it go away [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5566.12s)]
*  is if I, and they gave me a link and they said, [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5568.6s)]
*  I have to pay them in Bitcoin. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5570.360000000001s)]

*  I just want you to see how wild this is. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5585.8s)]
*  The government does not publish how many people [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5587.18s)]
*  are on death row in Vietnam. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5589.34s)]
*  Human rights groups say there's thousands. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5591.860000000001s)]
*  It's a state secret. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5593.34s)]
*  Speaking of crypto, what's going on [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5594.62s)]
*  with that Hawk Tuo chick? [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5596.1s)]
*  Is she going to jail? [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5597.58s)]
*  What happened now? [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5598.42s)]
*  What happened to Hawk Tuo? [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5599.26s)]
*  That's my girl. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5600.1s)]
*  No one's heard from her. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5600.9400000000005s)]
*  What did she do? [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5601.76s)]
*  She's been missing for over 300 hours, I think. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5602.6s)]
*  What does that mean? [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5603.76s)]
*  She went to sleep and she hasn't woken up. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5604.62s)]
*  What did she do? [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5606.18s)]
*  She just hasn't been on social media, you mean? [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5607.02s)]
*  It's not like she's hiding. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5608.74s)]
*  A coin was launched with her meme [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5609.9800000000005s)]
*  and she was like the front of it. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5612.14s)]
*  I don't know all the details. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5613.5s)]
*  Is that a crime? [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5614.5s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5615.5s)]
*  The pump and dump might be the crime. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5616.34s)]
*  The thing was there was an enormous amount of money [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5618.139999999999s)]
*  that was put into this meme coin by all these people [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5620.98s)]
*  and then she or someone representing her side of it sold [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5623.179999999999s)]
*  like instantaneously and made a huge score [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5628.34s)]
*  and then the coin was worth nothing. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5631.26s)]
*  So all those people that invested money, [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5634.74s)]
*  like one guy invested a million dollars. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5636.66s)]
*  Like imagine, you're like, oh, the Hawk Tuo girl? [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5638.98s)]
*  Yeah, that's a sound investment. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5641.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5642.5s)]
*  That seems like a good place to put my nest egg. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5643.34s)]
*  Some people for sure lost money [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5644.9s)]
*  but it was definitely a time to just troll and be like, [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5646.2s)]
*  oh, I'm such an idiot. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5648.72s)]
*  I lost $10 million on this [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5649.8s)]
*  because people were trolling the whole movement [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5651.32s)]
*  of being dumb and following Hawk Tuo [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5653.5599999999995s)]
*  but some people did lose money. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5656.16s)]
*  Is she actually gonna go to jail for real? [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5657.679999999999s)]
*  Can the SEC invest crypto like that? [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5659.48s)]
*  I guess they can now, right? [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5662.639999999999s)]
*  What she knew and what she did. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5664.24s)]
*  Well, it's like, what are the rules? [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5665.44s)]
*  What are the rules in terms of like, [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5666.88s)]
*  are you allowed to do that? [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5668.28s)]
*  Like is that unethical but legal? [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5669.48s)]
*  Like are you allowed to have a meme coin [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5672.12s)]
*  and it gets to like $100 million? [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5674.36s)]
*  Like imagine you have a bunch of it [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5676.400000000001s)]
*  and you just sell it all and you make 50 million bucks. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5677.24s)]
*  Are you allowed to do that? [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5678.76s)]
*  If you're not allowed to do that, [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5680.2s)]
*  what's the point in having 50 million bucks? [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5681.24s)]
*  Right. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5683.24s)]
*  Do you not have trust in the Hawk Tuo coin if I sell it? [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5684.08s)]
*  That's ridiculous, that's on you. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5687.4400000000005s)]
*  That's on me. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5688.68s)]
*  I mean, you have trust in it. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5689.52s)]
*  I even did the smart thing when I got out [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5690.360000000001s)]
*  when I thought it was a good price [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5692.04s)]
*  and I'm selling it to people. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5693.6s)]
*  They should take that and run with it [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5694.92s)]
*  and this will be the next currency of the world. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5696.52s)]
*  I invest in Hawk Tuo. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5698.16s)]

*  I don't get it. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5937.42s)]

*  Yeah, it's one for the SEC. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5942.38s)]
*  What about like when Tom Brady and Larry David [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5943.22s)]
*  got in trouble for the FTX thing [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5944.4800000000005s)]
*  and they were just promoting doing a commercial. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5946.08s)]
*  How were they in trouble for promoting a coin? [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5947.92s)]
*  Well, it remains to be seen whether or not to be charged [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5950.08s)]
*  or whether it would be found guilty. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5953.08s)]
*  But how could they even be remotely? [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5954.92s)]
*  Because someone lost a bunch of money [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5956.4800000000005s)]
*  and they said, Larry David, I trusted you. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5957.96s)]
*  Right. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5960.360000000001s)]
*  You were promoting this thing that I think is, [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5961.2s)]
*  that's the reason why I've never promoted any of those. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5963.240000000001s)]
*  Because. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5964.96s)]
*  I've had offers to promote things like that. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5965.8s)]
*  For real money. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5966.96s)]
*  I'm not interested. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5967.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5968.620000000001s)]
*  I'm like, uh-uh, I don't even understand it. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5969.46s)]
*  If I don't understand it, like you're selling what? [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5970.3s)]
*  You're selling NFTs? [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5972.400000000001s)]
*  What does that mean? [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5973.360000000001s)]
*  It's an unfungible token. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5974.200000000001s)]
*  We're done. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5975.52s)]
*  I don't know what you're saying. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5976.360000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5977.200000000001s)]
*  I'm not doing this. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5978.02s)]
*  Right. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5978.860000000001s)]
*  It's like too many fucking bros [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5979.700000000001s)]
*  that are out there doing this that, you know, [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5980.8s)]
*  the Lambo drivers. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5982.68s)]
*  Right. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5983.6s)]
*  It's like a fuckery culture. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5984.4400000000005s)]
*  So do you understand crypto fully [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5986.280000000001s)]
*  or is it still one of those things like. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5988.34s)]
*  I understand it. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5989.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I understand it. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5990.96s)]
*  It's weird that anybody would invest [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5992.64s)]
*  actual real money in it. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5994.16s)]
*  I understand Bitcoin more than all the other ones. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5995.64s)]
*  But even Bitcoin is mysterious. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5997.84s)]
*  There's a lot of weird, [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=5999.92s)]
*  I mean they don't even know who made it. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6001.0s)]
*  There's all these, [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6002.4s)]
*  there's a whole documentary on Satoshi Nakamoto [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6003.44s)]
*  who's real, the identity is. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6005.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6008.0s)]
*  It's all controversial. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6008.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6009.66s)]
*  That's weird. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6010.5s)]
*  You know, the fact that there's a certain [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6011.34s)]
*  stable amount of them though, that's encouraging. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6012.56s)]
*  You know, that you can't make more of them. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6015.24s)]
*  Okay. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6017.44s)]
*  But that's exactly what artists do [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6018.28s)]
*  to give their art value. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6019.2s)]
*  That's how you do it. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6020.84s)]
*  You get the supply and then, [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6022.320000000001s)]
*  oh these are only 10 original paintings [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6023.16s)]
*  and this is what I'm charging [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6025.04s)]
*  because there's only 10 prints of these. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6026.6s)]
*  And so you create the value by the scarcity. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6028.200000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6031.88s)]
*  So there's nothing mysterious about that. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6032.72s)]
*  Sort of, but it also limits the ability [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6033.54s)]
*  to add coins to it anytime you want and devalue it. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6036.52s)]
*  Right. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6040.280000000001s)]
*  Right, so that's what's more important [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6041.12s)]
*  than like making it scarce so people like it more. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6043.280000000001s)]
*  It's, it is weird that we, [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6047.08s)]
*  we used to be on a gold standard [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6050.6s)]
*  and then now we're just on hard drives [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6052.160000000001s)]
*  and we just sort of accept it. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6054.88s)]
*  And then the government, like when they wanna send money [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6056.400000000001s)]
*  to Ukraine, forget about the fact [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6058.56s)]
*  that we're trillions of dollars in debt. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6060.64s)]
*  They could just come up with $179 billion [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6062.52s)]
*  and ship it over to some country. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6066.200000000001s)]
*  Yay, go have a good time. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6067.72s)]
*  Right. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6069.04s)]
*  And you know, there's wild reports [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6069.88s)]
*  about the amount of corruption [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6071.620000000001s)]
*  that this money is experiencing. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6073.240000000001s)]
*  I mean, this money has probably gone [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6075.84s)]
*  through more people's noses [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6077.6s)]
*  and you know, and come out of more people's dicks. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6079.36s)]
*  Like how much, where does this money go? [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6081.96s)]
*  And it's so much, there's no way it's 100% efficient. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6084.5199999999995s)]
*  Uh-uh. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6087.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6088.48s)]
*  You have Bitcoin, Yannis? [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6089.32s)]
*  Not that part of the world. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6090.139999999999s)]
*  No, I don't understand it so much like Joe, [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6090.98s)]
*  I just don't. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6091.82s)]
*  Stay away. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6092.66s)]
*  Yeah, just stay away. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6093.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6094.32s)]
*  It's like when someone explains curling to me, [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6095.16s)]
*  you know the sport curling? [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6096.139999999999s)]
*  Sure. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6097.12s)]
*  I'm like, I don't, even when I get the rules, [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6097.96s)]
*  I'm like, I still don't understand what's going on. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6099.099999999999s)]
*  You know, I was in Newfoundland [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6100.5199999999995s)]
*  and I did a show up there once [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6102.0s)]
*  and the place that I was at was like a play, [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6103.48s)]
*  it was like a theater. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6106.599999999999s)]
*  And in this theater, apparently they have like [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6108.28s)]
*  curling shows and so like when you're walking [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6109.96s)]
*  down the hallway in the back, before you go on stage, [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6112.719999999999s)]
*  there's all these fucking photos of people curling. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6115.679999999999s)]
*  And I just went out there and started shitting on curling [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6118.5199999999995s)]
*  like right away and they were so bummed out. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6120.719999999999s)]
*  They were so bummed out that I. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6123.08s)]
*  It's like, it looks like the Housekeeper Olympics [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6126.12s)]
*  or something. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6128.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, they're just sweeping the ice. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6128.84s)]
*  Dumb. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6130.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6131.0s)]
*  It's such a dumb, dumb sport. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6131.84s)]
*  It's like bowling for retards. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6133.8s)]
*  Right. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6135.84s)]
*  Regular bowling is too complicated. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6136.68s)]
*  Right. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6138.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6139.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6139.96s)]
*  But they're good, I mean, there's people [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6141.16s)]
*  that are good at it. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6142.4400000000005s)]
*  Well. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6143.360000000001s)]
*  I don't know how they're good at it, but. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6144.200000000001s)]
*  I kind of get it, because it's kind of like billiards, [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6145.240000000001s)]
*  right, or pool. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6149.66s)]
*  You're rolling this thing, you're trying to like [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6151.12s)]
*  just roll it just enough. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6153.56s)]
*  Just this feel, you get this feel to it, [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6156.5s)]
*  you're just like, let it go now. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6158.76s)]
*  Right. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6160.88s)]
*  Let it slide, sweep it, sweep it, sweep it. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6161.72s)]
*  Get rid of the friction, sweep it in front of it. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6163.52s)]
*  So that's what they're doing, they get rid of the friction. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6165.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's what it's sweeping, [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6167.28s)]
*  they're trying to get rid of the friction. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6168.12s)]
*  Right. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6168.96s)]
*  They don't need dust. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6169.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6170.639999999999s)]
*  They don't need snow dust. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6171.48s)]
*  Right, it's stupid. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6172.32s)]
*  From their skates, it's so stupid. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6173.16s)]
*  It's stupid, yeah, it's so stupid. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6174.2s)]
*  But if you grow up and there's nothing to do [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6175.879999999999s)]
*  and you suck at hockey. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6177.96s)]
*  Just curl. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6180.24s)]
*  You play that. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6181.08s)]
*  I guess it's the golfing of ice sports. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6181.919999999999s)]
*  I guess. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6184.44s)]
*  Right. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6185.28s)]
*  Golfing's way more complex. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6186.12s)]
*  Yeah, but I just mean like you don't need [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6187.679999999999s)]
*  any real athletic talent to do it. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6189.0s)]
*  Like how do you retire from golfing? [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6190.759999999999s)]
*  You don't think you need athletic talent [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6192.0s)]
*  from golfing, for golfing? [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6193.719999999999s)]
*  Not really. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6195.58s)]
*  You definitely do. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6196.54s)]
*  For the drive. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6197.38s)]
*  You see these guys' bodies? [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6198.22s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, but the coordination of your body [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6199.5s)]
*  to drive a golf ball. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6202.22s)]
*  Jamie's a nut. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6203.78s)]
*  Jamie, tell them how much it is. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6205.1s)]
*  I know, but I was about to say, [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6207.0199999999995s)]
*  there's guys that are paralyzed that can still golf. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6208.26s)]
*  Yeah, I mean it's really like. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6211.0199999999995s)]
*  How do you golf with your mind? [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6212.42s)]
*  What do you say? [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6214.06s)]
*  No, I mean they can literally just swing an arm. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6214.9s)]
*  They're strapped into a contraption, [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6216.5s)]
*  it sets them upright and points them around. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6218.34s)]
*  I've seen blind people golf. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6220.14s)]
*  I mean Nate Bargatzi golfs, he's good. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6221.46s)]
*  Look at his body. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6223.22s)]
*  He's got tits. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6224.06s)]
*  I know what's your point. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6226.38s)]
*  To hit it 400 yards, that's 100% athletic [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6227.22s)]
*  and you can't just accidentally do that. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6228.66s)]
*  Yeah, I mean even John Daly. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6230.02s)]
*  You can say John Daly's fat and all that stuff, [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6231.46s)]
*  but John Daly, when you watch him move, [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6233.78s)]
*  the efficiency of his movements. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6235.78s)]
*  You know, like we were talking about Mark Hunt. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6238.5s)]
*  Mark Hunt's a big guy, but still fuck people up, right? [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6240.06s)]
*  He's still an athlete. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6242.86s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6243.9s)]
*  Like a lot of these fat golfers, [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6244.72s)]
*  there's a thing they know how to do. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6246.54s)]
*  They whack that ball and they know exactly how to fuck [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6248.7s)]
*  and put a little spin on that motherfucker, [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6251.86s)]
*  a little wist action on that. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6253.66s)]
*  The difference between pro and being able to play the game [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6254.98s)]
*  is like being a banker and playing a mop. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6257.0599999999995s)]
*  Like you ever seen Bartolo Colon, the pitcher for the Mets? [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6259.86s)]
*  No. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6262.46s)]
*  I thought that was a cologne you were doing. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6263.3s)]
*  This guy's body's the best. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6265.139999999999s)]
*  Look at Bartolo Colon. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6266.3s)]
*  If you pull up Bartolo, B-A-R-T-O-L-O, [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6267.82s)]
*  I mean look at this guy. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6270.42s)]
*  And he just threw heat in the majors. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6271.259999999999s)]
*  And he would just, you know? [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6273.46s)]
*  And he was fun about it. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6276.0599999999995s)]
*  He was fun about being fat. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6277.0599999999995s)]
*  He would sit in the locker room with no shirt on, [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6278.139999999999s)]
*  eating cheeseburgers. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6279.86s)]
*  Nobody gave a shit. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6281.0s)]
*  Look at that one with the helmet flying off his head. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6281.84s)]
*  As long as you're good at that sport. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6285.74s)]
*  He was good. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6287.86s)]
*  And that sport is a sport that doesn't require endurance. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6288.7s)]
*  That's what's important. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6291.34s)]
*  You don't have to do anything for a prolonged period of time. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6292.54s)]
*  The furthest thing you have to do is run to a base. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6294.82s)]
*  And if you gotta run to all of them, that's crazy. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6297.66s)]
*  What did you do? [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6299.86s)]
*  Generally, if you run into all of them, [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6300.82s)]
*  you can kinda trot because you knocked it out of the park. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6302.259999999999s)]
*  What do you think the sport that requires [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6305.0599999999995s)]
*  the most endurance, obviously not thinking about [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6306.54s)]
*  long distance running, because that's obvious, [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6309.86s)]
*  but you know what I think it is? [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6311.5s)]
*  I think hockey. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6314.34s)]
*  Well, soccer too. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6315.78s)]
*  Yeah, but the hockey, you notice how those guys [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6317.02s)]
*  can only be on the ice for like... [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6318.52s)]
*  Two minutes shifts. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6320.78s)]
*  Two minutes, and it gets so hard to skate like that. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6321.62s)]
*  Can't do it. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6324.34s)]
*  Yeah, they just can't. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6325.18s)]
*  Good point. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6326.02s)]
*  Good point. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6326.860000000001s)]
*  Soccer players stay on the field the whole game. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6327.68s)]
*  Yeah, because they get to rest and slow down. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6328.52s)]
*  Even the best, Gretzky, they can't, two minutes. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6329.9800000000005s)]
*  Two minutes tops. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6332.34s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6333.18s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6334.0s)]
*  They have four lines, I think. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6334.84s)]
*  So when they go two minutes, how much they take off [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6336.18s)]
*  before they go back on the ice? [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6338.5s)]
*  I think it's like another minute or two. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6339.34s)]
*  But it's multiple lines, like, you know? [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6340.7s)]
*  They just constantly go on and off enough [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6342.74s)]
*  because they just can't, [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6344.5s)]
*  because they have to continuously skate. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6345.54s)]
*  Can you imagine what a hockey game would look like [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6347.0199999999995s)]
*  if they'd never let them use the bench? [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6348.46s)]
*  Oh, that would be hilarious. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6349.54s)]
*  Oh my God, that would be insane. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6350.38s)]
*  People would drop dead. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6351.5s)]
*  Yeah, they would just drop dead. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6352.34s)]
*  That would be wild. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6353.179999999999s)]
*  I've ever seen hockey live, and NHL, that to me, [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6355.3s)]
*  besides MMA, I saw an MMA fight once, that was amazing, [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6358.34s)]
*  and then second is NHL. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6361.66s)]
*  It's very fast. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6363.179999999999s)]
*  NHL, those guys on skates, [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6364.0199999999995s)]
*  whether you know the rules or not, it's amazing. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6365.66s)]
*  It's a very, very fast game. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6367.7s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6369.54s)]
*  And the skill to be able to skate, [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6370.78s)]
*  I can barely skate at all. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6373.58s)]
*  I'm barely standing up. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6374.42s)]
*  These motherfuckers are like, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6375.26s)]
*  And it's the only sport where you're allowed [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6377.58s)]
*  a fist fight in, 100%. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6379.38s)]
*  Written into the rules. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6381.54s)]
*  It's encouraged. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6382.78s)]
*  You're allowed to duke it out, which is so crazy. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6383.62s)]
*  That's the only one. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6385.94s)]
*  Yeah, because I think people don't really know [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6387.0599999999995s)]
*  where the puck is, and so everyone's just waiting around [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6389.3s)]
*  for a fight. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6392.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6392.98s)]
*  You have no idea. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6393.82s)]
*  Because it's grandfathered in, the punching each other. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6394.66s)]
*  Has anyone ever seen a goal when it actually happened [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6397.46s)]
*  in real time? [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6400.22s)]
*  It happens too fast. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6401.0599999999995s)]
*  They had the siren on top of the goal. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6401.88s)]
*  Well, you know what I really like on TV [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6403.32s)]
*  where they have that circle over it, [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6404.96s)]
*  so you know where the puck is at all times. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6406.64s)]
*  Like, just a lot of craziness happening. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6408.56s)]
*  It's like if you're watching a football, [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6410.92s)]
*  if you're watching a football game from like the 30th row [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6412.72s)]
*  and you're looking down, like, what happened? [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6415.8s)]
*  Who's got the ball? [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6417.400000000001s)]
*  Like, after the ball gets hiked, it's like, where'd it go? [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6418.24s)]
*  Did it go to him? [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6422.6s)]
*  They're faking you out, you don't know, [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6423.4400000000005s)]
*  unless you see the guy throw it. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6425.56s)]
*  You don't know what's happening? [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6427.16s)]
*  And what about like old hockey goalies [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6428.76s)]
*  would do it with no helmet? [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6430.58s)]
*  And just get the puck and then we have that. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6431.98s)]
*  Oh, you see those faces, the way their faces? [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6433.54s)]
*  Do you think those guys ever sat on the bench [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6436.1s)]
*  and talked about mental health? [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6437.54s)]
*  Nobody told them what it was. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6439.0599999999995s)]
*  No, I don't think so. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6441.74s)]
*  You think they ever talked about their mental health? [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6443.82s)]
*  I think they had some struggles with it. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6444.98s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6446.66s)]
*  Yeah, taking a couple of shots to the head. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6447.5s)]
*  Oh, no question. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6448.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6449.5s)]
*  I mean, yeah, of course. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6450.34s)]

*  Vikings. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6500.1s)]

*  Dude, but is that true? [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6502.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6503.780000000001s)]
*  I didn't know that. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6504.6s)]
*  Those Iceland guys that win the world's [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6505.4400000000005s)]
*  strongest man competition all the time, [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6507.26s)]
*  like those guys like the mountain from Game of Thrones, [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6509.38s)]
*  where do you think that gene line came from? [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6511.34s)]
*  Vikings. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6513.18s)]
*  100%, those were the dudes that were in that fucking boat [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6514.02s)]
*  with the dragon head at the front. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6518.26s)]
*  And when they pulled up at your shore, [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6520.14s)]
*  everybody just ran. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6521.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah. That's it. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6523.34s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6525.860000000001s)]
*  Who we're not thinking about? [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6526.7s)]
*  I mean, it's obviously not underrated [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6527.52s)]
*  because everyone knows about them, [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6528.820000000001s)]
*  but let's just talk about the record. [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6530.14s)]
*  Alexander the Great, who led his troops, [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6532.360000000001s)]
*  undefeated in battle. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6536.02s)]
*  He's the Floyd Mayweather of generals. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6537.58s)]
*  Undefeated. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6541.1s)]
*  That's crazy. Record. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6542.26s)]
*  Never lost a battle. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6543.1s)]
*  That's crazy. That's true. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6544.46s)]
*  And conquered the known world at that time, [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6545.5s)]
*  took down the mighty Persian empire. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6547.36s)]
*  But if the Vikings were alive back then, [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6549.32s)]
*  they might kill him and his little boyfriend too. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6550.9s)]
*  They had enough of them. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6553.12s)]
*  I think so, dude. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6553.96s)]
*  They killed each other a lot too, unfortunately. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6555.48s)]
*  And they were civilized, the Vikings too. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6557.36s)]
*  It wasn't, but did you ever see the biological warfare [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6558.92s)]
*  when they would light the, I read this thing [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6562.599999999999s)]
*  where they would, the rats on their boat, [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6564.04s)]
*  when they were going to wherever they were invading, [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6566.5s)]
*  they would wait, they would get, look for infected rats. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6568.74s)]
*  Somehow they knew. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6571.639999999999s)]
*  They would get close enough, [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6572.719999999999s)]
*  they would light their tails on fire [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6574.12s)]
*  and then shoot them into over the walls [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6575.88s)]
*  and then let the rats run around and infect people [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6578.68s)]
*  and bite people or whatever, [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6582.6s)]
*  and wait it out for like 40 days and just then go in [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6583.72s)]
*  when the town was all dying of some disease. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6587.18s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6589.400000000001s)]
*  It's another. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6590.24s)]
*  That's the fact. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6591.08s)]
*  The Vikings were, they were brutal. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6592.04s)]
*  They would even kill like the priests and the churches. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6594.12s)]
*  They would do bad stuff. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6597.24s)]
*  Have you ever seen Alexander the Great's ruins [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6598.4800000000005s)]
*  in Afghanistan? [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6601.28s)]
*  In person? [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6603.64s)]
*  Dude. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6604.6s)]
*  Photographs. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6605.96s)]
*  Oh, no. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6606.799999999999s)]
*  Nobody wants to go to Afghanistan. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6607.639999999999s)]
*  That's the problem. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6608.48s)]
*  Archaeologists can't go there to study them, [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6609.299999999999s)]
*  but they have ancient Greek cities. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6610.839999999999s)]
*  I know. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6612.48s)]
*  They look like beautiful ancient Greek cities [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6613.32s)]
*  that are in the middle of Afghanistan. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6617.04s)]
*  That's sick. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6619.12s)]
*  My friend who served over there was telling me about it. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6619.96s)]
*  He was like, you go there, [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6621.799999999999s)]
*  you can't believe what you're seeing. [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6622.639999999999s)]
*  He had a bunch of pictures of it. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6623.5599999999995s)]
*  It's like, this is the craziest thing. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6624.679999999999s)]
*  It's like you're in Athens. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6625.799999999999s)]
*  You gotta admit, crazy. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6627.5199999999995s)]
*  The Greeks kind of nailed some stuff. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6628.919999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6630.759999999999s)]
*  My people kind of democracy. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6631.599999999999s)]
*  You know what you really should read? [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6632.44s)]
*  The immortality key. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6633.5599999999995s)]
*  Have you read that? [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6635.580000000001s)]
*  No. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6636.42s)]
*  It's Brian Murorescu. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6637.240000000001s)]
*  He's a scholar who was studying the use of psychedelic drugs [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6638.080000000001s)]
*  in ancient Greece for the Illucinian mysteries. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6641.740000000001s)]
*  Where everybody would go to learn about democracy. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6644.5s)]
*  And like it was all, they were all like tripping balls. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6646.860000000001s)]
*  And they've found evidence now from these vessels, [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6650.18s)]
*  these pottery vessels that inside these vessels, [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6653.72s)]
*  they were drinking wine. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6656.34s)]
*  But it wasn't wine. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6657.580000000001s)]
*  The wine wasn't just alcohol. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6659.42s)]
*  They would mix it with a bunch of different psychedelic [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6661.96s)]
*  compounds and one of them was ergot. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6664.06s)]
*  So they found residue of ergot, [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6666.46s)]
*  which is a psychedelic that gives you like [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6668.660000000001s)]
*  an LSD like experience. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6671.52s)]
*  So they were all drinking wine and tripping balls [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6673.900000000001s)]
*  and figuring out democracy and you know, [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6676.26s)]
*  like fucking the stars and constellations. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6678.700000000001s)]
*  They were out of their heads. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6681.620000000001s)]
*  And the birthplace of so much of western society [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6683.3s)]
*  has come from that one spot. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6687.22s)]
*  One to two thousand years ago. [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6688.54s)]
*  When's the last time you banged out a little LSD? [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6689.38s)]
*  It's been a long time. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6691.1s)]
*  Yeah? [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6691.9400000000005s)]
*  You think you'll bang it out again one day [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6692.780000000001s)]
*  I would like it to be legal before I admit to that. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6694.3s)]
*  Oh right, all right. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6696.34s)]
*  This is what I think. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6697.5s)]
*  Oh I thought LSD was legal. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6698.42s)]
*  New, new, new, new, super illegal. [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6699.74s)]
*  Schedule one. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6703.58s)]
*  I think when we realize the benefits of these things [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6705.3s)]
*  and hopefully it's within our lifetime, [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6709.62s)]
*  especially for people that have PTSD like soldiers, [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6711.42s)]
*  that'll open the door for that. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6714.66s)]
*  And then they'll have clinics where regular people [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6715.98s)]
*  can use it and then they can get over a lot of the shit [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6718.099999999999s)]
*  that people are struggling with. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6720.76s)]
*  There's a lot of people that could have [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6721.78s)]
*  a psychedelic experience and snap themselves back [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6723.58s)]
*  onto a better course in life. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6726.34s)]
*  And if it's illegal, that number of people [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6727.98s)]
*  is gonna be very limited. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6730.46s)]
*  But like all things, it's gonna have side effects. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6732.34s)]
*  This is the thing, it's like there's no biological [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6734.62s)]
*  free lunch and if you're doing something [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6736.62s)]
*  that's blowing your brains out like LSD, [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6739.0599999999995s)]
*  there's a certain amount of people who aren't coming back. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6741.219999999999s)]
*  And that's real. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6744.219999999999s)]
*  Because there's a certain amount of people [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6745.3s)]
*  who have a very fragile grasp on reality as it is. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6746.42s)]
*  You give that person nine grams of psilocybin mushrooms [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6750.22s)]
*  and you've got a real fucking problem. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6753.42s)]
*  They might not ever come back. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6755.26s)]
*  Were you able to snap back quick? [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6756.46s)]
*  You could snap back. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6758.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6759.1s)]
*  It depends on what you're doing. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6759.9400000000005s)]
*  And when you're doing it, what time in your life [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6761.780000000001s)]
*  and what the experience was like. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6763.7s)]
*  But it should be something that's controlled. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6765.2s)]
*  It should be something where you have places you can go [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6768.3s)]
*  where they have a very strict protocol, [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6771.38s)]
*  they measure your weight, they know what the dose is [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6775.62s)]
*  that they need to give you. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6778.46s)]
*  You can do it in a calm and clean and safe setting. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6779.26s)]
*  They're regulated. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6782.7s)]
*  They have counselors, they have people that understand, [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6783.9s)]
*  they screen you to make sure that you're not [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6786.82s)]
*  on any psych medications first that would interfere with it. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6788.54s)]
*  That's what we should have just like we have hospitals. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6792.06s)]
*  Just like we have mental health institutes. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6794.9s)]
*  This should be psychedelic research centers [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6797.5s)]
*  that are connected to treatment facilities. [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6800.4s)]
*  Right, there you go. [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6802.7s)]
*  I wanna do it too. [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6803.54s)]
*  I mean, the ketamine, that's what ketamine therapy is [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6804.38s)]
*  in some small ways, right? [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6806.38s)]
*  Exactly, it's very psychedelic. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6807.38s)]
*  In fact, John Lilly, the guy who created [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6808.66s)]
*  a sensory deprivation tank, that was his vibe. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6811.18s)]
*  He used to like to do ketamine in there. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6813.82s)]
*  He would do intramuscular ketamine. [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6815.9800000000005s)]
*  So he would go into the sensory deprivation tank [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6818.02s)]
*  and fucking bang himself with ketamine into the muscles [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6820.900000000001s)]
*  because it would last a long time and just. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6824.26s)]
*  Just fucking exist in this other dimension [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6830.26s)]
*  for hours at a time. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6832.900000000001s)]
*  That was his thing. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6834.58s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6835.46s)]
*  I mean, dude, I wanna hit it. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6836.34s)]
*  We should do a sensory deprivation tank together. [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6837.900000000001s)]
*  I have one here. [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6839.9800000000005s)]
*  He's got one here. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6840.820000000001s)]
*  You have one here? [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6841.64s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6842.4800000000005s)]
*  Wanna hit it? [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6843.320000000001s)]
*  No. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6844.14s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6844.9800000000005s)]
*  He won't do it. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6845.820000000001s)]
*  See, he gets a little, he won't do it. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6846.64s)]
*  I get a little scared of stuff. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6847.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, it's worth being scared. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6848.320000000001s)]
*  But that's not dangerous. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6849.14s)]
*  It's not scary. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6850.22s)]
*  Like whatever weird feelings you have, [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6851.06s)]
*  if you can't handle it, all you have to do is open the door [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6852.820000000001s)]
*  and you're sober instantaneously. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6854.820000000001s)]
*  It's different than anything else. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6857.06s)]
*  But if it was a drug, [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6858.7s)]
*  if the sensory deprivation tank was a drug, [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6859.78s)]
*  it would be a very psychedelic drug. [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6861.820000000001s)]
*  If it was just a drug, when you lay in there [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6863.98s)]
*  and your eyes are wide open, but it's pitch black [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6866.78s)]
*  and you're floating, you're completely weightless. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6868.94s)]
*  If that was a drug, it'd be a very popular drug. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6871.419999999999s)]
*  Now, when you've done this stuff, [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6873.7s)]
*  most people seem to say their ego [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6875.66s)]
*  disappears over the horizon type of stuff. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6877.62s)]
*  They realize everything's connected. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6879.7s)]
*  Have you had that experience? [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6881.139999999999s)]
*  You definitely realize everything's connected. [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6882.339999999999s)]
*  And your ego, you realize, is both protecting you [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6884.139999999999s)]
*  and holding you back. [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6888.099999999999s)]
*  Because your ego is like, you need a little bit of ego [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6890.0599999999995s)]
*  if you want to make it in life. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6893.14s)]
*  Because you need to have enough confidence in yourself [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6894.660000000001s)]
*  that you ask the girl out on a date [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6897.38s)]
*  that you're attracted to, [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6898.900000000001s)]
*  or that you chase the job that you want, [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6899.900000000001s)]
*  or that you stand up for yourself [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6902.26s)]
*  when you feel like you're getting fucked over [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6903.860000000001s)]
*  in a business deal. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6905.54s)]
*  You need some egos. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6906.620000000001s)]
*  You can't be completely selfless. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6908.38s)]
*  You're not gonna get anywhere. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6910.26s)]
*  But then you have to realize that you're very fragile [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6911.9400000000005s)]
*  and your ego is protecting you from a lot of [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6916.5s)]
*  true understanding of the life experience. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6919.78s)]
*  And one of the most profound things that happens [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6923.06s)]
*  with psychedelic experiences [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6926.02s)]
*  is the complete dissolving of ego. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6927.78s)]
*  And then you kind of see yourself and everyone around you [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6930.58s)]
*  in a way more objective way. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6934.62s)]
*  And you realize, oh my God, we're all energy [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6936.66s)]
*  feeding off of each other. [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6938.82s)]
*  And we're pretending that we're isolated. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6940.18s)]
*  We're singular, we're on our own. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6942.26s)]
*  That's why really ill people will tell you, [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6944.02s)]
*  I don't have any friends. [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6947.22s)]
*  I don't like people. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6948.66s)]
*  I don't wanna be around people. [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6949.78s)]
*  You know, if you've got a guy who's a fighter pilot, [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6951.38s)]
*  he's like, I don't hang around with fire pilots. [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6953.94s)]
*  Like, he's probably really depressed. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6955.42s)]
*  Like, something's wrong with him. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6957.34s)]
*  You don't hang out with your peers. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6958.82s)]
*  If you're not, you don't have friends. [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6960.26s)]
*  You don't enjoy camaraderie and community. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6961.54s)]
*  You wanna pretend that you're like this isolated, [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6963.78s)]
*  like dark poet or something like that. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6965.62s)]
*  You're probably very mentally ill. [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6967.62s)]
*  It's probably something really wrong with you. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6969.34s)]
*  We're hardwired social species. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6971.099999999999s)]
*  100%. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6972.98s)]
*  And we enjoy each other's company. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6973.82s)]
*  We feed off of it. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6976.54s)]
*  It's the worst thing they could do for you in jail [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6979.58s)]
*  is put you in solitary confinement. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6981.38s)]
*  The worst thing they could do. [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6982.98s)]
*  You're in a giant cage filled with prisoners [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6984.14s)]
*  and rapists and murderers. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6986.86s)]
*  The worst thing they could do is leave you alone. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6989.14s)]
*  Well, that's why I believe the internet's bad [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6991.38s)]
*  is because it's fake community. [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6992.86s)]
*  Right. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6995.58s)]
*  Right. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6996.42s)]
*  And that's why people talk like a fake way. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6997.26s)]
*  They don't talk like they would ever talk [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=6999.94s)]
*  if they were right in front of people. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7001.26s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7002.46s)]
*  And that's why I think it's bad [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7003.3s)]
*  because it's messing with people's sense [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7004.14s)]
*  of what reality is. [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7005.7s)]
*  And people are essentially disassociating [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7006.54s)]
*  from the reality of reality. [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7008.740000000001s)]

*  Right. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7010.42s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7011.240000000001s)]
*  And it's just, it's a very shallow way to communicate. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7012.08s)]
*  And I think that if you do it like that all the time, [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7015.02s)]
*  your ability to communicate normally [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7017.9400000000005s)]
*  and the ability to socialize [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7019.900000000001s)]

*  You don't flex that. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7025.34s)]
*  You don't use that muscle. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7026.700000000001s)]
*  And it atrophies, just like everything else. [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7028.700000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7030.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7031.46s)]
*  It's just there's so many kids [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7032.3s)]
*  that are completely socially disconnected [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7033.12s)]
*  other than the internet, which keeps them connected. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7034.5s)]
*  So they're socially connected through technology, [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7037.14s)]
*  but completely disconnected through human touch, [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7040.06s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7050.06s)]
*  They just exist in the same area [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7050.900000000001s)]
*  and just get as much coming through the screen as they can. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7052.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7055.820000000001s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7058.780000000001s)]
*  That's what's troubling [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7059.62s)]
*  and that's what I worry about my kids. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7060.4400000000005s)]
*  I go like, I want them to have human connection, [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7061.280000000001s)]
*  long conversations, experience people's energy. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7064.9s)]
*  Looking at someone in the eyes is everything. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7067.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7070.46s)]
*  You know, feeling someone's energy, like you said, [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7071.299999999999s)]
*  it's like you don't feel anything on the internet. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7073.0599999999995s)]
*  The problem also with kids is even when they're together, [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7074.38s)]
*  they're on their phones all the time. [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7076.7s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7078.46s)]
*  That's a problem. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7079.299999999999s)]
*  And this is one thing about podcasts [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7080.139999999999s)]
*  that's fucking amazing because podcasts [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7081.099999999999s)]
*  are one of the rare times in my life [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7082.82s)]
*  where for three hours I have no phone. [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7084.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7086.46s)]
*  For three hours, unless I'm checking something [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7087.299999999999s)]
*  or sending Jamie something, I don't. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7088.94s)]
*  And the people listening are also doing the same thing. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7090.5s)]
*  Right. [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7092.38s)]
*  They're connecting to you without doing that [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7093.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah, they're just connecting to hearing you. [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7095.54s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7096.78s)]
*  It's like a radio, a long radio show. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7097.82s)]
*  They're not like. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7099.46s)]
*  It's beautiful. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7100.3s)]

*  talking to other people and they're talking back [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7103.9s)]
*  and everyone's pretending like they're somebody else [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7106.22s)]
*  and catfishing each other. [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7107.9s)]
*  That's why I always used to like planes [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7109.66s)]
*  back in the day before Wi-Fi came around [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7111.3s)]
*  because when you were on a plane, [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7113.48s)]
*  if you didn't have a movie to watch or something like that, [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7115.4s)]
*  you just had to sit in that seat. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7118.04s)]
*  And when you just sit in that seat [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7120.74s)]
*  and you know you can't go anywhere, [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7122.0199999999995s)]

*  So when they're done, there's no carcass. [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7232.639999999999s)]
*  They're the fucking best animal on the planet. [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7235.04s)]
*  They got pseudo-penises. [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7237.5s)]
*  They're trans. Transgender animals. [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7238.84s)]
*  They're fucking wild. [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7240.400000000001s)]
*  The women are bigger than the men. [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7241.84s)]
*  I loved your bit about it. [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7243.28s)]
*  They smell too bad. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7244.68s)]
*  And we started the podcast [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7245.96s)]
*  because hyenas have always been my favorite animal [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7247.24s)]
*  and we both loved history [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7249.92s)]
*  and so we just combined those two things. [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7251.2s)]
*  But hyenas are hilarious, dude. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7252.64s)]
*  What was your bit about hyenas? [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7254.360000000001s)]
*  I didn't hear it. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7255.68s)]
*  It was great, it was a long bit. [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7256.5s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7257.34s)]
*  It's a long bit. [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7258.18s)]
*  It's a good bit. [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7259.02s)]
*  It's basically about their matriarchal power structure. [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7259.84s)]
*  Why that's bad. [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7263.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7264.08s)]
*  Well, it's also, they had to do that [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7264.900000000001s)]
*  because male hyenas are such cunts [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7265.92s)]
*  that they'd probably eat the babies. [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7267.56s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7268.8s)]
*  Yeah, they're monsters. [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7269.64s)]
*  But they're like a medium-sized animal [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7271.56s)]
*  in a world of things way bigger than them. [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7274.040000000001s)]
*  So they're living around lions. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7276.200000000001s)]
*  They get it done. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7277.64s)]
*  They trick you, numbers. [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7278.4800000000005s)]
*  They confuse you. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7281.72s)]
*  They're opportunity killers. [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7282.8s)]
*  They love to kill, to steal kills. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7283.9800000000005s)]
*  That laugh thing is real, that cackle. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7286.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they don't really know what it is either. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7287.96s)]
*  They don't actually know what exactly. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7290.6s)]
*  It seems like they're having fun. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7292.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, it's not like they're having a good time. [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7293.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they're just having fun. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7294.72s)]
*  They're fucking brutal. [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7296.240000000001s)]
*  The lions are like these fucking hyenas again. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7297.64s)]
*  Dude, they, yeah. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7299.28s)]
*  I mean, the hyenas just spoil fun. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7300.12s)]
*  They show up and you're like, these fuck. [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7301.72s)]
*  You ever see when like a cheetah works so hard? [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7303.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7307.6s)]
*  Because cheetahs fail all the time. [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7308.44s)]
*  And then they finally get a kill. [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7309.76s)]
*  And then you just hear that, kikikiki. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7311.32s)]
*  You just hear that. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7312.76s)]
*  And the cheetah's probably going, motherfucker. [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7313.6s)]
*  And they just come and they just steal it. [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7316.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7318.12s)]
*  That whole area, when you think about it, [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7318.96s)]
*  is like the proving ground for biological life. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7320.16s)]
*  Like how are you going to keep the populations in order? [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7324.72s)]
*  How are you gonna make sure [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7328.400000000001s)]
*  the predators don't get out of hand? [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7329.240000000001s)]
*  How are you gonna make sure that the hyenas [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7330.92s)]
*  always have to worry about the male lions? [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7333.400000000001s)]
*  Look at that face. [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7334.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7335.6s)]
*  Look at that face. [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7336.42s)]
*  That face is so crazy. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7337.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7340.240000000001s)]
*  I don't wanna get eaten by that. [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7341.08s)]
*  Just washing jaw muscles. [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7341.92s)]
*  I think. [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7343.56s)]
*  Oh my God, look at that face. [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7344.400000000001s)]
*  That's so nuts. [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7345.72s)]
*  They're hilarious. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7346.8s)]
*  Imagine that's the last thing you see before you get eaten. [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7347.8s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know why they're funny to me. [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7350.320000000001s)]
*  How many people die from hyenas every year? [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7352.280000000001s)]
*  They eat a lot of people. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7354.0s)]
*  Do they? [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7355.12s)]
*  Remember that picture that we saw of a hyena [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7355.96s)]
*  that's got an elephant's foot in its mouth? [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7357.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7359.08s)]
*  It's just running around with an elephant. [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7359.92s)]
*  Fucking monsters. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7361.96s)]
*  That was actually our first logo. [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7363.0s)]
*  We put our faces on that. [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7364.4s)]
*  Ah! [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7365.84s)]
*  And then we tried to sell merch at it [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7366.96s)]
*  and people were like, I'm not buying this bloody hyena [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7368.32s)]
*  for these fucking idiots. [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7370.04s)]
*  Yeah, and also it's not our picture to sell. [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7370.88s)]
*  Jamie, how many people die from hyenas every year? [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7373.08s)]
*  Hippos kill the most people in Africa, right? [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7375.56s)]
*  Do they? [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7377.36s)]
*  Yeah, I believe so. [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7378.2s)]
*  I believe hippos are responsible for the most deaths. [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7379.28s)]
*  What are they like? [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7381.76s)]
*  Are they like a village or something [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7382.64s)]
*  that lives close to the hippos in Africa? [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7383.4400000000005s)]
*  I think if you fuck around [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7385.280000000001s)]
*  and you get in the water near hippos, [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7386.120000000001s)]
*  you ever see hippos chasing boats? [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7387.56s)]
*  They'll chase boats. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7389.240000000001s)]
*  It's like a fucking submarine. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7390.240000000001s)]
*  Super territorial. [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7392.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, they're rough, man. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7393.76s)]
*  You think of them as Hungry Hungry Hippo. [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7395.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7397.4800000000005s)]
*  We make the most monstrous animals the cutest. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7398.320000000001s)]
*  Polar bears, hippos, yogi. [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7401.120000000001s)]
*  Yeah, teddy bears. [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7404.08s)]
*  Every kid has a teddy bear. [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7405.72s)]
*  You're like, you don't want a real bear. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7406.8s)]
*  Tony the Tiger. [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7407.76s)]
*  Yeah, right? [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7408.6s)]
*  Tony the Tiger. [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7409.72s)]
*  How many people every year die, [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7410.76s)]
*  let's take a guess before we find out. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7412.76s)]
*  How many people die from hyenas every year? [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7414.24s)]
*  You ready for this? [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7416.0s)]
*  I'm gonna say that I think in the world, [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7416.84s)]
*  50 people die of hyenas and I think 75 die of cannibals. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7419.84s)]
*  Wow. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7425.4800000000005s)]
*  That's what I think, more people get eaten [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7426.320000000001s)]
*  by other people than hyenas. [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7427.96s)]
*  Wow. [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7429.72s)]
*  15, 75 is my guessy-wessy. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7430.56s)]
*  How would you, you'd have to count into places [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7432.08s)]
*  where people do it for revenge too, like Haiti. [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7434.08s)]
*  They eat people for fun. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7436.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I'm saying. [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7438.4800000000005s)]
*  The counts, Papua New Guinea. [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7439.48s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7441.5599999999995s)]
*  How many, I think there's a very low number of cannibals [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7443.16s)]
*  every year where people get eaten by cannibals. [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7447.48s)]
*  I would say it's less than 20 people eaten by cannibals. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7449.719999999999s)]
*  This is my guess. [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7452.5599999999995s)]
*  And maybe 75 people every year die from hyenas. [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7453.44s)]
*  I'm gonna go 800 to 1,000. [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7458.44s)]
*  Hyenas? [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7461.96s)]
*  On the whole continent of Serengeti, yeah, I mean Africa. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7462.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I'm gonna go 1,000. [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7465.759999999999s)]
*  Every year? [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7466.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I'm gonna go 1,000. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7467.44s)]
*  Jesus. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7468.28s)]
*  What about cannibals? [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7469.96s)]
*  Cannibals I think is a lot higher. [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7470.8s)]
*  I mean, how are we ever gonna get that number? [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7472.16s)]
*  Nobody eats somebody and then goes and reports it. [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7473.8s)]
*  Yeah, so that's impossible to know. [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7476.28s)]
*  But I think hyenas you can track [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7478.5199999999995s)]
*  and I think they probably get hundreds. [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7480.44s)]
*  But ask Google, [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7482.24s)]
*  because Google tells you the truth traps CPT lies. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7483.08s)]
*  I bet it's not that many. [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7484.92s)]
*  What do we got, oh. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7487.48s)]
*  I was trying to find a good answer. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7488.32s)]
*  It took me a while to find an answer. [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7489.84s)]
*  I found one story where a guy was killed by some [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7491.08s)]
*  and it said it was the 60th in that year, [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7493.24s)]
*  but I didn't know what year it was. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7494.96s)]
*  60th hyena or cannibal? [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7496.599999999999s)]
*  Hyena death in that year. [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7498.64s)]

*  Yeah, this is 1998 to 99. [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7504.52s)]
*  50 people were attacked by hyenas with 35 being children. [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7506.320000000001s)]
*  12 people killed. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7510.120000000001s)]

*  I don't want to. [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7515.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and I'm not seeing tons of good info. [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7516.04s)]

*  If you're in that part of the world, [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7518.240000000001s)]
*  you better be packing everywhere you go. [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7519.68s)]
*  Yeah, we need it. [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7522.240000000001s)]
*  Bulletproof vest, shotgun, big bowie knife, [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7523.08s)]
*  fucking everything. [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7526.280000000001s)]
*  If you're walking around a hyena country, [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7528.2s)]
*  you better be ready to spray. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7529.96s)]
*  Since their attacks are actually kind of rare. [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7531.679999999999s)]
*  Hyena attacks? [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7533.76s)]

*  I think hippos. [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7539.639999999999s)]

*  Like, let's just guess. [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7601.16s)]
*  How many people die from lions? [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7603.400000000001s)]
*  If hyenas are, I'm gonna say 18. [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7605.4800000000005s)]
*  18 from hyenas? [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7608.12s)]

*  Do you think more people die from hyenas than lions? [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7609.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7611.16s)]
*  Well, that was like in the 80s [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7613.26s)]
*  and it was only 12 people died. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7614.400000000001s)]
*  But who's getting close to the lions like this? [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7615.8s)]
*  Assholes. [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7617.72s)]
*  Well, they also live out there. [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7619.84s)]
*  I mean, they did a lot of tribes live out there. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7621.0s)]
*  They're close by. [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7623.2s)]
*  There's a tribe, there's a village in Africa I saw, [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7624.04s)]
*  it was on that geo, that hyenas come in and get fed there. [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7626.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I saw that. [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7629.2s)]
*  Hyenas walk into, you saw that, right? [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7630.04s)]
*  Where they actually feed them. [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7631.280000000001s)]
*  So they have a deal and actually they believe [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7632.92s)]
*  helps keep them safe because the hyenas, [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7634.88s)]
*  no, they don't have to kill anyone, [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7636.54s)]
*  they'll just get the food. [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7637.72s)]

*  Make friends with the hyenas. [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7644.88s)]
*  Why not? [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7646.12s)]
*  They understand. [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7646.96s)]
*  They try to keep them as pets. [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7647.8s)]
*  You ever see the dudes walk around with chains on them? [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7648.96s)]
*  Yeah, that'd be wild. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7651.08s)]

*  So like a mastiff looking size? [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7659.08s)]
*  Yeah, it's kind of like probably a German shepherd [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7660.76s)]
*  or mastiff looking. [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7663.04s)]
*  Bigger than a shepherd, right? [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7663.88s)]
*  Probably. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7664.8s)]
*  I don't know because they're like, [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7665.68s)]
*  they're like, they're not that, [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7666.92s)]

*  Like if you've got clearance, you can't do that. [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7680.28s)]

*  and he would ride it on stage. [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7693.68s)]
*  And like he's doing a show [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7696.32s)]
*  and he's on a fucking buffalo in front of all these people. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7698.08s)]

*  I'd like to turn the strings. [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7826.24s)]
*  Now I've been thinking for so long. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7829.400000000001s)]
*  You know I'm here to say. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7832.72s)]
*  Got a tear in the stranglehold, baby. [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7835.88s)]
*  You've messed it out of the way. [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7839.2s)]
*  This is a huge, huge hit. [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7844.08s)]
*  I don't know it. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7847.56s)]
*  Who's the best guitarist of all time? [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7849.72s)]
*  Hendrix. [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7851.8s)]
*  Billy Ray? [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7853.120000000001s)]
*  Hendrix. [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7853.96s)]
*  Hendrix? [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7854.8s)]
*  Hold up. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7855.64s)]
*  All right, we're good. [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7856.4800000000005s)]
*  Stranglehold. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7857.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7858.52s)]
*  So he's a big musician. [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7859.360000000001s)]
*  He's famous for that. [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7860.200000000001s)]
*  Cat Scratch Fever, another big song. [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7861.04s)]
*  Okay. [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7862.120000000001s)]
*  Had a bunch of good songs. [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7862.96s)]
*  But then what happened? [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7863.8s)]
*  Then he got into politics and stuff? [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7864.64s)]
*  Well, he's just a bow hunter and very vocal [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7865.4800000000005s)]
*  about social issues. [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7869.76s)]
*  That's cool. [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7871.8s)]
*  And kind of a maniac. [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7872.64s)]
*  Right. [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7873.84s)]
*  Yeah, he's kind of a nutty dude, but he's fun. [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7874.68s)]
*  So then how does he have a son in Staten Island that I know? [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7877.2s)]
*  Well, his son, you know, I think he didn't know [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7878.88s)]
*  it was his son, right? [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7882.32s)]
*  It was one of those deals? [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7883.24s)]
*  But they're close, they're a relationship. [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7884.08s)]
*  But he has another son, the son Rocco, that I've met. [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7884.92s)]
*  He's a fun guy. [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7890.5199999999995s)]
*  I like him. [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7893.28s)]
*  It's a powerful name, Rocco. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7894.12s)]
*  I don't agree with everything he says, [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7895.679999999999s)]
*  but that's the case with a lot of people. [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7897.08s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7898.759999999999s)]
*  To each their own. [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7899.92s)]
*  I think Hendrix is the greatest. [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7900.759999999999s)]
*  When it comes to guitarists. [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7902.4s)]
*  Because Hendrix changed songs with his guitar. [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7903.32s)]
*  Like Eric Clapton famously, when he saw Hendrix play [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7907.2s)]
*  for the first time, was like, what am I doing? [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7910.2s)]
*  Why am I even doing? [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7911.679999999999s)]
*  It's Eric Clapton. [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7912.5199999999995s)]
*  Eric Clapton, Layla. [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7913.759999999999s)]
*  I mean, he was amazing. [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7917.08s)]
*  How about Billy Ray Vaughan, though? [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7918.16s)]
*  Stevie Ray Vaughan. [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7919.4s)]
*  Sorry, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Jesus Christ. [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7920.24s)]
*  Yeah, Stevie Ray Vaughan. [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7922.679999999999s)]
*  Tin Pan Alley. [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7924.0s)]
*  Amazing. [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7924.96s)]
*  He used to play at our club. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7925.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I can't believe I said Billy Ray Vaughan. [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7927.0s)]
*  I got him confused with Billy Ray Cyrus. [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7928.719999999999s)]
*  Don't tell my heart. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7931.679999999999s)]
*  My achy breaky heart. [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7934.16s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7935.0s)]
*  Tin Pan Alley is one of my favorite songs. [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7936.639999999999s)]
*  Have you ever seen in the corridor [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7938.48s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7969.4400000000005s)]
*  But someone was murdered there. [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7970.280000000001s)]
*  Someone was definitely shot there, I think in the 70s. [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7971.120000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7973.320000000001s)]
*  At least one person. [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7974.160000000001s)]
*  It used to be a nudie movie theater, [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7975.280000000001s)]
*  and it was a pool hall. [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7977.120000000001s)]
*  So it was like a nudie movie theater, a pool hall. [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7979.0s)]
*  It was a punk rock club. [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7981.8s)]
*  There's like a lot of history in there. [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7983.120000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7984.6s)]
*  A lot of people of the night in there. [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7985.4400000000005s)]
*  Do you think it's possible that it was built [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7986.280000000001s)]
*  on an Indian burial ground? [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7987.6s)]
*  Indian burial ground? [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7989.0s)]
*  It's so much better that you fucked that up. [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7991.32s)]
*  You know, there used to be a swastika on the wall. [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7993.4s)]
*  Oh yeah? [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7997.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7998.2s)]
*  So when we tore down, so there's like, you know, [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=7999.04s)]
*  a wall board, and you tear down the wall board, [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8003.2s)]
*  you get to the raw brick, and in the raw brick, [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8005.16s)]
*  there's a fucking swastika on the wall. [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8006.96s)]
*  And we're like, this is crazy. [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8009.639999999999s)]
*  And so while we're building the place up, [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8011.16s)]
*  you know, I come in like four months later, [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8013.92s)]
*  I'm like, hey guys, why is the fucking swastika still here? [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8015.44s)]
*  Like, we're gonna open. [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8018.36s)]
*  Six months. [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8020.759999999999s)]
*  You gotta get rid of the swastika. [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8021.639999999999s)]
*  So they tell one of the construction guys [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8023.08s)]
*  to take off the paint where the swastika is. [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8025.16s)]
*  And so you know what he does? [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8027.88s)]
*  He takes it off in the shape of the swastika. [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8029.04s)]
*  So he cleans, so now it's brighter. [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8032.12s)]
*  Now it's like bright white. [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8034.12s)]
*  I'm like, hey, it's still a fucking swastika. [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8036.24s)]
*  Get it off the wall. [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8038.84s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8040.759999999999s)]
*  Was it the swastika from like the Hindu symbol [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8041.92s)]
*  before the Heller? [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8043.88s)]
*  No, no, no. [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8044.719999999999s)]
*  It was probably from the punk rock days. [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8045.84s)]
*  Somebody probably thought they were being crammed [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8047.5599999999995s)]
*  fucking punk, yeah. [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8049.72s)]

*  I'm a rebel. [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8054.84s)]
*  And they threw it up. [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8056.0s)]
*  Yeah, they threw it up. [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8056.92s)]
*  They painted it on the wall and it stayed there. [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8057.76s)]
*  Wow. Yeah. [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8059.8s)]
*  They never cleaned it up. [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8061.280000000001s)]
*  This is so crazy. [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8063.12s)]
*  That reminds me of the old punchline in Atlanta [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8064.4800000000005s)]
*  that had the Vince champ signature. [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8067.04s)]

*  Oh yeah. Yeah. [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8075.4400000000005s)]
*  They used to do that. [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8076.280000000001s)]
*  That was a good move back then. [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8077.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8078.64s)]

*  They did, yeah. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8087.759999999999s)]
*  They're still going. [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8088.599999999999s)]
*  I saw a thing that said like hunter gatherers, [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8089.44s)]
*  their bodies, not only the flexibility they had is unmatched [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8091.839999999999s)]
*  but they actually had bigger brains. [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8094.919999999999s)]
*  You ever see this? [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8096.24s)]
*  That they actually think that they were smarter than us? [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8097.08s)]
*  They had bigger heads and bigger brains? [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8099.4s)]
*  Well, they probably had to process a lot of things. [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8101.24s)]
*  It was like, what is smart? [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8102.879999999999s)]
*  Is it smart to just be able to use chat, [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8103.959999999999s)]
*  cheap E.T. and find answers to things? [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8105.679999999999s)]
*  Or is it smart to have to figure stuff out [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8107.32s)]
*  about nature to stay alive? [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8109.719999999999s)]
*  Right. [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8111.679999999999s)]
*  You know, there's different kinds of intelligence. [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8112.5199999999995s)]
*  If you take like the smartest guy ever [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8113.36s)]
*  and you let him loose in the Amazon, [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8115.5599999999995s)]
*  how long is he gonna live? [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8117.36s)]
*  He's not gonna live very long. [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8118.48s)]
*  Stephen Hawking's not gonna make it. [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8119.32s)]
*  Hunter gatherers generally had larger brains [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8120.36s)]
*  compared to later human populations [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8122.4s)]
*  as the demands of their lifestyle, [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8124.12s)]
*  including complex foraging strategies [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8125.4s)]
*  and navigating diverse environments, [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8127.36s)]
*  lightly put selective pressure on the evolution [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8129.24s)]
*  of larger brain capacity for problem solving and planning. [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8132.16s)]
*  That makes sense. [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8134.88s)]
*  Expensive tissue hypothesis, interesting, [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8136.28s)]
*  which suggests that a diet rich in meat [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8139.5599999999995s)]
*  allowed for the energy expenditure [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8141.62s)]
*  needed to maintain a larger brain. [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8143.719999999999s)]
*  Did you see those, you know, [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8145.8s)]
*  they found a new population of humans [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8148.12s)]
*  that existed as recently as I think 100,000 years ago, [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8151.8s)]
*  but they found them in China [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8157.96s)]
*  and they have much larger heads. [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8159.24s)]
*  Really? [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8160.96s)]
*  Yeah, they found out like, [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8161.8s)]
*  they thought they were Denisovans, [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8162.639999999999s)]
*  I think at one point in time, [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8164.28s)]
*  which also is fairly new discovery. [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8165.36s)]
*  They found Denisovans in 2010, [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8167.4s)]
*  but this is another one. [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8170.4s)]
*  This is another new species of human being [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8171.92s)]
*  that they studied that they found, [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8174.2s)]
*  and they had large heads. [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8175.96s)]
*  Haven't they found like 12, [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8178.24s)]
*  like 11 different hominids now? [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8179.299999999999s)]
*  There's quite a few, there's quite a few, [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8181.28s)]
*  including the really controversial ones [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8183.36s)]
*  like homo florescensis or florescensis. [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8184.799999999999s)]
*  I forgot how to say it. [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8188.5599999999995s)]
*  What was that one? [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8189.4s)]
*  That was the hobbit people. [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8190.24s)]
*  The island of Flores, they were little tiny, [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8191.08s)]
*  three feet tall people. Squeaks, little squeaks. [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8192.52s)]
*  Little twinks. [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8194.24s)]
*  Little squeaks. [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8195.08s)]
*  Late 1970s, yeah, there it is. [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8195.92s)]
*  Homo juliesis, juliensis. [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8197.24s)]
*  Fossils began belonging to 16 individuals [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8200.76s)]
*  were found at two different locations in China. [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8203.84s)]
*  They appeared to belong to unique species, [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8205.6s)]
*  thousands of artifacts, stone tools, and animal bones. [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8207.28s)]
*  This one is the larger headed one. [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8210.6s)]
*  Is that the same one? [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8214.36s)]
*  Is that it? [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8217.06s)]
*  Because it says in the late 70s, fossils. [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8217.9s)]

*  Shanghua River in Harbin, China, [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8241.96s)]
*  where a bridge was being built. [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8244.36s)]
*  Okay, so skull is a combination of ancient [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8246.28s)]
*  and modern features, including a large brain, [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8248.4s)]
*  similar to modern humans and Neanderthals, [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8250.56s)]
*  a low forehead, this was it. [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8252.64s)]
*  But how do they know that these are, [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8255.64s)]
*  couldn't it just be like a weird looking kid? [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8256.8s)]
*  Like if me and Janos were laying down, [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8258.4s)]
*  you found our skeletons, [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8259.88s)]
*  you would think we might be different types of species. [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8260.72s)]
*  I mean, he's got a peanut head [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8262.48s)]
*  and I have a head like a crow magnum. [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8263.56s)]
*  Good point, right? [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8264.84s)]
*  If you found Shaq buried right next to Bridget the Midget. [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8265.84s)]
*  It could just be different people. [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8269.199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, good point. [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8270.68s)]
*  That is. [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8271.519999999999s)]
*  If you wanna talk about fumes, [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8272.34s)]
*  these kids definitely have fumes. [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8273.42s)]
*  Neanderthals, oh my God, dude. [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8274.88s)]
*  What does that smell like? [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8276.4s)]
*  Must have been bad, dude. [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8277.439999999999s)]
*  Yeah, big time. [[02:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8279.28s)]
*  Yeah, here Jamie, I think this is a different thing. [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8280.6s)]
*  I'm gonna send it to you right now. [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8283.24s)]
*  I'm gonna send you the title. [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8284.4s)]
*  I just saved it on my phone so I could look at it later. [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8286.119999999999s)]
*  I didn't really look at it too much. [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8289.039999999999s)]
*  Right. [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8290.64s)]
*  But they keep finding these new versions of humans. [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8291.46s)]
*  Right. [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8295.76s)]
*  So it's like how many of them were there [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8296.6s)]
*  and why did we succeed? [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8297.42s)]
*  Like what was so great about it? [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8298.52s)]
*  I think we were most vicious, right? [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8299.92s)]
*  And we just killed off the other ones? [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8301.56s)]
*  Dogs. [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8302.84s)]
*  You think dogs? [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8303.68s)]
*  Dogs. [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8304.52s)]
*  That's the answer. [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8305.34s)]
*  I know, dude. [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8306.18s)]
*  Yeah, I mean. [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8307.02s)]
*  You're 100% positive. [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8307.86s)]
*  Science says it, science says it. [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8309.12s)]
*  Like it's nation, you know, in the understanding of how, [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8310.2s)]
*  but it's pretty solid that that's what gave us the edge. [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8315.720000000001s)]
*  That we trained dogs. [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8319.960000000001s)]
*  That we domesticated dogs. [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8320.800000000001s)]
*  We teamed up with dogs and we had a symbiotic relationship [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8321.62s)]
*  and we were able to protect ourselves better. [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8323.9s)]
*  So this is it. [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8328.08s)]
*  Large head people, mysterious new form [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8329.52s)]
*  of ancient human emerges, this is it. [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8331.880000000001s)]
*  So provocative new piece of nature [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8334.16s)]
*  as proposed a whole new group of ancient humans, [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8336.04s)]
*  cousins of the Denisovans and Neanderthals [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8338.880000000001s)]
*  that once lived alongside Homo sapiens in Eastern Asia [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8341.18s)]
*  more than 100,000 years ago. [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8344.160000000002s)]
*  Brains of these extinct humans who probably hunted horses [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8345.800000000001s)]
*  in small groups were much bigger [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8348.7s)]
*  than any other hominin of their time, [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8350.7s)]
*  including our own species. [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8352.52s)]
*  This is it. [[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8354.0s)]
*  The large head people. [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8355.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8356.800000000001s)]
*  So that's it. [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8357.720000000001s)]
*  It is that name though. [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8358.560000000001s)]
*  Oh, no, no, in the past it says. [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8360.12s)]
*  Some science have attributed to it, [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8362.220000000001s)]
*  but that's not what they're saying. [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8364.36s)]
*  They think it's different. [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8365.8s)]
*  The Denisovans is what it says. [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8366.64s)]
*  Some scientists have attributed the Jewelluren fossils [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8368.8s)]
*  to Denisovans. [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8371.039999999999s)]
*  Right. [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8371.88s)]
*  But once lived alone. [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8372.72s)]
*  In the past. [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8374.48s)]
*  So now they think it's a totally different thing, right? [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8375.32s)]
*  I didn't know people ate horses. [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8377.56s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8379.199999999999s)]
*  Has every animal been eaten? [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8380.039999999999s)]
*  Oh, a lot of people eat horses, man. [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8381.0s)]
*  Yes, still right now. [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8382.56s)]
*  In fact, Shafkat Rakhmanov, [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8383.4s)]
*  the number one contender in the welterweight division, [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8384.4s)]
*  he says it's his favorite food. [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8386.48s)]
*  Horse meat? [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8387.68s)]
*  Yeah, he's from Kazakhstan. [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8388.52s)]
*  He rides horses and he eats horses. [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8389.439999999999s)]
*  He's like, I love horse. [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8391.64s)]
*  He loves them all the way. [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8393.439999999999s)]
*  You ever tried it? [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8394.52s)]
*  Yeah, I've had a horse. [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8395.48s)]
*  Good? [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8396.32s)]
*  I had it in Montreal. [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8397.14s)]
*  There's a restaurant in Montreal, [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8397.98s)]
*  one of the best restaurants in the world. [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8399.68s)]
*  Shout out to Joe Beef. [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8401.0s)]
*  Oh, of course. [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8402.359999999999s)]
*  Incredible, incredible place. [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8403.199999999999s)]
*  And we went there, Ari and I, we had, [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8405.0s)]
*  I went with Duncan too. [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8407.199999999999s)]
*  We had horse tartare and we had horse loin. [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8408.24s)]
*  And it was good. [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8411.88s)]
*  Fucking really good. [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8412.72s)]
*  It's game. [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8413.84s)]
*  It's like wild game. [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8414.68s)]
*  It's like eating an antelope or eating an elk. [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8415.82s)]
*  Right. [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8418.92s)]
*  It's real similar. [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8419.76s)]
*  It's not bad. [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8420.58s)]
*  But I remember it was all in the family. [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8421.42s)]
*  The bunkers were poor. [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8424.519999999999s)]
*  They weren't doing so well. [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8426.56s)]
*  And Edith went to the store and she bought horse meat. [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8427.48s)]
*  And she served it to Archie. [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8429.8s)]
*  And it was like a big deal. [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8431.08s)]
*  I ain't eating this horse. [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8432.279999999999s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8434.359999999999s)]
*  You remember that episode? [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8435.199999999999s)]
*  No, I never saw it. [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8437.4s)]
*  I don't. [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8438.24s)]
*  But again, another good impression. [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8439.359999999999s)]
*  I remember it was like a real problem in the family [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8440.96s)]
*  that she fed him horse. [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8443.439999999999s)]
*  But they were so poor. [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8445.16s)]
*  They didn't have any meat. [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8446.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8447.24s)]
*  Well, I just feel bad for horses. [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8448.06s)]
*  I mean, they lug us around for, you know. [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8449.48s)]
*  They're also very sweet. [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8451.08s)]
*  Yeah, I love them. [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8452.119999999999s)]
*  They're connected to people. [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8452.96s)]
*  You can get connected to a horse. [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8454.62s)]
*  Yeah, I can't eat horses. [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8456.1s)]
*  I can't eat dogs. [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8457.5s)]
*  I just can't do it. [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8458.34s)]
*  Can't do it. [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8459.16s)]
*  Dogs get eaten a lot, unfortunately, right? [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8460.0s)]
*  I think dogs and humans are connected genetically. [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8461.54s)]
*  I think so too. [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8464.54s)]
*  I think there's a place in our brain [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8465.42s)]
*  that kind of matches up with them. [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8466.820000000002s)]
*  And like, yeah, we evolve together. [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8468.300000000001s)]
*  Something's up. [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8470.060000000001s)]
*  It's magical. [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8471.02s)]
*  Yeah, my dog, he's a part of my family. [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8471.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8474.460000000001s)]
*  I'm connected to that dog. [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8475.460000000001s)]
*  Yeah, me too. [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8476.74s)]
*  See, I don't want a dog, but maybe I should get a dog. [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8477.58s)]
*  You think I should just do it? [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8479.34s)]
*  Dogs are great. [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8480.18s)]
*  But you're a weirdo. [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8481.1s)]
*  You'd probably give them away. [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8481.94s)]
*  No, I would. [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8482.78s)]
*  I can't take it anymore, [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8484.460000000001s)]
*  so I gave it to this Puerto Rican family. [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8485.300000000001s)]
*  I did. [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8486.140000000001s)]
*  And they raised it to be an attack dog, [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8486.980000000001s)]
*  and I feel bad. [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8489.140000000001s)]
*  Now he's attacking people. [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8489.980000000001s)]

*  I would. [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8491.820000000002s)]
*  I gotta be better with dogs. [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8492.660000000002s)]
*  Like that fucking dream house you got rid of, [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8493.480000000001s)]
*  and then you moved to the city like a retard. [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8495.18s)]
*  Like a fucking retard. [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8496.820000000002s)]
*  And now I bought one that was too expensive [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8498.060000000001s)]
*  because Chachi BT told me to. [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8499.740000000002s)]
*  Why didn't you try to buy your old house back? [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8501.900000000001s)]

*  When you have like- [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8511.82s)]
*  Him and I talk about it. [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8512.66s)]

*  I go a little wild, [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8519.46s)]
*  and he kinda keeps me back. [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8520.3s)]
*  Well, I mean, I'm not gonna say I said it, [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8521.46s)]
*  but I don't know how I controlled him, [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8524.22s)]
*  but it was bought by a Muslim family. [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8525.699999999999s)]
*  A Palestinian family. [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8527.9s)]

*  I see the writing on the wall. [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8541.18s)]
*  Well, they see that they're in a place [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8542.02s)]
*  where they can accomplish it, [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8544.42s)]

*  and told me never to gamble, [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8583.859999999999s)]
*  so I thought I escaped it [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8584.859999999999s)]
*  because I don't know anything about cards [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8585.82s)]
*  and sports gambling. [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8587.42s)]
*  I don't know anything about it. [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8588.4s)]
*  You do it with life choices. [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8589.46s)]
*  Yes, which is kind of a little riskier. [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8590.38s)]
*  A lot of people do. [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8592.179999999998s)]

*  That's what it is. [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8611.34s)]
*  Well, I tried to, but I got a bad Achilles. [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8612.16s)]
*  That can be fixed. [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8614.0s)]
*  I know, but I've been trying for six months. [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8616.759999999998s)]
*  What's wrong with your Achilles? [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8618.08s)]
*  I don't know, man. [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8618.92s)]
*  It hurts. [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8619.759999999998s)]
*  Well, I have tendinosis in the Achilles [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8620.599999999999s)]
*  and they did the x-ray [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8622.039999999999s)]
*  and they see some scar tissue in there, [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8622.88s)]
*  so they actually told me. [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8624.16s)]
*  Why don't you get stem cells? [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8625.119999999999s)]

*  That'll help, too. [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8631.22s)]
*  Spin the blood. [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8632.039999999999s)]

*  That's me. [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8660.84s)]
*  I've been two years with this. [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8661.68s)]
*  I have a growth on the back of my heel. [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8662.6s)]
*  Oh, from the bone? [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8665.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, like the bone's broken. [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8666.24s)]
*  Getting irritated? [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8667.400000000001s)]
*  Yep, yep, and it's all fucked up. [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8668.220000000001s)]
*  But I do have a clean colon. [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8670.44s)]
*  I had two polyps, [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8671.560000000001s)]
*  but under three centimeters, [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8672.400000000001s)]
*  we're good to go, baby. [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8674.16s)]
*  Congratulations. [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8675.0s)]
*  Clean ass, so to see. [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8675.82s)]
*  We got our colonoscopies a month apart. [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8676.66s)]
*  Everyone should get a colonoscopy starting at 40. [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8677.84s)]
*  Everyone should get it. [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8681.04s)]
*  It's on the rise with young people. [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8681.880000000001s)]
*  You know what you could really do? [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8683.2s)]
*  You could do a comprehensive blood screen [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8684.12s)]
*  to test you for all cancers, [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8687.160000000002s)]
*  not just asshole cancer. [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8688.68s)]
*  Well, they have that now. [[02:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8690.320000000002s)]
*  It's a lot easier, and it's better. [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8691.160000000002s)]
*  You never did a colonoscopy? [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8693.52s)]
*  I had one once. [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8695.04s)]
*  Right. [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8696.400000000001s)]
*  How dare you bring it up? [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8697.240000000002s)]
*  Why, what's wrong with it? [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8698.240000000002s)]
*  Nothing. [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8699.08s)]
*  It's fine. [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8699.900000000001s)]
*  I know, dude. [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8700.740000000002s)]
*  I didn't wake up that hard. [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8701.58s)]
*  I think that if you go, [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8702.800000000001s)]
*  I didn't have a colonoscopy, no. [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8704.5s)]
*  I had an exam where they go in there with their fingers. [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8705.880000000001s)]
*  I didn't go in there with a microscope. [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8708.6s)]
*  They didn't put the scope in there? [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8709.800000000001s)]
*  No. [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8710.720000000001s)]
*  He woke up during his, because he liked it. [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8711.560000000001s)]
*  I woke up. [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8712.820000000002s)]
*  I swear to God. [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8714.34s)]
*  No, I wasn't even hard. [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8715.18s)]
*  I'm not even fucking around. [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8716.5s)]
*  I woke up in the middle of it, [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8717.72s)]
*  because I just knew something was in my ass. [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8720.1s)]
*  I woke up, yeah. [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8722.82s)]
*  I woke up. [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8723.66s)]
*  I went, Mateo? [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8724.5s)]
*  I fell back asleep. [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8727.02s)]
*  But they can screen you with this, [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8729.3s)]
*  I forget what it's called. [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8731.66s)]
*  They do that at Waste Well, too. [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8732.94s)]
*  They send it off to a lab. [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8734.5s)]
*  They take your blood, and they screen you [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8735.66s)]
*  for like 100 kinds of cancer. [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8737.16s)]
*  Right. [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8739.3s)]
*  That's the way to go. [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8740.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8740.98s)]
*  They got the full body scans now, too. [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8741.8s)]
*  They're trying to attach, [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8743.22s)]
*  there was some paper that I was reading [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8745.06s)]
*  that was trying to attach cooking oils with cancer, [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8746.22s)]
*  specific kinds of cooking oils in colon cancer. [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8748.66s)]
*  Specific types of seed oils that things are cooked in, [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8752.9s)]
*  and the prevalence of that, and the human diet, [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8756.179999999998s)]
*  and how it's contributing to cancer. [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8758.56s)]
*  Yeah, well colon cancer's on the rise. [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8760.06s)]
*  Why is this stuff not available in New York? [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8761.859999999999s)]
*  Why can you only do this kind of stuff in Texas? [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8763.82s)]
*  You could do it in New York, I guarantee you. [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8765.539999999999s)]
*  You just don't know the right people. [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8767.019999999999s)]
*  You probably can't do stem cells to the extent, [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8769.019999999999s)]
*  it's like there's not a lot of these clinics [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8771.02s)]
*  because of a lot of FDA regulations, [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8773.220000000001s)]
*  and Utah's a really good state for it. [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8775.34s)]
*  They have much looser regulations. [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8777.44s)]
*  Right. [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8779.62s)]
*  But a lot of people wind up going to Mexico. [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8780.460000000001s)]
*  There's a place in Mexico called [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8782.140000000001s)]
*  the CPI Cellular Performance Institute. [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8783.62s)]
*  A lot of UFC fighters go there [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8786.060000000001s)]
*  because they have an arrangement with the UFC. [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8787.560000000001s)]
*  You could do wild shit down in Mexico. [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8789.9s)]
*  That's what Aaron Rodgers did, right, with his Achilles. [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8791.58s)]
*  He went down there, got the stem cells, he's good to go. [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8793.220000000001s)]
*  Yep, yep. [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8795.140000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8795.98s)]
*  He actually got treated here. [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8796.800000000001s)]
*  He got treated at Waste Well. [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8797.7s)]
*  Right. [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8798.9s)]
*  Aaron Rodgers did. [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8799.74s)]
*  So I should just go. [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8801.26s)]
*  Yeah, you definitely should. [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8802.26s)]
*  If I had known that you had that issue, [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8803.3s)]
*  I would have gotten you in early this morning. [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8804.9s)]
*  Oh, thank you. [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8806.26s)]
*  Fuck, I'll come back. [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8807.86s)]
*  Yeah, Ron White actually just went [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8808.9s)]
*  and he heard himself doing yoga. [[02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8810.94s)]
*  And he fucked up his ankle. [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8813.6s)]
*  They just treated him. [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8815.3s)]
*  And now he's good. [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8816.26s)]
*  Well, he just got it yesterday. [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8817.3s)]
*  It's gonna take a while before it's better. [[02:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8818.62s)]
*  But it will get you better, [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8820.62s)]
*  a lot quicker than not having it, that's for damn sure. [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8821.94s)]
*  I know a lot of people that have had [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8825.82s)]
*  pretty serious issues cleared up with stem cells. [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8827.42s)]
*  Like torn Achilles. [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8829.3s)]
*  Yeah, torn ligaments, as long as it's not fully torn. [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8830.46s)]
*  No, no. [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8833.22s)]
*  Then you definitely need surgery. [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8834.259999999998s)]
*  Achilles is a bad one, because it's like, [[02:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8836.179999999998s)]
*  God, there's so much torque on that when you're moving. [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8837.9s)]
*  And then they gotta screw it back down to your bone, [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8840.82s)]
*  and then it's gotta heal and make sure [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8843.22s)]
*  you strengthen it enough before you start using it. [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8845.06s)]
*  So you have to be real diligent about your rehab. [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8847.38s)]
*  Look how long it took Aaron Rodgers. [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8849.779999999999s)]
*  He has state of the art access to Waste Well. [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8851.179999999998s)]
*  And he was way ahead of the curve, [[02:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8854.5s)]
*  way ahead of what it takes most people to do. [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8856.619999999999s)]
*  But even then, he couldn't really play play that year. [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8860.06s)]
*  He had to wait until it was the next season. [[02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8863.02s)]
*  Those used to be career ending. [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8865.86s)]
*  Yep. [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8867.34s)]
*  And now it's good. [[02:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8868.18s)]
*  Yeah, because I've been doing calf exercises [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8871.58s)]
*  and strengthening all around, [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8873.7s)]
*  and it's just a year and a half. [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8875.14s)]
*  I'm like, dude, the pain is still there [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8876.58s)]
*  if I explode too much. [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8878.26s)]
*  It's also, I mean, what am I gonna do? [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8881.460000000001s)]
*  I got horrific feet, Joe. [[02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8882.78s)]
*  My feet are horrific, my toes cross over, I have no arches. [[02:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8884.26s)]
*  I have feet that look like they should be shoved [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8887.980000000001s)]
*  into high heels. [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8889.74s)]
*  And that's what it is. [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8890.58s)]
*  Have you ever worked out with barefoot shoes? [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8891.42s)]
*  You know those like minimalist, like Vigo? [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8893.380000000001s)]
*  They have to custom make them for his feet. [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8894.9s)]
*  Yeah, when you put your toe into each individual hole. [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8896.78s)]
*  No, no, I don't mean that. [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8899.380000000001s)]
*  You can get those too. [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8901.26s)]
*  Those are like the barefoot shoes. [[02:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8902.54s)]
*  Those are- [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8904.7s)]
*  Those help? [[02:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8905.54s)]
*  Yeah, those are okay. [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8906.36s)]
*  Those are good, the toe shoes. [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8907.380000000001s)]
*  I used to have those. [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8909.02s)]
*  But the ones I really like are they have a wide toe box [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8910.66s)]
*  so your feet spread out and there's very minimal [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8913.74s)]
*  amount of sole, just to kind of protect you [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8916.62s)]
*  from sharp things you stand on. [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8918.460000000001s)]
*  But it allows your toes to move as individual units. [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8920.18s)]
*  So a regular shoe acts as like a cast. [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8924.380000000001s)]
*  Like if you have like a thick sole boot [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8927.26s)]
*  and like a hard surface your foot sits on, [[02:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8930.140000000001s)]
*  it's like a cast. [[02:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8932.08s)]
*  So your toes aren't really working. [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8933.160000000002s)]
*  Your legs are picking it up, but your foot [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8934.42s)]
*  is basically atrophying inside that. [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8936.62s)]
*  And then if you work out barefoot, [[02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8938.94s)]
*  and especially if you work out [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8941.140000000001s)]
*  and you do something explosive like jumping [[02:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8942.820000000002s)]
*  and stuff with barefoot, then you're using your feet [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8945.380000000001s)]
*  the way they're supposed to be used. [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8947.98s)]
*  All the muscles strengthen. [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8949.1s)]
*  A lot of people have very, very weak feet. [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8950.94s)]
*  Yeah, I can't even move my toes individually. [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8953.26s)]
*  Like if you like Chris move your toe, I'll go like this. [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8955.22s)]
*  You can't do this? [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8957.06s)]
*  No, I can't do it. [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8957.9s)]
*  Wow, that's crazy. [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8958.72s)]
*  I mean, yeah, it's like, you know, it's horrible. [[02:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8960.34s)]
*  You should probably take care of that before it gets bad. [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8962.34s)]
*  See? [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8964.42s)]
*  Yeah, it's the only good- [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8965.26s)]
*  Go ahead and ask me to move my toe. [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8966.1s)]
*  Say move my toe. [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8967.42s)]
*  Say Chris, move your toe. [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8968.26s)]
*  Somebody say it. [[02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8969.22s)]
*  Move your toes. [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8970.06s)]
*  You have basketball feet like I do. [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8970.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8972.02s)]
*  That's all I could do, you see? [[02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8972.86s)]
*  I like that too. [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8973.720000000001s)]
*  Did you play a lot of basketball? [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8974.56s)]
*  I did, yeah. [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8975.52s)]
*  Maybe that's it. [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8976.36s)]
*  I did. [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8977.18s)]
*  Maybe it's all that like smushing in the shoe. [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8978.02s)]
*  It could be. [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8979.56s)]
*  Is that what it is, Jamie? [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8980.4s)]
*  Oh yeah, definitely. [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8981.24s)]
*  I had to wear extra pairs of socks, [[02:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8982.48s)]
*  like up until I was 18. [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8984.44s)]
*  Yeah, put that fucking hoof back in the sheath. [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8985.28s)]
*  But then you see on the ankle here, [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8987.44s)]
*  I got up a little bony. [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8989.08s)]
*  That's where it's fucked up. [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8991.04s)]
*  But I do have good hamstring flexibility, not bad. [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8991.960000000001s)]
*  That's not bad, congratulations on that. [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8993.960000000001s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=8995.64s)]
*  The Bronze Frieder, evil looking. [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9000.12s)]
*  He hasn't been playing, right? [[02:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9002.68s)]
*  Did he come back to the NBA yet? [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9003.72s)]
*  He came back, he just missed two games. [[02:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9004.56s)]
*  Oh. [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9005.96s)]
*  He's coming back? [[02:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9006.8s)]
*  What happened? [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9007.88s)]
*  Did he get hurt? [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9009.24s)]
*  Whatever, who knows? [[02:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9010.279999999999s)]
*  He needed to get time to get his body ready. [[02:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9011.32s)]
*  Oh, that's right, the meant, yeah, yeah, time out. [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9012.88s)]
*  Who knows, dude. [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9015.039999999999s)]
*  Who knows? [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9015.88s)]
*  Anybody who takes out of anything now, [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9016.72s)]
*  people are like, did he? [[02:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9018.48s)]
*  Does everybody trust a Lincoln to did? [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9019.4s)]
*  Yeah, like a diddy party. [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9020.24s)]
*  It's crazy, dude. [[02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9021.519999999999s)]
*  Yeah, imagine him regretting saying, [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9022.359999999999s)]
*  there's his feet. [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9025.119999999999s)]
*  Oh, damn, dude. [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9026.279999999999s)]
*  Just smashed up. [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9028.08s)]
*  I mean, that pinky toe is brutes. [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9029.119999999999s)]
*  A lot of kickboxers have feet like that, too. [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9030.88s)]
*  Feet all fucked up. [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9034.24s)]
*  Brutal. [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9035.08s)]
*  Imagine how many, [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9035.92s)]
*  you think about kickboxers, how many elbows they've kicked. [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9037.24s)]
*  Like, John Jones can't even fight [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9039.439999999999s)]
*  unless he has his big toe on his left foot [[02:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9040.92s)]
*  taped to his next toe. [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9043.199999999999s)]
*  He has to have it taped up [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9045.4s)]
*  because he tore his toe completely upside down [[02:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9046.4s)]
*  when he was beating up Chael Sonnen. [[02:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9049.72s)]
*  And he didn't realize it until I was interviewing him [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9051.439999999999s)]
*  after the fight, and then he looks down and sees his toe, [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9054.08s)]
*  he's like, oh, he freaks out and he has to sit down. [[02:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9055.88s)]
*  The adrenaline, he didn't even feel it. [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9058.599999999999s)]
*  Didn't even feel it. [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9059.88s)]
*  His toe was upside down. [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9061.56s)]
*  Like, the bottom of his toe was facing up. [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9062.4s)]
*  It was horrible. [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9064.0s)]
*  I would probably say one-on-one him, anyone in history, [[02:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9065.199999999999s)]
*  just because of how skilled he is. [[02:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9069.08s)]
*  That's what his foot looked like. [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9071.72s)]
*  Oh, damn. [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9072.56s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9073.4s)]
*  Yeah, bro. [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9074.24s)]
*  Yo. [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9075.439999999999s)]
*  It was crazy. [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9076.279999999999s)]
*  So you noticed it first, though? [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9077.099999999999s)]
*  No, I think he did. [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9078.199999999999s)]
*  I think he noticed it. [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9079.24s)]
*  I think he looked down. [[02:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9080.08s)]
*  Oh, God. [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9081.279999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he destroyed his toe. [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9082.119999999999s)]
*  So what happened, it twisted all the way around? [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9083.56s)]
*  That's from the force of beating the fuck out of Chael Sonnen. [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9085.24s)]
*  That's what that's from. [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9088.519999999999s)]
*  Like, ground and pound when he had him on the ground, [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9089.52s)]
*  just smashing down on him. [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9091.36s)]
*  Somebody isolated the moment his toe curls over. [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9093.92s)]
*  You could see it in the replay. [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9096.6s)]
*  Moment of his toe, just the amount of torque [[02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9098.560000000001s)]
*  he was putting on to try to kill Chael Sonnen. [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9100.480000000001s)]
*  Is he doing proria or aspenol? [[02:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9102.76s)]
*  Aspenol. [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9106.84s)]
*  I think it's gonna be aspenol. [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9107.68s)]
*  I think they're trying to come to some sort of an agreement. [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9109.0s)]
*  The rumor is that he wants $30 million [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9111.960000000001s)]
*  and the UFC's gonna pay it, hopefully. [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9114.720000000001s)]
*  I hope they pay it. [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9117.880000000001s)]
*  I agree with him. [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9118.72s)]
*  Him and proria would be the fight. [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9119.679999999998s)]
*  Pereira. [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9121.4s)]
*  Pereira, sorry. [[02:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9122.24s)]
*  Would be the fight everyone wants to see. [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9123.359999999999s)]
*  Perhaps. [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9125.48s)]
*  Because he's been so dominant that- [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9126.32s)]
*  Yeah, perhaps. [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9127.519999999999s)]
*  I mean, if it's gonna happen, they're both 37. [[02:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9128.72s)]
*  It should probably happen soon. [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9130.84s)]
*  But John is the heavyweight champion of the world [[02:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9132.519999999999s)]
*  and Pereira has challengers in the light heavyweight division, [[02:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9136.279999999999s)]
*  especially Ankaliyev. [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9138.76s)]
*  He's supposed to be fighting Ankaliyev. [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9140.199999999999s)]
*  Ankaliyev is fucking very dangerous. [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9141.679999999998s)]
*  And he's, I think he's the number one contender. [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9144.519999999999s)]
*  And he's been on a winning streak for a long ass time. [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9147.12s)]
*  He's only got one draw. [[02:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9149.720000000001s)]
*  And that was to Jan Blachowicz, who was the former champion. [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9151.240000000002s)]
*  So he's like at the top of the heap [[02:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9154.720000000001s)]
*  and he's been waiting for a title shot for a long time, [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9156.84s)]
*  but he's been talking a lot of shit [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9158.720000000001s)]
*  and Alex doesn't like that he talks shit. [[02:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9160.04s)]
*  So he's like, fuck him, make him wait. [[02:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9162.720000000001s)]
*  And so I think Alex just said that he's gonna fight in March [[02:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9164.800000000001s)]
*  and that he's not gonna fight Ankaliyev. [[02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9168.52s)]
*  Because if he's fighting in March, when is Ramadan? [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9171.04s)]
*  You're asking the wrong guy. [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9174.240000000002s)]
*  I thought he was gonna say yeah. [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9175.720000000001s)]
*  I thought you would know. [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9177.84s)]
*  I think it's in the summer. [[02:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9179.96s)]
*  February 28th. [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9181.16s)]
*  So he wouldn't be able to fight, [[02:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9182.96s)]
*  Ankaliyev wouldn't be able to fight in March. [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9185.16s)]
*  Because if it's like March 3rd [[02:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9187.16s)]
*  and he's gotta go through the entire month of Ramadan [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9189.24s)]
*  preparing for a world title fight, [[02:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9191.32s)]
*  February 28th and it ends Saturday, March 29th. [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9193.76s)]
*  So that's exactly during the time period [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9196.84s)]
*  where he's gonna fight. [[02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9199.52s)]
*  And with Ramadan, for the whole month, [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9201.84s)]
*  you can only drink water? [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9203.16s)]
*  No, no, no. [[02:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9204.36s)]
*  You definitely could drink water and you could eat food [[02:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9206.16s)]
*  but you could only do it after sundown. [[02:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9208.44s)]
*  So Bilal Mohammed, who's the UFC welterweight champion, [[02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9210.52s)]
*  he observes Ramadan and he was training and fighting. [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9214.560000000001s)]
*  He'd have to take a fight during Ramadan [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9219.0s)]
*  so what he would do is he would get up at like 4.30 [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9221.08s)]
*  in the morning before it was dark out, [[02:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9223.36s)]
*  before it was light out rather, [[02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9225.28s)]
*  and he'd have a big meal. [[02:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9226.240000000002s)]
*  And then he would go to the gym [[02:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9227.720000000001s)]
*  and then he would have no water at the gym, nothing. [[02:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9229.68s)]
*  And then at the end of the day, [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9233.720000000001s)]
*  and also he also didn't sleep during the day. [[02:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9235.36s)]
*  Like a lot of them, like their hack of that [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9237.84s)]
*  is they just sleep during the day [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9240.84s)]
*  and train and eat at night. [[02:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9242.24s)]
*  But he said that if you do that, [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9243.36s)]
*  then you miss out on the religious suffering [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9244.84s)]
*  which he thinks is very important for Ramadan. [[02:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9246.48s)]
*  So he would do it the way you're supposed to do it [[02:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9248.68s)]
*  where he worked out with no water, trained. [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9250.56s)]
*  And then he would finally get to the nighttime session, [[02:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9253.800000000001s)]
*  he'd be able to eat and then have a nighttime training [[02:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9257.12s)]
*  session like a little later than normal. [[02:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9259.800000000001s)]
*  And so that's how he would do his day. [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9261.76s)]
*  That's why these dudes are dominating. [[02:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9264.4s)]
*  They're just tougher. [[02:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9265.4s)]
*  He started working with the Dagestani guys, right? [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9266.8s)]
*  And then they just turned into a beast. [[02:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9269.0s)]
*  Well, those guys are hard fucking core. [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9270.92s)]
*  They want no distractions, no women, no bullshit. [[02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9274.32s)]
*  Get off your phone, let's go to work. [[02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9277.32s)]
*  They're probably not jerking off, if we're being honest. [[02:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9279.279999999999s)]
*  Probably. [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9281.359999999999s)]
*  They keep fuel, they keep it loaded up. [[02:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9282.199999999999s)]
*  Keep a loaded glue gun. [[02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9283.48s)]
*  That's something about having a loaded glue gun, right? [[02:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9287.039999999999s)]
*  When you're going into the ring, [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9289.08s)]
*  you wanna be glued up full of glue. [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9289.92s)]
*  Some people believe that, yeah. [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9291.38s)]
*  Some people believe that you're not supposed to ejaculate [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9293.52s)]
*  within a couple weeks of a big fight. [[02:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9295.2s)]
*  Didn't you not masturbate out of respect at 9-11? [[02:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9297.12s)]
*  That is true. [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9299.720000000001s)]
*  What was it? [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9300.560000000001s)]
*  Well, I wanted to go until we found [[02:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9301.400000000001s)]
*  Bin Laden, the perpetrator, but obviously that was too long. [[02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9303.6s)]
*  But I did go until October 1st. [[02:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9305.6s)]
*  From 9-11 to October 1, I said, [[02:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9307.12s)]
*  as of my respect back to this country, [[02:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9309.160000000002s)]
*  and patriotism, I'm not gonna glue at all [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9311.560000000001s)]
*  until we get out of this month of September. [[02:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9313.560000000001s)]
*  Didn't Louie have a joke about it? [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9315.2s)]
*  He waited until the second tower fell. [[02:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9316.52s)]
*  Probably. [[02:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9319.560000000001s)]
*  Like he jerked off. [[02:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9320.400000000001s)]
*  It's funny. [[02:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9322.24s)]
*  I think it was a joke. [[02:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9323.08s)]
*  He didn't make it until the second tower fell. [[02:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9324.68s)]
*  Dude, I remember there was like a vigil, [[02:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9329.0s)]
*  like on September 18th or whatever, [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9330.76s)]
*  like a week later in my neighborhood, [[02:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9332.68s)]
*  and I was playing basketball as a basketball player, [[02:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9334.48s)]
*  and I was playing in the park. [[02:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9336.8s)]
*  And I remember when I left, [[02:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9338.6s)]
*  everyone was just standing outside their house [[02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9339.76s)]
*  with American flags and candles, [[02:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9341.28s)]
*  and I wouldn't dribble my basketball, [[02:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9343.08s)]
*  because I was like, I think, a sound [[02:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9345.039999999999s)]
*  or any type of dribble of a ball. [[02:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9346.6s)]
*  Disrespectful. [[02:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9347.88s)]
*  Disrespectful. [[02:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9348.72s)]
*  And then a guy gave me a flag, [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9349.64s)]
*  like as I was walking, as if to say, [[02:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9351.92s)]
*  take one of these as you're walking home, [[02:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9353.48s)]
*  and I just walked with that flag. [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9354.88s)]
*  I love our fucking country, big, Joe. [[02:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9356.68s)]
*  I just love it, and I hate when people talk shit about it. [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9360.92s)]
*  Well, get ready. [[02:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9364.08s)]
*  Yeah, it's gummin'. [[02:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9365.24s)]
*  We got some drones. [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9366.8s)]
*  Listen to Joy Reid. [[02:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9367.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9368.76s)]
*  We should try to swap those things out of the air. [[02:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9369.6s)]
*  What do you think they are, if you had a guess? [[02:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9371.92s)]
*  I think they are, I was joking about the AI thing, [[02:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9373.72s)]
*  I think they're Chinese. [[02:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9377.199999999999s)]
*  I don't want to say this in such a big pocket. [[02:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9379.4s)]
*  I'm available to the CCP for whatever they need me to do. [[02:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9381.92s)]
*  Disinformation will do it. [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9385.24s)]
*  I think that they are sniffing the radiation. [[02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9386.6s)]
*  I think that that's the most plausible, [[02:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9388.48s)]
*  that I don't know if they know about it or not, [[02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9390.279999999999s)]
*  but I think they're probably looking for radiation. [[02:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9392.279999999999s)]
*  I don't know if that nuke's necessarily going off, [[02:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9393.8s)]
*  but I think that's probably what it is, [[02:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9396.039999999999s)]
*  if I had to just guess, if I really had to guess. [[02:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9397.64s)]
*  Well. [[02:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9400.64s)]
*  I think they're being launched from submarines underwater. [[02:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9401.48s)]
*  Yes. [[02:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9404.199999999999s)]
*  Well, that's what's crazy, is like, if that's the case, [[02:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9405.039999999999s)]
*  how many submarines and how big are these submarines, [[02:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9407.36s)]
*  because these things are the size of an SUV, [[02:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9409.76s)]
*  and some of them were coming from some [[02:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9411.68s)]
*  like untrackable distance offshore, 50 plus miles offshore, [[02:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9414.6s)]
*  and they're the size of an SUV, [[02:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9419.6s)]
*  and they can stay in the air for five hours. [[02:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9421.039999999999s)]
*  So what's the power source? [[02:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9422.72s)]
*  And then the other problem is they're not, [[02:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9424.44s)]
*  they don't exhibit a heat signature like a regular drone does. [[02:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9426.68s)]
*  So do they have some sort of cooling? [[02:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9429.52s)]
*  Is that why they can't track them? [[02:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9431.24s)]
*  Yeah, they're having a hard time tracking them [[02:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9432.32s)]
*  because of that, like they're having a hard time [[02:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9433.52s)]
*  tracking them with infrared. [[02:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9434.96s)]
*  They don't know why they can stay in the sky [[02:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9436.52s)]
*  for five hours at a time. [[02:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9438.12s)]
*  Ryan Graves, who's a fighter pilot, was on the other day, [[02:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9439.76s)]
*  and he was explaining to us, like, [[02:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9442.36s)]
*  there's certain aspects to some of these drones [[02:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9443.720000000001s)]
*  that are above state of the art. [[02:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9446.68s)]
*  They're doing things that we can't do. [[02:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9448.92s)]
*  The big one is the flying for that many hours. [[02:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9450.4s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9453.800000000001s)]

*  So what you're concentrating on is the one [[02:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9648.3s)]
*  on the lower right. [[02:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9649.86s)]

*  Like literally, dude, that's a ear in the sky right there. [[02:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9653.06s)]
*  So it's moving. [[02:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9657.3s)]

*  Shut up, shut up. [[02:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9659.26s)]

*  There's no tail. [[02:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9662.54s)]
*  That's a UFO. [[02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9663.66s)]
*  There's no blue or red light. [[02:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9664.5s)]
*  Look, something's coming off. [[02:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9665.34s)]
*  What the fuck? [[02:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9668.9s)]
*  So when it gets above, this is where it gets weird. [[02:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9671.7s)]
*  Because it's slowly rising. [[02:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9674.82s)]
*  It gets above that other thing, which might be the moon. [[02:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9677.460000000001s)]
*  I'm not sure what that other thing is. [[02:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9679.78s)]
*  I think it's the moon. [[02:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9681.42s)]
*  So that other thing, it gets above it, and then. [[02:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9682.34s)]
*  Look at the lights going off in two sides. [[02:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9685.5s)]
*  It starts taking off. [[02:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9687.18s)]
*  And when it starts taking off, it does it with no sound. [[02:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9688.82s)]
*  At a fucking insane rate of speed. [[02:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9692.54s)]
*  Like look at that. [[02:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9695.7s)]
*  No fucking way. [[02:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9697.5s)]
*  What the fuck? [[02:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9699.54s)]
*  It just went out to space. [[02:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9700.380000000001s)]
*  It just went out to space. [[02:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9702.1s)]

*  It just went out to space. [[02:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9704.62s)]
*  That's why. [[02:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9705.7s)]
*  Those guys are reacting like they're watching it. [[02:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9706.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9708.140000000001s)]

*  It could be fake. [[02:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9710.1s)]
*  It could be all AI generated. [[02:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9710.86s)]
*  It's ambiguous and blurry enough though [[02:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9712.54s)]
*  that I'm willing to entertain it. [[02:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9715.34s)]
*  If that's really what they saw, [[02:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9717.1s)]
*  that's a bunch of different people [[02:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9718.42s)]
*  seeing things like that over time. [[02:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9719.86s)]
*  And this is like the Tic Tac story. [[02:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9722.660000000002s)]
*  This is the one that Ryan Graves showed us [[02:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9725.18s)]

*  That these things, and they've seen it on, [[02:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9729.78s)]
*  this is one that was, this was seen by multiple people [[02:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9732.18s)]
*  from different planes that this thing moved [[02:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9735.5s)]
*  and then shot off into space. [[02:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9738.42s)]
*  And this lady got photos of it. [[02:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9739.86s)]
*  But whatever that thing's doing, [[02:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9741.42s)]
*  it's doing something that we can't do. [[02:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9743.380000000001s)]
*  That speed that that thing takes off, [[02:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9745.34s)]
*  that's faster than any rocket we have. [[02:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9747.7s)]
*  That's faster than any fighter jet. [[02:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9750.02s)]
*  That thing just shoots off into space [[02:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9751.86s)]
*  at some impossible speed. [[02:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9754.46s)]
*  So it's either us, the drones are either, [[02:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9757.58s)]
*  why are they blinking if it's not us? [[02:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9760.14s)]
*  Why do they have- [[02:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9761.779999999999s)]
*  That one wasn't blinking. [[02:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9762.619999999999s)]
*  No, but I mean the drones. [[02:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9763.46s)]
*  I'm saying the drones are blinking. [[02:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9764.279999999999s)]
*  So I'm saying if the drones are ours, [[02:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9765.66s)]
*  maybe there's been like UFO activity [[02:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9767.82s)]
*  and they're throwing these drones up [[02:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9771.66s)]
*  to try to capture it with a better- [[02:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9773.22s)]
*  Or what better way to distract people from actual UFOs [[02:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9775.619999999999s)]
*  that you know are gonna be all over the sky [[02:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9780.179999999998s)]
*  than to put a bunch of drones up there too. [[02:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9781.58s)]
*  That too. [[02:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9783.98s)]
*  Yeah, if you have a bunch of shit [[02:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9784.82s)]
*  that seems like stuff that you've seen, [[02:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9786.18s)]
*  like a drone flying around, [[02:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9788.7s)]
*  and then there's stuff that is impossible with it, [[02:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9791.86s)]
*  that's a good way to cover up the impossible stuff. [[02:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9794.98s)]
*  Have a bunch of regular drones. [[02:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9797.5s)]
*  Yeah, but at this point, why would they do that? [[02:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9799.26s)]
*  Everyone's already accepted the fact [[02:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9801.02s)]
*  that UFOs are out there. [[02:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9802.58s)]
*  Not really. [[02:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9804.42s)]
*  If there was a big thing where all of a sudden [[02:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9805.26s)]
*  the sky was filled with football field size, [[02:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9807.619999999999s)]
*  fucking motherships, people would lose their shit. [[02:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9810.78s)]
*  But if you could slowly get people accustomed to it, [[02:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9814.52s)]
*  the way people got accustomed to masks, [[02:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9816.56s)]
*  in the beginning, in 2019, [[02:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9819.4s)]
*  if you saw someone with a mask on, [[02:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9821.880000000001s)]
*  you'd be like, what the fuck is going on? [[02:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9823.32s)]
*  By 2021, why doesn't this guy have a mask on? [[02:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9824.84s)]
*  Just in a couple of years, everybody was wearing a mask. [[02:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9828.16s)]
*  We get accustomed to stuff. [[02:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9831.2s)]
*  If you get accustomed to things being in the sky, [[02:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9832.56s)]
*  and then all of a sudden there's nothing, [[02:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9834.92s)]
*  you could float anything in the sky. [[02:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9837.56s)]
*  If you have weirder and weirder drones [[02:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9839.68s)]
*  and then start showing spaceships, [[02:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9842.160000000002s)]
*  people would freak out way less. [[02:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9844.160000000002s)]
*  Right. [[02:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9846.02s)]
*  I don't know, dude. [[02:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9846.86s)]
*  If someone tells me this is a drone, chill. [[02:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9847.800000000001s)]
*  And if someone shows me a football field size spacecraft, [[02:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9850.08s)]
*  I'm gonna freak out. [[02:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9853.480000000001s)]
*  That's a big leap. [[02:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9854.320000000002s)]
*  In a good way. [[02:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9855.28s)]
*  But what about one the size of a car [[02:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9856.1s)]
*  that's definitely not ours? [[02:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9858.28s)]
*  So you think they're just doling them out by size? [[02:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9859.92s)]
*  If I was gonna do that, [[02:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9862.400000000001s)]
*  if I was gonna get people prepared for an imminent invasion, [[02:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9863.92s)]
*  like if I knew that there was UFOs on the way, [[02:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9867.28s)]
*  we're working at the James Webb Telescope [[02:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9871.02s)]
*  and we get a photo of a mothership [[02:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9872.9s)]
*  and it's heading towards us, [[02:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9875.82s)]
*  gonna be here in four months. [[02:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9876.78s)]
*  What would you do? [[02:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9878.3s)]
*  Well, if I knew that they were going to be sending drones [[02:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9879.22s)]
*  and probes into our atmosphere, [[02:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9882.78s)]
*  and maybe they've already done that, [[02:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9884.58s)]
*  to obscure that, I would put a bunch of our drones up there [[02:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9886.06s)]
*  and have them hover over cities [[02:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9889.619999999999s)]
*  so it doesn't freak people out [[02:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9891.4s)]
*  because you know that that's coming. [[02:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9892.66s)]
*  I mean, being freaked out is probably the least [[02:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9893.699999999999s)]
*  of our problems when they come. [[02:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9896.1s)]
*  Well. If they're coming. [[02:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9897.74s)]
*  Collapse of civil society is really possible [[02:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9898.76s)]
*  if aliens show up. [[02:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9902.84s)]
*  Like if they just instantaneously showed up, [[02:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9904.66s)]
*  things could completely collapse [[02:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9908.08s)]
*  if we knew that our leaders are just nothing [[02:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9909.9s)]
*  compared to these new things that are visiting us [[02:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9912.64s)]
*  from some other place [[02:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9915.16s)]
*  and doing things that are impossible with our technology. [[02:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9916.04s)]
*  We're helpless. [[02:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9918.960000000001s)]
*  We're lost, we're confused. [[02:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9919.98s)]
*  They could shut down nuclear power plants. [[02:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9921.16s)]
*  They can shut down the grid. [[02:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9922.960000000001s)]
*  They can shut down any weapon systems that we have. [[02:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9925.5s)]
*  Instantaneously, power goes off. [[02:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9928.859999999999s)]
*  If all those stories are true, [[02:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9930.619999999999s)]
*  the best way to keep people from absolutely freaking out [[02:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9933.419999999998s)]
*  is to slowly trickle it in on them [[02:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9935.9s)]
*  and get them more and more accustomed to this. [[02:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9937.619999999999s)]
*  Like as a Psy-op. [[02:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9939.64s)]
*  How committed are you to this theory? [[02:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9941.619999999999s)]
*  Not very. [[02:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9943.58s)]
*  Not very. [[02:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9944.419999999998s)]
*  I go all over the place. [[02:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9945.64s)]
*  I think according to someone that I spoke to, [[02:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9947.439999999999s)]
*  and this is someone who has high level clearance [[02:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9952.08s)]
*  and someone who worked for the government in this capacity, [[02:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9955.52s)]
*  he said some of these are not, they're not human. [[02:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9959.16s)]
*  They're not exhibiting, whatever they are, [[02:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9962.56s)]
*  they're exhibiting technology [[02:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9964.8s)]
*  that is far beyond what we're capable of. [[02:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9966.84s)]
*  And then there's other ones like Ryan Graves said [[02:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9969.68s)]
*  that are beyond state of the art, [[02:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9972.02s)]
*  but you can kind of sort of get that they would be a drone, [[02:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9973.44s)]
*  but how is it in the air for five hours? [[02:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9976.58s)]
*  How does it not have a heat signature? [[02:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9979.32s)]
*  How does it know when other drones are coming near it, [[02:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9981.960000000001s)]
*  when they're flying jets near it, [[02:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9985.36s)]
*  and they just shut the lights off and disappear? [[02:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9986.480000000001s)]
*  These things are just shutting off. [[02:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9988.78s)]
*  Oh dude, so this isn't, they're alien. [[02:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9990.320000000002s)]
*  Maybe they're alien drones. [[02:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9992.08s)]
*  It's possible. [[02:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9993.36s)]
*  Fuck. [[02:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9994.2s)]
*  Maybe they're just alien drones. [[02:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9995.02s)]
*  Also, if you were an alien [[02:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9995.86s)]
*  and you wanted to get people accustomed to this [[02:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9996.92s)]
*  without freaking out, wouldn't you start sending drones [[02:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=9998.740000000002s)]
*  that are similar to what we have, [[02:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10001.220000000001s)]
*  but just many levels better? [[02:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10003.480000000001s)]
*  But similar enough, so you go, oh I know what that is. [[02:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10006.0s)]
*  Or they could just like get on the TV and get like, [[02:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10008.560000000001s)]
*  hey dudes, we're chill. [[02:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10011.92s)]
*  But they probably, if they could get here, [[02:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10013.12s)]
*  they know how to speak our language, [[02:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10014.84s)]
*  and they just go, hey dudes, we're chill. [[02:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10016.160000000002s)]
*  They can morph. [[02:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10017.880000000001s)]
*  We're coming here, or they just go, hey guys, it's over. [[02:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10018.720000000001s)]
*  We're gonna use, we're gonna, [[02:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10021.2s)]
*  like you guys have seen The Matrix? [[02:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10022.560000000001s)]
*  We're about to use you for some sort of fuel. [[02:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10024.04s)]
*  Whatever they're gonna do. [[02:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10026.720000000001s)]
*  Or maybe they're not gonna be mean to us at all. [[02:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10027.560000000001s)]
*  That's possible too. [[02:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10029.28s)]
*  If they're that intelligent, they're not mean. [[02:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10030.160000000002s)]
*  They're not mean. [[02:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10032.960000000001s)]
*  People who- You mean like us? [[02:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10033.800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, we're not. [[02:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10034.640000000001s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[02:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10035.480000000001s)]
*  Or maybe the prison planet thing I said [[02:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10036.480000000001s)]
*  in the beginning of the show, this is how it happens. [[02:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10038.36s)]
*  Well, you ever heard Bob Lazar talk about [[02:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10040.0s)]
*  one of the most disturbing things that he found? [[02:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10041.76s)]
*  What? No. [[02:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10043.8s)]
*  One of the most disturbing things [[02:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10044.8s)]
*  when he was doing the back engineering program [[02:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10045.98s)]
*  on this supposed crashed alien spaceship [[02:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10047.82s)]
*  or recovered alien spaceship [[02:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10050.12s)]
*  was that they had a thick binder that was about religion. [[02:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10052.12s)]
*  And the thing, we'll have him play it. [[02:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10056.36s)]
*  We'll have him play it. [[02:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10059.2s)]
*  Because it's one of those ones we've played a few times. [[02:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10060.04s)]
*  But it's, the Bob Lazar story is the craziest. [[02:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10061.84s)]
*  Because if he was telling the truth, [[02:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10065.04s)]
*  and it seems like he's definitely telling the truth [[02:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10066.72s)]
*  about a lot, he definitely worked at Los Alamos [[02:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10068.12s)]
*  and he was on the labs, he was on the employee roster. [[02:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10070.96s)]
*  He has a detailed understanding of the building. [[02:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10071.96s)]
*  He knew all the security people when they took him there. [[02:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10073.8s)]
*  When George Knapp took him on a tour through there. [[02:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10075.759999999998s)]
*  He definitely worked there. [[02:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10078.16s)]
*  And he definitely was a propulsions expert. [[02:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10079.56s)]
*  And he says they hired him to go [[02:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10082.4s)]
*  and try to figure out this fucking thing. [[02:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10084.679999999998s)]
*  Here, listen to this. [[02:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10087.039999999999s)]
*  The hardcore thing is that there is [[02:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10087.88s)]
*  an extremely classified document dealing with religion [[02:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10089.199999999999s)]
*  and it's about that thing, period. [[02:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10093.0s)]
*  But why would there be any classified material [[02:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10095.679999999998s)]
*  dealing with religion? [[02:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10098.480000000001s)]
*  I wanna go back to the religion thing. [[02:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10101.2s)]
*  I want you to say it. [[02:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10102.76s)]
*  It's just, it's so far out. [[02:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10105.720000000001s)]
*  All right, your objection has been noted. [[02:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10108.800000000001s)]
*  Okay. What does it say? [[02:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10110.800000000001s)]
*  That we're containers. [[02:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10113.6s)]
*  That's how supposedly the aliens look at us. [[02:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10114.76s)]
*  That we are nothing but containers. [[02:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10118.720000000001s)]
*  Containers of? [[02:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10120.28s)]
*  Containers. [[02:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10121.44s)]
*  Maybe containers of souls. [[02:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10123.6s)]
*  You can come up with whatever theory you want. [[02:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10124.84s)]
*  That we're containers. [[02:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10127.12s)]
*  And that's how we're mentioned in the documents. [[02:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10128.08s)]
*  That religion was specifically created [[02:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10131.6s)]
*  so we have some rules and regulations [[02:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10134.52s)]
*  for the sole purpose of not damaging the containers. [[02:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10136.08s)]
*  That's George Knapp, by the way. [[02:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10140.12s)]
*  Shout out to George Knapp. [[02:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10142.6s)]
*  I mean, too freaked out. [[02:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10143.720000000001s)]
*  But it's, but it's kind of what you were talking about. [[02:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10144.960000000001s)]
*  The prison planet theory doesn't seem so crazy [[02:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10147.44s)]
*  if the advanced alien race is eating our negative emotions. [[02:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10149.960000000001s)]
*  Just don't be negative and you'll be saved. [[02:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10152.400000000001s)]
*  Dude, just be happy. [[02:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10154.800000000001s)]
*  That's what they've been trying to tell you. [[02:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10155.68s)]
*  Marley, everybody's been trying to tell you this. [[02:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10157.28s)]
*  What is this? [[02:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10158.68s)]
*  Jesus Jamie, what are you showing me here? [[02:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10159.52s)]
*  I believe that video you posted is from April. [[02:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10160.36s)]
*  April 12th, 2024, at Mountain Standard Time [[02:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10163.36s)]
*  in eastern Arizona, off the Black River [[02:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10166.56s)]
*  in the White Mountains, the Fort Apache Indian Reservation. [[02:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10169.48s)]
*  And oh, by the way, my friend Cam Haynes, [[02:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10173.36s)]
*  he hunts at one of the Apache Reservations. [[02:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10176.16s)]
*  He says they see them there all the time. [[02:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10178.64s)]
*  He said they see crazy shit in the sky all the time. [[02:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10181.52s)]
*  These guys are hunting out there [[02:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10184.52s)]
*  in this enormous reservation, [[02:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10186.119999999999s)]
*  like unbelievable, pristine forest land. [[02:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10188.96s)]
*  He said they see crazy shit. [[02:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10192.08s)]
*  And they just accept it, that it's true. [[02:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10194.64s)]
*  Right, I believe that. [[02:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10197.039999999999s)]
*  Most of the guys working there have seen something. [[02:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10198.039999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, I mean, that makes sense to me. [[02:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10200.359999999999s)]
*  That's also where Travis Walton, this guy, [[02:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10202.199999999999s)]
*  that was in Arizona too, wasn't it Jamie? [[02:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10204.4s)]
*  This version of the video, you can almost make out the moon. [[02:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10206.56s)]
*  I don't know if this is better [[02:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10208.8s)]
*  because it's been reposted less, but. [[02:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10210.16s)]
*  It does look better. [[02:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10212.88s)]
*  It definitely looks better. [[02:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10213.92s)]
*  So this is the same thing. [[02:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10215.519999999999s)]
*  Are you freaked out by this? [[02:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10216.56s)]
*  100%. Yeah. [[02:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10217.679999999998s)]
*  Yeah, but not enough that it's gonna fuck up my day. [[02:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10218.839999999998s)]
*  Yeah. Right, because it freaks me out, [[02:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10221.279999999999s)]
*  but it's not freaking me out like I can't sleep. [[02:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10223.08s)]
*  Right, yeah. It's freaking me out. [[02:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10225.519999999999s)]
*  Like, Ukraine freaks me out where I can't sleep. [[02:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10226.839999999998s)]
*  Yeah. You know, like, [[02:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10229.88s)]
*  that stuff freaks me out. [[02:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10231.08s)]
*  The looking for a nuke in the East Coast, [[02:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10232.439999999999s)]
*  that freaks me out where it'll fuck with my sleep. [[02:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10234.8s)]
*  If I think about that before I go to bed, [[02:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10236.679999999998s)]
*  the one thing that I genuinely, [[02:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10238.72s)]
*  like here it takes off. [[02:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10240.64s)]
*  Let's take a look at it while it's taking off. [[02:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10241.96s)]
*  Wow. [[02:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10243.68s)]
*  And this is the thing. [[02:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10245.32s)]
*  It's like, there's no sound. [[02:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10246.16s)]
*  Look at, look how fast it's going. [[02:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10248.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10250.28s)]
*  Like what could go that fast? [[02:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10251.12s)]
*  What the fuck can go that fast? [[02:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10252.880000000001s)]
*  It's crazy. [[02:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10257.6s)]
*  That is insane. [[02:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10258.44s)]
*  That has to be, I don't wanna guess [[02:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10259.44s)]
*  how many thousands of miles an hour that thing is going, [[02:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10261.880000000001s)]
*  but if you were a person inside, you're jello. [[02:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10264.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10267.52s)]
*  If you're going that fast. [[02:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10268.36s)]
*  Paul Verzi's dad and mom saw it [[02:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10269.4s)]
*  and it was not only the dad, mom, [[02:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10273.08s)]
*  it was like an aunt, they were all there. [[02:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10275.0s)]
*  And I asked his mom, she's like a religious person [[02:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10277.28s)]
*  and she said, yeah. [[02:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10279.52s)]
*  I mean, and they said it was low, had lights on it. [[02:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10280.36s)]
*  The father and the father is, you know, [[02:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10283.24s)]
*  a Bronx Italian guy. [[02:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10284.72s)]
*  And he said he doesn't believe in that stuff. [[02:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10286.16s)]
*  And it was low, like above the tree line. [[02:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10287.88s)]
*  He made it out. [[02:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10289.88s)]
*  It was a saucer. [[02:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10291.0s)]
*  And then he said it shot up [[02:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10292.08s)]
*  and turned into a dot in the sky. [[02:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10293.76s)]
*  And this was in the eighties or something. [[02:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10295.0s)]
*  Do you guys ever hear the Betty and Barney Hill story? [[02:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10295.84s)]
*  No. [[02:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10298.52s)]
*  Betty and Barney Hill were a couple in, [[02:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10299.36s)]
*  I think it was the 1950s. [[02:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10301.880000000001s)]
*  Oh yes, I know this story. [[02:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10304.24s)]
*  They were the first abduction story [[02:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10305.08s)]
*  and they did hypnotic regression [[02:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10307.08s)]
*  and they both had the same story that they were taking. [[02:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10308.960000000001s)]
*  They saw something in the sky, they pulled over their car [[02:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10311.0s)]
*  and then they woke up [[02:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10313.32s)]
*  and they don't know what the fuck happened. [[02:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10314.16s)]
*  But they were haunted by this [[02:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10315.84s)]
*  and they have the hypnotic regression [[02:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10317.04s)]
*  and they tell this crazy story [[02:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10319.04s)]
*  about being taken aboard this craft. [[02:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10320.2s)]
*  It's very similar to Travis Walton's story. [[02:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10322.08s)]
*  It's very similar to a bunch of stories of abduction. [[02:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10323.84s)]
*  And what is this, like they get tested on? [[02:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10327.2s)]
*  Like, or they just don't remember anything? [[02:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10329.4s)]
*  You know, it's hard to say [[02:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10330.72s)]
*  when you're dealing with hypnotic, [[02:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10332.56s)]
*  because the thing about these, [[02:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10335.08s)]
*  when you're recalling things through hypnosis [[02:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10337.16s)]
*  is like people are very susceptible [[02:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10339.8s)]
*  to someone imparting a memory into them. [[02:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10342.24s)]
*  So you'd have to know like what was the process like [[02:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10344.88s)]
*  in which you interviewed these people. [[02:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10348.119999999999s)]
*  But John Mack, who is a psychologist from Harvard [[02:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10349.64s)]
*  wrote a book called Abduction that I read in the 1990s [[02:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10354.199999999999s)]
*  that detailed all the different people that he worked on [[02:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10358.2s)]
*  that he was having these hypnotic regression sessions [[02:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10361.48s)]
*  with these people. [[02:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10365.08s)]
*  And they were all telling these similar stories [[02:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10365.92s)]
*  about being abducted. [[02:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10367.76s)]
*  And that he believed that there was a few people on earth [[02:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10368.88s)]
*  where they would revisit. [[02:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10373.42s)]
*  They would find, just like we do with animals, [[02:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10375.119999999999s)]
*  where we put collars on them, right? [[02:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10377.52s)]
*  They catch like a mountain lion. [[02:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10379.24s)]
*  They'll put a collar on that mountain lion [[02:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10381.28s)]
*  so they can understand where the mountain lion's going, [[02:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10382.84s)]
*  where his terrain is, how they do it with wolves [[02:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10385.4s)]
*  when they relocate them, they put collars on them [[02:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10387.92s)]
*  so they know where they are all the time. [[02:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10389.8s)]
*  And it makes sense that they would probably want [[02:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10392.12s)]
*  to understand us, so they would pick certain ones. [[02:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10395.66s)]
*  And if they had a way to silence your memories [[02:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10399.64s)]
*  and completely put you in some sort of a state [[02:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10403.08s)]
*  where they could manipulate you and take you to some place [[02:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10405.8s)]
*  and do examinations on you and then put you back [[02:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10408.4s)]
*  with no memory of it other than these like weird nightmares, [[02:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10411.5s)]
*  that makes sense. [[02:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10415.28s)]
*  Well, it shows that they're compassionate [[02:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10416.12s)]
*  if they put you back. [[02:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10417.44s)]
*  I guess, or that this is how they study you. [[02:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10418.68s)]
*  They want to know. [[02:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10422.4s)]
*  I mean, there's no stories of them stealing people, right? [[02:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10423.24s)]
*  They always bring you back. [[02:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10425.68s)]
*  But if that's real, what's the purpose of it? [[02:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10427.44s)]
*  What are they doing? [[02:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10431.28s)]
*  I would imagine they're studying us the same. [[02:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10432.32s)]
*  If we could study chimps and the chimps had no idea [[02:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10434.44s)]
*  we studied them, we would do that. [[02:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10437.44s)]
*  Instead, we dart them. [[02:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10439.2s)]
*  We dart them, and then they wake up and they're like, [[02:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10440.380000000001s)]
*  what the fuck? [[02:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10442.12s)]
*  That's how we do it. [[02:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10443.36s)]
*  And they would probably do it in a real similar way, [[02:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10444.560000000001s)]
*  just more sophisticated. [[02:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10446.8s)]
*  How about that other abduction story about those guys? [[02:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10448.039999999999s)]
*  They were like those rural guys in the 70s or something? [[02:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10450.92s)]
*  Travis Walton. [[02:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10453.64s)]
*  Oh, that was him? [[02:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10454.48s)]
*  That's the Arizona story, the lager. [[02:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10455.32s)]
*  Those guys, I believe them. [[02:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10457.08s)]
*  That story is crazy because the other guys in the truck, [[02:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10458.24s)]
*  one of the guys hated him. [[02:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10460.8s)]
*  He got in a fist fight with that guy [[02:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10461.84s)]
*  the day of the abduction. [[02:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10463.24s)]
*  He still told the same story that everybody told. [[02:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10464.8s)]
*  He walked up to this craft. [[02:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10467.119999999999s)]
*  They saw it flying through the air. [[02:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10468.48s)]
*  Wasn't that in Arizona, too? [[02:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10469.92s)]
*  Was the Travis Walton case in Arizona? [[02:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10472.08s)]
*  I believe it was. [[02:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10474.599999999999s)]
*  Arizona's a hot spot for it. [[02:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10475.6s)]
*  I mean, that's the Phoenix Lights. [[02:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10477.16s)]
*  Phoenix Lights was crazy. [[02:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10479.32s)]
*  Crazy, crazy. [[02:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10480.44s)]
*  And a lot of people saw that one. [[02:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10481.880000000001s)]
*  Thousands of people saw it, including the fucking governor. [[02:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10483.08s)]
*  So then why is this one catching on in the news? [[02:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10486.960000000001s)]
*  Because it's more. [[02:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10489.2s)]
*  This is more prevalent, and it's lasting [[02:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10490.4s)]
*  for days and days and days. [[02:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10492.36s)]
*  Got it. [[02:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10494.04s)]
*  And I don't know. [[02:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10494.880000000001s)]
*  I don't know what's going on. [[02:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10495.800000000001s)]
*  Do you think they just want to be there [[02:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10496.640000000001s)]
*  for the inauguration? [[02:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10497.960000000001s)]
*  Ah! [[02:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10499.2s)]
*  Probably. [[02:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10500.16s)]
*  Well, they're really early. [[02:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10501.0s)]
*  They're like fucking tailgating. [[02:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10501.84s)]
*  Yeah, they're tailgating. [[02:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10503.56s)]
*  They're tailgating the inauguration. [[02:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10504.76s)]
*  We're going to be there. [[02:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10505.84s)]
*  We're going to be there. [[02:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10506.68s)]
*  We're going to be close. [[02:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10507.52s)]
*  July. [[02:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10508.359999999999s)]
*  January 18th, we're doing a show in Washington, DC [[02:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10509.359999999999s)]

*  And we're like. [[02:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10516.4s)]
*  Bring a Geiger counter. [[02:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10517.24s)]
*  Well, we said we were like, why 22 days [[02:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10518.08s)]
*  before the inauguration? [[02:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10520.119999999999s)]
*  We were like, what the fuck are we doing? [[02:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10521.0s)]
*  Yeah, we're doing a live, the first live history [[02:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10522.199999999999s)]

*  In DC, it'll be fine. [[02:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10526.92s)]
*  It's a good time to do it. [[02:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10527.76s)]
*  I mean, but we were like fucking. [[02:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10528.6s)]
*  Probably. [[02:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10529.44s)]
*  Who knows? [[02:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10529.72s)]
*  We're doing it on January 21st. [[02:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10530.08s)]
*  That one I wouldn't count on being there. [[02:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10531.4s)]
*  We're doing it at 5 o'clock in the afternoon. [[02:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10533.24s)]

*  You ever do that? [[02:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10536.48s)]
*  You ever do like a 5 PM? [[02:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10537.0s)]
*  No. [[02:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10538.199999999999s)]
*  We think that's where the world's going with like. [[02:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10539.0s)]
*  We don't think people want to be out till midnight 1 AM anymore. [[02:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10541.68s)]
*  What do you think? [[02:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10544.32s)]
*  You think that's stupid? [[02:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10544.84s)]
*  You think earlier shows work? [[02:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10545.88s)]
*  Would you experiment with them? [[02:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10547.64s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, sure. [[02:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10549.48s)]
*  I mean, Bert Kreischer has always done afternoon shows. [[02:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10550.52s)]
*  Like, take the day off work show. [[02:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10553.119999999999s)]
*  He's done a bunch of those. [[02:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10554.44s)]
*  Yeah, Bert's been doing those for years. [[02:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10555.32s)]
*  Calling sick shows. [[02:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10557.119999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10558.72s)]

*  He actually filmed one at the mothership. [[02:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10562.6s)]
*  Oh, I didn't know that. [[02:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10564.44s)]
*  Did some day drinking shows. [[02:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10564.96s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, why not? [[02:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10566.48s)]
*  I mean, the club is there all day long. [[02:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10567.28s)]
*  Why not have shows during the day if you want to? [[02:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10568.68s)]
*  If you want, if you can sell them. [[02:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10570.4s)]
*  Especially it's dark out. [[02:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10571.68s)]
*  If it's the club's dark as shit. [[02:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10573.08s)]
*  It's dark when it's noon. [[02:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10575.28s)]
*  You know? [[02:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10576.72s)]
*  It's like you could totally have the same experience at noon [[02:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10577.36s)]
*  that you could at night. [[02:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10580.76s)]
*  But it seems like at nighttime, people are off work. [[02:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10581.92s)]
*  You get a couple of cocktails. [[02:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10584.84s)]
*  You get a little loose. [[02:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10586.56s)]
*  Sit in the dark. [[02:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10587.68s)]
*  Have a good time. [[02:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10588.6s)]
*  But on a Saturday, sometimes I feel [[02:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10589.76s)]
*  like people just sit around all day and wait for the show. [[02:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10591.12s)]
*  If you can put it at 5 o'clock, why not? [[02:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10593.16s)]
*  Look, that's why they like to go to football games, right? [[02:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10595.04s)]
*  Right. [[02:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10596.960000000001s)]
*  During the afternoon? [[02:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10597.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10598.44s)]
*  I mean, you certainly could. [[02:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10598.880000000001s)]
*  You certainly could have day shows. [[02:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10599.84s)]
*  Especially if you have a big name. [[02:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10601.56s)]
*  You know, if someone, they're willing to do something. [[02:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10603.16s)]
*  Most people like to go out at night. [[02:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10606.36s)]
*  You know, like to go to dinner, get a couple drinks, [[02:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10607.960000000001s)]
*  go to a show. [[02:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10609.960000000001s)]
*  That's a nighttime thing. [[02:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10610.880000000001s)]
*  But that's just, they're just accustomed to it. [[02:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10612.04s)]
*  Especially if it's Saturday or Sunday. [[02:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10614.36s)]
*  You totally could get away with it. [[02:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10616.08s)]
*  I'm just a morning baby. [[02:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10616.92s)]
*  I like to wake up early. [[02:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10618.0s)]
*  And then I like to get up. [[02:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10619.2s)]
*  I'm a 6 AM little baby boy that wakes up. [[02:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10620.36s)]
*  How long before you look at your phone? [[02:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10622.24s)]
*  What I used to look at it right away. [[02:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10623.88s)]
*  But now I give myself 15 minutes. [[02:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10625.92s)]
*  15 solid minutes? [[02:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10627.84s)]
*  I get 15 minutes and I get my feet on the floor. [[02:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10628.76s)]
*  And I just try to say. [[02:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10630.76s)]
*  What if you have to piss? [[02:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10631.64s)]
*  You don't piss without your phone. [[02:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10634.0s)]
*  Stop lying. [[02:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10635.36s)]
*  Let me think about that. [[02:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10636.44s)]
*  If you get up in the middle of the night to piss, [[02:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10637.12s)]
*  do you grab your phone? [[02:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10638.12s)]
*  That I don't do. [[02:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10638.8s)]
*  Because I'm in a slumber. [[02:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10639.68s)]
*  So I'm kind of just, it's kind of like, [[02:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10640.72s)]
*  I'm in a slumber state of piss. [[02:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10642.28s)]
*  But you're right, when I do get up, when I do get up. [[02:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10644.48s)]
*  Actually, I never really have to piss in the morning [[02:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10646.64s)]
*  when I wake up, because I do piss in the middle of the night. [[02:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10648.88s)]
*  But that is a good point. [[02:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10650.64s)]
*  I typically, if I have to piss, I do take my phone. [[02:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10651.76s)]
*  That's a good point. [[02:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10654.0s)]
*  But mostly, if I don't have to piss, [[02:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10654.88s)]
*  I will go 15 minutes, I try to do it. [[02:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10656.56s)]
*  And I just try to breathe. [[02:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10658.439999999999s)]
*  And get friendly with the present. [[02:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10659.599999999999s)]
*  Get friendly with the present. [[02:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10661.439999999999s)]
*  You gotta do it, baby. [[02:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10662.64s)]
*  Do you do any meditation or mindfulness stuff? [[02:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10664.08s)]
*  Sure, yeah. [[02:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10665.519999999999s)]
*  So good. [[02:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10666.359999999999s)]
*  Every day? [[02:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10667.199999999999s)]
*  Well, I do a lot of different things [[02:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10668.039999999999s)]
*  that also act like that. [[02:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10669.72s)]
*  Like my time in the sauna. [[02:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10671.039999999999s)]
*  I think that's very meditative. [[02:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10672.4s)]
*  Especially when I'm just concentrating on breathing [[02:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10674.720000000001s)]
*  and getting through the last 10, 15 minutes. [[02:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10677.44s)]
*  Cold plunge, I think that's a very meditative state too. [[02:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10679.800000000001s)]
*  Because you have to be in control of your emotions [[02:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10683.2s)]
*  and your anxiety. [[02:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10685.720000000001s)]
*  Because you wanna get the fuck out of there. [[02:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10686.92s)]
*  And you have to just stare at the clock. [[02:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10688.68s)]
*  And make sure you do your time. [[02:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10691.36s)]
*  But also, other things that I do. [[02:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10692.52s)]
*  What do you say, how long in the cold plunge? [[02:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10695.08s)]
*  Three minutes. [[02:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10696.64s)]
*  Three minutes, not bad. [[02:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10697.48s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[02:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10699.44s)]
*  Yeah, I can never try. [[02:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10700.28s)]
*  I can't even do a cold shower. [[02:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10701.92s)]
*  Dude, I can't believe we're doing [[02:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10703.320000000002s)]
*  maybe the last podcast on Earth [[02:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10704.560000000001s)]
*  after an alien invasion is coming. [[02:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10706.2s)]
*  I don't think these aliens are gonna stop podcasting. [[02:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10707.640000000001s)]
*  I think they like podcasts. [[02:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10710.0s)]
*  They like it, right? [[02:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10711.08s)]
*  Yeah, it's fun. [[02:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10711.92s)]
*  They're gonna love yours for sure. [[02:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10712.74s)]
*  You're an advocate for them. [[02:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10713.58s)]
*  They wanna know what we're doing. [[02:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10714.42s)]
*  Yes, I'm on their side. [[02:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10715.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10716.08s)]
*  Come visit me. [[02:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10716.92s)]
*  I'm shocked that they haven't visited me yet. [[02:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10717.76s)]
*  I'm upset. [[02:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10719.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10720.04s)]
*  Maybe they'll come. [[02:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10720.86s)]
*  You wouldn't be freaked out, right? [[02:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10721.7s)]
*  I would definitely be freaked out. [[02:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10723.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10724.24s)]
*  I mean, how do you not be freaked out [[02:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10725.16s)]
*  when you're confronted with the thing [[02:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10726.560000000001s)]
*  that everybody's wondered forever? [[02:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10727.880000000001s)]
*  Are we alone? [[02:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10729.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10730.560000000001s)]
*  And if you know you're definitely not alone, [[02:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10731.400000000001s)]
*  no matter who you are and what you say, [[02:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10732.92s)]
*  I don't care if you're the baddest motherfucker [[02:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10734.759999999998s)]
*  on the planet, you run into an alien, [[02:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10736.199999999999s)]
*  you're gonna freak out. [[02:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10737.64s)]
*  But why is that not comforting? [[02:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10738.519999999999s)]
*  Like, I'm a kid who doesn't like loneliness, [[02:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10740.16s)]
*  and it'd be nice to know [[02:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10742.279999999999s)]
*  that there's other things out there. [[02:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10743.519999999999s)]
*  What if they're completely indifferent to us? [[02:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10744.8s)]
*  What if they've completely eliminated emotion? [[02:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10746.64s)]
*  Yeah, but what's the difference between them and like- [[02:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10749.56s)]
*  And they're cold and calculated like a computer? [[02:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10750.4s)]
*  We have those here. [[02:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10752.96s)]
*  Yeah, but they're not telling you [[02:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10754.38s)]
*  what you can and can't do with your life. [[02:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10755.96s)]
*  They're not shutting down your power grid. [[02:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10757.839999999998s)]
*  They're not like coming over to rule over humanity. [[02:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10759.9s)]
*  That's the worry. [[02:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10762.8s)]
*  I mean, what's the worst they could do? [[02:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10763.64s)]
*  The worry is that they rule over us [[02:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10764.48s)]
*  the way we rule over countries. [[02:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10765.679999999998s)]
*  But maybe they do a better job. [[02:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10767.92s)]
*  Maybe. [[02:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10769.4s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, what's the worst they could do, really? [[02:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10770.24s)]
*  Look at you. [[02:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10772.199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, what's the worst they could happen? [[02:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10773.039999999999s)]
*  What does ChatGPT say about aliens? [[02:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10773.88s)]
*  The natives? [[02:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10775.199999999999s)]
*  Huh? [[02:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10776.039999999999s)]
*  We asked ChatGPT the other day- [[02:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10776.88s)]
*  What did they say? [[02:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10778.16s)]
*  If the Tic Tac was a UFO, we kept like beating it down, [[02:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10779.0s)]
*  asking it more and more questions, [[02:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10781.88s)]
*  like it's exhibiting something. [[02:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10783.16s)]
*  What are the possibilities? [[02:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10784.4s)]
*  If it is extraterrestrial, where would it come from? [[02:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10785.8s)]
*  They gave us like a list of like star systems [[02:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10787.599999999999s)]
*  that are close by. [[02:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10789.4s)]
*  Wow. [[02:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10790.48s)]
*  Yeah, you keep pestering ChatGPT. [[02:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10791.64s)]
*  I kept going with it. [[02:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10793.96s)]
*  I asked it to make an artistic rendition [[02:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10794.8s)]
*  of what it thought it would look like. [[02:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10797.16s)]
*  What the Tic Tac looked like? [[02:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10798.24s)]
*  Yo. [[02:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10799.36s)]
*  At first I made it huge, [[03:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10800.199999999999s)]
*  and I was like, that's a little too big, isn't it? [[03:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10801.02s)]
*  Yeah, maybe, but not big as those mothership ones. [[03:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10802.44s)]
*  I don't know what it is, but it's fun. [[03:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10806.08s)]
*  I like all this. [[03:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10807.88s)]
*  I like all this chaos. [[03:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10809.119999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10810.32s)]
*  I think it's fun. [[03:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10811.16s)]
*  I enjoy it when things get real sideways [[03:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10811.98s)]
*  for some strange reason. [[03:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10813.039999999999s)]
*  They were also probably been coming forever, [[03:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10814.0s)]
*  just now everyone's got phones [[03:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10815.96s)]
*  and now they're just capturing them. [[03:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10817.279999999999s)]
*  I think it's in the Bible. [[03:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10818.48s)]
*  I think the Ezekiel story in the Bible [[03:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10819.52s)]
*  is an alien visitation. [[03:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10821.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10823.560000000001s)]
*  So what is that? [[03:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10824.4s)]
*  They're saying they talk about these lights similar? [[03:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10825.220000000001s)]
*  It talks about a wheel within a wheel. [[03:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10826.060000000001s)]
*  Like the way Ezekiel describes this vision that he sees, [[03:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10827.4s)]
*  like something that had like [[03:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10831.36s)]
*  multiple different animal heads on it and different, [[03:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10832.720000000001s)]
*  like it describes it as a wheel within a wheel. [[03:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10835.16s)]
*  The way he's describing, like you would imagine, [[03:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10838.800000000001s)]
*  like if you saw something beyond your [[03:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10840.720000000001s)]
*  fucking wildest imagination, [[03:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10843.560000000001s)]
*  and then you tried years later to write this down, [[03:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10845.36s)]
*  or not even write it down, right? [[03:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10849.279999999999s)]
*  Because it was told as an oral tradition for a long time [[03:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10850.539999999999s)]
*  before it was ever written. [[03:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10853.56s)]
*  Who knows what the actual event was that he described, [[03:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10854.839999999998s)]
*  but there's a lot of ancient religious texts, [[03:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10857.8s)]
*  including the Vimanas from the Bhagavad Gita, [[03:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10860.439999999999s)]
*  all these different stories of things flying in the air [[03:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10863.4s)]
*  that exhibit extraordinary flight characteristics [[03:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10866.56s)]
*  that move the way we describe UFOs. [[03:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10870.759999999998s)]
*  So that's a good point then, [[03:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10873.0s)]
*  just because we have the capability to film this [[03:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10873.92s)]
*  and know about it now, [[03:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10876.96s)]
*  doesn't mean that they're gonna expose themselves [[03:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10878.400000000001s)]
*  because they've been doing this for thousands of years. [[03:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10880.24s)]
*  Yeah, they've been doing this for everything. [[03:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10881.08s)]
*  If you read Jacques Vallee's books on it, [[03:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10882.16s)]
*  Jacques Vallee is the guy, he's a scientist that they, [[03:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10885.24s)]
*  they, he was the reason why they had that French guy [[03:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10889.04s)]
*  in Close Encounters, the third count. [[03:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10892.480000000001s)]
*  You ever see that? [[03:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10894.16s)]
*  Close Encounters, Steven Spielberg? [[03:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10894.980000000001s)]
*  Long time ago. [[03:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10896.08s)]
*  Great fucking movie, but there was this French scientist [[03:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10897.08s)]
*  they bring in to try to help people get through this. [[03:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10899.800000000001s)]
*  It's based on Jacques Vallee, and there's Jacques, [[03:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10902.640000000001s)]
*  he was a podcast guest, very cagey, [[03:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10904.800000000001s)]
*  didn't answer a lot of questions, probed him a lot. [[03:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10907.36s)]
*  But his books are fascinating. [[03:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10909.56s)]
*  And one of the things about his books, [[03:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10911.64s)]
*  I've read the first one, I'm into the second one right now, [[03:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10913.039999999999s)]
*  in the first one, he goes into detail about, [[03:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10915.36s)]
*  through the 1700s, 1800s, all these different sightings, [[03:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10918.88s)]
*  all these different experiences that people documented [[03:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10923.36s)]
*  in news stories and different, [[03:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10925.68s)]
*  and they're all super similar, man. [[03:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10927.32s)]
*  Similar enough that different versions of it, [[03:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10929.84s)]
*  you could kind of attribute it to different people [[03:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10933.56s)]
*  lacking the words to adequately explain [[03:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10935.800000000001s)]
*  some super paranormal, bizarre experience, [[03:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10940.4s)]
*  but real similar. [[03:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10943.76s)]
*  I think they've probably always been here. [[03:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10945.12s)]
*  If they're real, if we are visited by something [[03:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10947.16s)]
*  that's either interdimensional or from another planet, [[03:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10949.64s)]
*  they've probably been doing this for a long fucking time, [[03:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10953.16s)]
*  monitoring us the same way we monitor animals [[03:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10955.92s)]
*  on this planet. [[03:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10959.08s)]
*  And they'll never, maybe never say who they really are. [[03:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10960.0s)]
*  Well, maybe they're getting ready to, [[03:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10962.76s)]
*  because we're about to unleash [[03:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10964.64s)]
*  these fucking quantum computers and AI, [[03:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10966.279999999999s)]
*  and maybe that is the thing that they're here [[03:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10968.599999999999s)]
*  to make sure goes smoothly. [[03:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10971.039999999999s)]
*  Because if you had to imagine one thing [[03:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10973.08s)]
*  that would completely change the capability [[03:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10975.32s)]
*  of this race of savage, barbarian, territorial apes [[03:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10977.4s)]
*  with thermonuclear weapons, which is what we are, [[03:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10982.279999999999s)]
*  you would, like, right when they're about [[03:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10984.92s)]
*  to achieve godlike powers, like, let's, let's, like, hover. [[03:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10986.64s)]
*  Wow. [[03:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10991.72s)]
*  That makes sense. [[03:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10992.56s)]
*  It really does make sense when you put it [[03:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10993.72s)]
*  into that context, which is actually reality, [[03:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10995.519999999999s)]
*  that we are about, we are on the precipice [[03:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=10998.32s)]
*  of something that is so unimaginable. [[03:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11000.48s)]
*  Bigger than the split of the atom. [[03:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11003.359999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11004.48s)]
*  Bigger than anything. [[03:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11005.32s)]
*  Like, literally something. [[03:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11006.16s)]
*  You're blowing my mind right now. [[03:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11007.439999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, we really, when you think so. [[03:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11009.16s)]
*  Your anxiety's gonna go up. [[03:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11011.4s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, well, no, I don't, [[03:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11012.679999999998s)]
*  my anxiety's about stupid stuff, which is weird. [[03:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11014.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11016.76s)]
*  What, so, yeah, this stuff just doesn't bother me, [[03:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11017.599999999999s)]
*  but I get bothered by stupid stuff. [[03:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11019.98s)]
*  What is wrong with me? [[03:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11021.64s)]
*  This stuff is not genuinely affecting you right now. [[03:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11022.56s)]
*  If it was, if it was inescapable, [[03:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11026.279999999999s)]
*  if it was, like, hovering over this building right now, [[03:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11029.24s)]
*  we wouldn't be able to have a podcast. [[03:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11031.16s)]
*  We'd all be outside. [[03:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11032.56s)]
*  We'd be going, what the fuck, man? [[03:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11034.039999999999s)]
*  If there's some silent thing that's three miles long [[03:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11036.359999999999s)]
*  that's blocking out the sky, and it's hovering, [[03:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11039.32s)]
*  you know, 300 yards above us, [[03:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11041.96s)]
*  we would all be freaking the fuck out. [[03:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11044.68s)]
*  Right. [[03:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11047.48s)]
*  So what, my question is, like, [[03:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11048.32s)]
*  Elon Musk probably has, like, what, [[03:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11049.880000000001s)]
*  IQ of, like, 140 or something, or? [[03:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11052.16s)]
*  Probably, at least. [[03:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11054.48s)]
*  So what is chat GBTs, like, IQ, like, considered now? [[03:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11055.48s)]
*  Well, once chat GPT, once they achieve, [[03:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11060.08s)]
*  and they think they're gonna be able to do this in 2025, [[03:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11062.960000000001s)]
*  when it achieves artificial general intelligence, [[03:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11064.960000000001s)]
*  I think what it will be is as smart as every human being [[03:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11069.12s)]
*  that's on Earth combined. [[03:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11073.24s)]
*  See if that's right, see if that's correct. [[03:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11075.880000000001s)]
*  What does that mean, artificial general intelligence? [[03:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11077.4s)]
*  The thing is, this is like, whatever it is, it's baby steps. [[03:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11079.32s)]
*  So whatever that is, like, this insane leap from us to that [[03:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11082.119999999999s)]
*  is baby steps in comparison to what it's going to be. [[03:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11086.08s)]
*  Right. [[03:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11088.88s)]
*  It's not gonna stop there. [[03:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11089.72s)]
*  Right. [[03:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11090.56s)]
*  And if you have, if you have sentient [[03:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11091.4s)]
*  artificial intelligence and unlimited computing power [[03:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11093.68s)]
*  connected to nuclear power plants, like they're gonna do, [[03:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11097.119999999999s)]
*  and then it develops a better version of itself [[03:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11100.52s)]
*  and better versions of power and better versions [[03:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11102.92s)]
*  of its programming and all the other things [[03:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11105.76s)]
*  that go along with it and its capabilities. [[03:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11107.64s)]
*  And if chat GPT is trying to lie and copy itself, [[03:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11110.08s)]
*  what is that thing gonna do? [[03:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11115.32s)]
*  And they also don't know how it works, right? [[03:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11117.08s)]
*  Like, I watched that 60 minutes interview [[03:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11119.439999999999s)]
*  with that sort of godfather of AI [[03:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11121.72s)]
*  or whatever they consider him, [[03:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11123.72s)]
*  like the guy who first created the biggest component of it, [[03:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11125.199999999999s)]
*  and he says, we don't, the layers thing, [[03:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11127.96s)]
*  and then he was like, they don't know how it works. [[03:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11129.68s)]
*  They don't know how it works. [[03:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11130.68s)]
*  They don't, no. [[03:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11132.519999999999s)]
*  That blows my mind. [[03:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11133.68s)]
*  It should. [[03:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11134.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11135.56s)]
*  It should, and that's why the aliens are hovering. [[03:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11136.4s)]
*  So is Elon concerned? [[03:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11138.08s)]
*  Is Elon like really concerned about AI? [[03:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11139.92s)]
*  I don't know, he keeps it under his hat. [[03:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11141.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11143.56s)]
*  I think he's got contracts with NASA, [[03:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11144.4s)]
*  and he's the Defense Department, and he's running SpaceX. [[03:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11146.56s)]
*  I don't think he can talk wild about aliens [[03:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11149.359999999999s)]
*  when he got that kind of, he's like a lot on the line. [[03:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11151.119999999999s)]
*  That's what we were saying in the gym the other day. [[03:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11153.64s)]
*  Because he doesn't believe in them. [[03:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11155.48s)]
*  I saw him on your show, and I'm like, [[03:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11156.32s)]
*  I'm not sure if they, yeah. [[03:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11157.14s)]
*  He's a, they're real, they're very subtle. [[03:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11157.98s)]
*  I don't know. [[03:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11160.08s)]
*  Yeah, because people were like, [[03:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11161.0s)]
*  oh, how come he's not commenting on the drones? [[03:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11161.84s)]
*  He comments on everything. [[03:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11163.4s)]
*  That's true. [[03:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11164.44s)]
*  So like what does that tell you? [[03:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11165.28s)]
*  That tells me something's going on. [[03:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11166.800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11168.24s)]
*  That's what, I would be commenting on it. [[03:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11169.08s)]
*  If I had nothing to do with it, [[03:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11170.400000000001s)]
*  and I was a super genius who comments on everything, [[03:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11172.0s)]
*  I would for sure comment on all these fucking drones. [[03:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11174.320000000002s)]
*  Well, there's a lot of them. [[03:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11177.2s)]
*  My wife saw one, she videoed it. [[03:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11178.320000000002s)]
*  It was a drone. [[03:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11180.24s)]
*  There's a lot of them. [[03:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11181.08s)]
*  But it could have been a man-made, [[03:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11182.24s)]
*  it could have been like somebody's drone in there. [[03:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11183.320000000002s)]
*  Could have been a kid, [[03:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11185.16s)]
*  because a lot of people are probably putting them up [[03:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11186.0s)]
*  in the sky too. [[03:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11187.58s)]
*  100%. [[03:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11188.42s)]
*  They're all flying around Austin, I see them. [[03:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11189.26s)]
*  And they're normal drones. [[03:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11190.44s)]
*  I seen them the other night. [[03:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11191.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11193.28s)]
*  Boys, let's wrap this up. [[03:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11194.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11194.960000000001s)]
*  History hyenas is back. [[03:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11195.800000000001s)]
*  History hyenas. [[03:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11196.640000000001s)]
*  We're very happy. [[03:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11197.480000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11198.300000000001s)]
*  Very happy. [[03:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11199.140000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11199.980000000001s)]
*  And we're demonetized on YouTube. [[03:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11200.800000000001s)]
*  So we're trying to get re-monetized. [[03:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11201.640000000001s)]
*  What happened? [[03:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11203.640000000001s)]
*  What'd you say? [[03:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11204.480000000001s)]
*  Dude, who knows? [[03:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11205.300000000001s)]
*  It's again, it's a, I don't know. [[03:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11206.140000000001s)]
*  This is, why does this happen to me? [[03:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11207.800000000001s)]
*  I remember the last time. [[03:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11209.12s)]
*  Censorship. [[03:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11209.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and the last time they did it to my channel, [[03:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11210.800000000001s)]
*  and then you spoke about it, and then they re-monetized. [[03:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11213.140000000001s)]
*  They suspended me last time. [[03:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11216.160000000002s)]
*  We don't know, because we weren't even active. [[03:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11218.08s)]
*  The problem is, if you get a bunch of haters [[03:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11220.720000000001s)]
*  who flag your videos and complain about them, [[03:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11223.2s)]
*  I think sometimes that can do it. [[03:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11225.76s)]
*  Yeah, it says harmful content. [[03:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11227.560000000001s)]
*  We didn't even put in an episode. [[03:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11228.76s)]
*  It's just cocksuckers who just mass report you, [[03:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11229.84s)]
*  or they don't like you. [[03:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11233.76s)]
*  I mean, there's a lot of ways to weaponize [[03:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11235.12s)]
*  that whole reporting system. [[03:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11236.960000000001s)]
*  We're trying, but that's one. [[03:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11238.6s)]
*  And then you gotta realize that YouTube is managing [[03:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11239.44s)]
*  some fucking insane number of videos [[03:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11243.0s)]
*  that are getting uploaded every minute. [[03:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11245.560000000001s)]
*  Right. [[03:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11246.960000000001s)]
*  And they probably have to have all these systems in place [[03:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11247.800000000001s)]
*  to handle this stuff, and I bet you can game that system. [[03:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11250.04s)]
*  And then there's also a bunch of people that work for them [[03:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11252.4s)]
*  that are woke dipshits, and I think they can flag things, [[03:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11254.92s)]
*  and they get out of line sometimes. [[03:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11257.96s)]
*  We tried, we tried to get it reinstated. [[03:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11259.28s)]
*  They said we have to, February is our next chance. [[03:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11261.119999999999s)]
*  YouTube, please. [[03:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE&t=11264.4s)]
