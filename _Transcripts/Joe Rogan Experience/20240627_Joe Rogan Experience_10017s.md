# Joe Rogan Experience #1905 - Derek, More Plates More Dates
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=0.0s)]
*  Shrain by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day! [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6.0s)]
*  Hey Derek, you know how I got so jacked? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=13.0s)]
*  How? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=15.0s)]
*  I followed the nine ancestral tenants. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=16.0s)]
*  Oh, I heard that works really well. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=18.0s)]
*  It's the best way. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=20.0s)]
*  Boy, when I saw that video that you posted, you actually sent me the video after I'd already seen it. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=22.0s)]
*  I caught it within three minutes of you posting it. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=28.0s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=30.0s)]
*  I saw it, it just showed up on YouTube feed. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=31.0s)]
*  I'm like, oh yes, here we go. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=33.0s)]
*  And I wasn't surprised at all. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=36.0s)]
*  No. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=38.0s)]
*  It seems to completely make sense, but that's exactly what I expected. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=39.0s)]
*  Yeah, it seemed like just a matter of time for him. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=43.0s)]
*  There's no way you can look like that in your 40s. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=45.0s)]
*  That jacked. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=49.0s)]
*  I mean, he's preposterously jacked. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=50.0s)]
*  Do we have a fucking... [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=52.0s)]
*  Now that we know that he's full of shit, we're talking about the liver king, by the way, ladies and gentlemen. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=54.0s)]
*  A lot of people are like, what are they saying? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=59.0s)]
*  This is all inside stuff. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=60.0s)]
*  There's a guy, if you don't know who the liver king is, there's a guy who calls himself the liver king. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=61.0s)]
*  And he's this guy who walks around everywhere with no shirt on. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=66.0s)]
*  I've seen him in Vegas with no shirt on. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=70.0s)]
*  Big bushy beard, super jacked. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=72.0s)]
*  And he was telling people that the way he gets that way is by sunning his balls. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=74.0s)]
*  He literally lays down with his asshole staring at the sun and eats raw liver and just lifts like a maniac. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=79.0s)]
*  And that's how he's so jacked. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=88.0s)]
*  But it's preposterous. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=90.0s)]
*  Yeah, too many polar extremes to have just like a unique marketing spin that was just highly viral, in my opinion. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=91.0s)]
*  And I don't know, I think most people could see through it. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=99.0s)]
*  But at the same time, he would... [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=102.0s)]
*  There was a lot of big names that even reached out to me after the video came out. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=103.0s)]
*  And they were like, you know, I didn't think he was natural. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=107.0s)]
*  But this guy literally right to my face would say, blatantly, I am natural. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=110.0s)]
*  And a lot of people will take a guy at his word when it's like a private conversation. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=117.0s)]
*  And if he's straight up telling you in person, yeah, it's actually legit. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=122.0s)]
*  I'm natural. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=126.0s)]
*  And he was just lying through his fucking teeth, seemingly. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=127.0s)]
*  There's some people that are really jacked that are natural. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=129.0s)]
*  For sure. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=132.0s)]
*  Some people that are super, super disciplined. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=133.0s)]
*  They, you know, they're taking supplements, but all legal supplements that you get at like a vitamin store. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=135.0s)]
*  And they're just like, they've never gotten off the grind. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=143.0s)]
*  And who's that guy, Paul Sklar? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=147.0s)]
*  Did you comment on him? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=150.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, he actually did blood work, like immediately after I had talked about it one time and it checked out. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=151.0s)]
*  Yeah, he looks like what's possible. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=159.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=162.0s)]
*  I if you don't know who that guy is, he's super jacked and he's 50 years old. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=163.0s)]
*  But when I'm looking at him, I am not getting any like steroid vibes. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=166.0s)]
*  I'm getting a really fit guy who works out really hard and has probably been doing it for 30 years. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=172.0s)]
*  That's that's what I get when I look at that guy. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=178.0s)]
*  That's all feasible and possible. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=181.0s)]
*  Now, please go to the liver king. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=183.0s)]
*  Please show me some preposterous liver king physiology. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=187.0s)]
*  Oh, he has. Have you seen his apology? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=193.0s)]
*  No, I haven't. I want to watch it. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=195.0s)]
*  He comes clean on steroids. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=197.0s)]
*  You I fucked up. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=199.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=202.0s)]
*  I don't know if you guys are able to watch the images, though. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=203.0s)]
*  I want to see some images of his body because his body is just so off the charts, ridiculously massive. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=205.0s)]
*  That's OK. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=213.0s)]
*  That's OK. But that's there's unflattering lighting. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=214.0s)]
*  Yeah, I want to I want to show some of him like jacked and lifting because he's just fucking gigantic. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=217.0s)]
*  So he did cover the AB implants and etching again. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=228.0s)]
*  He said no to both, even in his apology touches on it. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=231.0s)]
*  Is it I mean, I guess it's possible if you run that much juice that your muscles grow that big, too, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=235.0s)]
*  because the kind of stuff he does is, you know, very core specific. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=241.0s)]
*  Like he's doing a lot of stuff where he's like cleaning and pressing kettlebells and walking with them over his head. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=248.0s)]
*  And all that stuff really does ignite your core. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=254.0s)]
*  And if he's doing that all the time, I would imagine it's possible that those are real abs. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=258.0s)]
*  But that was the question. Do you think those are real abs? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=263.0s)]
*  Yeah, personally, I think they're legitimate abs. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=267.0s)]
*  And the etching thing, I think, is more of the controversial topic. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=271.0s)]
*  Did he have some sort of like cosmetic work done to target locally the fat around the abdominal definition? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=275.0s)]
*  Would that make much of a difference, though, because he's very lean, clearly. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=286.0s)]
*  If you look at his arms, you look at his chest, you look at everything like look at that image right there. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=289.0s)]
*  He's so lean. I mean, how much fat would you even be talking about? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=293.0s)]
*  And how would that make the things the topographical map of his his abs? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=296.0s)]
*  The way they pop up like mountains. That's just mass. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=302.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's where the question of whether or not that's real or whether or not they're implants. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=306.0s)]
*  That's what I was leaning to is just like I feel like his overall body composition is pretty consistently represented. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=310.0s)]
*  I don't think he has like this. Like I get that his. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=317.0s)]
*  Look at him walk in there. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=320.0s)]
*  The argument is they don't change in like when he sits down or anything, the density of them and like the separation is so dramatic that it's got to be something. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=322.0s)]
*  Yeah. And, you know, you could never really say if it was well done, like what did or didn't happen. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=332.0s)]
*  I don't think it's implants, though. That would be really obvious, in my opinion. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=339.0s)]
*  Well, granted, then it's like, well, if it's unnoticeable, would you even? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=343.0s)]
*  Right. You know, right. It's like plastic surgery. You only see the stuff that's not good. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=346.0s)]
*  Are you guys able to play the apology without it being copyrighted? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=351.0s)]
*  We can play it for us. Come after us. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=354.0s)]
*  I don't know what like the Spotify copyright rules are like. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=358.0s)]
*  Oh, listen, I think Spotify can handle this. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=362.0s)]
*  Play the YouTube version. Let's play it. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=364.0s)]
*  Let's play it. Yeah. If you put it on YouTube, you're more than allowed to. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=366.0s)]
*  Here it goes. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=370.0s)]
*  Lever King confession. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=372.0s)]
*  I'm making this video. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=376.0s)]
*  That's a terrible sound. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=378.0s)]
*  Is it a connection issue? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=380.0s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=382.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=384.0s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=385.0s)]
*  That's happened before. What is that? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=386.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=387.0s)]
*  A lot of people believed him, including the Bell brothers, Chris and Mark Bell. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=390.0s)]
*  I'm like, how, guys? You two steroids. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=395.0s)]
*  How do you not look at that guy and go clearly? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=399.0s)]
*  I think Mark likes to think that a lot of people like he again, he doesn't want to put a [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=403.0s)]
*  Is it working? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=410.0s)]
*  Like a limitation on what's possible. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=413.0s)]
*  Like he likes to believe that you could. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=416.0s)]
*  And again, because this the problem with this too is a lot of people will extrapolate this out and then think [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=418.0s)]
*  everyone with a jack physique must be doing something, which is problematic because then it sort of creates this right. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=423.0s)]
*  This narrative around, you know, everyone's lying or anyone with a good physique. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=429.0s)]
*  It's impossible to get there without doping your fucking face off kind of thing, which is not the case. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=433.0s)]
*  There are certain individuals who like I do believe that physique. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=439.0s)]
*  OK, maybe not. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=443.0s)]
*  Maybe not that physique, but like within striking distance of that in zero point zero zero zero zero one percent of individuals. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=445.0s)]
*  You could get there naturally. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=452.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=454.0s)]
*  Potentially hyper responders. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=455.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=456.0s)]
*  Guys who are just like ridiculous genetics like Ronnie Coleman natural. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=457.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=460.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=461.0s)]
*  Perfect example. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=462.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=463.0s)]
*  Ronnie Coleman natural was super jacked, but he couldn't compete with the most jack guys. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=464.0s)]
*  And then he started doing steroids. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=467.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=468.0s)]
*  He just exploded. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=469.0s)]
*  But he's super honest about it. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=470.0s)]
*  Like when Ronnie talks about it, he just will explain like up until he was 30 years old, he was natural. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=471.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=476.0s)]
*  So can we get it or is it OK? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=477.0s)]
*  Got a little. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=480.0s)]
*  Because I'm embarrassed and ashamed, it sounds fucking terrible. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=483.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=486.0s)]
*  Maybe there's another version of cable. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=487.0s)]
*  I think there's something wrong with my cable for some reason. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=489.0s)]
*  I'm looking at the audio on my feed and it's not. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=491.0s)]
*  Is it the cable or is it how it connects? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=493.0s)]
*  Is it like it's one of the other? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=495.0s)]
*  It's both. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=496.0s)]
*  It could be both. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=497.0s)]
*  That's an old laptop, isn't it? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=498.0s)]
*  No, it's a new one. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=499.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=500.0s)]
*  Old cable, maybe. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=501.0s)]
*  Because I lied and I missed love. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=502.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=503.0s)]
*  Quiet. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=504.0s)]
*  I don't know if something's wrong. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=505.0s)]
*  That's all right. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=506.0s)]
*  Let's play. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=507.0s)]
*  We can hear what he's saying. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=508.0s)]
*  A lot of people. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=509.0s)]
*  Finally, I'm making this video to apologize. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=510.0s)]
*  Because I fucked up. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=511.0s)]
*  Because I'm embarrassed and ashamed. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=512.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=513.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=514.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=515.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=516.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=517.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=518.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=519.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=520.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=521.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=522.0s)]
*  I'm embarrassed and ashamed. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=524.0s)]
*  Because I lied. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=525.0s)]
*  And I missed love. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=526.0s)]
*  A lot of people. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=527.0s)]
*  I've stated that this is a complicated as fuck topic, at least to me it is, because before [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=528.0s)]
*  social media, I was rich and anonymous. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=533.0s)]
*  And after social media, I'm still rich, but no longer anonymous. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=536.0s)]
*  And I never expected this kind of exposure in the public eye. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=541.0s)]
*  It's been tricky as fuck to navigate. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=546.0s)]
*  Well, clearly I did it wrong. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=552.0s)]
*  And I'm here now to set the record straight. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=555.0s)]
*  Yes, I've done steroids. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=561.0s)]
*  And yes, I'm on steroids. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=564.0s)]
*  I'm on a leading edge by a trained hormone clinician. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=566.0s)]
*  Lyricking the public figure was an experiment to spread the message, to bring awareness [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=570.0s)]
*  to the 4,000 people a day who killed themselves. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=575.0s)]
*  80,000 people a day that try to kill themselves are people who are hurting at record rates [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=579.0s)]
*  with depression, autoimmune, anxiety, infertility, low ambition in life. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=584.0s)]
*  Our young men are hurting the most, feeling lost, weak, and submissive. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=590.0s)]
*  So I made it my job to monitor and preach. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=595.0s)]
*  He did it for the hurting people. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=597.0s)]
*  Come on, Derek. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=599.0s)]
*  The comments are not too favorable on that part of the video. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=600.0s)]
*  Our highest and most dominant form. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=605.0s)]
*  This is my fight. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=607.0s)]
*  This is why I exist. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=608.0s)]
*  Pause. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=610.0s)]
*  Your highest and most dominant form. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=613.0s)]
*  What? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=616.0s)]
*  He wanted everybody that's depressed and trying to kill themselves to reach their highest, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=617.0s)]
*  most dominant form. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=622.0s)]
*  But he wanted to lie about how he achieved his physique. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=623.0s)]
*  So mislead these people that just by eating liver, you can come close to that. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=627.0s)]
*  So as you fail at that as well as everything else you failed at life, it led you to the point of doing [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=631.0s)]
*  something to yourself that you're thinking about committing suicide. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=636.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=639.0s)]
*  Like that's what he's saying. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=640.0s)]
*  I feel like in this video he had like a very good opportunity to just straight up say, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=641.0s)]
*  sorry, I fucked up, et cetera, which I think he thought he was doing, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=645.0s)]
*  but he also makes a few little comments in there that I feel like people really dug in on, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=649.0s)]
*  like the whole, I didn't expect it to happen this or me to blow up this much. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=655.0s)]
*  It's like it was very meticulously planned out from inception of the brand within this. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=659.0s)]
*  I don't know if you saw the emails, but it's like within one year I want to be at exactly this in social media [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=664.0s)]
*  following and this is what I'm going to do. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=671.0s)]
*  What's his social media following at now, Jamie, which is like Instagram. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=673.0s)]
*  I bet he's at five million. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=679.0s)]
*  I think on TikTok, one point seven million on TikTok. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=681.0s)]
*  He's at like three point something. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=683.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's Chinese bots. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=686.0s)]
*  Maybe let's play some more of this nonsense. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=690.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's spreading the message. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=692.0s)]
*  I've been on several podcasts and when asked if I've ever taken steroids, I've always said no, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=694.0s)]
*  I don't touch this stuff. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=700.0s)]
*  Not going to touch this stuff. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=701.0s)]
*  That was a lie. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=706.0s)]
*  I convinced myself that this had nothing to do with the ancestral message. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=709.0s)]
*  I convinced myself that I'm not a competitive athlete of any kind. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=714.0s)]
*  So who the fuck am I cheating? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=719.0s)]
*  I convinced myself that this topic was a placeholder for a far more important conversation. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=721.0s)]
*  I convinced myself that this would overshadow the 36 years of working out, usually twice a day, without PEDs. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=728.0s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=737.0s)]
*  I convinced myself that this was a vocal minority, usually in the fitness category, driving to an unproductive conversation. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=739.0s)]
*  And I had convinced myself that this would be the wrong message to send to the 15 year old boys. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=748.0s)]
*  Oh, the 15 year old boys. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=755.0s)]
*  The ones who actually can get jacked. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=757.0s)]
*  We've seen enough. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=759.0s)]
*  You know what the problem is? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=762.0s)]
*  Sometimes people don't hang out with people that are smarter than them. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=764.0s)]
*  And you think you're the smartest person, or maybe because he's running this company, people have to listen to him. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=768.0s)]
*  So he's got this distorted perception of his ability to communicate and his ability to convince people. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=775.0s)]
*  That was so theatrical and so corny. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=783.0s)]
*  I don't know what kind of thought process went into this. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=786.0s)]
*  There was some sort of ROI calculation on if I lie, what is the probability I get outed versus how viral can I go? [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=789.0s)]
*  If I lie from the get go versus... [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=797.0s)]
*  I just don't know how his team, especially with the information out there, thought that it was going to be a net win where it's probably never going to come out. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=800.0s)]
*  Does he have a team? [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=809.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's pretty elaborate. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=811.0s)]
*  His team was... [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=813.0s)]
*  Well, he has a media team that he hired to kind of like... [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=814.0s)]
*  Right, but they're just employees. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=816.0s)]
*  One of them came up to me in Vegas. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=818.0s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=820.0s)]
*  Yeah, one of my security guards stopped him. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=821.0s)]
*  He was like, I'm a producer for the Liver King. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=823.0s)]
*  I'm like, what the fuck do you produce? What are you producing? [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=825.0s)]
*  Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if... [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=828.0s)]
*  It's not a movie. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=830.0s)]
*  How many UFC events did he try in? [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=831.0s)]
*  He was front row at one of my shows in Vegas. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=833.0s)]
*  Oh, damn. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=836.0s)]
*  At the MGM. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=837.0s)]
*  Yeah, and then I saw him again at the Canelo fight. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=839.0s)]
*  He was trying really hard to get on the podcast. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=841.0s)]
*  He's been trying really hard to get on now. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=843.0s)]
*  He contacted a few friends of mine, some of them that have like Burt Kreischer, that had him on the show. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=845.0s)]
*  He told me he's trying to get on. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=851.0s)]
*  Yeah, for what? Say that more? [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=853.0s)]
*  Like, come on, this is dumb, man. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=855.0s)]
*  This is a fucking... you ran a con game and you got busted. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=857.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=860.0s)]
*  And it's unfortunate that you feel terrible. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=861.0s)]
*  I'm sorry you feel bad, because that's just what happens when you get caught lying. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=863.0s)]
*  But you didn't have to lie. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=867.0s)]
*  I don't even see how bad it would have been if from the get-go he was like, I... [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=869.0s)]
*  You know, it's not the healthiest... [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=874.0s)]
*  I want one more replacement. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=875.0s)]
*  Yeah, but like, I understand the not wanting to talk about the other shit, because he was on Winster, Oladeca. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=876.0s)]
*  High amounts of GH, etc. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=882.0s)]
*  Which is not ancestrally consistent, but neither is HRT, because it's like, well, if your diet was so dialed, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=884.0s)]
*  like, why is it that you don't have like adequate testicular function or adequate hormone output or this or that? [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=890.0s)]
*  And it's just like, I guess it kind of just like spit in the face of his message too much that he couldn't wrap his head around justifying coming out and saying, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=896.0s)]
*  I'm on HRT, but do this other stuff. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=903.0s)]
*  Well, he kind of had, I mean, one of the parts of your video that was really good was that you inserted this guy who gives a definition of charlatans. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=905.0s)]
*  Who's that guy? [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=913.0s)]
*  Zach Talender. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=914.0s)]
*  Zach Talender. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=915.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=916.0s)]
*  So that guy's definition of charlatans is really excellent, because, you know, when you're talking about fitness and physiques, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=917.0s)]
*  and you're talking about bodybuilding and just getting jacked, there are so many, like, really educated, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=924.0s)]
*  really jacked looking people that are online that tell you how they do it. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=933.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=939.0s)]
*  And they give you like what supplements they're taking, what kind of sets they're doing, what's their recovery like, what's all those things. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=940.0s)]
*  And it's everyone's giving a very similar message. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=948.0s)]
*  Some people have different approaches. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=952.0s)]
*  Some people, you know, they're doing, you know, different kinds of exercises, but it's pretty consistent. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=954.0s)]
*  And one of the things that Zach talked about in that video that you inserted into your video, which was really good, was that when someone comes along and they have a secret. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=961.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=969.0s)]
*  This is the secret. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=970.0s)]
*  The secret is the nine ancestral tenants. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=971.0s)]
*  I mean, you see him there with a beard. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=974.0s)]
*  He looks like a fucking, like an ogre, like someone in the Lord of the Rings. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=976.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=980.0s)]
*  Like he looks like he belonged the nine ancestral tenants. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=981.0s)]
*  Like you're going to meet him in a cave somewhere and he's going to explain to you and give you a magic staff. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=983.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=988.0s)]
*  And he, I felt he feels it justified to be a larger than life character to represent the polar extreme of ancestral living. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=989.0s)]
*  And even if it's at the detriment of having to take a bunch of drugs to do it. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=995.0s)]
*  Because men are killing themselves. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=999.0s)]
*  There's a whole reason for it. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1001.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1003.0s)]
*  It's so dumb because imagine if you're like a really skinny guy and you're like, I'll have to eat liver and I can look like that guy. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1004.0s)]
*  Imagine like there's people out there that really believe that like that's what's missing. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1010.0s)]
*  You know, wolves eat liver. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1014.0s)]
*  Why don't I eat liver? [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1015.0s)]
*  So they go on, which is by the way, very, very healthy for you. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1016.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1019.0s)]
*  Liver is a fantastic food to eat. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1020.0s)]
*  One of the very best foods. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1021.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1023.0s)]
*  I've been eating an ounce a day for years. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1024.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1026.0s)]
*  I saw that in the video too. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1027.0s)]
*  I eat elk liver. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1028.0s)]
*  Whenever I kill an elk, I get it's a giant ass liver. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1029.0s)]
*  It's like this big. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1032.0s)]
*  And I buy a cab's liver and I'll eat liver at restaurants. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1033.0s)]
*  It's very good for you. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1037.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1038.0s)]
*  It's rich in nutrients. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1039.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1040.0s)]
*  But that's not going to get you that big. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1041.0s)]
*  That's that's hyperhuman. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1043.0s)]
*  Like what what that guy's achieved with his physique is a lot of hard work, no ifs, ands, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1044.0s)]
*  or buts about it, but also exogenous hormones. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1049.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1052.0s)]
*  And it's like there are people out there that are more educational and obviously natural, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1053.0s)]
*  like Saladino. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1057.0s)]
*  He's yes. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1058.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1059.0s)]
*  Like he I feel like he puts out like pretty goddamn informative content that's still very [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1060.0s)]
*  represents his even if he has a polar extreme, like potentially narrow view of like what [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1064.0s)]
*  the optimal diet is. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1069.0s)]
*  It's very much like reinforced by information, thought process, not necessarily his like [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1071.0s)]
*  he shows up shirtless on camera. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1077.0s)]
*  And I'm sure some of that was inspired by the liver king to some extent because he didn't [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1078.0s)]
*  used to do that. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1081.0s)]
*  But it's like when did he start? [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1082.0s)]
*  When did he start with the shirtless on camera? [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1084.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1086.0s)]
*  But like maybe half a year ago or nine months ago. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1087.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1091.0s)]
*  I wonder if the liver king inspired him to do that. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1092.0s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1094.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1095.0s)]
*  He started showing his meals and showing up shirtless on camera. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1096.0s)]
*  But he has a great physique and he's natural. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1098.0s)]
*  Totally natural. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1100.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1101.0s)]
*  That's what's achievable. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1102.0s)]
*  You look at Paul's physique. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1103.0s)]
*  It's he looks excellent and it's totally achievable. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1104.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1107.0s)]
*  And he's in his 40s still still has high hormone output, et cetera. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1108.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1111.0s)]
*  He walks the walk and talks the talk. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1112.0s)]
*  He's a legitimate medical doctor. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1114.0s)]
*  He's real. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1116.0s)]
*  And unfortunately, he's in business with the liver king. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1117.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's complicated. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1119.0s)]
*  Have you seen his video about like separating guys? [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1120.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1124.0s)]
*  Fucking crazy. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1125.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1126.0s)]
*  I'm gonna play his video. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1127.0s)]
*  Paul Paul. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1128.0s)]
*  Poor Paul, brother. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1129.0s)]
*  He's great. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1130.0s)]
*  I really like that guy. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1131.0s)]
*  I don't know if he's accurate. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1132.0s)]
*  I shouldn't say honest. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1134.0s)]
*  I meant to say accurate in terms of like whether or not vegetables are actually bad for you. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1135.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1140.0s)]
*  Some of it, like again, it's very much leaning into certain extrapolations he's made that [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1141.0s)]
*  support his hypothesis, I feel like, which I feel like could be a stretch in many scenarios [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1147.0s)]
*  like this equals bad, not moderate quantities equals potentially cumulatively beneficial [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1153.32s)]
*  for some people. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1159.9199999999998s)]
*  I did a podcast with him not that long ago and I felt like I gave pretty fair questions [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1160.9199999999998s)]
*  that really assessed in some circumstances could like even medications, for example, [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1166.6399999999999s)]
*  like he's pretty against things that are like pharmaceutical at this point. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1170.9199999999998s)]
*  He thinks everything could be naturally rectified through high quality lifestyle diet, et cetera. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1175.28s)]
*  To some extent, maybe I'm speaking on his behalf and being a little bit too polar on [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1179.68s)]
*  that, but he is very like, I don't know, he's open to the idea that there's some minor benefit [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1182.3600000000001s)]
*  potentially to having the hormetic stress of a vegetable in some circumstance, but then [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1189.6000000000001s)]
*  in his content that's bite sized, it very much comes across like seed oils fucking suck. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1194.1200000000001s)]
*  This equals bad. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1200.44s)]
*  Don't touch this. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1201.68s)]
*  And I don't know, like it's he's definitely finding his own unique way to pick up virality [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1202.68s)]
*  but at least it's centered around like what he believes to be truthful. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1208.8000000000002s)]
*  He's not misleading necessarily with his like, you know, a fucking calculated pre-planned [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1212.8000000000002s)]
*  meticulously thought out like lie essentially. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1218.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1220.8000000000002s)]
*  Well, let's see what he says and note that he has a shirt on. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1221.8000000000002s)]
*  So I wanted to post a story today with a little more context for the liver king situation. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1227.2800000000002s)]
*  I posted a reel with my thoughts. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1233.8400000000001s)]
*  I've known Brian for five years, long before his social media presence began. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1238.0s)]
*  He's a good human at his core and I'm incredibly disappointed by the steroid revelations, which [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1243.28s)]
*  appear to be true. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1251.72s)]
*  I think integrity is everything. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1254.16s)]
*  The most common question that I'm getting asked now is didn't you know Paul about the [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1256.4s)]
*  steroid use? [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1260.64s)]
*  The answer is no. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1261.88s)]
*  I had my concerns about it. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1263.28s)]
*  I had my doubts that he was free of PEDs like so many of you, but on multiple occasions [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1264.72s)]
*  when I challenged him with this, I was told that the answer is no, that he was not on [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1269.56s)]
*  any performance enhancing drugs. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1274.2s)]
*  Brian and I are both adult humans. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1276.24s)]
*  We live thousands of miles apart from each other, but I had no knowledge of his PED use, [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1278.68s)]
*  though I did have my concerns as I said. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1283.92s)]
*  I will take full responsibility for my lack of ability to challenge him with those concerns [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1286.16s)]
*  sooner. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1292.6000000000001s)]
*  When he began getting traction on social media, I should have brought my concerns about the [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1293.6799999999998s)]
*  truthfulness, the veracity of his statements, of his claims that he was not using PEDs to [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1298.8799999999999s)]
*  him sooner. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1303.84s)]
*  And like I said, I will take full responsibility for that. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1304.84s)]
*  That was my mistake. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1307.36s)]
*  Let's stop right there. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1308.36s)]
*  I did not know about that. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1309.36s)]
*  I get it. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1310.36s)]
*  Here's the problem. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1311.36s)]
*  He was in business with this guy before he became this gigantic social media presence. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1312.9599999999998s)]
*  That supplement line that Paul and the liver king were involved with, that's existed for [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1319.76s)]
*  years. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1325.3600000000001s)]
*  I mean, he was on my podcast years ago and he gave me some of those supplements. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1326.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1329.28s)]
*  I think Harden Soil has been around since well before the liver king inception. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1330.28s)]
*  So back then, it didn't matter. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1334.3600000000001s)]
*  What Paul was trying to do was he was trying to promote supplements that he believed would [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1337.24s)]
*  enhance people's diet. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1344.76s)]
*  That if you can't eat enough liver, if you can't get heart and kidney, we could use desiccated [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1347.64s)]
*  forms of it. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1353.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1354.08s)]
*  And I think that's a noble way to market it too, where it's like, let's say I have a micronutrient [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1355.08s)]
*  deficiency of, I don't know, vitamin A or copper or whatever it is, or choline, for [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1359.52s)]
*  example, like liver is very dense in choline. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1365.12s)]
*  That sort of thing, if you don't like the taste of liver, is it reasonable to have a [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1367.84s)]
*  supplement in capsule format to get the exact same thing in, but without having to eat something [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1372.32s)]
*  you deem to be gross? [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1376.44s)]
*  Like totally. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1378.08s)]
*  I think that's a totally fair way to market it as well. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1379.08s)]
*  But it's the whole, the other angle. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1382.28s)]
*  Yeah, but imagine being in business with this guy and then all of a sudden the guy starts [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1384.2s)]
*  being shirtless, walking around with a chain around his neck and all the crazy shit that [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1388.86s)]
*  he was doing and then saying he's steroid free. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1394.0s)]
*  The crazy thing about it is the first time, as far as I know, that he said and lied to [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1396.3s)]
*  somebody on camera was to the face of Paul. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1401.3s)]
*  So that's probably why he feels even more. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1403.94s)]
*  Really? [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1406.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1407.1s)]
*  Like it was on Paul's podcast where he was like, you know, tell everyone about, like [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1408.1s)]
*  there's a lot of speculation going around. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1412.46s)]
*  You know, we've talked about it. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1414.3799999999999s)]
*  Tell them, are you enhanced with PEDs? [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1416.3799999999999s)]
*  What do you do to get this physique? [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1418.78s)]
*  And then he basically just said, this question has done more for the liver king brand than [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1420.1s)]
*  any other question. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1424.54s)]
*  And I'm glad you're asking. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1425.74s)]
*  The answer is no, I've never done the shit, never going to do the shit. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1426.94s)]
*  I feel like I mean, this is obviously this is Monday morning quarterbacking and Paul's [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1430.02s)]
*  a friend. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1436.02s)]
*  I really like Paul, but I feel like he should have asked him to take a blood test. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1437.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1440.54s)]
*  Like if you're highly suspect of it, you're in business with this guy. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1441.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1444.46s)]
*  And now this guy's his gigantic social media presence. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1445.46s)]
*  Drug testing your fucking business partner. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1448.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1450.3s)]
*  Well, I would do that. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1451.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1452.58s)]
*  It's just funny how that's actually justified in this scenario. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1453.58s)]
*  In that scenario it is. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1456.02s)]
*  I think ordinarily, if the guy was just a business partner, you know, of course you [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1457.34s)]
*  wouldn't. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1461.22s)]
*  But also, of course you wouldn't lie. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1462.22s)]
*  Look, if I was friends with the liver king and he told me he was clean, I'd be like, [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1463.22s)]
*  get the fuck out of here, bitch. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1468.1399999999999s)]
*  That's what I would say. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1470.82s)]
*  I would be like, as a friend, I'd be like, come on, man, shut the fuck up. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1471.82s)]
*  Shut the fuck up. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1475.18s)]
*  You're five foot seven, 200 plus pounds, solid muscle. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1476.18s)]
*  And you're what, 45 or something like that? [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1479.74s)]
*  Bitch, get out of here. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1481.74s)]
*  You're doing something. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1483.18s)]
*  Stop lying. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1484.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1485.18s)]
*  I would be like, I can't be friends with you now. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1487.0600000000002s)]
*  Because now I know if you'll lie about something so similar, or so simple rather. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1489.26s)]
*  No, yeah, I guess, like he did say, I should have grilled him harder, but then it's like, [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1493.7s)]
*  a lot of people get on him like, shut up. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1498.94s)]
*  You should have known before the fact. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1501.78s)]
*  You should have known. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1503.46s)]
*  You should have known. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1504.46s)]
*  But he doesn't do anything. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1505.46s)]
*  So maybe that's why. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1506.6000000000001s)]
*  Maybe if he was on HRT and maybe he was surrounding himself with guys who were really super jacked, [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1508.46s)]
*  maybe he would be more entrenched in that world. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1515.1599999999999s)]
*  But it seems like the kind of exercises that he does, he does a lot of body weight stuff, [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1517.52s)]
*  and he does a lot of sprints on the beach and surfing. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1521.3999999999999s)]
*  He's not in that world. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1525.8s)]
*  Yeah, there are some people who are in the know like you, who would be like, obviously, [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1526.8s)]
*  how could you not know? [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1531.32s)]
*  And a lot of people are coming out and like, oh, big surprise. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1532.32s)]
*  Who didn't fucking see it coming? [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1535.04s)]
*  But there are a lot of people, potentially even Paul, some people are doubtful that he's [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1536.6799999999998s)]
*  truthful in that context. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1541.72s)]
*  But like Paul's like a hyper intelligent individual. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1542.72s)]
*  And if he actually didn't know, like imagine the layman who thinks that, you know, the [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1545.3600000000001s)]
*  rock is fucking clean, for example. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1549.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1551.32s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1552.32s)]
*  Does the rock say he's clean? [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1553.32s)]
*  He has implied it pretty heavily, but he also doesn't end up in scenarios where he gets [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1554.94s)]
*  ass point blank, whereas the liver king goes out of his way to fucking lean into it and [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1560.56s)]
*  use it as like a marketing spiel. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1565.48s)]
*  The rock should come clean right now. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1567.28s)]
*  Make a video in response to the liver king video. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1568.8400000000001s)]
*  I need to talk to you because the rock's been lying. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1572.48s)]
*  Yeah, no. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1576.28s)]
*  Yeah, the there's not a fucking chance in hell he's clean. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1578.0800000000002s)]
*  No, not a chance in hell. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1581.5600000000002s)]
*  As big as the rock is at 50. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1583.28s)]
*  What was wild as he came out? [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1586.04s)]
*  OK, and I get this is like coincides with the message he would want to push to. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1587.44s)]
*  And I don't think it's like disingenuous necessarily, but it's like he was on a men's health interview [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1592.16s)]
*  and he talks about how his number one priority is longevity now. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1597.0s)]
*  The rock? [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1600.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1601.04s)]
*  And I'm like, dude, like everything you're doing is like the hyper opposite of that, [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1602.04s)]
*  like in terms of a diet, a lifestyle, potentially. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1606.44s)]
*  But like the the drug exposure to maintain the physique to then do the superhero roles [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1609.92s)]
*  to do the whatever at his age. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1614.3600000000001s)]
*  Like it's clearly not longevity focused. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1616.68s)]
*  It's very much like how much can I milk this right now with my brand sort of thing? [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1619.44s)]
*  Well, we're not. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1623.76s)]
*  Let's look at a physique of the rock, like a full jacked rock. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1625.48s)]
*  Find find the rock at his most jackety jacked. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1629.8s)]
*  He's like pretty fucking peaked in terms of like the last few years. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1633.08s)]
*  He's definitely like turned it up and on at 50. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1637.32s)]
*  Yeah, that's natural, bro. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1639.72s)]
*  That's how could you think otherwise? [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1641.92s)]
*  He's a lot of sushi. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1643.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1644.48s)]
*  But the point is, it's like you can't even get there with HRT. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1646.12s)]
*  That's not HRT. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1650.64s)]
*  No. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1652.04s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1653.8s)]
*  And it's like, is this pro longevity? [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1656.32s)]
*  Like, of course not. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1658.36s)]
*  And it's no, he's so massive and he's so different than he was when he was 30. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1659.36s)]
*  Yeah, when you're in your 20s and obviously mindful of your image and, you know, [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1665.8799999999999s)]
*  you're still working out like a maniac, you're like a top tier. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1672.32s)]
*  Like he's a genetic marvel, as is anyways, when he was natural. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1675.48s)]
*  Yes. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1679.32s)]
*  So to have all of a sudden 30 years later, like you're in better form than you were in [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1680.08s)]
*  your 20s, like it's just fucking obvious, obviously. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1684.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1687.76s)]
*  I mean, this is OK. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1688.56s)]
*  But there's some better videos of him where it just, you know, shows this preposterous [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1690.6s)]
*  physique that, you know, there's a responsibility that you have to people that are listening [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1697.4399999999998s)]
*  to you. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1702.9199999999998s)]
*  And if you don't want to talk about it, that's one thing. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1703.52s)]
*  But if you do talk about it, there's a responsibility that you have to people that are listening [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1706.08s)]
*  to you. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1709.72s)]
*  And I think you have to be honest. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1710.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1711.92s)]
*  Which is why I'm honest about it. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1712.24s)]
*  I just I don't think there's anything wrong with taking hormone replacement. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1713.56s)]
*  I think it's actually wise. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1717.08s)]
*  I think it's healthier. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1718.44s)]
*  I feel way better than I did before I was doing it. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1719.44s)]
*  And I started doing it when I was like 37, 38. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1723.08s)]
*  And even then, I was just taking like the cream. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1726.16s)]
*  I was taking testosterone cream. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1729.28s)]
*  And like right away, I was like, oh, my God, I feel so much better. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1731.3600000000001s)]
*  Everything felt better. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1734.8s)]
*  I don't think it's wrong. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1736.08s)]
*  I think it's smart. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1738.12s)]
*  But you got to be honest. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1739.8s)]
*  What do you think an A-list actor should do if they were asked point blank in an interview [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1742.1999999999998s)]
*  on like a movie, like they're promoting a movie that they just did where they just piqued [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1746.28s)]
*  their physique. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1750.8s)]
*  And it's clear to the person who can discern what's going on. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1751.4399999999998s)]
*  Like Thor. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1755.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1756.0s)]
*  Let's just say Hemsworth is in an interview. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1756.1999999999998s)]
*  Do you think what do you think he should answer when he's asked point blank? [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1758.04s)]
*  Like, did you use any enhancement? [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1761.28s)]
*  Well, Mickey Rourke did. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1763.8799999999999s)]
*  Shout out to Mickey Rourke. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1765.8799999999999s)]
*  When Mickey Rourke did The Wrestler, he told everybody. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1767.28s)]
*  I think he did one of those shows, like Letterman or Colbert or something like that. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1770.56s)]
*  He was like, oh, I was on a ton of shit. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1776.32s)]
*  Yeah, he was like, oh, I talk a lot of stuff. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1778.52s)]
*  Because there's definitely an argument. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1780.36s)]
*  Mickey's kind of wild, though. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1781.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1782.44s)]
*  There's definitely an argument to be made that when you have such an impressionable [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1782.96s)]
*  and massive audience that if you say, this is what it took to get here, it very much [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1786.24s)]
*  could influence the trajectory of certain younger men who are trying to aspire to be [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1791.84s)]
*  like you. So I see both sides of the coin for sure. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1796.56s)]
*  So it's kind of an interesting scenario for some of the actors, because I think just [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1800.8799999999999s)]
*  unspokenly, some of these interviewers know to not ask the question. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1805.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1809.52s)]
*  But it's just an interesting scenario in which I would wonder what the best answer is if [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1810.0s)]
*  it's just point blank yes. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1816.04s)]
*  Well, let me tell you a case. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1817.48s)]
*  There was a guy who got really jacked for a superhero role, and he did a friend of mine's [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1819.1599999999999s)]
*  podcast, and he said to him before the podcast, I'll talk about anything, but do not ask me [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1823.84s)]
*  about drugs. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1828.8799999999999s)]
*  Just please don't talk to me about steroids or drugs. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1829.9599999999998s)]
*  It was the number one thing he did not want to talk about. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1833.1599999999999s)]
*  I think studios and the massive amount of money that's involved in a film, the one thing [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1837.8s)]
*  they don't want is to jeopardize any of the potential income. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1847.36s)]
*  And if you come out and say, you know, the only way I got this way for The Hulk is I had to take massive [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1852.8s)]
*  amounts of steroids, and this is just how it is. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1858.68s)]
*  People are going to get upset. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1861.8799999999999s)]
*  Oh, you cheated. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1863.0s)]
*  And there's a mentality as you go further down the line that people are less and less educated [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1864.2s)]
*  about the realities of fitness and physiques. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1869.44s)]
*  As you go further and further down the line, there's a mentality where people like Barry Bonds cheated. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1872.64s)]
*  Mark Maguire cheated. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1878.08s)]
*  Those are cheaters. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1880.32s)]
*  Or Lance Armstrong. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1881.8s)]
*  Yeah, Lance Armstrong cheated. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1882.68s)]
*  And they're just uneducated. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1885.64s)]
*  And unfortunately, we're playing to that. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1887.04s)]
*  And mainstream television is so woefully piss poor at interviewing these people and pressing them. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1890.44s)]
*  And they let them off the hook every time. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1897.88s)]
*  Every single time, whether it's Thor, whether it's Hemsworth, or any of these people who got [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1900.48s)]
*  super fucking jacked for a movie, like Wolverine. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1906.28s)]
*  Like, cut the fucking shit. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1910.28s)]
*  They're as wild as apparently he's coming back to be Wolverine again. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1912.68s)]
*  But they're going to CGI it. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1916.1200000000001s)]
*  Oh, they are. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1917.36s)]
*  Yeah, he said he can't do that anymore. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1918.4s)]
*  And he's probably in his 50s. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1921.64s)]
*  He's probably like, I am not doing this. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1925.8s)]
*  I'm not going to commit to fucking killing myself potentially. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1927.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1931.04s)]
*  I mean, what do you think a guy like that gets on to get that big? [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1931.72s)]
*  I mean, what kind of stuff? [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1935.92s)]
*  I've never gotten that big. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1937.16s)]
*  So when you get that big, what do you want? [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1938.68s)]
*  Well, Wolverine, I feel like his physique was largely low body fat, more so than massive [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1941.68s)]
*  amounts of size. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1948.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and that one, that's a good point. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1949.44s)]
*  The most stacked he's been is that picture right there, basically. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1952.0400000000002s)]
*  And you can just see it in the traps. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1955.48s)]
*  Yeah, that's actually achievable. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1956.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1958.44s)]
*  Guys have definitely, that Paul Sklar guy is built like that. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1959.3600000000001s)]
*  It's just in the condensed time frame and the unique circumstances imposed on these [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1961.96s)]
*  individuals who go into the prep not looking like anything. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1967.0s)]
*  Like that's where it gets unrealistic. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1971.4s)]
*  And they're just completely transforming in a matter of like 12 weeks. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1973.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1976.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1977.64s)]
*  Looks pretty jacked there. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1978.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1979.44s)]
*  Look, he got massive. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1980.44s)]
*  He probably took some shit. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1981.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1983.0s)]
*  But like Hemsworth got bigger than that. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1983.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1985.68s)]
*  But he also has better genetics for sure. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1986.52s)]
*  I actually talked to his trainer. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1989.28s)]
*  It was for the first role he ever did, the first Thor movie. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1990.88s)]
*  He had this guy who was like Chris Duffin or something. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1995.6s)]
*  I forget the guy's name. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1998.7199999999998s)]
*  But that guy outsourced a trainer who is local to Chris to work with him. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=1999.52s)]
*  And that guy claims he had, I asked him point blank. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2006.0s)]
*  He was like, I have no idea what they were doing. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2008.76s)]
*  Like even the guy who was literally with him in the gym, [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2011.36s)]
*  he could be lying to my face though too. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2014.04s)]
*  But he said he had no recollection of them, no idea that they were doing anything. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2015.8799999999999s)]
*  As far as he knows, it was all natural. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2021.76s)]
*  I'm just like, yeah. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2023.92s)]
*  It's a weird world, isn't it? [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2027.0800000000002s)]
*  Like where you're supposed to kind of be full of shit about that stuff. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2028.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2031.52s)]
*  Because it's so obvious to people. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2032.3200000000002s)]
*  Like one of the interesting things. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2035.24s)]
*  I don't actually think it's problematic, by the way, for somebody to juice up [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2039.04s)]
*  for a role to represent a superhero character. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2042.44s)]
*  It's more when they lie, but they also have marketing and or products [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2045.64s)]
*  centered around their physiques and what they achieve for that role. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2051.48s)]
*  Like, for example, with Hemsworth, he has like this app that sold for $200 million [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2055.08s)]
*  that is centered around workouts and stuff. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2058.28s)]
*  But some of the marketing around that will be like, train like Thor. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2061.72s)]
*  You know, this is what Thor did, how to get his physique sort of thing. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2065.76s)]
*  That's where it gets kind of murky, in my opinion, more so. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2069.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2072.76s)]
*  Well, I don't think there's anything wrong with doing steroids [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2074.36s)]
*  to achieve that sort of physique for a movie either. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2077.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2079.8s)]
*  I do think there's something wrong with lying about it. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2080.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2083.84s)]
*  But there's also, if you went on a show. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2084.6800000000003s)]
*  See, when Mickey Rourke did it, he did it for The Wrestler [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2087.8s)]
*  when he talked about it. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2091.7200000000003s)]
*  He talked about doing steroids for The Wrestler. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2092.76s)]
*  And that was a movie that wasn't really about a hero. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2094.96s)]
*  It was about a guy who's down and out, and he's all fucked up, [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2098.88s)]
*  and he's doing drugs, and he's a mess. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2101.7200000000003s)]
*  It's not an admirable character that people would aspire to be. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2105.8s)]
*  Like, you know, like Black Adam. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2110.72s)]
*  When you see The Rock, and he's standing there with his shirt off, [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2113.9199999999996s)]
*  with his shorts on, there's not a man alive [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2118.4399999999996s)]
*  who doesn't want to be built like that. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2120.3999999999996s)]
*  They all want to be built like that. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2121.4399999999996s)]
*  So if he's telling you that he's not doing anything to get that, [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2122.72s)]
*  and I don't know if he is, is he telling people? [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2127.7599999999998s)]
*  Does he say, I've never taken steroids in my life? [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2130.2s)]
*  Does he say that? [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2132.16s)]
*  He said in one instance that when he was 18, [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2132.9199999999996s)]
*  him and his friends took something, and it gave him gynecomastia, [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2136.2799999999997s)]
*  and then he never touched it again or something like that. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2140.08s)]
*  That seems suspect. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2142.16s)]
*  Super suspect. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2143.7999999999997s)]
*  First of all, when you're 18, just doing something once [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2144.92s)]
*  is not going to give you gyno. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2147.68s)]
*  It could. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2149.56s)]
*  Could it really? [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2150.2799999999997s)]
*  The most prevalent I've seen of gyno development [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2151.4s)]
*  is in individuals who, like, without enough information, [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2154.7999999999997s)]
*  went into haphazard use of like a prohormone or like an oral steroid [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2159.0s)]
*  without understanding the pharmacology around it, [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2163.2s)]
*  and then fucked themselves up. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2165.68s)]
*  One time? [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2166.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2167.84s)]
*  Really? [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2168.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2169.08s)]
*  Like you do like a heavy cycle of D-ball or something, [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2169.56s)]
*  get some gyno and? [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2171.68s)]
*  No shit. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2172.96s)]
*  I thought it would take a few cycles. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2173.68s)]
*  To develop into like a significant matured titty, [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2175.68s)]
*  then yeah. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2179.72s)]
*  But like, it depends on the genetic predisposition, [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2181.4s)]
*  because some guys get gyno just through puberty too. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2184.08s)]
*  Really? [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2186.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2187.16s)]
*  Oh, it's just a natural thing that just fucks up. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2187.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2190.2s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2190.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2191.7999999999997s)]
*  Well, him saying that he did something once when he was 18, [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2192.56s)]
*  he got gyno, like how did you take care of it? [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2195.0s)]
*  What would you do to get rid of the gyno? [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2198.04s)]
*  Yeah, presumably. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2199.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2200.8s)]
*  You have to have an operation. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2201.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2201.96s)]
*  Like, people need to understand, like, that's not fluid. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2202.36s)]
*  It's like a gland gets bigger, right? [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2204.36s)]
*  Yeah, it's like literal glandular tissue [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2206.64s)]
*  that you need to get like surgically removed. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2208.44s)]
*  Have you ever seen it, the operation? [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2210.2799999999997s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2212.08s)]
*  I've done videos on it. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2212.6s)]
*  Oh, that's right you have. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2213.56s)]
*  It's horrible. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2214.7599999999998s)]
*  It's like you're pulling those little alien chest [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2216.16s)]
*  busters out of your titty. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2218.2799999999997s)]
*  It's amazing how much mass there is behind those things. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2219.4s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2222.2s)]
*  No, they like even for such like a little something that's [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2223.0s)]
*  barely protruding cosmetically just at an objective look, [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2226.84s)]
*  when you actually look at what came out, it's like, damn. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2230.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2233.2400000000002s)]
*  That's a fuck ton of tissue. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2233.48s)]
*  It's a fucking egg. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2234.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2235.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, it's gross. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2236.2000000000003s)]
*  But I don't mean, if that's always, [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2238.76s)]
*  if he's saying that, that's all he's ever done, [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2240.6400000000003s)]
*  that's crazy talk. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2242.5200000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2243.76s)]
*  It's like at that point, it's like, it's weird. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2244.28s)]
*  It's like trying to half tell the truth, [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2246.88s)]
*  but not at all at the same time. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2248.5200000000004s)]
*  Also, when you look at his physique [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2251.2400000000002s)]
*  in the early days of the WWE. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2252.96s)]
*  Oh, nothing in comparison. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2254.76s)]
*  Go to like the early days of the Rock. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2257.2s)]
*  I mean, he was like very athletic. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2259.68s)]
*  I mean, great genetics, big, strong guy. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2263.48s)]
*  But he didn't look anything like he looks now. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2266.92s)]
*  The mass and the striations and the vascularity. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2269.44s)]
*  This version of him did, but like this version [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2273.52s)]
*  definitely didn't. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2275.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2276.32s)]
*  Like that version. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2277.16s)]
*  I mean, he's fit. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2278.52s)]
*  On the right. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2279.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2280.28s)]
*  Looks good. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2280.6s)]
*  But look at the difference there. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2281.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2283.08s)]
*  That's that hair then. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2284.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2285.68s)]
*  I mean, looks very fit. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2286.18s)]
*  I mean, he's a fucking, he's pretty jacked. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2288.52s)]
*  That's more recent because that's the crazy tattoo. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2291.48s)]
*  That's him now. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2294.8399999999997s)]
*  I mean, this is much older. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2296.48s)]
*  I mean, he's a fucking massive, heavily muscle, muscle guy. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2297.8799999999997s)]
*  Some shots of him where it's just like. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2302.72s)]
*  So what kind of stuff do you think? [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2305.56s)]
*  Well, that was, he looks pretty good there. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2307.68s)]
*  He just doesn't look lean. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2310.56s)]
*  I think there was like type in The Rock, Scorpion King. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2311.88s)]
*  I think that was an old enough movie where [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2316.2000000000003s)]
*  it was like on the red carpet, the guy just [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2318.36s)]
*  looked like a totally, I don't know, [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2320.2400000000002s)]
*  like a shell of what he is now. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2323.56s)]
*  And that was a long, I'm not bad. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2324.8s)]
*  This is bad CG. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2328.32s)]
*  I actually never. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2329.6800000000003s)]
*  Maybe this isn't a good example. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2330.44s)]
*  Why don't you look red carpet. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2332.96s)]
*  That's pretty good. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2334.92s)]
*  Yeah, that's good. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2335.92s)]
*  I forget which. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2336.92s)]
*  Well, maybe on the red carpet, he was off the cycle. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2338.32s)]
*  There was one picture where it just [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2340.68s)]
*  looked like dramatically different. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2342.2s)]
*  I don't remember exactly what year it was. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2344.2799999999997s)]
*  But OK, it wasn't that year. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2346.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, he looks pretty big. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2349.6s)]
*  Look, he's a giant dude, massive human being. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2352.12s)]
*  And clearly when he's lean and he looks great. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2355.04s)]
*  But what do you think you would have [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2359.16s)]
*  to do to achieve that kind of a physique at 50? [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2362.7599999999998s)]
*  First of all, you wouldn't maintain that kind of mass [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2365.64s)]
*  as you naturally got older normally. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2367.8799999999997s)]
*  No, definitely not. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2370.68s)]
*  Again, there's a reason why I feel [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2372.72s)]
*  that your body naturally down regulates a lot of processes [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2375.56s)]
*  too, potentially to conserve, stay alive longer. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2378.6s)]
*  Because the bigger of a human you are, [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2382.2s)]
*  the faster you're going to die in general. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2384.2799999999997s)]
*  I don't see many seven foot guys walking around [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2386.7599999999998s)]
*  at 80 plus years old personally. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2389.0s)]
*  Very few. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2391.2799999999997s)]
*  Isn't Bill Russell was one of the few? [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2391.96s)]
*  He passed away. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2394.2799999999997s)]
*  How old was he though? [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2395.32s)]
*  He was quite old. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2396.2s)]
*  Yeah, I think he got close to 90. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2397.08s)]
*  OK. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2399.2799999999997s)]
*  But in general, even bodybuilders, [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2400.52s)]
*  again, they're subjecting themselves [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2402.24s)]
*  to absurd amounts of drugs. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2403.68s)]
*  But at the same time, the sheer body weight and the stress [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2404.84s)]
*  it imposes on all organ systems and the longevity of everything [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2408.56s)]
*  internally, not just like, it's all something [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2411.88s)]
*  that accelerates you towards death faster, essentially. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2415.2799999999997s)]
*  So it's like total antithesis of longevity [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2419.56s)]
*  at the end of the day. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2423.2799999999997s)]
*  So yeah, you're definitely not going [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2424.68s)]
*  to be able to sustain that at 50, even on HRT. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2426.16s)]
*  He's going to have to transiently push the envelope [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2429.96s)]
*  fairly often if he's doing multiple roles [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2433.4s)]
*  on a consistent basis that require this look. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2435.44s)]
*  And it seems like he's been pretty fucking dialed [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2437.68s)]
*  about maintaining it year over year now. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2439.88s)]
*  Yeah, he's never really gotten thin or fat [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2441.96s)]
*  or never shrunk down and built back up. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2444.36s)]
*  There's definitely something about once you've built [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2447.44s)]
*  the tissue, you can retain it with a very modest amount [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2449.44s)]
*  or at least to some extent. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2454.16s)]
*  It's still going to typically be something [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2455.92s)]
*  outside of what would be normally achievable [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2457.64s)]
*  in terms of your hormone production, [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2460.56s)]
*  because if you went totally naturally, [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2462.12s)]
*  you would just fucking melt away. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2463.2799999999997s)]
*  But a lot of it is the building the muscle, [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2465.08s)]
*  I'm sure you can attest to, building muscle [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2468.12s)]
*  is magnitudes harder than it is to just hold your physique. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2470.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, so you could get away with maybe working out [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2473.2s)]
*  a few times a week with very moderate volume [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2476.4s)]
*  and maintain exactly what you have, [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2478.64s)]
*  but to actually build, you're going to have to go [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2480.2s)]
*  into a surplus, you're going to have to increase your volume, [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2481.7599999999998s)]
*  you're going to have to increase your rest, [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2483.7599999999998s)]
*  your sleep quality, duration, et cetera. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2485.92s)]
*  Like it's all very demanding. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2488.32s)]
*  So it wouldn't be unthinkable that, or unfathomable, [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2489.44s)]
*  whatever the terminology would be, [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2493.88s)]
*  that he would use a shit ton or a decent amount, [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2494.96s)]
*  blast, got to where he is, and then he could sustain it [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2498.1600000000003s)]
*  with what he deems to be not healthy, [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2500.4s)]
*  but healthy enough that he can sort of just cruise on it [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2503.32s)]
*  and hold his shape for whatever, [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2506.2000000000003s)]
*  the foreseeable future of him doing these kind of roles. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2508.6s)]
*  So what kind of stuff do you think someone would take [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2510.88s)]
*  to achieve that sort of physique? [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2513.8s)]
*  I don't think it's very dissimilar from what, [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2515.96s)]
*  like Liver King, everything he's doing [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2518.6800000000003s)]
*  is pharmacy-derived and prescribed. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2520.32s)]
*  Like there was a reason why the compounds he chose, [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2523.0800000000004s)]
*  some of them are, like for example, Winstral, [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2525.5600000000004s)]
*  not something that has a clinical application generally, [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2528.52s)]
*  but like there are certain medications [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2531.1600000000003s)]
*  that are only available through a pharmacy legally. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2532.84s)]
*  You can get prescribed by a doctor [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2535.92s)]
*  and get overseen by a doctor. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2537.1600000000003s)]
*  So like I would imagine The Rock [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2538.48s)]
*  is not touching stuff like Trenvalone, [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2540.7200000000003s)]
*  that's like an underground product [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2542.6s)]
*  that is not going to have pharmaceutical standards [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2544.56s)]
*  for its production, and it's just not like a safe compound. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2546.92s)]
*  Not that any of them are safe, [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2550.44s)]
*  but generally it's not the most risk-averse compound. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2551.96s)]
*  And what are the risks, especially when someone's like 50 [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2557.3199999999997s)]
*  and you're doing that, what are the risks? [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2560.88s)]
*  Significant heart enlargement [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2563.7599999999998s)]
*  and impeding the actual function [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2566.6s)]
*  of the cardiovascular system in general, kidney stress, [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2568.88s)]
*  depending on if you're using oral steroids or not, [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2571.72s)]
*  liver toxicity, neurodegeneration is going to be accelerated [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2573.8399999999997s)]
*  from high doses of androgens. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2578.0s)]
*  Like across the board it's just like broad spectrum, [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2580.24s)]
*  terrible for you, above A-shart-C. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2583.08s)]
*  So it is that interesting moral dilemma. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2586.24s)]
*  Like what do those people say when they're confronted [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2589.3999999999996s)]
*  if they do want to be this, [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2593.16s)]
*  you know, they're trying to be this character [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2596.8399999999997s)]
*  that is a superhero and it's something [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2600.12s)]
*  that people are going to look up to, [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2602.84s)]
*  and they're a role model for young men. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2604.64s)]
*  Look at this fit, healthy guy who's in the gym, [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2607.92s)]
*  pushing it every day, the hardest worker in the room, [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2610.72s)]
*  like that kind of deal. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2613.68s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's a weird, interesting scenario. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2614.84s)]
*  And it's wild because it's like, you can know for certain [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2619.04s)]
*  the rock wouldn't be who he is if it wasn't for the steroids. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2621.56s)]
*  For certain. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2624.92s)]
*  It's physique. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2625.7599999999998s)]
*  The physique is the selling point. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2626.58s)]
*  It's like a really hot girl who decided to just, [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2627.92s)]
*  you know, let herself go. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2631.6800000000003s)]
*  There's no way. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2633.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2634.36s)]
*  Yeah, and to answer your question earlier, [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2635.2000000000003s)]
*  like what you would do to get that, [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2636.56s)]
*  like I imagine he was probably, [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2637.8s)]
*  he's probably prescribed like a base amount of testosterone [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2639.76s)]
*  that he like titrates up and down [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2642.8s)]
*  based on whatever he needs to do for his roles. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2644.32s)]
*  I imagine he's on like a base of growth hormone, [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2646.52s)]
*  and then he probably intertwines in things like that, [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2648.84s)]
*  here and there, like I imagine for joint support, [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2651.64s)]
*  but also like additional fullness, anabolism, et cetera. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2653.64s)]
*  And then maybe like Anivar is like a hardening agent [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2656.88s)]
*  when he's preparing for roles that need to get like [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2659.1600000000003s)]
*  more dry and grainy looking. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2661.2400000000002s)]
*  But in general, it's gonna be stuff that is prescribable [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2663.1600000000003s)]
*  by his overseeing, whoever it is that's overseeing his care. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2665.54s)]
*  It's gonna be pharmaceutical grade compounds [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2669.76s)]
*  that you can have actual medical oversight. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2671.92s)]
*  Like no doctor is gonna recommend you take like [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2675.2000000000003s)]
*  a trend balloon, for example. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2677.2000000000003s)]
*  He looks amazing. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2678.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it looks like a fucking [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2682.28s)]
*  bodybuilder level front double. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2683.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, he looks fucking great. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2685.68s)]
*  The question is, [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2687.3199999999997s)]
*  like if these guys are doing media events, [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2691.08s)]
*  and they're going on these talk shows, [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2694.2s)]
*  and they're being interviewed for interviews and stuff, [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2697.3199999999997s)]
*  and they're not telling the truth about that, [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2700.62s)]
*  are they even being questioned? [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2704.2799999999997s)]
*  I mean, is anybody questioning the rock or questioning [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2706.04s)]
*  hamsworths? I think they kinda know [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2708.3199999999997s)]
*  it's like not gonna turn out well if they ask. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2709.6s)]
*  Like they'd probably get like fired, I imagine, [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2712.48s)]
*  if they actually ask that question to them. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2714.28s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2715.96s)]
*  Cause I think that's an important topic. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2717.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, no, and it just gets swept under the rug, [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2719.1600000000003s)]
*  cause it's like, it's nothing about answering the question [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2721.28s)]
*  other than getting the breaking story is conducive [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2724.76s)]
*  to that reporter's like longevity of their career. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2726.88s)]
*  Right. Essentially. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2729.92s)]
*  It's really unfortunate that even HRT [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2731.32s)]
*  has gotten such a weird, [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2735.6000000000004s)]
*  it's in this very bizarre category [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2738.5600000000004s)]
*  of things that people avoid discussing. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2741.52s)]
*  I know guys that are sheepishly asking questions [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2744.2400000000002s)]
*  and trying to get on it now, that are friends with mine, [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2749.5800000000004s)]
*  that like 10 years ago used to mock me for it. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2752.7000000000003s)]
*  They're like, why are you taking that stuff? [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2756.48s)]
*  I'm like, why aren't you taking it? [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2757.7400000000002s)]
*  What's wrong with you? [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2759.84s)]
*  No, even the celebrities that are honest, [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2760.92s)]
*  or with exception of maybe like Mickey Rourke or something, [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2762.6400000000003s)]
*  are like pretty careful and calculated [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2766.0s)]
*  about how they even represent their HRT, [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2768.84s)]
*  which could be like a therapeutic amount. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2770.92s)]
*  Like there was one interview, it was like, [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2773.7200000000003s)]
*  I think it was Kumail Nanjiani talking with, [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2776.48s)]
*  what's his name, Rob McElhenney from It's Always Sunny. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2780.48s)]
*  I forget the name of the show, [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2783.58s)]
*  but they're like, obviously Kumail totally, [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2784.48s)]
*  completely morphed his physique. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2787.2000000000003s)]
*  Morphed? Yeah. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2788.8s)]
*  The guys are fucking mutated in like a year. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2790.12s)]
*  And then Rob McElhenney did like a wild transformation too. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2792.2000000000003s)]
*  And they were talking about like, [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2795.92s)]
*  there, I think it was Rob who said like, [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2797.6s)]
*  my testosterone level is like, [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2800.52s)]
*  he said something finicky to basically sort of deflect, [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2802.0800000000004s)]
*  but also say like, yeah, I'm on HRT kind of thing. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2804.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2808.32s)]
*  Whoa. Yeah. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2809.88s)]
*  He's jacked now. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2810.96s)]
*  Yeah. He got a... [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2812.04s)]
*  He's in his 40s, how old is he? [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2813.1200000000003s)]
*  He did that on purpose too, to gain a bunch of weight. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2814.8s)]
*  Yeah. To be funny for the show. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2816.7200000000003s)]
*  And... Oh, so you got fat? [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2818.6800000000003s)]
*  You got fat on purpose for the show [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2820.2400000000002s)]
*  and then got ripped on purpose too. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2821.92s)]
*  And he said like, it's really hard as fuck [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2823.52s)]
*  to do that without him being a celebrity [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2825.32s)]
*  and have all the resources he has. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2828.28s)]
*  It's also really bad for you to get fat like that. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2829.48s)]
*  Like to do that for a show. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2832.04s)]
*  Like when people do that for a show, [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2833.52s)]
*  it's like, Jesus Christ. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2835.64s)]
*  What was the context of the, why did he get fat again? [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2837.2400000000002s)]
*  Again, it was like, I think it was like, I don't know, [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2839.72s)]
*  season eight, this show's been on a long time [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2842.32s)]
*  and he's just like, I'm bored. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2844.2400000000002s)]
*  And it's like, it'd be really funny if I got fat. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2845.2s)]
*  And like, that's just the characters. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2847.36s)]
*  Like it was funny. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2848.8s)]
*  How funny would it be if I just ate like shit [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2850.92s)]
*  for four months straight and just got fat as hell? [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2853.08s)]
*  Hilarious, right? [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2855.6s)]
*  Yeah. Didn't Marky Mark do that? [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2856.52s)]
*  Didn't Wahlberg do that for a role? [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2859.68s)]
*  Get really fat for a role? [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2861.48s)]
*  He did. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2862.32s)]
*  That was probably like makeup. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2863.16s)]
*  I don't know if he would let himself go like that. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2864.36s)]
*  I think he did. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2865.72s)]
*  He works, let's see. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2866.56s)]
*  I think he did. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2867.4s)]
*  For pain and gain, him and The Rock were playing [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2868.2400000000002s)]
*  like bodybuilder dudes. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2870.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2871.32s)]
*  And they both gained like quite a bit of size for it. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2872.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2874.6s)]
*  I don't think he ever got like fat though, necessarily. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2875.44s)]
*  But I could be wrong. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2877.32s)]
*  I thought- He gained like 20, it says 20 pounds. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2878.16s)]
*  Okay. What was that for? [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2880.68s)]
*  Yeah. So what was that movie? [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2881.64s)]
*  This could have been for that new movie Father Stew. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2883.28s)]
*  He did, I don't know if it's specifically that. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2884.84s)]
*  Because I remember reading about how- [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2887.2400000000002s)]
*  Wahlberg claims natural too, which is wild. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2888.8s)]
*  30 pounds for Father Stew, yeah. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2892.76s)]
*  There was some guy that I think- [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2894.88s)]
*  He could be natural on the left. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2896.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2899.2000000000003s)]
*  No, he could be. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2900.0400000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2901.0400000000004s)]
*  But I think, I forget who it was, [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2901.88s)]
*  but like somebody had a list of some steroid dealer [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2905.0s)]
*  that had like a list of customers and leaked it. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2908.7200000000003s)]
*  And he was like on the list. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2910.36s)]
*  And then he was questioned by a reporter [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2911.88s)]
*  and he just like, I don't know what you're talking about. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2913.6800000000003s)]
*  I'm all natural. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2916.84s)]
*  That's weird that you, [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2919.76s)]
*  it's just a weird, for someone like you, [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2922.5200000000004s)]
*  who is very well-versed and really understands it. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2925.5600000000004s)]
*  And your show, by the way, for people who don't know, [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2928.44s)]
*  it's called More Plates, More Dates, and it's on YouTube [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2930.6800000000003s)]
*  and it's a goofy name, but it's a great show. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2933.2400000000002s)]
*  But it's- [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2935.48s)]
*  I'd love to ask you about that like direction, by the way, [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2936.32s)]
*  because I've been thinking about like, should I change it? [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2939.1200000000003s)]
*  Like as I get older, I sort of like- [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2941.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2942.48s)]
*  No? [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2943.5200000000004s)]
*  I don't think you have to. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2944.36s)]
*  I mean, it's kind of funny. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2945.2400000000002s)]
*  Okay. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2946.84s)]
*  And everybody knows it. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2947.6800000000003s)]
*  It's catchy, but it's like, I made it when I was like, [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2949.28s)]
*  I don't know, like early 20s. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2950.8s)]
*  And it's just like- [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2952.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2953.2s)]
*  Clearly as I delve more into the rabbit hole [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2954.24s)]
*  of like the science-based community [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2956.48s)]
*  and like talk with guys like Huberman and stuff, [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2958.4s)]
*  like I feel more and more disconnected with what it was, [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2960.04s)]
*  which was just like self-improvement for men, [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2963.28s)]
*  like broad spectrum. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2964.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2966.0s)]
*  And I get more into like the professional interactions [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2966.84s)]
*  with guys like you, guys like in the science-based community. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2969.56s)]
*  It's like really, sometimes I feel like I don't even align [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2972.08s)]
*  with my own like channel name. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2975.2s)]
*  Like it's weird. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2976.64s)]
*  Right, I know what you mean. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2977.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2978.92s)]
*  Yeah, well the thing is like everyone knows [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2979.7599999999998s)]
*  that name right now. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2982.2s)]
*  And the problem is like, if you did change it, [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2983.32s)]
*  there would be at least a period of time [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2985.72s)]
*  where people were just like, where is he? [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2987.52s)]
*  Where'd he go? [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2989.24s)]
*  Like why is he this now? [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2990.08s)]
*  There would be confusion. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2992.32s)]
*  Yeah, like even this episode would be named [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2993.88s)]
*  more plates, more dates. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2995.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2996.2s)]
*  You're not gonna- [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2997.04s)]
*  I don't think it's a problem. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2997.88s)]
*  I mean, I get it though. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=2999.2s)]
*  It's kind of a funny story though [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3000.7599999999998s)]
*  that you started when you were in your early 20s [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3001.96s)]
*  and now you're actually more mature. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3003.92s)]
*  Yeah, I try to, sometimes when I see channels [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3008.04s)]
*  like PewDiePie or some of these channel names [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3010.6800000000003s)]
*  that are just objectively kind of, I don't know, [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3013.92s)]
*  silly or whatever, I'm like, oh, they did fine. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3016.6400000000003s)]
*  So who am I to think I should do differently or something? [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3019.52s)]
*  But- [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3023.04s)]
*  I think you're fine. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3023.88s)]
*  Cause everybody knows, it's just, they know the story. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3024.92s)]
*  It's like you've had the channel for a long time. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3027.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3029.7200000000003s)]
*  I think it's fine. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3030.56s)]
*  Look at MrBeast, it's the biggest channel on there. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3031.4s)]
*  Great example. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3032.84s)]
*  What is MrBeast mean? [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3034.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3035.3599999999997s)]
*  I think it was his gamertag when he was- [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3036.2s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3037.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3038.12s)]
*  Everyone knows who he is now. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3038.96s)]
*  Yeah, perfect. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3040.12s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I don't think you have to change it. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3041.0s)]
*  I think the negatives of changing it outweigh the positives. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3042.52s)]
*  Okay. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3046.08s)]
*  Yeah, and also the positive, it's like, [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3046.9199999999996s)]
*  is part of the charm of the show [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3049.04s)]
*  is that it has a goofy name. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3051.52s)]
*  Cause like, you know, you're obviously saying [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3053.3599999999997s)]
*  it's very intelligent shit and very knowledgeable shit, [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3055.3599999999997s)]
*  but you have the silly more plates, more dates. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3058.16s)]
*  I feel like there's a barrier to entry [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3060.3599999999997s)]
*  that might be higher for the demographic as I age though, [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3062.2s)]
*  where it's like harder to take the, I don't know, [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3067.0s)]
*  an initial piece of content as a new viewer. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3070.7999999999997s)]
*  You're just like, what is this like [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3073.0s)]
*  douchey fucking bodybuilder channel? [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3074.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3075.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3076.64s)]
*  But when people listen to you talk, [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3077.48s)]
*  also the complete lack of retention in your production. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3079.04s)]
*  I mean, you're sitting there [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3081.7599999999998s)]
*  with a fucking air conditioner behind you. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3082.6s)]
*  What is that? [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3084.2s)]
*  Is that a- [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3085.04s)]
*  What is the secret bro? [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3085.8799999999997s)]
*  I can't tell. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3086.7s)]
*  You can't tell what it is? [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3087.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3088.3599999999997s)]
*  It looks like something that Gru would have [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3089.2s)]
*  in the Minions movie. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3093.16s)]
*  It's, but it's fine. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3096.16s)]
*  I don't think you need to change that. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3098.3599999999997s)]
*  But you know, people like you in this, [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3100.3599999999997s)]
*  in the world that you live in, [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3104.52s)]
*  where you're constantly examining the efficacy [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3106.08s)]
*  of supplements and of modalities and strategies [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3109.8399999999997s)]
*  for fitness and health and longevity [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3113.72s)]
*  and all these different things. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3116.56s)]
*  For you, when you see people talking about being natural, [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3117.7599999999998s)]
*  they're clearly not natural. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3122.44s)]
*  It's offensive, isn't it? [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3124.0s)]
*  Yeah, definitely. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3125.32s)]
*  Yeah, for me it's offensive too. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3126.84s)]
*  It's like, I get a fe- [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3128.44s)]
*  Like I've rarely talked shit about people. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3129.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3131.52s)]
*  But the liver king thing, I was like, [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3132.36s)]
*  get the fuck out of here. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3133.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, the thing that rubbed me the wrong way the most [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3134.84s)]
*  about it and is kind of like what compelled me [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3137.76s)]
*  to even make a video was because he was seeking coaching [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3140.0s)]
*  without the disclosure of what the plan was to do [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3144.76s)]
*  with that help. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3149.6800000000003s)]
*  So it's like, I am going to enhance myself [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3150.78s)]
*  and I'm already enhanced as is in order to blow up [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3154.46s)]
*  by this exact date, but I'm not gonna tell you, [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3159.26s)]
*  even the guy who I'm trying to seek help from potentially, [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3162.1800000000003s)]
*  this is what I'm doing with it. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3165.38s)]
*  So it's like, you're almost aiding [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3167.1400000000003s)]
*  in the fraudulent activity a little bit. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3168.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3171.82s)]
*  And it's just like, I don't know, [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3172.6600000000003s)]
*  it just like was crossing the line of ethics [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3173.5s)]
*  and morals for me a little bit. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3175.9s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3177.42s)]
*  And it's also, it's just bad when people [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3178.34s)]
*  are very high profile and they're super duper jacked [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3181.42s)]
*  and they're trying to say they just get it [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3184.78s)]
*  from eating kidneys. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3186.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3187.54s)]
*  It's just stupid. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3188.38s)]
*  It's just not good for anybody. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3189.2000000000003s)]
*  No. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3190.34s)]
*  You know, like anyone like yourself who knows what, [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3191.1800000000003s)]
*  like that's an unusual amount of muscle [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3195.38s)]
*  for a human body to possess. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3198.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3200.6600000000003s)]
*  I mean, he's massive, massive. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3201.48s)]
*  Yeah, just insulting the intelligence of people who are. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3202.58s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3205.46s)]
*  But the good thing is that though it does, [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3206.46s)]
*  like especially the way you covered it, [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3209.9s)]
*  you covered it brilliantly. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3211.78s)]
*  And I appreciate it. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3213.2200000000003s)]
*  And it's a very long and comprehensive video [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3214.06s)]
*  that goes over the entire saga, [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3216.9s)]
*  how it began, who he is, what he's done, [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3219.18s)]
*  all the statements that he's made [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3222.94s)]
*  about being natural on multiple occasions. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3224.54s)]
*  It illuminates people to the realities of physiques [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3227.86s)]
*  and of this dilemma that we're talking about [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3232.34s)]
*  with like role models and superheroes and these actors. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3234.9s)]
*  Actors are in the most insulated world. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3239.62s)]
*  Like it's very brave when an actor just comes out [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3242.3s)]
*  and says their opinions about controversial subjects [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3246.1s)]
*  or gives, expresses some opinion that's not mainstream [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3248.82s)]
*  because that's dangerous. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3255.02s)]
*  Like for your career. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3256.58s)]
*  If you want to make it in show business in Hollywood, [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3258.02s)]
*  like what Mark Wahlberg has done is brilliant. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3261.42s)]
*  He shuts the fuck up. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3263.42s)]
*  And when he talks, he doesn't talk much [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3265.82s)]
*  and he doesn't talk about anything heavy duty [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3267.38s)]
*  and occasionally does and they come down for him. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3269.3s)]
*  They come after him when he does. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3272.82s)]
*  You gotta be real careful. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3275.02s)]
*  Because if you just start saying, [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3276.26s)]
*  look at me, look at these guns. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3277.38s)]
*  You don't get like this normally. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3280.3s)]
*  This is not normal. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3282.34s)]
*  You know, guys with 21 inch arms, [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3283.82s)]
*  like this is not normal. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3286.2200000000003s)]
*  How do you think I'm doing steroids? [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3287.58s)]
*  Like they don't, but they don't do it. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3289.94s)]
*  They can't do it. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3291.02s)]
*  They literally can't. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3291.86s)]
*  A guy like Mark Bell is a great example. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3293.46s)]
*  He's telling you, I've done steroids my whole life. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3297.06s)]
*  Look at the size of him. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3299.54s)]
*  He's giant. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3300.38s)]
*  That's why I got so confused that he didn't think [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3301.22s)]
*  that the liver king was full of shit. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3303.7s)]
*  And that's why, I don't know. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3305.06s)]
*  Like I don't know if he just really likes him as a human [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3306.14s)]
*  or what his, like if he didn't want to call him out [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3309.74s)]
*  to his face or what, but it's like, it was, [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3312.34s)]
*  I'm having a hard time grasping [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3316.38s)]
*  that he didn't think that was the case. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3318.78s)]
*  But I know he thinks other people he's friends with [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3322.06s)]
*  or is aware of are natural, [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3324.2999999999997s)]
*  who look even more insane than liver king. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3326.34s)]
*  Like who? [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3328.1s)]
*  Mike O'Hern, you ever seen him? [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3328.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3330.34s)]
*  Mike O'Tren. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3331.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3332.66s)]
*  I saw that guy on a plane once. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3333.5s)]
*  He was on a flight with his dog. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3336.74s)]
*  He's gigantic. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3338.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3340.1s)]
*  And he says he's natural? [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3341.1s)]
*  Yeah, he even responded to the liver king thing [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3342.62s)]
*  and he was like. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3345.2599999999998s)]
*  What? [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3346.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3347.2999999999997s)]
*  Oh my God, he's so big. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3348.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3350.18s)]
*  Is that possible? [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3351.02s)]
*  Well, that's. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3352.46s)]
*  Is it possible? [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3353.3s)]
*  That's the thing is like you could, [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3354.14s)]
*  like who knows man, fuck. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3357.38s)]
*  You know, if Coleman looks the way he did, [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3359.42s)]
*  is it possible this guy could be the hyper-extreme outlier? [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3362.38s)]
*  Isn't Michael Hearn like 50? [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3365.1s)]
*  He's like 53 or something. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3367.62s)]
*  The thing though that's problematic [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3369.58s)]
*  is he does nothing to prove otherwise. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3371.14s)]
*  Like he could easily go get a blood test [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3374.62s)]
*  and a drug test and prove people wrong. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3377.18s)]
*  Like Paul Sklar did. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3379.62s)]
*  Yeah, like even with Paul, [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3381.1s)]
*  like he still did what I think he was capable of [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3383.22s)]
*  with his resources to get tested [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3387.8199999999997s)]
*  and he showed he went out of his way to do it. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3389.3399999999997s)]
*  But like there was this one guy, Matt Does Fitness. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3390.98s)]
*  He's seen as like this fake Natty in the fitness industry [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3393.38s)]
*  because he looks amazing at his body composition [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3397.8599999999997s)]
*  and he was just sick of it. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3401.8599999999997s)]
*  So he contacted me to facilitate like actual drug testing. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3403.1s)]
*  Like as if I was a USADA entity or something. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3406.7s)]
*  And he put up a budget of money [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3409.7s)]
*  in the thousands of dollars range [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3413.18s)]
*  to get randomly drug tested with urine [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3414.74s)]
*  and concurrent blood testing. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3416.8199999999997s)]
*  And like I carried, chose all the tests he was getting [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3418.66s)]
*  to be as bulletproof as possible. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3421.3399999999997s)]
*  And we would have a guy literally just show up [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3423.54s)]
*  when he's fucking lifting at home, wherever, [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3426.06s)]
*  pull his blood and get his urine and then test it to prove. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3428.62s)]
*  And he's been doing it for like half a year now [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3431.94s)]
*  and concurrently showing that his lifts are not going down. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3434.94s)]
*  So not only is his body composition staying the same, [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3438.38s)]
*  but his lifts have not changed. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3440.98s)]
*  And he's passing the drug tests, [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3442.26s)]
*  which are like bulletproof tests [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3443.54s)]
*  facilitated by somebody who's not himself [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3445.7000000000003s)]
*  because he's not walking into the lab on his own, [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3447.7400000000002s)]
*  on his own accord whenever he wants sort of thing. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3450.46s)]
*  So like there's, I'm not saying that everyone should go [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3452.9s)]
*  do that because that was like a hard thing to coordinate. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3455.06s)]
*  But that would be like- [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3457.94s)]
*  Who is this guy again? [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3458.78s)]
*  What's his name? [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3459.78s)]
*  Matt Does Fitness. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3460.62s)]
*  You got him? [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3461.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3462.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, so that guy's natural. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3463.58s)]
*  That's incredible. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3464.4s)]
*  That's, but also he looks like he's about 30. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3465.2400000000002s)]
*  How old is that guy? [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3468.04s)]
*  He's like 36, I think. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3468.88s)]
*  Is he? [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3470.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3471.48s)]
*  Well, that's extraordinary. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3472.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3473.6800000000003s)]
*  That's very difficult to achieve [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3474.52s)]
*  and that guy must work very hard. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3475.84s)]
*  And- [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3478.4s)]
*  He's a genetic freak. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3479.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3480.08s)]
*  For sure. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3480.9s)]
*  Excellent genetics, works very hard, [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3481.7400000000002s)]
*  but kudos to him for taking all of those tests and- [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3483.04s)]
*  Yeah, like it was like more bulletproof [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3487.7200000000003s)]
*  than like actual fucking UFC testing. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3489.48s)]
*  Now let's follow up with that guy in 15 years [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3491.72s)]
*  and see what he looks like. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3494.4399999999996s)]
*  Cause if he can keep that Paul Sklar level of fitness, [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3495.9599999999996s)]
*  cause Sklar is I think 50, right? [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3499.52s)]
*  Or 51. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3501.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3502.3999999999996s)]
*  Like, but that's, it's so funny, [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3503.24s)]
*  the eye test when you look at someone, [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3506.7599999999998s)]
*  you go like, that's possible, that's possible. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3509.7599999999998s)]
*  Like when I look at Paul Sklar, that's possible. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3512.2799999999997s)]
*  When you look at The Rock, you go, get the fuck out of here. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3514.3999999999996s)]
*  Get the fuck, when you look at the Liver King, [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3516.56s)]
*  get the fuck out of here. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3518.6s)]
*  When you look at that Michael Hearn guy. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3520.08s)]
*  Yeah, no, the Michael Hearn example is, [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3521.7599999999998s)]
*  it's wild that he leans. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3523.7599999999998s)]
*  He doesn't go as hard as Liver King, I guess, [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3525.7599999999998s)]
*  in that he's like, but it's weird [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3529.52s)]
*  because he definitely likes to make, poke fun at it, [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3532.0s)]
*  even though he will not go out of his way [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3534.92s)]
*  to show any blood testing or do anything [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3536.52s)]
*  to reinforce his natural status other than, [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3538.96s)]
*  oh, look at me at like 15 years old, [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3541.8s)]
*  I'm bigger than you now. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3543.64s)]
*  So like, obviously it's just natural progression. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3544.64s)]
*  It's like, yeah, you're a genetic freak, [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3547.12s)]
*  which is why you look the way you do on gear now. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3549.02s)]
*  Right, exactly. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3550.98s)]
*  That's a very good point. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3551.94s)]
*  Because there's a lot of people that, [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3554.02s)]
*  if they took testosterone or they took [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3555.38s)]
*  a bunch of different steroids, [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3558.1s)]
*  they still would look like shit. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3559.54s)]
*  Yeah, oh, tons of guys. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3560.78s)]
*  Yeah, sometimes you'd be shocked [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3562.38s)]
*  that if you walk into a public gym, [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3563.54s)]
*  like who's actually on gear and who's not, [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3564.9s)]
*  sometimes the guys who are natural [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3566.38s)]
*  look better than the guys on gear. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3567.54s)]
*  Yeah, Jesus Christ. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3569.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3570.98s)]
*  Imagine saying that you're 53 years old [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3572.5s)]
*  and you're natural and you're built that way. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3575.2599999999998s)]
*  That is crazy. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3577.82s)]
*  Yeah, like that's insulting when you're like. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3579.22s)]
*  It's insulting. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3580.14s)]
*  I mean, the guys obviously got incredible genetics [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3581.18s)]
*  and obviously works very hard, but also, [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3583.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3587.1s)]
*  Saucy. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3587.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3589.62s)]
*  There's a little saucy. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3590.46s)]
*  Yeah, he sold some potentially unethical products too. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3592.18s)]
*  Oh, what are those? [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3596.5s)]
*  Like he said, duck eggs were like far superior [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3597.8599999999997s)]
*  to normal eggs, which I don't know, [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3600.3399999999997s)]
*  I haven't even looked into the micronutrient proportions [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3602.62s)]
*  of it to see if that's to be true. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3604.94s)]
*  Well, they're bigger. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3606.54s)]
*  But he was selling like a duck egg extract product [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3607.38s)]
*  for like 700 bucks or something. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3610.7400000000002s)]
*  And like very much implying [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3613.26s)]
*  that it was supporting his physique. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3615.1800000000003s)]
*  Duck egg extract. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3617.82s)]
*  Why don't you just go get duck eggs? [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3619.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3621.38s)]
*  I had a duck egg recently, it was terrible. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3622.3s)]
*  It was like one of those things where it's like, [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3624.46s)]
*  oh, you know, like even in cosmetics, [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3625.62s)]
*  they'll like take a peptide, some obscure name [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3627.38s)]
*  and like extract and be like, oh, [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3629.86s)]
*  we put it into this face serum [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3630.94s)]
*  and this thing that came from some natural source. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3632.46s)]
*  It's like the secret for, you know, [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3634.9s)]
*  eternal youth sort of thing. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3636.94s)]
*  Yeah, it was just like the commercialization [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3638.98s)]
*  of the thing that is not responsible for your physique [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3641.1800000000003s)]
*  is like very, very frowned upon. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3643.54s)]
*  Yeah, that should be frowned upon. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3646.6600000000003s)]
*  It's very deceptive, you know? [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3649.38s)]
*  I mean, it's one thing if you're actually using [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3651.42s)]
*  those products and you believe in them [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3653.3s)]
*  and this is why you're selling them. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3655.78s)]
*  But when you're just doing it for a money grab [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3657.5s)]
*  and also you're on the sauce. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3659.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3662.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3662.98s)]
*  One thing that you've done that's really good, [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3663.86s)]
*  that's really important with your channel [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3665.86s)]
*  is you've highlighted the horrific negative effects [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3667.3s)]
*  that some people encounter. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3671.5800000000004s)]
*  And one of them was this young man, [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3673.3s)]
*  I'd never seen anything like it. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3675.02s)]
*  This young man that got on steroids in his back. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3676.86s)]
*  Oh, just exploded. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3679.86s)]
*  In his chest too, right? [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3681.1400000000003s)]
*  Like acne, like you couldn't believe. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3682.54s)]
*  What is that? [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3686.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, so some people, they have genetic predispositions [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3687.7000000000003s)]
*  that'll make them like either hyper respond [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3690.42s)]
*  sometimes in a positive way, [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3693.54s)]
*  also in the side effect aspect. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3694.7000000000003s)]
*  Like usually the role will be, [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3696.02s)]
*  if you push the envelope and go into like [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3697.7400000000002s)]
*  super physiological dosage territory, [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3699.58s)]
*  typically one thing will at least go wrong for you. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3702.9s)]
*  You will probably have some sort of, [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3705.94s)]
*  I'm not saying this to be always the case [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3708.42s)]
*  because there are like more responsible ways to go about it [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3709.86s)]
*  to minimize the risk of this happening [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3711.98s)]
*  or potentially avoid it altogether to some extent. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3713.66s)]
*  But like, you know, hair loss, gynecomastia, acne, et cetera. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3716.1s)]
*  And this guy, he just had brutal acne breakout after. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3719.14s)]
*  What's the name of the video so we can take a look at it? [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3723.9s)]
*  It's tough to say, [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3725.94s)]
*  cause I've done a couple of acne videos. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3726.94s)]
*  You would just type in acne and you'd see like [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3729.06s)]
*  at least a few examples on my channel. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3730.94s)]
*  Just go to more plates, more dates. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3732.74s)]
*  The guy's back. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3734.42s)]
*  You can see all the scarring, [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3735.5s)]
*  you can see some of the active ones, [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3736.7s)]
*  but like this is pretty f**king desolated, dude. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3738.58s)]
*  This is his back from the top and this is his face, [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3741.66s)]
*  oh, his neck and his chest. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3745.7s)]
*  Pretty, pretty intense, dude. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3748.1000000000004s)]
*  To the point where, yeah. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3750.0600000000004s)]
*  There's a few, if you just typed in. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3752.9s)]
*  Yeah, if you just went on the search. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3755.6200000000003s)]
*  Oh, Jesus Christ. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3757.0600000000004s)]
*  Look at that guy with his chest bleeding. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3758.6600000000003s)]
*  The guy in the middle there. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3760.82s)]
*  What the f**k, man? [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3762.5s)]
*  That's so crazy. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3764.9s)]
*  It looks like he got attacked by a shotgun. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3766.5s)]
*  Doesn't it? [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3769.46s)]
*  It looks like he got shot. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3770.3s)]
*  There's little holes all over his chest. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3771.86s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's hard to predict too, [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3774.3s)]
*  because some of these guys will just end up with [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3777.22s)]
*  brutal acne without having a very. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3780.46s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3783.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, that guy got desolated. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3784.14s)]
*  Now is that the scarring on his back? [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3786.18s)]
*  Yeah, so that was a unique scenario [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3788.94s)]
*  where a lot of people think his gear was just like, [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3791.2599999999998s)]
*  because again, it doesn't just come to your responsive gear, [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3794.22s)]
*  it's also the quality of its preparation. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3796.54s)]
*  Like if you have toxic carrier oils, [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3798.54s)]
*  like unhealthy solvents, [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3800.7s)]
*  you have a response to it that is unique [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3802.66s)]
*  from another individual, [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3804.7799999999997s)]
*  or it depends on the quality of your products [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3806.6200000000003s)]
*  and is why pharmaceutical grade is always going [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3808.9s)]
*  to be preferable as well. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3811.82s)]
*  That makes sense. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3814.54s)]
*  That makes sense. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3815.54s)]
*  So it's not just the steroid itself. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3816.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3818.1s)]
*  You're getting cheap s**t. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3819.54s)]
*  My God, he doesn't even look any different. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3821.06s)]
*  That's what's crazy. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3823.78s)]
*  He gets a lot of heat because he shows his aftermath, [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3824.94s)]
*  but he used to actually body build pretty intensely [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3827.7000000000003s)]
*  and he had a respectable physique. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3830.7000000000003s)]
*  And is that what he looks like now? [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3833.9s)]
*  He's off everything now. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3835.5s)]
*  Does he still have that f**ked up back though? [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3836.86s)]
*  It's getting a lot better, [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3838.66s)]
*  because he took Accutane, he came off the gear, et cetera. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3839.94s)]
*  He claims his source was like a highly vetted pure source, [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3842.98s)]
*  so it's tough to say if it was actually just the gear [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3846.46s)]
*  or if it was just like s**t gear plus response to the gear [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3849.14s)]
*  or what, but. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3851.94s)]
*  So now he looks pretty natural. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3852.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3854.42s)]
*  And now is that, does he show any photos of his back now? [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3855.26s)]
*  Yeah, he does. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3858.78s)]
*  Oh, he's still got those f**ked up scars all over him. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3859.62s)]
*  Yeah, I kind of feel for the guy [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3862.66s)]
*  because he does put out information [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3864.42s)]
*  to try and make people aware of what happened to him, [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3868.46s)]
*  but now because he's natural, [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3871.3s)]
*  people will very much take that and be like, [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3872.58s)]
*  why would you even take gear to look like this? [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3874.98s)]
*  And it's like, that's not what he looked like [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3877.3s)]
*  when he was on gear. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3878.6600000000003s)]
*  Wow. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3880.38s)]
*  Yeah, he had aspirations to be a competitive bodybuilder [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3882.2200000000003s)]
*  and do certain things that, [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3885.02s)]
*  it just wasn't in the cards for him genetically, obviously, [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3886.82s)]
*  but yeah, that was like a wild one. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3889.46s)]
*  That whole bodybuilding world is so strange [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3892.2599999999998s)]
*  because it literally is impossible [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3894.66s)]
*  to compete without steroids. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3897.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3899.1s)]
*  It's impossible. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3900.1s)]
*  There are. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3901.2599999999998s)]
*  If you're gonna be in Mr. Olympia. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3902.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3904.2999999999997s)]
*  Oh yeah, for sure, you gotta be on s**t. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3905.58s)]
*  Isn't that wild? [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3907.4599999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3908.4199999999996s)]
*  There's a whole level, even things like grappling, [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3909.2599999999998s)]
*  like jujitsu, which is one of the dirtiest sports [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3913.2999999999997s)]
*  in, I mean, it's certainly the dirtiest combat sport, [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3916.98s)]
*  like openly dirty. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3920.46s)]
*  There's still people that are clean, [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3922.94s)]
*  that do really, like the Rotolo brothers at 19 years old, [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3924.46s)]
*  they're f**king, they look completely natural [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3926.98s)]
*  and they're assassinating people. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3929.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3931.34s)]
*  Just natural. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3932.1800000000003s)]
*  There's a lot of natural people, Mikey Musumechi, [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3933.02s)]
*  natural, a lot of them, tons of them, [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3934.78s)]
*  but not in bodybuilding. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3937.58s)]
*  No, and it's wild because it's like, [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3939.1s)]
*  the fitness industry, you would think is, [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3941.7400000000002s)]
*  the epitome of health and fitness is the whole point. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3943.86s)]
*  Right. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3946.9s)]
*  So it's just so paradoxical [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3947.7400000000002s)]
*  where you have this industry built off of [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3949.74s)]
*  portraying a healthy lifestyle, [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3952.66s)]
*  but then you're also doing the most paradoxical, [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3954.2599999999998s)]
*  unhealthy thing to your body simultaneously. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3957.22s)]
*  But then somehow the visual cosmetic representation [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3960.54s)]
*  of the unhealthy drug use portrays a more healthy [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3963.2599999999998s)]
*  and vibrant, vitality look to people. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3966.46s)]
*  It's just like, oh, this jack guy must be the result [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3970.1s)]
*  of the fitness lifestyle. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3972.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, the strange thing is when they're in peak form, [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3973.8599999999997s)]
*  they're literally on death's door. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3977.02s)]
*  Oh yeah, their kidneys are about to fucking [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3978.62s)]
*  peter out and they're just ready [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3981.5s)]
*  to fucking pass out essentially. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3983.9s)]
*  Yeah, for people that don't know, [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3985.14s)]
*  when you see a bodybuilder on stage [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3986.22s)]
*  and they're fully shredded and ripped and flexing, [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3988.06s)]
*  they are so dehydrated. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3990.74s)]
*  They're ready to black out. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3993.02s)]
*  Yeah, there's definitely safer ways to do it, [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3995.02s)]
*  but ultimately going down to deathly low body fat levels, [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=3996.8199999999997s)]
*  cutting water, doing all these things, [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4000.5s)]
*  it's just, there's nothing healthy about it. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4002.38s)]
*  Your body was never meant to get there fucking ever. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4005.06s)]
*  Not only that, your body never naturally would keep [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4007.94s)]
*  that amount of mass while you have such low body fat. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4010.3s)]
*  No, you're fighting all mechanisms of biology [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4013.7000000000003s)]
*  until you get there. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4017.6600000000003s)]
*  Your body is like, what are you doing to me? [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4018.5s)]
*  Isn't it interesting though that that to people [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4020.58s)]
*  represents the ultimate physique? [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4023.02s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it's fucked. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4025.34s)]
*  Looking like you're dying, that's the ultimate physique. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4026.82s)]
*  I have a friend that got so lean, [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4028.98s)]
*  he couldn't even walk around because his feet, [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4030.7400000000002s)]
*  the padding on the bottom was essentially gone [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4033.7400000000002s)]
*  because he had no fat anywhere. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4037.34s)]
*  So it was painful for him to walk and to sit, [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4038.86s)]
*  his ass bones would be sticking out [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4041.3s)]
*  and he couldn't even sit on a chair [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4044.2200000000003s)]
*  without padding and stuff. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4046.1400000000003s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4047.6200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it gets nuts. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4048.46s)]
*  But wouldn't you also imagine that's massive inflammation [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4049.6200000000003s)]
*  in all of his joints and that everything [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4052.6600000000003s)]
*  is just on high alert. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4055.06s)]
*  True, that too, yeah. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4056.82s)]
*  It's just an agony. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4057.94s)]
*  Yeah, and it's like you're not even able to sleep. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4059.06s)]
*  God, it's so bad. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4061.42s)]
*  You're just starving as hell and you're slamming stimulants, [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4062.42s)]
*  Adderall and whatnot, to crush your appetite [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4065.06s)]
*  in order to sustain your absurd deficit. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4066.82s)]
*  There was a family that we knew in California [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4069.34s)]
*  and the husband was just a normal guy with a regular job [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4072.98s)]
*  and he decided to enter into a bodybuilding competition. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4078.9s)]
*  And he got really low body fat and did the whole deal, [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4082.42s)]
*  did the competition, and then afterwards experienced [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4087.6600000000003s)]
*  organ failure and died. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4090.46s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4091.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, for nothing. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4092.82s)]
*  Yeah, it's like often. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4094.1400000000003s)]
*  36-year-old guy who looked great. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4095.5s)]
*  Yeah, oftentimes the wild thing is [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4098.38s)]
*  it's not like a sport that is highly monetizable anyways. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4101.3s)]
*  Your prize money will be nothingness [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4106.1s)]
*  unless you're at the top of the sport. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4109.74s)]
*  And even then, it's like in general, [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4112.06s)]
*  I know guys who make more money in the fitness industry [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4114.74s)]
*  as just influencer bros than the most top tier bodybuilders [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4117.02s)]
*  because the bodybuilders are so dedicated to their craft [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4122.42s)]
*  and eating and training and sleeping. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4125.46s)]
*  They don't even have the mental bandwidth [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4127.54s)]
*  to do anything entrepreneurial outside of that. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4129.26s)]
*  So even though they're the top echelon in the sport, [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4131.58s)]
*  even their earning potential is capped by what [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4135.14s)]
*  is imposed on them from the sport [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4138.94s)]
*  to maintain just this fucking brontosaurus physique. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4140.38s)]
*  And how long can they do that? [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4144.86s)]
*  It depends. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4147.94s)]
*  Some of them die in their late 20s. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4148.54s)]
*  It's fucked. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4150.46s)]
*  Jesus. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4151.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4152.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4153.5s)]
*  And it is no different than anorexia. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4155.18s)]
*  No, yeah. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4157.900000000001s)]
*  It's just body dysmorphia. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4158.740000000001s)]
*  When you are around those guys, the worst thing anybody [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4161.9400000000005s)]
*  can ever say to one of them, like, hey, man, do you lose weight? [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4164.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4167.280000000001s)]
*  And they'll be like, what the fuck? [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4167.780000000001s)]
*  You see that? [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4169.02s)]
*  What are you saying? [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4169.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4170.34s)]
*  You think I lost weight? [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4170.820000000001s)]
*  What are you saying? [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4171.780000000001s)]
*  And it'll fuck with their hate, even if they're massive. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4172.700000000001s)]
*  They're gigantic. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4175.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4176.34s)]
*  And it's like ultimately, I think the liver king thing [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4176.820000000001s)]
*  is a hyper extreme perfect example of that very situation. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4179.38s)]
*  I believe he had extreme body dysmorphia, [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4184.46s)]
*  just like most bodybuilders wanted to juice it up, [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4186.66s)]
*  even though it's contrary to what he is promoting [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4189.3s)]
*  in his ancestral ways. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4191.9s)]
*  And just hope people wouldn't find out. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4192.9800000000005s)]
*  Honestly, I don't give them that much benefit of the doubt. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4194.86s)]
*  I think what he was doing was just pure deception. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4199.66s)]
*  I don't think there's body dysmorphia involved. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4202.82s)]
*  I think even if he wasn't promoting it, though, [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4205.14s)]
*  he would have still looked like that and done that stuff. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4207.14s)]
*  I bet he would have looked close. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4209.92s)]
*  Didn't you go back to his early, early Instagram? [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4212.74s)]
*  He's definitely incentivized to push it harder [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4215.0199999999995s)]
*  when he's a front-facing public figure. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4218.58s)]
*  I'm not doubting that. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4221.62s)]
*  I'm just saying I do believe he would not just [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4222.46s)]
*  be on therapeutic HRT even if it wasn't for the message. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4224.74s)]
*  I think he very much enjoys progressing and getting [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4230.179999999999s)]
*  a good physique and working the way he does. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4232.62s)]
*  Yeah, you might be right about that. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4234.54s)]
*  Which is what a lot of bodybuilders, [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4235.299999999999s)]
*  ultimately, when they get into this, [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4236.86s)]
*  typically, it's not for, oh, I just [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4239.78s)]
*  want to win Mr. Olympia. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4241.82s)]
*  For some of them, very few, potentially, that [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4243.46s)]
*  is the end goal. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4245.7s)]
*  But it often stems from an insecurity of whatever [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4247.0599999999995s)]
*  it is from your youth, or you feel your physique is [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4251.66s)]
*  inadequate, whatever it is. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4253.58s)]
*  And then you compensate aggressively [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4254.74s)]
*  by going hardcore into the chemical enhancement realm, [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4256.7s)]
*  even at the detriment of your own health, in order [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4260.7s)]
*  to look a certain way. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4262.62s)]
*  Yeah, and that's where that whole thing [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4264.3s)]
*  about him being a charlatan from your video comes into play. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4266.38s)]
*  Because he's selling this ancestral line of supplements, [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4269.22s)]
*  where it's all, and also, I have a friend who [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4273.3s)]
*  is very knowledgeable about this stuff. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4278.18s)]
*  And he expressed some concern. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4279.780000000001s)]
*  And I actually reached out to Paul about this, Paul Saladino. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4281.54s)]
*  And Paul says that it's very, very little concern. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4285.18s)]
*  But he was saying that when you're dealing with organ meat, [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4287.58s)]
*  and there's possibilities of getting prions involved, [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4291.46s)]
*  and this was where mad cow disease came to play. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4298.02s)]
*  You're talking about cow brains and all [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4301.02s)]
*  these different things. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4303.660000000001s)]
*  He was concerned. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4304.660000000001s)]
*  And this is a very knowledgeable person. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4306.540000000001s)]
*  I reached out to Paul. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4308.22s)]
*  Paul, he gave me a very knowledgeable and really well [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4310.1s)]
*  thought out response. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4314.900000000001s)]
*  And particularly where they get their organs, [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4316.860000000001s)]
*  everything is grass fed, grass finished. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4319.22s)]
*  It's all pasture raised animals that are raised [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4322.38s)]
*  in the most natural of conditions. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4324.820000000001s)]
*  Are you talking about the raw organ meats [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4326.94s)]
*  they eat on camera, or literally the actual supplements? [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4329.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah, the actual supplements. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4333.66s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4334.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4335.5s)]
*  My friend, by the way, my friend is not [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4336.98s)]
*  involved in the organ supplement business. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4339.62s)]
*  So maybe he doesn't understand how it's run. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4342.0199999999995s)]
*  But he's like, when you deal with organs, [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4343.86s)]
*  you're opening up the door for, if you don't absolutely [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4346.339999999999s)]
*  know the source of these organs. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4352.179999999999s)]
*  But no one's disputing whether or not organs are good for you. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4354.58s)]
*  Organs, they're so good for you. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4357.22s)]
*  Heart and kidney and particularly liver, so good for you. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4359.82s)]
*  And that's what's hopefully the outcome [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4364.94s)]
*  isn't at the detriment of that message too, [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4367.58s)]
*  because it's like, I hope people don't just take the liver king [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4369.74s)]
*  debacle as everything he said was nonsense. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4372.7s)]
*  Because he had a lot of good information, [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4375.18s)]
*  a lot of stuff that was motivating, [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4378.46s)]
*  stuff that could have been implemented to improve [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4380.74s)]
*  your quality of life, health, vitality, et cetera. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4382.9s)]
*  It's just unfortunate the way he went about doing it. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4385.86s)]
*  The real liver king is Paul Saladino. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4388.179999999999s)]
*  He's really eating that. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4390.62s)]
*  And go to Paul Saladino's Instagram, [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4391.58s)]
*  show some pictures of his physique. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4394.219999999999s)]
*  If you want to look like that guy, no hormone replacement. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4395.98s)]
*  Just get sunlight outside. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4399.0599999999995s)]
*  He's super healthy. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4400.98s)]
*  All he eats is organic fruits and meat and organ meat. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4402.62s)]
*  And that's it. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4405.98s)]
*  And one thing I think Paul would be on board with, [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4407.219999999999s)]
*  but is just because it's not ancestrally consistent [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4409.38s)]
*  to be on exogenous synthetic TRT, [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4413.26s)]
*  it's not like you should live in a suboptimal state [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4416.7s)]
*  or quality of life because you're [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4419.9800000000005s)]
*  trying to be ancestrally consistent. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4421.7s)]
*  Right. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4424.22s)]
*  Look at Paul. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4424.74s)]
*  That's healthy. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4425.66s)]
*  That's real. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4426.62s)]
*  What that guy's built like, that is 100% natural and achievable. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4427.78s)]
*  And he really does. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4432.1s)]
*  He lives in Costa Rica. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4433.74s)]
*  He serves every day. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4435.06s)]
*  He eats nothing but healthy food. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4436.38s)]
*  I feel like our podcast, it's the thumbnails [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4439.14s)]
*  on the bottom right there. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4441.780000000001s)]
*  But I grilled them pretty hard in a respectful way, [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4442.780000000001s)]
*  I felt, of a lot of the incongruencies or concerns [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4446.14s)]
*  about the diet model and micronutrient shortcomings. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4450.14s)]
*  There are certain more difficult things [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4454.780000000001s)]
*  to get in through a nose to tail diet like magnesium. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4456.54s)]
*  And we touch on a lot of that stuff. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4459.700000000001s)]
*  Does he recommend supplementation [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4461.9800000000005s)]
*  with magnesium to compensate for that? [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4463.660000000001s)]
*  Or how does he handle that? [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4465.700000000001s)]
*  He thinks that the RDAs for them, [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4466.82s)]
*  like many other vitamins and minerals, [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4469.3s)]
*  are potentially off because he does a lot of blood chemistry [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4471.0599999999995s)]
*  to see where he's at. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4475.42s)]
*  And he's quite hyper aware of his biofeedback [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4476.46s)]
*  and knows what's going on. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4479.259999999999s)]
*  And he's never been deficient from what he can tell. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4480.42s)]
*  So he believes that if warranted, [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4483.46s)]
*  I'm sure he would recommend it. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4485.94s)]
*  But he thinks that he gets enough from his diet. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4487.259999999999s)]
*  But he's not opposed to supplementation [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4489.34s)]
*  when warranted. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4491.58s)]
*  There are certain individuals who might benefit from, [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4492.46s)]
*  extra choline. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4495.62s)]
*  If your diet too is, even if it's nose to tail, [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4497.62s)]
*  if you're trying to lose weight or something [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4501.02s)]
*  and you're in a little bit of a deficit or whatever, [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4502.9400000000005s)]
*  maybe you might be a little bit deficient [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4505.820000000001s)]
*  in one micronutrient. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4507.54s)]
*  And then it's justified to take a supplement with it. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4508.54s)]
*  I'm sure he would be on board with that. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4511.62s)]
*  And that is the whole premise of the supplements [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4514.02s)]
*  to begin with, is if you don't want to eat a fucking heart, [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4516.62s)]
*  here's heart. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4519.1s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4519.74s)]
*  And the fact that you could swallow it very easily [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4521.02s)]
*  and mix it with all your other supplements. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4523.82s)]
*  What is a natural source of magnesium? [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4525.82s)]
*  Off the top of my head, as far as what I would say [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4529.98s)]
*  is the most magnesium dense foods, [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4532.299999999999s)]
*  it's tough to say off the top of my head. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4537.78s)]
*  I kind of forget exactly. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4539.82s)]
*  The best way to get it? [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4541.5s)]
*  Yeah, for me, I use a magnesium bisglycinate supplement [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4543.46s)]
*  personally, just because I use this thing called chronometer. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4546.179999999999s)]
*  And I plug my diet in. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4548.9s)]
*  And then it shows a full breakdown [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4549.94s)]
*  of my micronutrient proportions in terms [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4551.32s)]
*  of minerals as well as micronutrients, [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4553.58s)]
*  like all the vitamins. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4555.38s)]
*  And for me, it's even difficult to get magnesium in. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4556.66s)]
*  So it's like, if I need to backfill that [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4559.98s)]
*  with a supplement, I feel it justified. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4562.3s)]
*  Do you ever do epsom salt baths? [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4564.42s)]
*  No, never. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4566.34s)]
*  That's a great way to get magnesium. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4566.98s)]
*  Oh, is it? [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4569.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4569.86s)]
*  It's one of the things that I found from doing the isolation [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4570.42s)]
*  tank, because a sensory deprivation tank has [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4573.18s)]
*  1,000 pounds of magnesium in that water. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4575.98s)]
*  We have just bags of epsom salts. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4579.66s)]
*  It's all fucking magnesium. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4582.02s)]
*  So you're pouring that stuff into the water, [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4583.900000000001s)]
*  and then you float in it. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4585.860000000001s)]
*  And it like is? [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4587.700000000001s)]
*  There's an article on magnesium from epsom salts baths. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4588.820000000001s)]
*  And you can like absorb it? [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4595.3s)]
*  Yeah, your skin absorbs it. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4596.660000000001s)]
*  OK. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4597.620000000001s)]
*  I mean, I don't know if it's enough [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4599.02s)]
*  and how often you'd have to do it. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4601.02s)]
*  But I know that a lot of people get a benefit from epsom salts [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4602.9800000000005s)]
*  baths. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4605.820000000001s)]
*  It's supposed to be very good for the muscles. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4606.42s)]
*  What is that, Jamie? [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4608.34s)]
*  No evidence that it absorbs? [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4609.9800000000005s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4611.94s)]
*  While relaxing in a hot bath may help soothe aching muscles, [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4612.74s)]
*  there's no evidence that people absorb bath water magnesium [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4615.46s)]
*  through their skin. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4618.299999999999s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4619.0199999999995s)]
*  If you look up the molecular mass of magnesium, [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4619.66s)]
*  I would be doubtful that it's low enough to actually [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4622.7s)]
*  absorb transdermally. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4626.54s)]
*  Oh, that's interesting. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4628.099999999999s)]
*  There's this rough rule. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4629.94s)]
*  It's like if the molecular mass of a molecule [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4631.66s)]
*  is under 500 Daltons, then it can absorb through the skin [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4634.46s)]
*  and get absorbed. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4638.82s)]
*  Go back to what you just said. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4640.339999999999s)]
*  Look at this. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4641.54s)]
*  Magnesium can be absorbed through the skin [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4641.94s)]
*  for a convenient, effective way to increase your magnesium [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4643.82s)]
*  levels. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4646.18s)]
*  When magnesium is absorbed through the skin, [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4646.7s)]
*  this process is called transdermal absorption. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4648.74s)]
*  From a company that sells a topical magnesium product. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4651.3s)]
*  Is that what it is? [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4653.62s)]
*  Type in magnesium molecular mass and just see what comes up. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4655.3s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4659.58s)]
*  It's so funny why you can read stuff like that and just think [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4660.82s)]
*  that that's. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4664.06s)]
*  Yeah, molecular weight. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4664.62s)]
*  OK, here we go. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4665.66s)]
*  OK. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4667.22s)]
*  What does that mean? [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4667.7s)]
*  So from the surface, you would think [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4669.14s)]
*  that this is something that could absorb transdermally. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4671.660000000001s)]
*  Because it's what is that number? [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4674.42s)]
*  2, 4.305U. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4676.1s)]
*  What does that mean? [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4678.660000000001s)]
*  I'm more familiar with. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4680.1s)]
*  Atomic mass units? [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4680.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, with Daltons. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4682.14s)]
*  I know the 500 number is the threshold whereby [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4684.06s)]
*  it's supposed to be able to absorb. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4686.5s)]
*  Which I think is also written as grams per mole. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4690.18s)]
*  So with that level, you believe it [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4693.58s)]
*  is absorbable transdermally. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4696.38s)]
*  I would think. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4698.58s)]
*  So why did that other article. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4699.1s)]
*  Not my expertise, by the way. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4700.34s)]
*  I appreciate that. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4702.66s)]
*  But isn't it funny though that the first result [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4703.62s)]
*  was it can't be absorbed. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4706.22s)]
*  The second result was it can. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4707.22s)]
*  And then you look at the molecular weight [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4708.7s)]
*  and you looked at it and you're like, [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4710.34s)]
*  well, it looks like it can. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4711.42s)]
*  Exercise performance and recovery [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4713.98s)]
*  while relaxing in a hot bath may help soothe aching muscles. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4715.46s)]
*  There's no evidence that people absorb bath water magnesium [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4720.54s)]
*  through the skin. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4723.98s)]
*  On the other hand, oral supplementation [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4724.98s)]
*  But this is the same article. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4727.26s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4728.54s)]
*  That's where it came from. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4728.94s)]
*  I was trying to find out why they were saying it. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4729.66s)]
*  What year is this? [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4731.38s)]
*  That was Healthline. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4732.86s)]
*  2017. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4734.26s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4735.62s)]
*  I don't know what this says. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4736.74s)]
*  I don't know if they're right. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4737.7s)]
*  I bet they're a bunch of nerds that don't even lift. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4738.54s)]
*  Shut your mouth, nerds. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4740.66s)]
*  What kind of biohacks do you do nowadays besides the. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4743.18s)]
*  The big one that I've been doing that I actually just started [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4746.3s)]
*  doing all this week is cold plunge first thing [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4749.26s)]
*  in the morning. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4752.9s)]
*  I had read this thing about this guy, [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4754.7s)]
*  and then I read some subsequent articles. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4756.94s)]
*  Then I talked to Huberman about it, [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4758.62s)]
*  about there's a great benefit to cold plunge before exercise. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4760.0599999999995s)]
*  And so there is a negative association between cold plunge [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4765.58s)]
*  and hypertrophy. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4770.98s)]
*  So what that means is that if you lift weights [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4772.0599999999995s)]
*  and you just climb right into the cold plunge [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4775.74s)]
*  right afterwards, you actually have less of a benefit [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4778.18s)]
*  from lifting weights because the cold and the anti-inflammation [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4780.9s)]
*  properties actually stop the hypertrophy. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4783.74s)]
*  So the recommendation was always lift weights [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4786.94s)]
*  and then wait multiple hours before you [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4790.0599999999995s)]
*  get into the cold plunge. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4793.0599999999995s)]
*  I really like the cold plunge after cardio. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4794.78s)]
*  Cardio was a big one for me. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4796.7s)]
*  But I also know that there's a great benefit to sauna [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4797.94s)]
*  after cardio because it actually sustains your heart rate. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4801.78s)]
*  So it's like static aerobic exercise. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4804.66s)]
*  So if you do, say like if I do, I really [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4807.34s)]
*  like sprints on the Rogue Echo bike. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4810.58s)]
*  It's like a salt bike. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4813.18s)]
*  I love doing Tabatas on that. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4815.02s)]
*  So I'll do the 20-second with 10-second rest. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4817.22s)]
*  And then I'll go right into the sauna. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4820.06s)]
*  So it's like you're 185 degrees and your heart's [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4821.700000000001s)]
*  already pounding because you just got off the bike [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4824.18s)]
*  and it's fucking brutal. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4826.42s)]
*  But I've noticed an increase in my cardiovascular capability [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4828.62s)]
*  because of that. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4832.14s)]
*  And then what I would do is I'd get into the cold plunge [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4832.900000000001s)]
*  after I was done with all that. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4835.38s)]
*  So I'd do 20 minutes in the sauna and then at 185 degrees [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4836.780000000001s)]
*  and then go right into 34 degrees right after that [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4840.320000000001s)]
*  and do three minutes into the cold plunge. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4843.9s)]
*  Now I've been starting my morning, every morning, [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4845.419999999999s)]
*  as soon as I decided I was gonna do it the whole month, [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4849.54s)]
*  the moment I wake up, I just get out of bed, [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4852.54s)]
*  I put my fucking flip-flops on and I walk out [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4855.82s)]
*  to the cold plunge. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4859.099999999999s)]
*  It's fucking 40 degrees outside. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4859.98s)]
*  And I just take off my clothes and I just climb in there [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4862.0199999999995s)]
*  for three minutes every goddamn morning. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4865.099999999999s)]
*  And I set my phone right at the top of the thing [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4867.54s)]
*  and I put the fucking stopwatch on. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4870.299999999999s)]
*  I go, here we go. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4872.34s)]
*  And it's rough. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4873.58s)]
*  You know what's rough, man? [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4875.46s)]
*  When I first wake up, I don't enjoy waking up anymore. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4876.900000000001s)]
*  Because I enjoy waking up but then there's just nervousness. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4880.26s)]
*  Like shit. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4883.06s)]
*  So today's Friday so I've done it five days in a row. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4884.38s)]
*  But it's this fucking awful feeling [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4886.860000000001s)]
*  that you know you're gonna have to do this. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4890.38s)]
*  Once you're done though, you're probably like hyper alert [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4892.66s)]
*  and ready to roll. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4895.02s)]
*  Oh yeah, hyper alert, ready to roll, [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4895.860000000001s)]
*  you feel pretty fucking good. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4898.3s)]
*  But also I did something I didn't want to do. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4900.3s)]
*  Which I think is for someone like me, [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4903.66s)]
*  it deals with a lot of pressure and stress and anxiety [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4906.74s)]
*  from just being in the public eye and all that stuff. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4910.5s)]
*  I firmly believe that you need something way worse [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4913.54s)]
*  to counter that, that you voluntarily subject yourself to. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4916.900000000001s)]
*  Has it always been, when did that really, [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4920.78s)]
*  has it ramped up more in recent years [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4923.38s)]
*  or have you kind of perpetually dealt with that [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4924.9800000000005s)]
*  since being, I don't know, you've been a public facing [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4926.7s)]
*  person for a long time. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4929.82s)]
*  I've had a, it's like a trickle. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4931.22s)]
*  I've had a trickle of stardom. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4933.3s)]
*  It's slowly ramped up and it's almost like snake venom. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4935.74s)]
*  I've got a little more bitten enough [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4939.74s)]
*  so that I can tolerate it. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4942.0599999999995s)]
*  Because I've seen people that are really young [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4944.0199999999995s)]
*  that get really famous quickly and it just wrecks them. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4946.139999999999s)]
*  It wrecks them psychologically. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4949.34s)]
*  And also they don't understand how to manage the input. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4951.58s)]
*  So they're reading comments about them. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4956.74s)]
*  They're tweeting and then responding to tweets [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4958.82s)]
*  and going back and forth with people in Instagram comments. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4961.86s)]
*  Like, dude, dude, dude, just stop. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4964.38s)]
*  And then I'll- [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4966.179999999999s)]
*  You still do that, eh? [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4967.0199999999995s)]
*  Ignore them entirely. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4967.86s)]
*  I don't fucking read a goddamn thing. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4968.7s)]
*  It's the only way. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4970.22s)]
*  It's the only way you can stay sane. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4971.62s)]
*  My friend's like, I can't help myself. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4973.66s)]
*  I'm like, you 100% can help yourself. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4974.86s)]
*  It's just don't look at it. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4977.139999999999s)]
*  It's not an option. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4977.98s)]
*  I don't have that option. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4979.099999999999s)]
*  There's no option to look at that. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4980.86s)]
*  I post stuff, I keep going. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4982.46s)]
*  And I think that's very important [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4984.86s)]
*  because you're dealing with, you know, [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4987.42s)]
*  with my case on my Instagram, [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4989.219999999999s)]
*  I think it's like 15 million people. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4991.0199999999995s)]
*  That's a lot of fucking people, man. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4993.78s)]
*  That's too many people. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4995.299999999999s)]
*  There's no way you can, that's manageable. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4996.42s)]
*  You can't interact with those people. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=4998.86s)]
*  People could say mean shit to you and it'll hurt your feelings. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5000.7s)]
*  Why would you subject yourself to that? [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5002.86s)]
*  But I think even like articles written about you, [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5005.339999999999s)]
*  you have to have perspective. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5008.98s)]
*  You have to understand like who's right, [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5010.259999999999s)]
*  why are they doing this? [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5012.139999999999s)]
*  They're doing this because you're successful. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5013.0599999999995s)]
*  They're distorting who you are [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5014.38s)]
*  in order to make this look better. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5016.58s)]
*  So you have to do something, I believe, [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5019.06s)]
*  something to offset that. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5021.9800000000005s)]
*  And one of the best things is really brutal exercise. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5023.82s)]
*  Brutal physical exercise and then sauna and cold plunge, [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5027.54s)]
*  in my opinion, are the very best things [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5032.42s)]
*  to mitigate the effects of that [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5035.26s)]
*  because they're so hard to do [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5037.34s)]
*  that the other stuff just seems easy. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5039.900000000001s)]
*  It's like, so someone said something mean about you, [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5041.78s)]
*  whatever. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5044.22s)]
*  Have you ever had like a time you just had to totally [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5045.22s)]
*  disconnect from everything to mentally handle it? [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5048.5s)]
*  Or like, no? [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5051.58s)]
*  You're pretty good about it. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5053.42s)]
*  Yeah, just don't read about me. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5054.42s)]
*  Let's read about other stuff. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5056.099999999999s)]
*  I mean, I feel like you're supposed to, [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5057.46s)]
*  you know, look, there's people that live [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5060.0599999999995s)]
*  in war torn parts of the world. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5062.26s)]
*  There's people that were born in dirt floors [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5064.3s)]
*  and they're dealing with rebels [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5067.78s)]
*  and they hear gunfire in the middle of the night [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5069.98s)]
*  and either their children get killed [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5072.54s)]
*  or their family members get killed. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5075.46s)]
*  That's real problems. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5076.94s)]
*  But the problems of someone saying mean shit [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5078.78s)]
*  about you on Twitter, it only seems mean. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5080.38s)]
*  It seems awful because you're interacting with it. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5083.1s)]
*  If you don't interact with it, it doesn't even exist. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5085.9s)]
*  It's wild how much just your state of mind [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5088.46s)]
*  can influence like how happy or not happy your life is [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5091.1s)]
*  and like how you perceive external stimuli. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5094.02s)]
*  Very, very much so. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5096.26s)]
*  And also the kind of people that you surround yourself with. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5097.46s)]
*  That's crucial. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5100.22s)]
*  You have to have a good tribe. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5102.0199999999995s)]
*  You have to have a good tribe of fun, healthy people. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5103.459999999999s)]
*  If you don't, you're fucked. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5105.54s)]
*  If you have backstabby people or gossipy people [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5107.82s)]
*  or mean people or resentful people [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5112.299999999999s)]
*  or you're constantly dealing with somebody [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5115.5s)]
*  who's like, you know, always fucking falling off the wagon [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5117.0199999999995s)]
*  and you gotta go rescue Mike. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5121.5s)]
*  He's under a bridge shooting heroin, fuck. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5123.0199999999995s)]
*  You know, like if you have enough of those people [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5125.78s)]
*  in your life, they will derail any progress [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5127.66s)]
*  you're trying to make. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5129.82s)]
*  Any self-improvement and self-growth. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5130.78s)]
*  I think, you know, obviously you should be there [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5133.34s)]
*  for your friends if something goes wrong, [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5135.34s)]
*  but you gotta recognize when this is an unstoppable pattern. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5136.82s)]
*  You know, and I'm not just talking about addiction. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5141.0199999999995s)]
*  I'm talking about everything. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5142.86s)]
*  Like with some people it's gambling. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5143.7s)]
*  With some people it's food. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5145.34s)]
*  With some people it's just fucking, [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5146.62s)]
*  some people, they just sabotage their lives. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5150.259999999999s)]
*  And if you're around that person [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5153.54s)]
*  and they're always sabotaging their life [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5154.9s)]
*  and they always expect you to come in and fix it for them. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5156.42s)]
*  Like they can absorb a significant amount [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5158.46s)]
*  of your resources. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5162.86s)]
*  On the other hand, if you have friends that are positive [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5164.9s)]
*  and healthy and thankful and appreciative [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5167.58s)]
*  and they're fun to be around [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5170.22s)]
*  and those people can enhance your life, [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5172.38s)]
*  you enhance their life and everybody grows together [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5174.82s)]
*  and everybody has a good time together. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5178.06s)]
*  That's a big key to being able to manage this stuff. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5179.58s)]
*  As you've exploded, did you like have a conscious shift [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5183.02s)]
*  towards that? [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5185.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5186.82s)]
*  I learned, well I've always been a very loyal friend [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5187.86s)]
*  and I think that it's very important to have good friends [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5192.22s)]
*  and it's also very important to like, [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5196.099999999999s)]
*  I come from the martial arts world. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5198.42s)]
*  In the martial arts world you need training partners [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5200.3s)]
*  and without training partners you never get better. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5203.18s)]
*  You want elite people around you [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5206.099999999999s)]
*  and so that you have to hold yourself up [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5208.54s)]
*  to the standards of their technique and their abilities [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5210.98s)]
*  and it's the only way you get better. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5213.62s)]
*  You get better by being in an environment [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5214.94s)]
*  with a bunch of killers, iron sharpens iron. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5217.02s)]
*  So when I was a kid, from the time I was young, [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5219.5s)]
*  we always valued people who were very, very good. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5223.900000000001s)]
*  You never tried to pretend they weren't good. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5227.46s)]
*  You always valued them and you always looked at their, [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5229.740000000001s)]
*  like oh he's the best at this, like watch how he does this [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5232.740000000001s)]
*  and then you would learn and grow from imitating them [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5235.660000000001s)]
*  or asking them. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5238.700000000001s)]
*  Like most of my martial arts techniques that I learned, [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5240.1s)]
*  no all of them, all of them. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5243.34s)]
*  I learned from other people, all of them. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5245.06s)]
*  I never learned anything on my own. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5247.82s)]
*  Never figured out anything. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5248.66s)]
*  And nothing I do is original. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5249.5s)]
*  Everything that I learned how to do, [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5250.98s)]
*  somebody had to teach me how to do it. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5252.179999999999s)]
*  So I needed someone who was like really good at something [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5253.54s)]
*  that could show me how to do it. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5255.66s)]
*  So when I got into comedy, one of the things [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5256.94s)]
*  that was so shocking was like there's this like denial [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5258.46s)]
*  of other people's value or like why is he getting this [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5262.0199999999995s)]
*  or why is she so successful? [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5266.139999999999s)]
*  My mentality was this martial arts mentality, [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5268.419999999999s)]
*  like look how good he is at marketing. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5271.54s)]
*  Like look how good he is at delivering. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5273.299999999999s)]
*  Look how he holds a pause. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5274.86s)]
*  Like man, look at that stage presence. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5276.139999999999s)]
*  Look at that, look how relaxed he is up there. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5278.46s)]
*  And it was like I wanted to compliment them. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5280.7s)]
*  I'm like dude, how you do that is amazing. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5282.78s)]
*  Like what do you do? [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5284.78s)]
*  Do you consciously do that? [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5285.78s)]
*  Like how do you write? [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5287.179999999999s)]
*  How do you do it? [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5288.139999999999s)]
*  Because like I wanted to treat it like I'm supportive. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5288.98s)]
*  And in the weird world of television and comedy, [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5292.299999999999s)]
*  it was a scarcity and a famine mentality [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5298.86s)]
*  because there was only so many jobs, right? [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5301.78s)]
*  So if you wanted to be on a sitcom, [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5304.06s)]
*  if you and I say we're in the audition room [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5305.54s)]
*  and we're both playing Tom the fucking security guy [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5308.22s)]
*  on a sitcom, if I knew that you're my friend [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5311.780000000001s)]
*  and you're reading, I might fucking derail you. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5314.900000000001s)]
*  I might say, you look like shit, Derek. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5317.900000000001s)]
*  What are you, fucking losing weight? [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5319.54s)]
*  Like you'd say some gross things to each other [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5320.9400000000005s)]
*  or you'd be, that person doesn't represent a colleague [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5323.38s)]
*  and a friend, that person represents the fucking barrier [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5326.700000000001s)]
*  that's gonna keep you from success. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5330.26s)]
*  You wanna be in that house in the Hollywood Hills [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5331.94s)]
*  driving a fucking Corvette, come on baby. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5334.099999999999s)]
*  You know, you gotta succeed. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5336.74s)]
*  And that mentality fucked with comedians for a long time. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5338.74s)]
*  Then the internet came along. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5344.0599999999995s)]
*  And what the internet showed everybody is like, [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5345.5s)]
*  no, no, no, these people are assets. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5347.419999999999s)]
*  Like you have them on your podcast, [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5352.419999999999s)]
*  your podcast is better. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5354.62s)]
*  And then you tell people about their podcast [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5356.139999999999s)]
*  and their podcast is good. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5358.179999999999s)]
*  So now people listen to you. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5359.5s)]
*  If you say, hey, go see Tom Segura, he's fucking hilarious. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5361.1s)]
*  People go see him like, you're honest. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5364.22s)]
*  You tell the truth, like he's really good. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5366.34s)]
*  And so then it's good for everybody. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5368.3s)]
*  So he blows up, you blow up, [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5370.660000000001s)]
*  and then we all help each other together. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5372.5s)]
*  So one of the great things about comedy now [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5374.06s)]
*  is that we have essentially like an organic network. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5376.700000000001s)]
*  Instead of a network that we're all under contract [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5380.660000000001s)]
*  and everyone has to give X percentage to this [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5383.700000000001s)]
*  and that to that, no, no, no executives. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5386.9400000000005s)]
*  No, no, it's an organic network of people [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5389.54s)]
*  who are just friends, who support each other. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5392.46s)]
*  And we just get together and have a good time. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5394.66s)]
*  Is there any path like as you got to comedy, [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5396.86s)]
*  like obviously you've done a bunch of different trajectories [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5399.7s)]
*  like you did the reality show thing, you're an actor, [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5401.62s)]
*  you did like a bunch of different stuff. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5404.0199999999995s)]
*  Is there any path that you in hindsight, [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5405.34s)]
*  wish you leaned into harder or like fleshed out more? [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5407.54s)]
*  No, definitely not. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5410.9s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5411.94s)]
*  No, I think it was good to do Fear Factor [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5413.98s)]
*  just because it made me realize [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5416.22s)]
*  I don't ever wanna do that again. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5418.26s)]
*  It was just for money. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5420.42s)]
*  Cause the Fear Factor was something, it was a great job. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5421.58s)]
*  Very happy that I got it. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5424.1s)]
*  I worked with some great people, it was a lot of fun. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5425.58s)]
*  Matter of fact, I was just hanging out with one of the guys [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5428.18s)]
*  that I did it with the other day. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5430.780000000001s)]
*  But that was only for money. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5433.62s)]
*  Like I only did it for money. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5436.18s)]
*  Like podcasts are fun. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5437.1s)]
*  Like standup comedy is fun. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5438.66s)]
*  That's the most fun. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5440.42s)]
*  Standup comedy is the most fun. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5441.54s)]
*  UFC commentary is fun, it's fun. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5443.9800000000005s)]
*  It's more fun to watch. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5447.18s)]
*  More fun to just watch fights. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5448.5s)]
*  But commenting on fights, you get to watch [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5450.38s)]
*  from like right there. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5453.3s)]
*  Like the fence is like right here in front of you. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5454.22s)]
*  It was pretty fucking amazing. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5456.38s)]
*  But no, none of those things. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5457.82s)]
*  I'm definitely glad I got the acting out of my system. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5460.14s)]
*  I don't like doing that. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5462.82s)]
*  I don't like, that's the least fun. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5463.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think some of it, [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5465.74s)]
*  like obviously I'm just speaking objectively [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5466.860000000001s)]
*  from what I see, but some of the most [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5468.58s)]
*  like hyper successful individuals like yourself, [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5469.66s)]
*  it's being like hyper talented, [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5471.82s)]
*  but then also like fortuitous timing [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5474.18s)]
*  in a lot of different scenarios potentially. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5476.860000000001s)]
*  And like there is some luck involved. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5478.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5480.5s)]
*  I'm wondering like if you were to be, [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5481.46s)]
*  like there's so much pressure on social media now [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5483.700000000001s)]
*  for young guys, especially at younger and younger ages [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5486.26s)]
*  to be like this crazy successful entrepreneurial individual, [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5488.860000000001s)]
*  even when they're like fucking teenagers or something. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5492.9800000000005s)]
*  And what would you, if you were to go back [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5495.66s)]
*  and be a teenager or a young twenties guy now, [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5497.66s)]
*  you're starting from scratch, how would you approach it? [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5500.54s)]
*  It's so much different. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5504.38s)]
*  It's so hard to say. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5505.219999999999s)]
*  Because when you're under the public eye of social media, [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5506.139999999999s)]
*  and even if you just have a small account [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5509.5s)]
*  with like 500 followers, you still are under the public eye [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5511.54s)]
*  because something you say can go viral [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5514.66s)]
*  and then either you blow up or you're fucked. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5517.259999999999s)]
*  Like either one of those scenarios is possible. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5520.139999999999s)]
*  So it's managing your life today is so much more problematic. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5522.54s)]
*  It's so much more difficult. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5528.78s)]
*  I couldn't imagine being a teenager in high school [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5530.42s)]
*  with a fucking TikTok account. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5533.900000000001s)]
*  Like we could just say wild shit. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5535.58s)]
*  How about that guy who was a football player [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5537.82s)]
*  who got denied a scholarship [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5540.9800000000005s)]
*  because he was singing along to the lyrics in a rap video [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5543.06s)]
*  and he said the N word. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5546.14s)]
*  So there's a video of him singing along to a song he likes [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5547.54s)]
*  and they kicked him out of the college. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5551.82s)]
*  That's fucking wild. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5554.46s)]
*  When was that? [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5555.3s)]
*  Very recent. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5556.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5556.9800000000005s)]
*  And he was like top draft pick, like an elite quarterback. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5557.82s)]
*  Fuck. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5561.7s)]
*  Is somebody else gonna pick him up? [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5562.98s)]
*  I'm gonna hope so. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5564.54s)]
*  Yeah, that's wild. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5565.38s)]
*  Imagine, that could change the trajectory [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5566.86s)]
*  of his entire life because he was 15 [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5569.9s)]
*  and he thought he was just rapping along to a video. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5573.26s)]
*  They're saying it, what can I say? [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5577.22s)]
*  You're fucking your frontal lobes [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5579.0199999999995s)]
*  aren't even formed at 15. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5580.38s)]
*  And to hold that kid from that moment [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5581.98s)]
*  for the rest of his life, and that's just one example. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5585.54s)]
*  There's so many examples of people ruining [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5588.62s)]
*  their fucking life on social media [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5591.02s)]
*  because they don't know any better [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5592.9800000000005s)]
*  because they're fucking 14 or whatever. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5594.1s)]
*  And it's like, I wouldn't want that. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5596.580000000001s)]
*  I can't imagine that. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5601.06s)]
*  I couldn't imagine growing up [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5602.540000000001s)]
*  with that kind of connection to people. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5605.1s)]
*  And I think in some ways, it discourages people [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5607.540000000001s)]
*  taking chances. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5611.22s)]
*  It discourages people really finding themselves [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5612.820000000001s)]
*  and how to express themselves. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5615.3s)]
*  Like if every standup set you ever did [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5616.5s)]
*  from the beginning of your first open mic [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5620.3s)]
*  was online and available to people, that's horrendous. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5623.14s)]
*  Yeah, I guess I'll like the crash and burns [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5626.06s)]
*  and I'll like the trial and error. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5628.78s)]
*  Yeah, that would not be. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5631.62s)]
*  Yeah, and then if you read those comments, [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5632.78s)]
*  like you fucking suck, quit, quit now. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5634.46s)]
*  Like that'd get in your head. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5637.02s)]
*  You can't move past it. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5638.5s)]
*  Most of my bombings, like all my bombings really, [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5640.38s)]
*  were just in these weird fucking nights [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5643.06s)]
*  and weird places and you get over it [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5645.78s)]
*  and then you move on and you just go, ugh, that one sucked. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5648.78s)]
*  That one I shouldn't have got drunk [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5652.78s)]
*  or that one I was too tired [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5654.3s)]
*  or that one I was too green [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5656.099999999999s)]
*  or that one I couldn't follow that guy. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5657.78s)]
*  And these are all lessons that you learn, [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5659.38s)]
*  but you don't want to dwell on them constantly. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5661.099999999999s)]
*  Because if you do, you will put yourself back [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5664.3s)]
*  in the mindset of that person who you were [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5667.3s)]
*  when you were failing, [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5670.3s)]
*  which I think is just like very detrimental to growth. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5671.62s)]
*  Like you gotta be aware of shortcomings and failures, [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5674.94s)]
*  but you can't dwell. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5678.9400000000005s)]
*  If you dwell on them, then you're maintaining this mindset [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5680.06s)]
*  of a person who just failed years after that failure. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5682.78s)]
*  That was a long time ago. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5686.7s)]
*  You gotta move on. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5687.82s)]
*  And if you don't move on, you're gonna get stuck. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5689.18s)]
*  And some people, look, there's some people [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5691.18s)]
*  that get stuck in high school forever, forever. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5693.78s)]
*  We know those stories. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5697.26s)]
*  They had failures in high school. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5699.26s)]
*  Maybe they got beat up in high school. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5700.78s)]
*  Maybe they were an asshole [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5703.1s)]
*  and they got their comeuppance in front of the whole school [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5705.02s)]
*  and they never recovered. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5707.5s)]
*  They never recovered. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5709.18s)]
*  Maybe they were a dick and they were talking shit [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5710.1s)]
*  to some guy and he just beat the shit out of him [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5713.02s)]
*  in front of everybody and like, no. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5714.54s)]
*  And every day that guy wakes up, fuck, years later [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5716.98s)]
*  and thinks about this failure. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5721.3s)]
*  No, it's wild. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5722.82s)]
*  Like the earlier stuff happens, [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5723.82s)]
*  it seems to like very much affect the trajectory [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5725.06s)]
*  of your life, like very significantly. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5727.06s)]
*  Very significantly. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5729.38s)]
*  High school is a big one, man, [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5730.38s)]
*  because it's like you're changing from a kid [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5731.62s)]
*  to a person, to an adult. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5734.42s)]
*  In that process, so many mistakes are made. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5737.1s)]
*  See, the wild thing is how even at your level of success, [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5740.62s)]
*  you trying to wrap your head around what you would do [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5743.740000000001s)]
*  as like a young guy, you can't even fucking fathom it. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5745.9800000000005s)]
*  So like imagine how overwhelmed [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5748.9400000000005s)]
*  some clueless 18 year old kid is. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5750.700000000001s)]
*  I can't imagine. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5752.42s)]
*  It's terrible for them. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5753.740000000001s)]
*  I think it's really terrible. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5754.860000000001s)]
*  And it's so available and also it's addictive. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5756.58s)]
*  It's not like something that's available [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5760.860000000001s)]
*  that you don't really need to go to all the time. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5762.740000000001s)]
*  Everyone carries a goddamn phone with them [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5765.38s)]
*  everywhere they go. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5766.9800000000005s)]
*  So you're always connected to this. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5768.38s)]
*  And kids are ruthless how they talk shit [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5770.46s)]
*  about each other on the internet. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5772.74s)]
*  Oh my God, they're so mean. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5774.06s)]
*  Yeah, I wouldn't wanna live like that. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5777.14s)]
*  But who knows? [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5779.46s)]
*  Maybe it's one of those things where [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5780.3s)]
*  the way I've described it in the past [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5782.78s)]
*  is like I grew up in the Northeast [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5784.58s)]
*  and I wouldn't trade that for the world [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5786.9400000000005s)]
*  because there's something about growing up [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5791.26s)]
*  in a place where it fucking snows, [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5793.14s)]
*  where it's cold as shit and the winter comes [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5795.54s)]
*  and you're fucked and when your car breaks down, [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5798.06s)]
*  you gotta walk five miles and negative 10 degrees. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5800.620000000001s)]
*  That builds a resistance or a resilience rather [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5804.58s)]
*  in a person that is, I don't think it's replaceable. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5808.5s)]
*  I don't think you can get that. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5813.660000000001s)]
*  I mean you certainly could develop discipline [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5815.38s)]
*  and you could certainly develop resilience [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5817.5s)]
*  if you live somewhere else, [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5819.34s)]
*  especially if you have a hard childhood. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5820.5s)]
*  Those people develop a lot of resistance [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5822.58s)]
*  and a lot of resilience. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5824.3s)]
*  But there's something about growing up in harsh climates [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5826.0199999999995s)]
*  that develops a specific type of character. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5830.54s)]
*  Character of a person that values hard work [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5833.42s)]
*  and you get shit done and it's like very common [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5835.66s)]
*  to people that live in like the Northeast in Boston. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5838.74s)]
*  I wonder if like kids growing up today [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5842.7s)]
*  are, it's like a technological winter. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5846.0599999999995s)]
*  Like they are developing a resilience, [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5849.4s)]
*  like a psychological resilience if they survive it. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5852.9400000000005s)]
*  They don't fucking commit suicide, [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5855.5s)]
*  which a lot of kids do today. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5856.74s)]
*  Like suicide and self harm is up quite a bit. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5858.06s)]
*  Jonathan Haidt has a book about it. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5861.7s)]
*  It's called The Coddling of the American Mind [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5863.38s)]
*  and in it, that's one of the things they discuss [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5865.860000000001s)]
*  is that particularly with girls, [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5868.06s)]
*  suicide and self harm ramps up considerably [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5870.9400000000005s)]
*  around the time of social media's invention, [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5874.66s)]
*  around the time of the iPhone. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5877.62s)]
*  So maybe these kids today that are growing up [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5880.1s)]
*  are growing up with like the winter time equivalent [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5883.860000000001s)]
*  of resilience, but through the internet. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5888.06s)]
*  Yeah, some of these, like I've been more, [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5891.740000000001s)]
*  as I become more successful, [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5894.34s)]
*  I've been exposed to more successful people, [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5895.46s)]
*  those who are self made, but also those who aren't [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5897.820000000001s)]
*  and have been like trust fund babies or whatever. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5900.06s)]
*  And there's definitely a huge differentiation [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5902.38s)]
*  between the mindset or the mentality [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5905.62s)]
*  of those who have gone through adversity or hard times [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5908.3s)]
*  versus those who've spent like silver platter [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5910.5s)]
*  to them essentially. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5912.3s)]
*  And it definitely does fuck them up, I think. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5913.54s)]
*  Like even the ones who are successful, [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5915.38s)]
*  but didn't have to go through the hard upbringing [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5917.18s)]
*  or make it through challenges that otherwise [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5920.42s)]
*  have been, they've just like coasted through essentially [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5923.9800000000005s)]
*  because they've never been imposed, [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5926.5s)]
*  it's never been imposed on their lives at all. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5927.74s)]
*  There's no comparison. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5929.34s)]
*  That description of a self made man, [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5930.820000000001s)]
*  everybody wants to be a self made man. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5933.860000000001s)]
*  I mean, there's no real self made men. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5935.38s)]
*  Everybody has help from everybody. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5937.54s)]
*  But the reality is there's a giant difference [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5939.38s)]
*  between growing up poor and then eventually becoming rich [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5941.62s)]
*  versus growing up super wealthy [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5945.22s)]
*  and then being given money and working hard [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5948.34s)]
*  to sustain that money. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5951.22s)]
*  It's just not the same. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5952.78s)]
*  You're like concrete that's like missing an ingredient. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5954.18s)]
*  And you don't really know [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5957.42s)]
*  if you could have done it on your own. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5958.26s)]
*  And I'm sure you can attest to the fact that [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5959.58s)]
*  there definitely is like a neurological component to like, [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5962.42s)]
*  it's called the hedonic treadmill. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5965.42s)]
*  Your new set point becomes just what your baseline [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5967.7s)]
*  expectation is of what makes you feel satisfied [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5970.099999999999s)]
*  and then anything, you need some heightened level of success [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5973.3s)]
*  to feel that like dopamine hit or level of achievement again, [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5976.62s)]
*  even if your baseline is like some absurdly [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5980.34s)]
*  good achievement as is. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5983.26s)]
*  Whereas back in the day, if you got like, [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5985.34s)]
*  20 bucks an hour for some job, [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5987.54s)]
*  like you would have been fucking stoked. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5989.82s)]
*  Like back in the day, I used to make like eight bucks an hour [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5991.179999999999s)]
*  like picking up like golf balls on the driving range. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5994.0199999999995s)]
*  Like for me back then, it was like money, fuck yeah. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5996.860000000001s)]
*  This is great. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5998.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=5999.82s)]
*  And it's just like that, I don't know, [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6000.66s)]
*  like adapting to that and being able to go from like zero [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6002.78s)]
*  to my hero, but just like the step by step is like [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6006.62s)]
*  what gives you the reward, gives you the mental progress [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6009.78s)]
*  and achievement that I think makes like a cumulatively [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6013.26s)]
*  just like a well-rounded human as opposed to the guys [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6016.14s)]
*  who are just like, here you go. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6019.06s)]
*  Like you're already up here from get-go sort of thing. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6020.66s)]
*  Yeah, and you also can remember when you were poor, [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6023.78s)]
*  which is very valuable. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6026.66s)]
*  Yeah, it makes you way more grateful. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6028.139999999999s)]
*  Way more grateful. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6029.54s)]
*  I remember all my terrible jobs. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6031.139999999999s)]
*  I really do. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6033.3s)]
*  What was the worst one? [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6034.139999999999s)]
*  I had a job with my friend, Jimmy Lawless, [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6037.0599999999995s)]
*  for like only a couple of weeks. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6040.62s)]
*  Maybe it was a little longer than that, [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6042.94s)]
*  but I was working on a construction crew in the summer, [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6044.0599999999995s)]
*  building a wheelchair ramp at a Knights of Columbus Hall [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6047.9s)]
*  in Massachusetts. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6051.62s)]
*  I think I was probably like 16, 17 at the time, [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6053.339999999999s)]
*  somewhere in that range. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6057.339999999999s)]
*  I was carrying cement and pressure treated lumber [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6059.219999999999s)]
*  all day long. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6063.94s)]
*  That's all I did. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6065.419999999999s)]
*  All day long, I carried cement bags [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6066.379999999999s)]
*  and pressure treated lumber, because I was a laborer. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6069.259999999999s)]
*  I wasn't skilled. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6071.62s)]
*  So all day long, you're carrying lumber [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6072.82s)]
*  and you get these splinters in your hand [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6077.139999999999s)]
*  from this pressure treated lumber. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6079.58s)]
*  Pressure treated lumber is lumber that's been soaked [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6081.54s)]
*  in some awful fucking chemical. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6084.18s)]
*  And then you're carrying that. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6086.58s)]
*  It's heavy as fuck. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6088.26s)]
*  And then you're carrying cement bags. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6089.34s)]
*  And I remember going to the gym at night after a work day. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6091.42s)]
*  So you get off work at 3.30 or whatever it is. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6096.06s)]
*  And then I go to the gym and I'd be like, [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6098.54s)]
*  this is like, ugh. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6099.86s)]
*  I had nothing. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6101.9800000000005s)]
*  I remember hitting the bag and just be like, oh my God. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6103.18s)]
*  I was trying to do fighting [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6106.22s)]
*  while after that, not just weight training. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6107.34s)]
*  That would be fucking brutal. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6109.66s)]
*  I was competing. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6111.42s)]
*  Jesus. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6112.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I was still competing. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6113.099999999999s)]
*  In hindsight, isn't it almost more impressive [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6114.42s)]
*  what you think about what you did [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6116.66s)]
*  when you were grinding versus now sometimes? [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6117.74s)]
*  Sometimes I think back to how I balanced university, [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6120.299999999999s)]
*  my shitty jobs, going on dates, doing all this stuff. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6123.379999999999s)]
*  I was like, how the fuck did I also work out [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6126.54s)]
*  very consistently, get all my meals and be regimented? [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6129.0199999999995s)]
*  And then you think back to now [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6131.82s)]
*  when you ever give yourself an excuse for something, [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6132.98s)]
*  you're like, you pathetic piece of shit. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6135.139999999999s)]
*  Remember what you used to do? [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6137.179999999999s)]
*  You never complained back then. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6138.46s)]
*  I know, but there's something about hunger. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6139.98s)]
*  There's something about the grind of want. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6143.099999999999s)]
*  God, I want it to work out. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6147.099999999999s)]
*  I want to be great. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6148.66s)]
*  I want this, I want that. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6149.62s)]
*  And that grind of wanting something, [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6151.5s)]
*  it's like it fuels you in a way [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6154.78s)]
*  that nothing else is capable of fueling you. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6156.98s)]
*  Yeah, that's what makes me wonder if Connor [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6159.94s)]
*  could ever make a successful comeback [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6162.219999999999s)]
*  as I feel like that level. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6164.0199999999995s)]
*  He could. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6166.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6167.139999999999s)]
*  No, he could. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6167.98s)]
*  He certainly could. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6168.82s)]
*  I mean, if Floyd Mayweather was still elite, [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6170.3s)]
*  even at the top of his game, [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6172.66s)]
*  I don't think you ever forget where you came from. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6174.26s)]
*  Some people do. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6176.74s)]
*  Some people definitely get soft. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6178.38s)]
*  That was the Marvin Hagler quote. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6180.3s)]
*  He would say how difficult it is to run in the cold [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6181.86s)]
*  when you're waking up in silk sheets. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6184.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6186.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6187.26s)]
*  But Hagler took steps to mitigate that. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6188.42s)]
*  Hagler used to train at a Provincetown, [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6191.42s)]
*  which was on the Cape. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6194.34s)]
*  So he would go out to the Cape Cod [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6195.7s)]
*  in the middle of the winter [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6197.22s)]
*  to eat some of the best foods in the fucking sand. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6198.1s)]
*  He separated from his family. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6200.9800000000005s)]
*  He would go into this fucking Spartan training camp. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6202.54s)]
*  That was his way of staying hard. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6206.42s)]
*  I think Connor could still do it. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6210.26s)]
*  The real question for me with Connor [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6212.06s)]
*  is what's going on with his leg? [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6214.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6216.18s)]
*  Was he has like a titanium fucking platenant now? [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6217.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6219.18s)]
*  His legs snapped in half and no one, [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6220.02s)]
*  and I mean no one in combat sports [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6223.26s)]
*  has had their legs snap in half [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6225.820000000001s)]
*  and come back and been the same or better. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6228.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6230.46s)]
*  Anderson Silva's leg was fucked. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6231.3s)]
*  Corey Hill was the first guy in the UFC [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6233.1s)]
*  that I saw get his leg snapped [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6234.9s)]
*  and he never really was the same again. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6236.38s)]
*  I don't even know if he fought again. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6238.82s)]
*  And then Corey died young, unfortunately. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6240.18s)]
*  And then the next one was Anderson [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6242.38s)]
*  and the next one was Chris Weidman. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6245.74s)]
*  Anderson did fight again, but he was never the same again. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6247.7s)]
*  And Chris Weidman has yet to fight. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6251.74s)]
*  I don't know if, as Chris Weidman spoke publicly [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6253.82s)]
*  about his leg and the recovery, see if that's the case. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6256.3s)]
*  Cause Connor actually brought it up [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6259.66s)]
*  when someone was asking him about USADA. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6261.58s)]
*  Yeah, he was like, it almost seemed like [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6265.0599999999995s)]
*  he was justifying drug use at some point. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6267.58s)]
*  It was kind of wild. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6270.099999999999s)]
*  It seemed exactly like that. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6270.94s)]
*  He was like, you don't know what this is like. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6271.86s)]
*  I took myself out of the pool, everything's on board. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6275.74s)]
*  And it was like very suggestive of, [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6278.0199999999995s)]
*  this was within the rules and I had to do it. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6280.42s)]
*  And fuck you if you don't agree with my decision [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6284.42s)]
*  sort of thing. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6286.38s)]
*  Not only that, he's taking his shirt off [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6287.22s)]
*  and closing constantly. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6288.9s)]
*  And he looks like his piss would melt that USADA cup. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6290.46s)]
*  Like it would just burn a hole right to the bottom [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6294.66s)]
*  of that USADA cup. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6296.9s)]
*  Yeah, if there's ever been speculation. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6299.22s)]
*  What's this, Wonder Boy? [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6300.86s)]
*  Yeah, eight months ago on Wonder Boy's channel, [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6301.86s)]
*  there's a video of him training and kicking, I guess. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6303.5s)]
*  Oh, great. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6305.86s)]
*  I wonder how it's doing though. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6308.3s)]
*  So here he's training. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6310.94s)]
*  So maybe he's getting ready to work out again [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6312.58s)]
*  or maybe getting ready to fight again, [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6314.62s)]
*  preparing for Wonder Boy. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6317.3s)]
*  But the thing is, it's like there's a big difference [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6318.82s)]
*  between training and really being confident enough [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6321.5s)]
*  in the shin to test it, like getting kicked. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6325.34s)]
*  So let's see if, see, he's just touching. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6332.22s)]
*  They're touching right here. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6334.46s)]
*  This is the kind of sparring that he's doing here [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6335.42s)]
*  is the kind of sparring, it's called technical sparring. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6337.74s)]
*  You're just kind of tapping each other. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6340.54s)]
*  You're almost like playing tag. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6342.860000000001s)]
*  Even if your leg was to have the structural integrity [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6344.46s)]
*  to sustain an actual fight, what is the implications [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6347.66s)]
*  of walking around with a plate in it? [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6352.3s)]
*  Is that unfair? [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6353.820000000001s)]
*  Well, that's interesting because I had David, [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6355.780000000001s)]
*  look at that leg when it snapped. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6357.3s)]
*  I'm coming back, baby. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6359.54s)]
*  Watch Chris Weidman test out his leg after brutal injury. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6360.740000000001s)]
*  I had David Goggins on the podcast yesterday. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6365.18s)]
*  And Goggins, he's such a fucking freak of discipline [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6367.66s)]
*  and his ability to tolerate pain [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6374.22s)]
*  is like no one I've ever talked to. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6377.86s)]
*  He had bone on bone on his knees to the point [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6380.46s)]
*  where it distorted the shape of his bone, [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6385.5s)]
*  where his bones were like distorting to deal with the fact [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6388.7s)]
*  that there was no meniscus there [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6393.139999999999s)]
*  and it was like growing off in a weird way. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6394.7s)]
*  So the way they mitigated that is they had to cut a wedge [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6396.54s)]
*  out of his shin and then they lowered that bone down [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6401.0199999999995s)]
*  to make it parallel and flat with the tibia. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6405.82s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6410.62s)]
*  And you see these screws that are in there [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6411.66s)]
*  and he's got this plate and he screws. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6414.3s)]
*  And he said every step he takes, he fills that plate. [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6416.3s)]
*  Damn. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6419.66s)]
*  Every step. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6420.5s)]
*  He said, it sucks. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6421.34s)]
*  Everywhere I go, I fill that plate. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6422.9s)]
*  So it's just the new normal to him is every time he steps, [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6424.66s)]
*  he fills a plate and that's his leg. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6428.9s)]
*  Fuck. Yeah. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6431.9s)]
*  And he says it presses against his hamstring as well. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6433.54s)]
*  So it's like constant discomfort. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6436.98s)]
*  And look at that one screw that pops out the side, [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6439.38s)]
*  like trim that bitch. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6440.98s)]
*  Why you letting that thing stick all the way out? [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6442.78s)]
*  Weird, the other one too, right? [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6444.62s)]
*  Two of them. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6445.5s)]
*  But like, see how the wedge is missing? [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6446.7s)]
*  Like that little wedge slice right there, [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6449.139999999999s)]
*  his knee would go up on the side. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6452.42s)]
*  So he was almost like bow-legged. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6455.660000000001s)]
*  Fuck. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6457.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6458.18s)]
*  But look at this, there's no spacing in the fucking knees, man. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6459.1s)]
*  The guy runs 240 mile races with those knees. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6463.22s)]
*  See the wild thing to me about him too, [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6467.34s)]
*  and it's like perhaps he's like fully elucidated this [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6470.26s)]
*  in his book or in podcasts and I'm just, you know, [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6473.42s)]
*  haven't seen it, but like he used to be out of shape. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6476.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6479.820000000001s)]
*  And then all of a sudden like switch flips [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6480.66s)]
*  and he's just the most hyper disciplined individual [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6483.099999999999s)]
*  of all time essentially. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6485.26s)]
*  Like what was the catalyst for that like mindset shift? [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6486.22s)]
*  Like has he discussed that in detail? [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6489.86s)]
*  Yeah, well he slowly figured it out. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6492.22s)]
*  But like the first steps that he made, [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6496.5s)]
*  I mean the first time he ever ran, [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6498.86s)]
*  look at how fat he was at one point in time. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6500.62s)]
*  The first time that he ever ran, [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6502.58s)]
*  he said he ran like around the block [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6504.58s)]
*  and he fucking couldn't go any further. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6506.42s)]
*  He was exhausted. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6507.94s)]
*  He was eating terrible food [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6508.98s)]
*  and drinking milkshakes every day [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6510.299999999999s)]
*  and he was just working as an exterminator. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6511.82s)]
*  He's got two books. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6514.58s)]
*  One of them is called Can't Hurt Me, [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6515.7s)]
*  that's the first one. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6517.339999999999s)]
*  And this is the new one, it's called Never Finished [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6518.66s)]
*  and this comes out on December 6th. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6521.339999999999s)]
*  And this one is even more rough. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6523.9s)]
*  It's even more rough than the first book. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6525.62s)]
*  It's fucking rough, man. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6527.299999999999s)]
*  His life was rough. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6529.379999999999s)]
*  And those demons like propel him every day. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6531.259999999999s)]
*  And now he's in this place where he's known [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6535.38s)]
*  as like literally the hardest motherfucker that's ever lived. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6539.14s)]
*  Like that's who he is. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6542.38s)]
*  He's this guy that will run like, [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6544.46s)]
*  you know, 20 fucking ultra marathons in a month [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6546.62s)]
*  just to show people that it's possible. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6549.42s)]
*  And that is like a burden too. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6551.42s)]
*  Because now you're constantly attached to this thing [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6554.860000000001s)]
*  where you have to push it to the end [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6557.82s)]
*  and then you see his body is falling apart. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6559.66s)]
*  It's crazy how some of the most successful people [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6562.5s)]
*  seem to have like chips on their shoulder [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6564.3s)]
*  that they use to like propel them mentally. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6566.62s)]
*  And it's like, I don't know if that's, [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6570.46s)]
*  like I've done that too personally. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6571.820000000001s)]
*  Like try to, even in the gym, [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6573.820000000001s)]
*  sometimes you think of fucked up shit [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6575.14s)]
*  to get through that last like rep. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6576.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6577.900000000001s)]
*  And it's like, is that it? [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6578.74s)]
*  I don't know, is that the healthy thing to do? [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6579.58s)]
*  I don't even know. [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6581.46s)]
*  I don't know what's the healthy thing to do. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6582.3s)]
*  I mean, I would think, I would also, [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6584.1s)]
*  oftentimes when I'm doing sprints on the bike [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6586.18s)]
*  and I'm really tired, I think about getting tapped out. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6588.9400000000005s)]
*  Cause I have a bunch of memories in my head [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6591.34s)]
*  of different guys who caught me in triangles [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6593.06s)]
*  and this guy caught me in an arm bar. [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6595.22s)]
*  And sometimes you get caught just cause you're too tired. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6597.06s)]
*  Like you see it coming and you just can't step over the leg. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6599.900000000001s)]
*  You can't pull your arm out. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6603.700000000001s)]
*  And then you wind up getting tapped. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6604.860000000001s)]
*  You're like, fuck. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6605.9400000000005s)]
*  And you know you got tapped cause you were too tired. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6607.740000000001s)]
*  You know what the defense was, [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6609.620000000001s)]
*  but you weren't able to implement it [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6612.26s)]
*  cause you're too exhausted. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6613.580000000001s)]
*  So I think of those moments a lot of times when I'm training, [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6614.52s)]
*  when I'm just in the middle of like a sprint, [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6617.9400000000005s)]
*  I want to like, [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6619.860000000001s)]
*  I don't know if that's good or bad. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6620.7s)]
*  I mean, I think it's, that's not, [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6623.7s)]
*  it's positive in that it's making me do that extra work. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6626.0599999999995s)]
*  And that extra work is ultimately beneficial. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6630.26s)]
*  So I use it as fuel. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6632.58s)]
*  And for David, one of the things we got into [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6634.12s)]
*  when we talked about on a podcast [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6636.66s)]
*  is going to come out the day the book is released. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6638.38s)]
*  One of the things that we talked about is that [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6640.84s)]
*  he literally reads out things his haters say in comments [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6642.84s)]
*  and records it. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6648.34s)]
*  Oh, so he does, he reads the comments. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6649.6s)]
*  And then listens to it while he runs. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6651.360000000001s)]
*  But he's a psycho. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6654.4800000000005s)]
*  I would not recommend that. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6656.200000000001s)]
*  And I don't know if it's- [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6657.72s)]
*  So it's the opposite to your approach. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6658.56s)]
*  Yeah, but he's, he lives a different life. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6659.88s)]
*  Like it's a very performance-based life. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6662.4800000000005s)]
*  It's not like an interactive life. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6665.240000000001s)]
*  And it's not like he's, he doesn't, [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6667.52s)]
*  he hasn't done a podcast since he did mine. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6669.240000000001s)]
*  Oh wow. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6671.4800000000005s)]
*  Like he, his last podcast I did, [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6672.320000000001s)]
*  he was, fuck the last podcast I did. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6673.64s)]
*  It was like four years ago, fuck these podcasts. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6675.240000000001s)]
*  He's like, but I liked you, I'll do yours. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6677.96s)]
*  He's different. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6680.400000000001s)]
*  David exists in this world where he is out there [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6681.68s)]
*  pushing himself beyond the limitations [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6686.240000000001s)]
*  of the average human being. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6689.320000000001s)]
*  Way beyond. [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6690.84s)]
*  In terms of his tolerance for pain. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6692.0s)]
*  And he believes he's extracting lessons from that. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6694.400000000001s)]
*  Like he likes the suffering, [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6697.56s)]
*  because he learns about himself in that suffering. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6700.820000000001s)]
*  And he continues to grow through that suffering. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6703.400000000001s)]
*  That's what he does, all day long man. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6706.4800000000005s)]
*  So he doesn't get stressed about the comments or anything. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6708.76s)]
*  He just goes and like procures the best shitty ones. [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6710.76s)]
*  And then uses that to be like, fuck these people. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6714.52s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, Taken Souls, that's what he says. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6717.2s)]
*  Taken Souls, those motherfuckers see you out there, [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6720.280000000001s)]
*  Taken a soul. [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6722.92s)]
*  It's like, why are you out here running? [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6724.4400000000005s)]
*  Cause you're not motherfucker. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6725.4800000000005s)]
*  And he keeps running. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6727.08s)]
*  Like he's got a, he's got a chip on his shoulder [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6727.92s)]
*  as big as a fucking Empire State building. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6730.4800000000005s)]
*  But that's- [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6732.52s)]
*  Did you leave the podcast fired up? [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6733.92s)]
*  Damn it, I left that book fired up. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6736.12s)]
*  You read that book, you want to run through a fucking- [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6738.2s)]
*  I texted him. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6739.96s)]
*  I said, dude, I'm ready to run through a fucking wall [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6740.92s)]
*  reading this book. [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6742.64s)]
*  He's like one of the best sources of motivational strength [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6744.0s)]
*  I've ever encountered, because it's all real. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6747.92s)]
*  And most people didn't even know [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6750.72s)]
*  how fucked up his knees were. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6752.4s)]
*  Like until he let us show those pictures, [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6754.16s)]
*  like most people didn't even know [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6756.68s)]
*  what he was going through. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6757.8s)]
*  Like that kind of pain is insane. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6758.72s)]
*  His doctor said to him, [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6762.04s)]
*  I can't believe you can walk on these knees. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6763.68s)]
*  Forget about run thousands of miles. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6766.84s)]
*  Like that's the amount of fluid they pulled out of his knee [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6770.16s)]
*  and the black fluid on the left. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6773.28s)]
*  What was he saying? [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6775.52s)]
*  It was deoxygenated? [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6776.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah, or unoxygenated. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6777.4400000000005s)]
*  I don't know the, yeah. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6778.52s)]
*  It's just fucking clots and clumps. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6779.6s)]
*  And that was all from his knee, man. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6782.28s)]
*  He's never gone to the realm of what could attenuate. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6785.08s)]
*  Like as far as I know, he's not on TRT [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6789.4400000000005s)]
*  or done anything to- [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6791.68s)]
*  It's like, why though? [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6793.28s)]
*  He imposes so much stress on his body [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6795.160000000001s)]
*  that it's wild that he has not explored it or anything. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6797.0s)]
*  Yeah, I wonder if he would now. [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6800.92s)]
*  I mean, I believe he's 45 now. [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6803.0s)]
*  Like even just recovery agents, [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6804.96s)]
*  not even the TRT stuff like peptides, stem cells, whatever. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6806.4800000000005s)]
*  Right. I don't know. [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6810.160000000001s)]
*  Well, it certainly could help [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6811.320000000001s)]
*  and maybe it would have saved his knees, but maybe not. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6813.120000000001s)]
*  The volume, the sheer volume of pounding [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6818.240000000001s)]
*  and all the shit he does. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6821.76s)]
*  You know, he fights wildfires. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6823.68s)]
*  No. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6827.0s)]
*  Yeah, for fun. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6827.84s)]
*  I'm not kidding. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6830.4400000000005s)]
*  No, I know. [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6831.280000000001s)]
*  For months at a time. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6832.12s)]
*  He's a wildfire, he's a smoke jumper. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6832.96s)]
*  So they take him out, that's him, [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6837.4400000000005s)]
*  jumping out of a fucking, I guess, an airplane [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6839.4800000000005s)]
*  and parachutes down into these woodland areas [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6843.320000000001s)]
*  where there's firefighters. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6847.400000000001s)]
*  Jesus. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6848.96s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6849.8s)]
*  He sent me a picture. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6850.64s)]
*  He goes, this one's gonna be fucked up. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6851.88s)]
*  He sent me a picture of a fucking polar bear [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6854.4800000000005s)]
*  that someone had spotted near one of these places [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6856.360000000001s)]
*  where they're getting dropped off. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6860.88s)]
*  Because like when you're in Northern Canada, [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6862.320000000001s)]
*  like some of the areas where people get dropped off. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6864.72s)]
*  Yeah, that's him. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6868.160000000001s)]
*  Yeah, we have brutal forest fires in like Northern Canada. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6869.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah, brutal. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6871.88s)]
*  Let me send you these pictures that he sent me [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6873.320000000001s)]
*  because they're so crazy. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6875.4400000000005s)]
*  And one of them, he was parachuting into a place [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6876.64s)]
*  where there was a grizzly bear. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6879.96s)]
*  And he's like, they found a grizzly bear. [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6882.64s)]
*  I'm like, no, don't go, man, what are you doing? [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6884.04s)]
*  So. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6887.8s)]
*  Yeah, there's some of the fires. [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6890.200000000001s)]
*  So here's one he sent me that's a polar bear. [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6891.64s)]
*  Yeah, you're gonna take a piss. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6894.6s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead, go ahead, take a piss. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6895.4400000000005s)]
*  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6900.96s)]
*  Images of polar bears. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6902.4400000000005s)]
*  I think obviously his priority would be like [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6904.160000000001s)]
*  injury proofing himself, getting back in there and like, [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6906.360000000001s)]
*  he very much wants to get back and have a run for sure. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6910.28s)]
*  So welcome back from PING. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6914.24s)]
*  So we were just talking about Conor McGregor's injury. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6915.88s)]
*  The weird thing is that there's a loophole in USADA [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6918.36s)]
*  that allows you to get out of the testing pool. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6920.64s)]
*  And you get out of the testing pool, you can just juice up. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6924.48s)]
*  Yeah, most of the guys weren't even aware, apparently. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6927.4s)]
*  I think it was Anthony Smith who does the show with Biz Bang. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6930.0s)]
*  Yeah, he was like, I didn't even know [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6933.44s)]
*  you could fucking do that. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6934.36s)]
*  Seems weird. [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6935.76s)]
*  And you just need six months. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6936.96s)]
*  If someone had an injury though, [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6939.839999999999s)]
*  that's a very wise way to approach it, right? [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6941.24s)]
*  Like what potentially would be good things [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6943.48s)]
*  that you would take if you had a broken bone [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6946.5199999999995s)]
*  and you wanted it to heal quicker? [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6948.919999999999s)]
*  HGH, peptides, androgens are very restorative of, [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6950.919999999999s)]
*  like they'll reinforce bone mineral density. [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6956.759999999999s)]
*  It's not just muscle tissue for anabolic steel. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6959.48s)]
*  There's certain stuff that's gonna stay in a system [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6962.44s)]
*  for a long time you could never use, [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6964.24s)]
*  but on the bioidentical side, [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6965.719999999999s)]
*  anything that is pro bone integrity, [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6968.6s)]
*  infrastructure enforcing, he is going to be, [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6973.68s)]
*  I would be highly incentivized if I was him [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6977.4800000000005s)]
*  and I knew I wasn't being tested. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6979.200000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6980.52s)]
*  So I'd be pushing that vector hard. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6981.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah, if you took time off, [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6983.64s)]
*  say if it was you and you were a UFC fighter [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6985.240000000001s)]
*  and you broke your leg and you found out about this, [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6988.320000000001s)]
*  you saw it a loophole. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6990.68s)]
*  So you would take peptides, you would take growth. [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6992.52s)]
*  What are the things that you were saying [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6995.400000000001s)]
*  that you wouldn't take [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6996.52s)]
*  because it would stay in your system for too long? [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6998.0s)]
*  Oh, like any synthetic androgen [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=6999.72s)]
*  you would not be touching in general. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7002.28s)]
*  Anything that could be detected for, [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7004.48s)]
*  I don't know, DECA, anything of that nature [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7007.36s)]
*  I'm sure is not even on his radar. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7009.2s)]
*  It would be more bioidentical compounds. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7010.64s)]
*  How long does that stuff stay in your system? [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7012.8s)]
*  Bioidenticals? Like a DECA or? [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7015.24s)]
*  Oh, DECA can be like a year you get detection. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7016.8s)]
*  Oh really? Yeah. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7018.92s)]
*  Wow. That's fucking nuts. [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7020.12s)]
*  So him taking testosterone, [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7021.44s)]
*  but wouldn't that fuck with his endogenous production [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7024.04s)]
*  of testosterone when he gets off of it? [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7026.96s)]
*  Yeah, he could, but I'm saying the most logical thing [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7028.88s)]
*  would be the growth factor side of things. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7032.28s)]
*  So that would be GH and then accompanying peptides, [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7034.08s)]
*  like the BPCs, the TB 500. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7037.04s)]
*  There's other peptides that are not even tested for [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7039.4400000000005s)]
*  that I'm sure he was probably already using. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7041.4400000000005s)]
*  But yeah, I imagine his main priority [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7044.56s)]
*  is injury proofing himself more so [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7047.88s)]
*  than getting like juicy as fuck. [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7050.56s)]
*  Right. Yeah. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7052.04s)]
*  Yeah, well also just recovering from that. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7053.04s)]
*  You know, when your bones get snapped [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7057.16s)]
*  and it's a weight bearing bone, [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7059.8s)]
*  he says I crushed the metatarsal bone in my foot [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7061.52s)]
*  three weeks before the Khabib fight and still made the walk. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7064.36s)]
*  All injuries are not the same. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7066.76s)]
*  You will see it all on Netflix. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7068.32s)]
*  Oh, so he's doing a Netflix documentary? [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7070.36s)]
*  When a serious injury with a high percentage [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7073.08s)]
*  of never recovering occurs, it is just simply not the same. [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7075.08s)]
*  Yeah, well there is a high percentage [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7080.68s)]
*  of never truly recovering. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7082.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7084.04s)]
*  No, there's like a few, like I have a little list here. [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7084.88s)]
*  Like there's something called pentasan polysulfate. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7088.84s)]
*  I'm sure he might be trying. [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7092.76s)]
*  BPC 157 you've heard of and something like the thymus and beta. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7093.96s)]
*  Like some of these are kind of like commonly known [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7097.64s)]
*  would be expected, but I imagine it's very much [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7100.8s)]
*  from the acceleration of recovery, like you said, [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7103.4400000000005s)]
*  and then also just trying to make sure [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7105.4800000000005s)]
*  this shit never happens again. [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7107.36s)]
*  And he's actually confident going into the ring. [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7108.92s)]
*  And yeah, like for him, it's kind of a unique loophole for sure. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7110.68s)]
*  And I don't know like how, if anyone else has vetted [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7116.0s)]
*  this strategy and like somehow they were encouraged not to [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7119.6s)]
*  or made it seem like it was not allowed, [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7124.400000000001s)]
*  but it seems kind of odd that he was able to take himself out [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7126.84s)]
*  so perfectly and then is able to just enter back in. [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7131.320000000001s)]
*  Like this is not something that I [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7134.4800000000005s)]
*  think even other UFC fighters were aware of as like a possible. [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7135.92s)]
*  Right. [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7139.4800000000005s)]
*  And looks massive. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7140.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7142.8s)]
*  I mean, he looks well over 200 pounds right now. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7143.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7145.36s)]
*  IGF-1 too, forgot to mention, would also [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7145.84s)]
*  be something that would make sense. [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7147.84s)]
*  But yeah, there's other compounds, [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7150.32s)]
*  but I would think the growth factor side of things [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7152.0s)]
*  would make the most sense. [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7154.04s)]
*  When a guy breaks a leg like that, [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7155.84s)]
*  how long is it before that thing is 100%? [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7157.96s)]
*  Like it seems like I would, as far as like injury recovery [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7163.16s)]
*  goes for something that significant, [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7166.5199999999995s)]
*  like I wouldn't know personally off the top of my head, [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7167.92s)]
*  but it seemed like there were certain individuals that took. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7170.12s)]
*  Like I forgot what Anthony Smith's injury was, [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7172.72s)]
*  but it was not as severe. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7174.84s)]
*  And there was other individuals who [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7176.4s)]
*  had significant bone related injuries that [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7177.84s)]
*  took way fucking longer to come back. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7180.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7182.88s)]
*  Anthony thought his leg was broken, [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7183.4s)]
*  but it turned out it wasn't. [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7185.44s)]
*  But it was some sort of a significant, [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7187.08s)]
*  I think it was a ligament injury or something [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7189.04s)]
*  like that, which is why it was so unstable, [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7191.0s)]
*  that he thought it was cracked. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7194.0s)]
*  Is that what it's going on? [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7195.44s)]
*  What was Anthony Smith's injury? [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7196.44s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7200.12s)]
*  Maybe if it gets cracked. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7206.12s)]
*  Well, I cracked my shin skiing. [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7208.28s)]
*  It's called an insufficiency fracture. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7211.12s)]
*  You know, I had a menoscopy. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7215.32s)]
*  I have some meniscus missing from the inside of my knee. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7217.84s)]
*  And I crashed skiing. [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7221.0s)]
*  And I got a crack. [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7223.88s)]
*  And I was like walking around. [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7225.12s)]
*  I was like, this fucking hurts, like in a weird way. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7226.36s)]
*  I better get an MRI. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7228.48s)]
*  And then I got it checked out. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7229.72s)]
*  And the doctor's like, the top of your shin, where it meets, [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7230.96s)]
*  the cartilage is cracked. [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7234.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7236.360000000001s)]
*  And it healed. [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7237.0s)]
*  You know, it took a couple months, and it was gone. [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7237.96s)]
*  But it's like, you know, that was no big deal. [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7240.0s)]
*  Didn't have to get screws or cast or anything. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7244.04s)]
*  I just did normal stuff. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7246.360000000001s)]
*  I just didn't throw any kicks or anything. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7247.56s)]
*  Reveals what caused leg break. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7250.84s)]
*  He said, just fucking shit luck. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7252.92s)]
*  And so it is a leg break. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7255.240000000001s)]
*  Stepped on the foot, pulled back, [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7260.320000000001s)]
*  and then dragged my body forward. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7262.08s)]
*  But this is like right after the fight, correct? [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7264.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that thing I was just reading [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7267.200000000001s)]
*  was like some other complications [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7268.6s)]
*  he had after he got surgery or had some comp. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7270.08s)]
*  What was that? [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7275.56s)]
*  Did he have like staph infection or something? [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7276.92s)]
*  He had a clot or something. [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7278.52s)]
*  Oh, Jesus. [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7279.84s)]
*  But I guess he didn't. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7280.4400000000005s)]
*  He went to the doctor. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7281.4800000000005s)]
*  They told him to go home. [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7282.400000000001s)]
*  So what was actually wrong with the leg? [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7284.6s)]
*  Trying to find the date. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7287.88s)]
*  They're saying leg break. [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7288.76s)]
*  This is November 3rd. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7290.24s)]
*  I felt like he didn't break his leg. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7292.6s)]
*  I felt like he thought it was broken. [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7296.04s)]
*  But then Dana White said it wasn't. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7297.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7302.0s)]
*  OK. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7303.96s)]
*  Either or. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7304.88s)]
*  It wasn't as significant as Conor's, [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7305.68s)]
*  where you snap both the tibia and the fibula. [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7307.56s)]
*  Both of them, it was dangling there. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7310.2s)]
*  I mean, he went into that fight with a fractured leg. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7311.84s)]
*  He had a stress fracture that was already there. [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7316.639999999999s)]
*  They were looking at it. [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7319.28s)]
*  Headed for surgery after suffering broken ankle. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7320.44s)]
*  Dana White admits error. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7323.4s)]
*  Oh, so Dana had said that it wasn't broken, [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7324.759999999999s)]
*  but it in fact was broken. [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7328.24s)]
*  I get it. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7329.959999999999s)]
*  So he had to get his ankle repaired, which is bad, [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7331.679999999999s)]
*  but not as bad. [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7336.28s)]
*  Getting this tibia and the fibula snap, [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7337.919999999999s)]
*  and then you have to reestablish blood flow, [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7341.08s)]
*  and everything has to heal back up. [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7343.04s)]
*  And then also, you're fucking kicking knees and elbows [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7345.12s)]
*  and shit. [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7348.32s)]
*  And I mean, how confident is he going to be throwing that leg? [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7348.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7352.64s)]
*  I guess he's one of the premier shit talkers, [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7353.92s)]
*  but it's wild how aggressive he is with it still, [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7356.44s)]
*  even though he's kind of in this losing streak position. [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7359.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7363.96s)]
*  Yeah, it is weird. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7365.2s)]
*  His last big win was Donald Cerrone, [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7366.599999999999s)]
*  which was a significant win. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7368.8s)]
*  But then I wonder, it could be just inactivity too. [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7370.12s)]
*  The inactivity is probably one of the bigger [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7377.44s)]
*  factors in his demise. [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7380.2s)]
*  Maybe even more so than just the silk sheets. [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7383.04s)]
*  Like he said that after the Dustin Poirier fight, [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7387.64s)]
*  when Dustin Poirier knocked him out, [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7389.72s)]
*  he's like, I just feel like inactivity is a real problem. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7391.22s)]
*  I just need to get back in here and be active. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7393.96s)]
*  Because there's a lot going on in a fight, [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7396.8s)]
*  and if you're not accustomed to fighting at a high level, [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7399.92s)]
*  the stress of that moment is so overwhelming. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7402.6s)]
*  Very, very difficult for guys to just take years off [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7406.12s)]
*  and jump back in and be at 100%. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7408.72s)]
*  Yeah, even the guys who are on a hot streak like Costa [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7410.76s)]
*  and just melting under pressure, some of them, [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7413.52s)]
*  definitely seems like even at the highest [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7416.4400000000005s)]
*  level with the most confident of individuals, [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7418.32s)]
*  they might just fucking crack under the pressure. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7420.08s)]
*  He's a funny guy. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7423.4400000000005s)]
*  He's leaning into this whole secret juice thing. [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7424.28s)]
*  Yeah, hilarious. [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7426.72s)]
*  He's a jug that says secret juice on it. [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7427.72s)]
*  Do you think that he's on something, [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7429.72s)]
*  or do you think he's just very extraordinary genetics? [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7431.2s)]
*  That's the thing. [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7437.4800000000005s)]
*  I did a whole deep dive video on what [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7438.360000000001s)]
*  I think he could be doing. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7441.08s)]
*  And I think for any individual that doesn't pass the eye test, [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7442.280000000001s)]
*  he would definitely be one of those individuals. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7446.92s)]
*  But I wouldn't boil it down to that. [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7448.92s)]
*  He could be a hyper outlier individual for sure. [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7450.64s)]
*  And I wouldn't want to ever say a definitive statement. [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7454.76s)]
*  But I think if there was ever a person, [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7457.04s)]
*  maybe not if there was ever a person, [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7459.84s)]
*  but I think it's highly probable that he's [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7461.84s)]
*  done certain things for sure. [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7464.2s)]
*  Even when he went into the ultimate fighter, [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7467.56s)]
*  what is the show called again? [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7471.08s)]
*  The ultimate fighter thing? [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7472.72s)]
*  Yeah, the secret juice. [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7474.0s)]
*  He went in as a self-proclaimed bodybuilder from Brazil. [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7475.08s)]
*  And his physique very much represented [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7478.6s)]
*  what you would expect. [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7481.36s)]
*  And his performance is only, obviously, he [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7482.32s)]
*  was more of a newbie back then. [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7484.64s)]
*  But even outside of myself, highly respected individuals [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7486.48s)]
*  like Farrasahabi also believes he's on gear [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7491.04s)]
*  or has done certain things. [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7493.36s)]
*  And yeah, you can never say for certain [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7494.679999999999s)]
*  if they're passing tests, obviously. [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7498.799999999999s)]
*  But a lot of finicky shit sometimes [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7500.2s)]
*  goes into when they're testing out of the country, politics, [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7502.16s)]
*  corruption, et cetera. [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7506.04s)]
*  Yes. [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7507.32s)]
*  I didn't know how. [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7508.28s)]
*  I wouldn't say there's a lack of comprehension [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7512.639999999999s)]
*  in the comprehensiveness in the USADA tests. [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7515.88s)]
*  But they're not bulletproof. [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7519.76s)]
*  Yeah, it's not that they're not trying. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7521.68s)]
*  It's like they only have so much, well, I guess, [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7523.88s)]
*  who's interpreting that? [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7526.2s)]
*  Some people might say otherwise. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7527.76s)]
*  But it is budget restricted. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7529.400000000001s)]
*  So you can only do so much testing on every fighter. [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7532.52s)]
*  And then sometimes their choice of who's being tested, [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7535.36s)]
*  though, is definitely a little bit iffy. [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7538.2s)]
*  Like there was the light heavy guy. [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7540.84s)]
*  I think it was a Jeery, or what's his name? [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7543.44s)]
*  Jeery Prohost. [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7546.4s)]
*  Yeah, he was tested like 51 times. [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7546.919999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and then if you looked at like a Dillashaw, [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7549.799999999999s)]
*  he was tested like nine times or something, [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7551.919999999999s)]
*  which is just like, why? [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7553.839999999999s)]
*  Right. [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7555.839999999999s)]
*  Why is he tested less when he's actually popped out? [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7556.4s)]
*  Yeah, like some of the most premier suspect guys [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7559.28s)]
*  were tested like single digit times. [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7561.12s)]
*  And this other guy somehow has like half of USADA's fucking [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7562.759999999999s)]
*  budget allocated to him. [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7566.28s)]
*  Like I get that he was new in the actual sport, [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7567.839999999999s)]
*  I forget where he came from exactly. [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7574.08s)]
*  Well, he was not new in MMA. [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7575.8s)]
*  No, no, no. [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7577.36s)]
*  He just wasn't fighting. [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7577.88s)]
*  New to the UFC, right? [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7578.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7579.5599999999995s)]
*  So the idea that some people have put out [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7580.04s)]
*  is they needed to establish more of a comprehensive passport [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7582.4s)]
*  on him quicker so that he had more [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7585.16s)]
*  elaborate testing off the jump then. [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7586.68s)]
*  Look at that, though. [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7588.5599999999995s)]
*  That's so nuts. [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7589.36s)]
*  Yeah, it was a really. [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7590.32s)]
*  He's so much more tested than anyone else. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7591.28s)]
*  Yeah, it was like a wild disparity. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7593.92s)]
*  Wild. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7596.76s)]
*  Rosanamma Eunice got tested more than Paulo Costa. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7597.84s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7603.92s)]
*  Neil Magni got tested more than Paulo Costa. [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7605.56s)]
*  That is nuts. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7608.64s)]
*  And for Dilishaw only getting single digit tests, [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7610.2s)]
*  it was like. [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7612.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7613.56s)]
*  It just very much brought into question, [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7614.08s)]
*  like were they hoping he'd have more leeway in order [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7616.96s)]
*  to not have like, give him the opportunity [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7620.4800000000005s)]
*  to actually have a good fight when he's coming back [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7623.0s)]
*  sort of thing? [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7626.16s)]
*  There's a lot of speculation, obviously. [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7627.12s)]
*  You couldn't say one way or another [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7628.28s)]
*  what actually is going on. [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7629.6s)]
*  And they're very tight lipped about, [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7631.24s)]
*  like they don't reveal test results anymore [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7633.04s)]
*  like they used to. [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7634.8s)]
*  Back in the day, you could actually [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7635.5199999999995s)]
*  get like John Jones fucking urine analysis [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7637.32s)]
*  and interpret it yourself and like see what's going on. [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7639.5199999999995s)]
*  Whereas now, it's like if a guy pops or whatever, [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7641.96s)]
*  it's very, you can't really get insight [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7644.08s)]
*  onto what their decision making process is. [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7647.48s)]
*  Even when asked about Connor, they [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7649.32s)]
*  were very, very vague in their answer. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7651.32s)]
*  It was very much just like, this is [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7653.76s)]
*  what the rule set is for getting in and out of the pool [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7655.8s)]
*  and the testing window that you need to be subject to in order [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7658.68s)]
*  to be qualified to fight again. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7661.12s)]
*  And that's it. [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7662.84s)]
*  We're not going to speak on any individual fighter, [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7663.6s)]
*  what has happened with them or not happened with them, [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7665.4800000000005s)]
*  et cetera. [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7667.0s)]
*  I blame you. [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7667.52s)]
*  I do. [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7669.16s)]
*  When you covered the John Jones situation, [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7671.360000000001s)]
*  that was very illuminating to me. [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7674.52s)]
*  I was like, oh, OK. [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7676.320000000001s)]
*  And then you were talking about the test levels [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7680.08s)]
*  and the epitestosterone to testosterone ratio [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7683.04s)]
*  and how it was all off. [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7686.68s)]
*  And all of these points seemed to indicate [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7688.16s)]
*  that someone who was supplementing [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7691.28s)]
*  with exogenous hormones. [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7693.72s)]
*  Yeah, it was like a pretty comprehensive picture [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7695.64s)]
*  that is hard to dispute with all the evidence presented. [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7700.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7703.68s)]
*  You couldn't be like, oh, for fucking sure. [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7704.2s)]
*  But it's pretty hard to refute what [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7706.44s)]
*  has been put in front of our face [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7709.08s)]
*  with the positive test results and all [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7710.4s)]
*  of the other background context. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7712.04s)]
*  Yeah, and it's also a guy who is a wild dude. [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7714.2s)]
*  He's doing a lot of wild shit. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7719.84s)]
*  He's doing coke. [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7721.6s)]
*  It's not like his body's a temple. [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7724.56s)]
*  What do you think about his comeback? [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7727.6s)]
*  Interesting. [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7730.08s)]
*  If anybody wanted to get bigger and get taken out of the pool, [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7731.24s)]
*  I would have thought John did it. [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7734.4s)]
*  I mean, that would be the move. [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7736.04s)]
*  Get super saucy. [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7738.56s)]
*  I wonder if he saw the situation and was like, [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7740.0s)]
*  fuck. [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7741.8s)]
*  Yeah, probably, because he's trying to come back naturally. [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7742.4400000000005s)]
*  But he's fucking big as shit now. [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7746.16s)]
*  He's like 255, 260 now. [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7747.96s)]
*  The question is, that's a lot of time off. [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7751.52s)]
*  But if Francis Ngannou versus John Jones is the big fight, [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7754.92s)]
*  well, Francis has had to take a lot of time off as well, [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7759.72s)]
*  because Francis had a torn MCL and ACL, had to get surgery, [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7762.4400000000005s)]
*  reconstructed his leg, rehabilitated it, [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7766.68s)]
*  got out for over a year. [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7770.0s)]
*  So that, to me, is very interesting. [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7771.84s)]
*  I like that fight, because Francis has had a lot of time [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7774.0s)]
*  off, John's had a lot of time off, and it's commensurate, [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7777.16s)]
*  at least close. [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7782.72s)]
*  I mean, obviously, Francis has been more active recently. [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7783.64s)]
*  But at least that time off makes sense to me. [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7786.2s)]
*  And it's a very compelling fight. [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7789.08s)]
*  And I think John, his background, his resume, [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7790.96s)]
*  does warrant an immediate shot at the title. [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7795.36s)]
*  He's absolutely one of the greatest fighters of all time. [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7797.76s)]
*  No ifs, ands, or buts. [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7799.96s)]
*  And him stepping up from light heavyweight, [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7801.2s)]
*  relinquishing the title, voluntarily saying, [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7803.4800000000005s)]
*  I'm done with this. [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7805.68s)]
*  I'm going to move up to heavyweight [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7807.16s)]
*  and be the heavyweight champ. [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7808.52s)]
*  And then building himself legitimately into a heavyweight, [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7809.52s)]
*  and then documenting it all, showing all the deadlifts, [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7812.8s)]
*  showing all the squats, showing put on size [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7815.44s)]
*  and put on some body fat, that's compelling. [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7818.88s)]
*  What do you foresee as if it happened, [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7822.96s)]
*  what would be your prediction? [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7825.76s)]
*  Well, the grappling of John Jones [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7828.44s)]
*  is very difficult to deal with. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7829.879999999999s)]
*  I mean, for a guy like Francis Ngannou, [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7831.44s)]
*  who was primarily a striker and was taken down [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7834.24s)]
*  on multiple occasions by Stipe Miocic, [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7838.2s)]
*  and really dominated in their first fight, [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7841.24s)]
*  the question is, has Francis gotten better at grappling? [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7843.5599999999995s)]
*  Well, he definitely has, because he beat Cyril Gahn [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7847.12s)]
*  with grappling. [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7850.04s)]
*  That was the fight that he fought with his blown out leg. [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7851.0s)]
*  And he fought Cyril Gahn, who is a fucking phenomenal striker. [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7854.2s)]
*  I don't know if you saw Cyril Gahn versus Taitui Vassa. [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7858.4s)]
*  Holy shit, is Cyril Gahn good. [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7861.48s)]
*  He's so technical, so smooth, and his combinations are since. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7863.16s)]
*  And Francis beat him with his grappling. [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7867.16s)]
*  So Francis's grappling, even with a fucked up leg, [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7870.92s)]
*  has gotten a lot better. [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7873.5199999999995s)]
*  But has it got to John Jones levels? [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7874.639999999999s)]
*  That's the big question. [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7877.36s)]
*  Because John took down Daniel Cormier, [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7878.44s)]
*  who's an Olympic wrestler. [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7882.599999999999s)]
*  I mean, John's a fucking monster when it comes to grappling. [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7884.08s)]
*  And he's also just as tall as anybody in the heavyweight [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7887.8s)]
*  division. [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7890.72s)]
*  And he has a phenomenal understanding of distance. [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7891.64s)]
*  He's the very best at utilizing reach. [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7896.08s)]
*  But when he goes up, he's now fighting [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7899.2s)]
*  guys that are his height and even bigger than him, [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7901.08s)]
*  and Francis. [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7904.360000000001s)]
*  So how does he deal with that? [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7905.6s)]
*  How does he deal with a guy like Cyril Gahn? [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7906.84s)]
*  How does he deal with these? [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7909.16s)]
*  It's interesting to find out. [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7910.64s)]
*  And I love the fact that he really [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7912.0s)]
*  didn't want to do light heavyweight anymore. [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7914.0s)]
*  He's like, I'm done. [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7915.72s)]
*  I want a new challenge. [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7916.4800000000005s)]
*  I want to be a two division champion. [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7917.52s)]
*  But it's a long time. [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7920.040000000001s)]
*  It's taking a long time. [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7921.320000000001s)]
*  How old is he now? [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7922.92s)]
*  I would imagine John's 35, 36 maybe. [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7924.68s)]
*  What is peak fighter age? [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7928.280000000001s)]
*  35? [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7929.84s)]
*  Around there. [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7930.4400000000005s)]
*  How old is he? [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7931.040000000001s)]
*  He's 35? [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7932.4400000000005s)]
*  I think peak fighter age is probably 30 to 34, [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7934.56s)]
*  if I had to guess. [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7939.72s)]
*  And below, obviously. [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7940.92s)]
*  Some elite fighters are 26, 27. [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7942.88s)]
*  But when it gets to championship level, [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7944.96s)]
*  there's one thing like prospects. [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7947.24s)]
*  It's very rare that someone is at championship level [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7949.679999999999s)]
*  that young. [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7951.8s)]
*  That's why John was so amazing. [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7953.04s)]
*  John was the youngest ever UFC champion [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7954.92s)]
*  and was as elite as anybody alive when he was 22 years old. [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7958.16s)]
*  He was as good at everything as anybody was. [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7964.08s)]
*  He opened up the fight for the world title [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7966.96s)]
*  against Mauricio Shogun, who was a legend. [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7969.5599999999995s)]
*  He opens up that fight with a flying knee, which is crazy. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7972.36s)]
*  Who does that? [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7975.96s)]
*  But that's John. [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7976.6s)]
*  He's just a wild, confident, risk-taking, skillful fighter [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7977.88s)]
*  who has one of the highest fight IQs I've ever seen. [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7982.6s)]
*  His ability to know what to do and when to do it [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7986.6s)]
*  is just extraordinary. [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7988.92s)]
*  The thing about Francis, though, is he has nuclear power. [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7991.0s)]
*  It's a totally different kind of power. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7995.72s)]
*  Yeah, so you get caught with one shot, and you're fucked. [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=7997.8s)]
*  He's a 265-pound natural, 6-foot-5 man. [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8001.0s)]
*  Francis is a monster. [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8007.24s)]
*  And he hits people where you just sit there and go, Jesus. [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8009.88s)]
*  The Alistair Overeem one is the best example. [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8014.44s)]
*  He hit Alistair Overeem with a left uppercut slash hook [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8017.04s)]
*  where Alistair's head snapped so far back, [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8020.52s)]
*  he was looking at his ankles. [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8023.12s)]
*  It was just crazy. [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8025.44s)]
*  That knockout was just like, Jesus. [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8027.24s)]
*  That's what Francis has. [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8030.4s)]
*  And when he knocked out Steve Bamiocic to win the title, [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8031.759999999999s)]
*  and John has to be very, very, very aware of that. [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8036.719999999999s)]
*  Francis has a giant striking advantage. [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8039.759999999999s)]
*  Giant. [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8041.839999999999s)]
*  It's wild when you see guys grind through five rounds, [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8042.48s)]
*  and they still get caught at the end with one shot, [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8045.16s)]
*  and that's all it takes. [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8047.2s)]
*  Yeah, Kamaru Usman and Leon Edwards. [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8048.32s)]
*  Yeah, or the Pereira. [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8050.5599999999995s)]
*  We were talking about that last year, [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8053.4s)]
*  and I was asking him how he was going to go. [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8054.679999999999s)]
*  No. [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8057.04s)]
*  Can never fucking put your guard down or be [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8058.360000000001s)]
*  too careful with that guy. [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8061.2s)]
*  Well, that's an interesting thing. [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8062.64s)]
*  How much have you looked into the science of weight cutting? [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8064.08s)]
*  Yeah, there are certain drugs you [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8068.88s)]
*  can use that I believe aren't banned that you can do pretty [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8071.0s)]
*  hyperaggressive fat loss in short condensed time frames. [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8074.72s)]
*  Like what drugs? [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8079.68s)]
*  Have you ever heard of DNP? [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8081.0s)]
*  No. [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8082.320000000001s)]
*  Dinitrophenol. [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8083.2s)]
*  It was used in explosives in World War I, [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8084.2s)]
*  and then they found out that after the workers were creating [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8086.36s)]
*  the bombs, they were overheating and dying, [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8089.96s)]
*  and they figured out it was because it was being absorbed [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8091.84s)]
*  transdermally and increasing their metabolism so much [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8094.08s)]
*  that they were internally overheating. [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8096.5599999999995s)]
*  Whoa. [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8098.4s)]
*  Yeah, and they marketed it as a fat loss agent [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8099.28s)]
*  for however many years in like decades ago, [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8101.28s)]
*  almost a fucking 100 years ago at this point. [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8106.04s)]
*  And people started dying because it's [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8108.04s)]
*  very easy to miscalculate your dose or use. [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8110.92s)]
*  The lethal dose is not that far from the effective dose. [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8115.08s)]
*  Oh, god. [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8117.76s)]
*  And people were overheating and dying, [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8118.28s)]
*  and they took it off the market, and it's become illegal. [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8119.88s)]
*  But as far as I know, I don't think they actually [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8122.16s)]
*  test for it in USADA. [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8124.4400000000005s)]
*  If you put in their drug database, 2,4-dinitrophenol, [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8125.52s)]
*  I don't think they test for it. [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8128.92s)]
*  And there are certain other things too, [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8130.68s)]
*  but there are a lot of loopholes on it. [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8132.6s)]
*  I don't even think they test for stimulants [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8135.28s)]
*  outside of competition either, like amphetamines and whatnot. [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8137.04s)]
*  Really? [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8140.36s)]
*  Yeah, so there are a lot of things [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8140.92s)]
*  you could do to nuke your appetite, [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8141.72s)]
*  increase energy expenditure significantly, [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8143.84s)]
*  drop water weight potentially more aggressively, [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8148.0s)]
*  and cut harder than would otherwise be naturally [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8150.32s)]
*  possible potentially. [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8154.360000000001s)]
*  So I don't necessarily think that he's [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8157.08s)]
*  doing all these things, but when you see a guy lose like fucking [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8158.96s)]
*  60 pounds or something, you can only [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8161.32s)]
*  imagine he's looking for any loophole that. [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8162.8s)]
*  What about stuff like semaglutide? [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8165.52s)]
*  That as well. [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8167.64s)]
*  Yeah, that is a- [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8168.64s)]
*  Is that legal in USADA? [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8169.64s)]
*  You could check easily. [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8171.96s)]
*  It's like UFC DRO, and you type in the database any drug name, [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8173.2s)]
*  and it'll say in competition, out of competition, allowed [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8176.5199999999995s)]
*  or not. [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8178.84s)]
*  I imagine GLP-1 agonists are not restricted, [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8179.679999999999s)]
*  because it's used to treat type 2 diabetes or obesity [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8182.24s)]
*  at the higher dosages, and super effective. [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8187.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8190.44s)]
*  So does that just curb your appetite? [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8191.679999999999s)]
*  Is that what that stuff does? [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8194.0s)]
*  Yeah, so it basically makes you feel satiated way easier, [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8195.36s)]
*  essentially. [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8201.04s)]
*  Your compulsion to eat is so dramatically hindered [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8201.76s)]
*  that you're way more likely to stick to a diet. [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8205.52s)]
*  Even individuals, if you become a morbidly obese person, [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8208.16s)]
*  sometimes there are genetic predispositions at play, [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8212.8s)]
*  for sure. [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8215.52s)]
*  But in addition, a lot of these individuals, [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8216.2s)]
*  they lack willpower to stick to a diet [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8219.16s)]
*  and follow a well-thought-out exercise regimen or whatever. [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8222.68s)]
*  To get to that point, many of them [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8226.68s)]
*  do lack the willpower necessary, because they're [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8228.52s)]
*  succumb to cravings and whatnot. [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8231.759999999998s)]
*  And not every individual has the same hunger, appetite, satiety, [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8233.199999999999s)]
*  feedback signals that the next guy might have who's super lean. [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8237.4s)]
*  And that's why they can walk around lean, [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8240.56s)]
*  because they just don't get as hungry. [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8241.88s)]
*  And these individuals, even the morbidly obese, really fat [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8243.759999999998s)]
*  motherfuckers, they would end up losing 30 pounds plus on average [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8248.039999999999s)]
*  when they use this stuff, when they were testing it [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8253.279999999999s)]
*  for type 2 diabetes. [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8255.4s)]
*  And they started ramping up the dose [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8256.759999999998s)]
*  and found that there was an obesity management. [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8258.16s)]
*  Obesity management dose. [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8260.36s)]
*  That was hyper effective for these guys [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8263.8s)]
*  to lose 30, 40 pounds, which is very, very effective [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8265.6s)]
*  for managing hemoglobin A1C, fasting insulin levels, [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8270.279999999999s)]
*  fasting glucose levels, and becoming far more healthy [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8274.119999999999s)]
*  individuals as a result. [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8276.279999999999s)]
*  But it's as a consequence of the weight loss. [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8277.44s)]
*  But these individuals would typically overeat otherwise, [[02:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8279.52s)]
*  and they start using this drug. [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8281.88s)]
*  And all of a sudden, they don't feel [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8283.32s)]
*  compelled to eat nearly as many calories. [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8285.76s)]
*  Interesting. [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8288.48s)]
*  So if you're a fighter who's aggressively cutting, [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8289.04s)]
*  you still have the same cravings as anybody else who's [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8292.12s)]
*  following a diet model of any sort, [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8295.0s)]
*  like trying to get the single digit body [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8298.04s)]
*  fat to step on a weigh-in before fight night, [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8299.800000000001s)]
*  and you're water depleted, whatever. [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8303.400000000001s)]
*  You can imagine you would just love to eat a piece of chocolate [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8304.76s)]
*  right now, or anything. [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8307.84s)]
*  Your cravings are through the goddamn roof, [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8308.880000000001s)]
*  because your body's feedback signals are screaming at you [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8310.68s)]
*  to eat nutrients. [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8313.640000000001s)]
*  So trying to fight back against that with pharmacology [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8315.36s)]
*  would absolutely be useful. [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8318.28s)]
*  Do you think that using semiglutide, though, [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8320.12s)]
*  would affect physical performance? [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8323.12s)]
*  Because of the diminished appetite, [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8324.560000000001s)]
*  is there any other sort of feedback loop [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8328.24s)]
*  that would let you, like maybe you [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8330.16s)]
*  wouldn't take in the nutrients that are necessary to have [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8332.0s)]
*  a good workout? [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8334.320000000002s)]
*  Potentially. [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8335.44s)]
*  Like it, there we go. [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8336.24s)]
*  Not prohibited. [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8337.640000000001s)]
*  Semiglutide in competition, not prohibited, not prohibited, [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8338.84s)]
*  out of competition. [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8342.12s)]
*  This is something that is just being learned about. [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8342.960000000001s)]
*  In the health space, health and wellness, [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8345.88s)]
*  and actual scientific community, semiglutide [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8349.16s)]
*  has been known about for a long time, [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8352.199999999999s)]
*  because it was used to manage type 2 diabetes. [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8353.68s)]
*  But only more recently has it started [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8356.24s)]
*  to pick up steam in popularity for its effects on obesity, [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8358.0s)]
*  because all these crazy headlines are coming out [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8361.599999999999s)]
*  about people losing 30, 40 plus pounds who otherwise couldn't. [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8363.76s)]
*  And as far as how it would affect a fighter's ability [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8367.199999999999s)]
*  to assimilate nutrients, stuff like that, [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8369.76s)]
*  yeah, it slows gastric emptying significantly, [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8372.039999999999s)]
*  and it can cause pretty intense GI issues, make you nauseous. [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8374.2s)]
*  Maybe you don't even want to eat the food that you [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8378.92s)]
*  need to eat if you're, you know, kind of depends [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8380.92s)]
*  on what situation you're imposing on yourself. [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8383.16s)]
*  But yeah, it's not a side effect free drug by any means. [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8386.52s)]
*  That would be significant. [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8389.0s)]
*  That would be a real problem, I would think. [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8390.44s)]
*  Don't you think? [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8392.16s)]
*  Yeah, it depends on your individual response. [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8393.16s)]
*  Like there are a lot of individuals using it. [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8395.560000000001s)]
*  Like even Elon Musk uses it now. [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8398.28s)]
*  What? [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8400.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, he posted a tweet. [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8400.92s)]
*  Somebody was like, hey, Elon, how are you so lean now? [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8403.64s)]
*  Or like, how did you lose the weight? [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8406.44s)]
*  And he was like, fasting and Wegovi. [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8408.0s)]
*  And Wegovi is the branded 2.4 milligram increment [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8409.84s)]
*  of semaglutide. [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8413.960000000001s)]
*  So it's like the highest dose you could be using. [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8414.880000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8418.800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8420.12s)]
*  So how does he look now? [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8420.880000000001s)]
*  A lot thinner. [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8423.12s)]
*  Does he? [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8424.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8425.0s)]
*  Show a picture of Elon Musk looking jacked, like that. [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8425.68s)]
*  Have you seen that thing? [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8430.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8431.92s)]
*  That's the thing people made us. [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8432.44s)]
*  That's Elon. [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8433.640000000001s)]
*  That's supposed to be, it's called gigachad. [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8435.800000000001s)]
*  So if he was following the nine ancestral tenants. [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8437.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8440.16s)]
*  If he was like just eating raw liver, sunning his balls. [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8440.68s)]
*  He said he used popular weight loss [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8444.32s)]
*  drug to get fit, ripped, and healthy. [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8445.800000000001s)]
*  He does look thinner there. [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8450.08s)]
*  Yeah, there we go. [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8452.04s)]
*  That was the tweet. [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8452.880000000001s)]
*  Let's see. [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8455.2s)]
*  Oh yeah, looks quite a bit thinner. [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8456.28s)]
*  Well, you know what? [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8458.800000000001s)]
*  There was a photo of him on a yacht [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8459.6s)]
*  where he looked like a wine barrel. [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8461.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8462.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8463.68s)]
*  He got big. [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8464.16s)]
*  That's the thing. [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8465.24s)]
*  That guy works fucking 16 hours a day. [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8465.92s)]
*  Sometimes it's unflattering angles, though. [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8467.76s)]
*  You're pushing your stomach and whatever. [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8469.96s)]
*  A little fasting and Wegovy. [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8473.039999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8474.76s)]
*  So Wegovy is like the, there are different increments [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8475.88s)]
*  of dosage from the company that makes it. [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8480.84s)]
*  And the lower dosage, like the drug is semaglutide. [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8483.28s)]
*  And I think the lower one is called Ozempic. [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8487.039999999999s)]
*  And it's for diabetes management. [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8489.4s)]
*  But it's basically just like a pen that's [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8490.84s)]
*  like in one milligram increments. [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8493.12s)]
*  And that's the diabetes management dose. [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8495.08s)]
*  There's other smaller increments, too. [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8497.08s)]
*  But 2.4 milligrams is like the max well tolerated dose [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8498.52s)]
*  where for obesity management, it's like significantly [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8502.84s)]
*  more effective. [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8506.36s)]
*  I would think that for a fighter, [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8507.72s)]
*  if that really does have all those little gastrointestinal [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8509.32s)]
*  issues and. [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8512.12s)]
*  Yeah, the net ROI might be negative. [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8513.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8515.2s)]
*  I would think so. [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8516.12s)]
*  Yeah, it depends. [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8517.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8518.0s)]
*  What other thing? [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8518.56s)]
*  There's a limited supply for that drug right now. [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8520.08s)]
*  Of course. [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8522.08s)]
*  We've talked about it 15 times. [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8523.52s)]
*  You can't get it. [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8525.48s)]
*  All these fat people are so mad. [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8526.28s)]
*  Yeah, well, lose weight. [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8529.16s)]
*  It's like the value of willpower is very underappreciated. [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8531.36s)]
*  But I get it. [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8535.16s)]
*  And especially when someone is, they're [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8536.4s)]
*  used to consuming a lot of carbohydrates, [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8538.88s)]
*  very difficult to cut that down to a place where you're actually [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8541.28s)]
*  going to be in a deficit. [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8545.72s)]
*  Yeah, some of the neurochemical changes [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8547.0s)]
*  that happen when you're accustomed to the Western diet [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8549.04s)]
*  with processed foods and stuff, you're kind of. [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8551.160000000002s)]
*  Some of these individuals, I think, [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8552.880000000001s)]
*  are imposing a situation on themselves [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8554.2s)]
*  where their brain is so sugar addicted or processed food [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8556.400000000001s)]
*  addicted where they then need pharmacology [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8559.400000000001s)]
*  to stick to a reasonable calorie intake [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8562.44s)]
*  so they can eat their shitty foods too. [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8565.320000000002s)]
*  Or I think a lot of this, not always, [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8567.800000000001s)]
*  but some of this appetite feedback regulating stuff [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8570.0s)]
*  could happen naturally if you just had a high quality diet, [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8573.160000000002s)]
*  high quality sleep. [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8576.6s)]
*  A lot of these things are massively [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8577.72s)]
*  impacted by sleep quality, duration, diet quality, [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8579.64s)]
*  exercise regimen. [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8583.519999999999s)]
*  And it sort of self-regulates itself like a normal, healthy [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8584.72s)]
*  body would. [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8587.24s)]
*  And some of this stuff could be band-aids [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8588.16s)]
*  for certain individuals who are getting shit sleep, [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8589.92s)]
*  doing whatever. [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8592.119999999999s)]
*  That makes sense. [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8593.72s)]
*  When I did the carnivore diet, I was pretty shocked at how [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8595.56s)]
*  easily satisfied I was. [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8598.96s)]
*  And if I had done the carnivore diet [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8601.08s)]
*  and then someone put a plate of spaghetti in front of me [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8604.32s)]
*  while I was doing that, I would be done eating, [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8606.28s)]
*  fine with the carnivore diet. [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8609.16s)]
*  But the spaghetti would be like, I want that now. [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8610.480000000001s)]
*  And I could eat that. [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8612.84s)]
*  I could probably eat a whole bowl of spaghetti [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8614.08s)]
*  after eating, being completely satisfied with steak. [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8616.640000000001s)]
*  Whereas when I was on that diet very strictly, [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8620.880000000001s)]
*  which is just for a month, I could be fine. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8623.24s)]
*  I'm done eating. [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8626.880000000001s)]
*  Isn't that weird how you have a second stomach for shit? [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8627.640000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8630.16s)]
*  For shit. [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8630.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8631.44s)]
*  French fries. [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8632.0s)]
*  I eat my dinner, and I'm like, I don't want more of that. [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8632.720000000001s)]
*  But ice cream. [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8635.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8635.68s)]
*  Fuck yeah. [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8636.16s)]
*  Give me all of that. [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8636.68s)]
*  Isn't that wild? [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8637.6s)]
*  All of a sudden, I can pile down 2,000 more calories. [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8638.56s)]
*  Crazy. [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8641.6s)]
*  And even nuts. [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8643.039999999999s)]
*  Sometimes I'll eat, and I'll be totally [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8644.84s)]
*  done with my healthy meal. [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8646.68s)]
*  But I'll be like, I want some almonds. [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8648.56s)]
*  I'm going to grab some almonds. [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8650.0s)]
*  But a handful of almonds, like 500 calories. [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8650.88s)]
*  Like a handful. [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8654.0s)]
*  That's it, right? [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8654.88s)]
*  No, it's absurd. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8655.64s)]
*  Almonds are very rich in calories, aren't they? [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8656.84s)]
*  Yeah, it's so easy to. [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8659.76s)]
*  And that's one thing when people, [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8661.48s)]
*  they think they're eating clean, and they [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8663.119999999999s)]
*  don't realize these little things that you [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8664.82s)]
*  do throughout the day, they stack up. [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8666.58s)]
*  If you just put them all in a bowl, [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8668.82s)]
*  and then you measure the calories in that bowl, [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8670.42s)]
*  you're like, oh, that's 1,500 calories. [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8672.34s)]
*  Yeah, it was wild as there was this university in Canada [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8674.42s)]
*  that removed all of the nutritional information, [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8678.1s)]
*  apparently, from the foods that the students are [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8681.26s)]
*  getting on their meal plans, because it was too triggering [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8684.619999999999s)]
*  to show the calories. [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8687.34s)]
*  And then it presents this fucked up scenario [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8689.42s)]
*  where you can't even self-regulate. [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8692.74s)]
*  Even the individuals who want to stay at a healthy weight, [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8695.26s)]
*  you can't even figure out what the fuck you're eating. [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8697.619999999999s)]
*  And I don't know, I'm on board with intuitive eating [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8700.38s)]
*  if you've gotten to the point where you've educated yourself [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8705.34s)]
*  enough about what your body actually needs, [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8707.88s)]
*  when to stop eating, and you've established healthy practices [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8710.82s)]
*  that have become cemented as your foundational [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8714.82s)]
*  infrastructure. [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8717.08s)]
*  But to then have a guy who doesn't even know how to diet [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8717.76s)]
*  and be like, oh, don't worry about it. [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8720.58s)]
*  You're satisfied. [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8722.34s)]
*  That's how you get fat. [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8723.86s)]
*  If I ate until I felt good, I would be a fat fuck. [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8725.58s)]
*  There was a viral video that went around [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8728.7s)]
*  that was a woman who was a god, I [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8731.02s)]

*  was talking about avoiding certain foods is just fat phobic, [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8737.1s)]

*  yourself donuts. [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8745.12s)]
*  And to call some food junk food is incorrect. [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8746.3s)]
*  And it's like, how are you ever speaking publicly on this? [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8752.22s)]
*  Also, she was obese as fuck. [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8757.619999999999s)]

*  Remember that video? [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8761.66s)]
*  Nutritionists were outraged. [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8764.22s)]
*  It's the same kind of outrage that you [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8765.98s)]
*  should have at them thinking that it's triggering [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8767.58s)]
*  to have actual data on the food you're eating. [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8770.38s)]

*  You should know what the calorie and what the nutrient content [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8776.66s)]
*  is of the food. [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8779.26s)]

*  in this university system. [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8813.46s)]

*  Fuck off. [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8865.7s)]
*  You guys are unhealthy. [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8866.42s)]
*  And it's not in any way good. [[02:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8868.58s)]
*  Yeah, it sucks if someone's fat and they feel bad [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8871.099999999999s)]
*  if someone calls them fat. [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8873.82s)]
*  You're right. [[02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8874.9s)]
*  And someone shouldn't do that. [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8875.46s)]
*  But they're fat. [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8876.66s)]
*  And you're fat. [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8878.58s)]
*  And the promotion of stuff that's not even food, too. [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8879.58s)]
*  Donuts. [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8883.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8884.82s)]
*  I'm not saying you shouldn't indulge, but it's like. [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8885.339999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8887.5s)]
*  You should earn it. [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8887.98s)]
*  Earn indulgence. [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8889.3s)]
*  If I have a piece of cake, I fucking earn that shit. [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8890.22s)]
*  And if I don't earn that shit, I feel [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8892.939999999999s)]
*  gross after I eat that piece of cake. [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8894.54s)]
*  But I try to balance it out. [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8896.5s)]
*  And a lot of people don't have the willpower to balance it out. [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8897.86s)]
*  They don't. [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8901.42s)]
*  They're not going to. [[02:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8902.300000000001s)]
*  They're not going to self-correct. [[02:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8903.220000000001s)]
*  They're not going to look at their gut in the mirror [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8904.86s)]
*  and go, Jesus, what am I doing with this? [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8906.62s)]
*  They're never going to make that, OK, tomorrow we stop this [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8908.62s)]
*  and we start that. [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8912.660000000002s)]
*  And now we get going in a positive direction. [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8913.62s)]
*  That's one of the good things about Goggins, though, too, [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8916.1s)]
*  is he showed that even him, who's [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8917.820000000002s)]
*  the most incredibly disciplined and hard individual out there, [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8919.820000000002s)]
*  he even at one point was not in the best shape. [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8923.78s)]
*  300 pounds. [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8926.62s)]
*  And turned it around. [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8927.300000000001s)]
*  And look at him now. [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8928.34s)]
*  So it's like, if he can do it, fucking anyone can, for sure. [[02:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8929.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8932.220000000001s)]
*  He's the best with that because he's not [[02:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8932.720000000001s)]
*  scared of being vulnerable. [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8935.140000000001s)]
*  So he's not scared of communicating that. [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8936.220000000001s)]
*  It's just like the problem with this fitness. [[02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8938.220000000001s)]
*  And one of the things I really admire about you is your openness [[02:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8942.34s)]
*  and your also you are so educated [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8945.54s)]
*  on so many different subjects when [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8949.62s)]
*  it comes to supplementation and training modalities [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8950.980000000001s)]
*  and all these different things. [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8953.5s)]
*  And you just talk about stuff from a place of actual knowledge. [[02:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8954.82s)]
*  There's so much bullshit in that world. [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8959.38s)]
*  There's like so many people who are just full of crap. [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8962.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8966.06s)]
*  No, it's wild how much misinformation [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8966.56s)]
*  is in this industry and misleading, I don't know, [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8968.54s)]
*  just like information designed to make [[02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8972.02s)]
*  you buy into whatever it is that they're trying to promote. [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8975.58s)]
*  That is, this is the only way. [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8978.1s)]
*  There's no other alternative. [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8980.06s)]
*  And I think more transparency in the industry overall [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8981.82s)]
*  is just always a net benefit for the individuals watching, [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8984.5s)]
*  trying to educate themselves. [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8989.26s)]
*  Very, very hard to come by. [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8991.74s)]
*  It's such an overwhelming amount of information [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8993.78s)]
*  now too across social media. [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8995.78s)]
*  It's like who do you even trust or listen to half the time? [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=8997.02s)]
*  Well, I know they can trust and listen to you. [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9000.18s)]
*  It's one of the things I appreciate about you. [[02:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9002.14s)]
*  And one of the things that happens [[02:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9004.1s)]
*  when a guy like the liver king gets so massive [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9005.58s)]
*  is that he develops this incredible following that really [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9009.46s)]
*  is unjustified given the fact that he's lied about stuff. [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9012.98s)]
*  But then that will come towards you now. [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9016.66s)]
*  And a lot of that will come towards you [[02:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9018.699999999999s)]
*  because people realize, who's this guy who's exposed this? [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9020.38s)]
*  And what is this? [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9022.98s)]
*  Oh, this guy's interesting. [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9023.58s)]
*  Look how educational this is. [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9026.06s)]
*  Let's look how much information this guy's giving out. [[02:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9027.699999999999s)]
*  This is great. [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9030.26s)]
*  And then they'll go to your other videos [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9031.1s)]
*  and they'll say, oh, there's a real good benefit to this. [[02:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9032.3s)]
*  And you talk about stuff without any worry [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9035.34s)]
*  about the moral quandary involved. [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9037.14s)]
*  You're just like, this is what's effective, [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9039.42s)]
*  and this is what works. [[02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9041.539999999999s)]
*  And that's how it should be. [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9043.38s)]
*  It should be up to the person who's [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9045.619999999999s)]
*  taking it to make your own decisions in terms of what [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9047.58s)]
*  you should and shouldn't do with your body. [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9050.42s)]
*  But you also show, look at this guy's fucking back [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9052.22s)]
*  and the acting. [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9054.82s)]
*  Look at this guy's tits from gyno. [[02:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9055.74s)]
*  Yeah, no, I'm sure that's why, as much as I do too, [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9057.619999999999s)]
*  I appreciate the stuff you do. [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9060.619999999999s)]
*  It's very, very transparent into what you do, [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9061.9s)]
*  what's effective, why you do it, what you feel [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9064.42s)]
*  is a waste of time, why, how you've learned things, [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9066.34s)]
*  how you've educated yourself over the years. [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9068.82s)]
*  You always have people on, regardless [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9071.9s)]
*  of how big or small their social media following is too. [[02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9073.460000000001s)]
*  You're just highly committed to high quality information [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9075.98s)]
*  and furthering your education and the education [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9078.86s)]
*  of those who are watching, which is super admirable. [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9081.1s)]
*  I don't know any other podcaster who actually just has on people [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9084.7s)]
*  they want to fucking talk to kind of thing. [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9088.58s)]
*  That's all my requirements. [[02:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9090.42s)]

*  I'm like, eh. [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9094.22s)]
*  I don't see where that's going to go. [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9095.74s)]
*  I only want to talk to people that I mention. [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9097.86s)]
*  And it's just up to me. [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9099.619999999999s)]
*  I will entertain it sometimes. [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9101.3s)]
*  A famous person will try to come on and go, [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9103.5s)]
*  all right, let me go watch an interview with them. [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9105.74s)]

*  Why? [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9169.300000000001s)]
*  What is it? [[02:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9170.42s)]
*  I want to learn about you, because I think in doing so, [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9171.94s)]
*  you learn about yourself. [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9174.54s)]
*  You learn about the human mind. [[02:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9176.18s)]
*  Is there any guests that are like your top, [[02:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9178.34s)]
*  I don't know, individuals you'd love to have on one day? [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9181.94s)]
*  Hunter Biden. [[02:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9184.06s)]
*  Hunter, come on. [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9185.460000000001s)]
*  I'm your only way out of this. [[02:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9187.460000000001s)]
*  No, I don't care. [[02:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9191.94s)]
*  I mean, look, my friends are my favorite people to talk to. [[02:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9194.460000000001s)]
*  Having comedians on or fighters on, [[02:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9197.5s)]
*  those are my favorite people to talk to for the most part. [[02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9199.62s)]
*  But I enjoy it. [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9203.06s)]
*  It's just very fortunate. [[02:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9205.66s)]
*  But also an unexpected education. [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9207.7s)]
*  That's been the most amazing part about it, [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9211.5s)]
*  is to be able to talk to so many intelligent people that [[02:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9213.26s)]
*  have so much information on so many different subjects [[02:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9216.02s)]
*  and be able to quiz them. [[02:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9218.18s)]
*  Like I had Neil deGrasse Tyson on the other day. [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9219.140000000001s)]
*  And I'm asking him about the Webb telescope. [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9221.140000000001s)]
*  And I'm like, OK, tell me, how does it work? [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9222.900000000001s)]
*  What are they doing? [[02:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9224.66s)]
*  So it's like you get this free seminar with this fucking [[02:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9226.02s)]
*  genius who gets to sit down and explain to you [[02:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9229.26s)]
*  how they can shoot a telescope a million miles into space [[02:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9231.820000000002s)]
*  and take photos of the cosmos. [[02:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9234.58s)]
*  What do you think of the neural link thing coming out soon? [[02:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9238.54s)]
*  Elon's going to chip himself or something? [[02:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9241.820000000002s)]
*  He's going to turn into a god. [[02:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9245.5s)]
*  He said he's going to put a chip in himself when it comes out. [[02:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9247.220000000001s)]
*  And he's hoping next year, which is wild. [[02:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9249.78s)]
*  He'll probably do it. [[02:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9252.94s)]
*  I guarantee he'll do it. [[02:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9253.980000000001s)]
*  They'll try it on some monkeys first. [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9255.86s)]
*  Do you worry about that shit? [[02:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9257.460000000001s)]
*  The progression of? [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9258.78s)]
*  Because I know you'll sit here and ask him about that stuff. [[02:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9259.820000000002s)]
*  And I don't know how much you worry about where [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9263.660000000002s)]
*  it's going in terms of. [[02:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9265.94s)]
*  Yeah, I worry a lot. [[02:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9267.34s)]
*  I think it's inevitable, though. [[02:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9268.859999999999s)]
*  I think there used to be single-celled organisms, [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9270.42s)]
*  and now there's multi-celled organisms that have cell phones. [[02:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9273.06s)]
*  I think that's just going to keep going. [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9275.9s)]
*  I think we're going to be inexorably connected [[02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9277.619999999999s)]
*  to technology. [[02:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9280.619999999999s)]
*  And it's going to be how I think there's [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9281.58s)]
*  going to come a time where we're not [[02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9283.5s)]
*  going to breed sexually anymore. [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9284.96s)]
*  And I think that's probably where all this low-T shit is [[02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9286.779999999999s)]
*  going. [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9289.5s)]
*  Oh, for sure. [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9290.779999999999s)]
*  Even if you just see an attractive woman, [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9292.22s)]
*  your test goes up. [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9293.9s)]
*  There's definitely a biological component [[02:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9295.7s)]
*  to it that is above and beyond the whole phallates [[02:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9297.900000000001s)]
*  and the endocrine disruptors and stuff. [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9300.94s)]
*  There is direct biological consequences [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9302.740000000002s)]
*  to the way people are living. [[02:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9304.94s)]
*  Yes. [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9306.42s)]
*  And there's also direct biological consequences [[02:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9307.26s)]
*  to overcoming difficulties and success. [[02:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9309.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9312.140000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9312.62s)]
*  There's a lot of weird interactions [[02:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9313.12s)]
*  with hormones and real-world events. [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9315.26s)]
*  No, I forget the study. [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9318.62s)]
*  But it was comparing somebody who won versus lost [[02:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9320.140000000001s)]
*  a competition or something. [[02:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9323.54s)]
*  And it was like the winner would get a boost in T. [[02:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9324.7s)]
*  Loser would lose T. [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9326.7s)]
*  Yes. [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9328.300000000001s)]
*  Oh, definitely. [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9328.980000000001s)]
*  That's true. [[02:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9329.86s)]
*  When I lost fights, I never wanted to have sex. [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9330.380000000001s)]
*  When I would lose fights, I'd just feel like a fucking loser [[02:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9333.1s)]
*  and just want to go home and just go to sleep. [[02:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9335.980000000001s)]
*  You just feel so down. [[02:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9338.78s)]
*  I think there's probably some sort [[02:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9342.86s)]
*  of human biological reward system [[02:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9346.220000000001s)]
*  that's built into that to try to encourage conquerors. [[02:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9350.58s)]
*  Oh, for sure. [[02:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9353.300000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9353.980000000001s)]
*  I wonder, for you, obviously, I think [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9354.78s)]
*  you're in your early 50s now. [[02:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9358.02s)]
*  Yeah, 55. [[02:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9359.54s)]
*  So would you, if it was possible, [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9360.58s)]
*  if it even came out and David Sinclair came out [[02:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9364.02s)]
*  with some crazy longevity thing, you could just live forever, [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9366.5s)]
*  would you want to maintain that in perpetuity? [[02:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9369.46s)]
*  And what do you think about the way? [[02:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9374.26s)]
*  I don't really know how to perceive if this is a good thing [[02:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9377.54s)]
*  the way things are going, just trying [[02:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9381.54s)]
*  to turn people into robots and this whole shift [[02:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9382.86s)]
*  towards maintaining the species in perpetuity. [[02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9386.140000000001s)]
*  There's one way to look at is, would you want to live forever? [[02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9390.18s)]
*  The other way to look at it is, do you want to deteriorate? [[02:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9393.060000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know how to adequately frame the question, [[02:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9395.74s)]
*  but it's a very odd scenario where [[02:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9398.18s)]
*  people are striving for this, I don't know. [[02:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9401.5s)]
*  Immortality, I guess. [[02:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9404.300000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, Ray Kurzweil genuinely wants immortality. [[02:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9406.54s)]
*  He wants you to download consciousness [[02:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9409.900000000001s)]
*  into some sort of supercomputer, and then you [[02:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9411.820000000002s)]
*  will exist in this new realm. [[02:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9414.42s)]
*  Yeah, because I'm trying to imagine what the future is [[02:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9416.380000000001s)]
*  of people just have this fucking chip in their head [[02:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9418.62s)]
*  and they're just sitting there brain dead on a couch, [[02:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9420.66s)]
*  simulating sex all day, essentially, [[02:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9424.060000000001s)]
*  and just hammering the dopamine button, and that's pretty much [[02:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9427.140000000001s)]
*  it. [[02:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9429.58s)]
*  Is that life in 100 years? [[02:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9430.1s)]
*  It's a real problem. [[02:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9432.54s)]
*  The Matrix used to be some fun movie that you go to watch [[02:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9433.980000000001s)]
*  and you're like, wow, what a crazy dystopian future. [[02:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9438.26s)]
*  But now in 2022, decades later, you go, [[02:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9441.42s)]
*  this is oddly around the corner. [[02:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9445.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9447.94s)]
*  No, it's eerie, how a line some of the old movies [[02:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9449.5s)]
*  is sort of becoming. [[02:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9453.7s)]
*  Well, the metaverse is kind of failing, right? [[02:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9454.5s)]
*  Zuckerberg pumped so much money into the metaverse, [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9457.34s)]
*  and now people are calling him a fool. [[02:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9460.34s)]
*  How much money did Meta lose on the metaverse, [[02:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9465.14s)]
*  banking on the metaverse? [[02:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9468.78s)]
*  It's like billions. [[02:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9469.94s)]
*  They laid off 11,000 people. [[02:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9471.46s)]
*  It's fucking crazy. [[02:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9474.1s)]
*  I didn't even understand what it was. [[02:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9476.3s)]
*  Was it just like you have a virtual character [[02:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9477.82s)]
*  and you go hang out with people as in a video game that [[02:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9479.42s)]
*  already exists, essentially? [[02:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9482.38s)]
*  Or what was the utility of it above and beyond basic things [[02:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9483.74s)]
*  that, I don't know, in the gaming world already exist? [[02:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9488.74s)]
*  Well, there's things that are educational about it [[02:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9491.42s)]
*  that are really interesting. [[02:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9494.98s)]
*  One of the things, he came in and he [[02:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9496.34s)]
*  gave me one of the newer units that are out now to try on [[02:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9497.82s)]
*  and show you the capabilities. [[02:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9502.66s)]
*  And one of the things you could do is virtual tourism. [[02:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9504.779999999999s)]
*  So you could go to the Louvre in Paris, [[02:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9508.42s)]
*  and you're walking around with people that are in the Louvre. [[02:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9510.26s)]
*  So they had someone wear it, right? [[02:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9514.3s)]
*  And then the cameras are all around. [[02:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9517.06s)]
*  They probably have multiple people that did it. [[02:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9519.46s)]
*  And then there's all these actual human beings [[02:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9521.74s)]
*  that are walking around the Louvre, [[02:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9524.779999999999s)]
*  and you walk in between them and can go walk right up [[02:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9526.1s)]
*  to this painting and check it out. [[02:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9529.78s)]
*  And it looks pretty good. [[02:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9532.66s)]
*  I mean, it doesn't obviously look 100% real. [[02:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9533.78s)]
*  But they can do that with things like Mount Everest. [[02:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9536.220000000001s)]
*  They can do that with things like Monoloa. [[02:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9538.94s)]
*  You could go to Tahiti. [[02:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9542.9s)]
*  You could experience things that are unavailable to you. [[02:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9545.460000000001s)]
*  Say if you're living in some inner city [[02:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9549.5s)]
*  and you're a young kid, you can get a wealth [[02:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9552.02s)]
*  of physical experiences through virtual reality. [[02:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9553.78s)]
*  This is how they marketed it. [[02:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9558.34s)]
*  This would even be over a year ago now. [[02:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9560.02s)]
*  This is what we're supposed to be getting to, [[02:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9562.060000000001s)]
*  although we're not quite there even yet. [[02:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9564.26s)]
*  But it's showing what you were just describing, [[02:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9566.7s)]
*  like taking someone into the middle of ancient Rome [[02:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9569.140000000001s)]
*  and letting them see what it was like. [[02:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9572.78s)]
*  That would be fucking wild. [[02:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9574.1s)]
*  I mean, if they could accurately represent [[02:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9575.900000000001s)]
*  what the lifestyle of those people was like back then, [[02:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9579.62s)]
*  I would really want ancient Egypt. [[02:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9584.14s)]
*  That's the big one to me, but they just don't know enough. [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9585.94s)]
*  I'm just trying to imagine the utility above and beyond [[02:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9588.98s)]
*  a cost-effective way to do tourism [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9591.74s)]
*  or experience things that would otherwise be unaffordable. [[02:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9595.14s)]
*  What is the end goal of it? [[02:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9597.82s)]
*  I think it has to be entertainment-based. [[02:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9599.34s)]
*  Otherwise, people are just gonna abandon it. [[02:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9601.42s)]
*  It'd have to be fun. [[02:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9603.3s)]
*  Yeah, and there's a lot of games that are fun. [[02:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9604.78s)]
*  He and I did fencing. [[02:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9608.66s)]
*  We fenced together, which is pretty cool. [[02:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9609.94s)]
*  And then there's a boxing game, which is really cool. [[02:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9612.300000000001s)]
*  Where you box against this virtual opponent, [[02:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9614.94s)]
*  and you get a good workout, man. [[02:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9617.66s)]
*  And when they punch you, you see a flash of light. [[02:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9619.7s)]
*  Like you got hit. [[02:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9622.34s)]
*  Does it seem realistic to you? [[02:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9623.78s)]
*  No, not realistic, but not realistic. [[02:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9625.18s)]
*  Not necessarily realistic, but enough so [[02:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9628.98s)]
*  that it makes it exciting. [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9631.5s)]
*  So when you put the headphones on [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9633.14s)]
*  and then you're standing in front of this guy [[02:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9635.9s)]
*  and he throws punches, if you move your head, [[02:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9637.54s)]
*  the punches miss you. [[02:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9639.58s)]
*  And if you hit him, you see his head snaps back. [[02:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9640.7s)]
*  And when he hits you, you see a flash of light. [[02:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9643.86s)]
*  And you get a good workout. [[02:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9646.380000000001s)]
*  You really do. [[02:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9647.58s)]
*  Is it kinda like the Nintendo Wii? [[02:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9648.42s)]
*  Already did that, though? [[02:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9650.140000000001s)]
*  Kinda, except it's virtual. [[02:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9650.980000000001s)]
*  So you have a headphone on it. [[02:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9652.820000000002s)]
*  And you're looking around the ring. [[02:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9654.18s)]
*  You see the floor, you see the skies. [[02:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9655.94s)]
*  People in the audience are cheering. [[02:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9658.460000000001s)]
*  And then there's this dude who's walking towards you. [[02:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9660.54s)]
*  And they don't look totally real, [[02:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9662.66s)]
*  but it's that uncanny valley thing. [[02:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9665.54s)]
*  Eventually they'll look real. [[02:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9667.66s)]
*  Eventually you'll look over and it's like Andre Ward [[02:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9669.26s)]
*  waiting to beat you up. [[02:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9671.619999999999s)]
*  And you're like, oh my God, this is so crazy. [[02:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9672.619999999999s)]
*  I think as those things get better and better, [[02:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9675.58s)]
*  they're gonna be more and more compelling. [[02:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9677.98s)]
*  But virtual reality as a concept [[02:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9680.179999999998s)]
*  has been around for a long time. [[02:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9683.3s)]
*  People thought it was gonna take off, [[02:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9685.699999999999s)]
*  but the technology just wasn't quite ready yet [[02:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9687.66s)]
*  where it could look realistic [[02:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9691.46s)]
*  and be really, just really immersive. [[02:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9693.34s)]
*  And now it is. [[02:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9697.62s)]
*  Now it's better, but not quite. [[02:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9698.54s)]
*  It's not quite yet. [[02:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9700.460000000001s)]
*  Have you seen Ready Player One? [[02:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9701.7s)]
*  Yes, love that movie. [[02:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9702.740000000002s)]
*  Makes me wonder if it's just gonna be [[02:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9704.54s)]
*  essentially replicating what you could otherwise, [[02:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9706.460000000001s)]
*  if you were trying to achieve something in real life [[02:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9711.140000000001s)]
*  and then trying to replicate a virtual version of it. [[02:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9713.140000000001s)]
*  And then you're just gonna be competing [[02:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9715.7s)]
*  against other people virtually for virtual belongings [[02:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9716.820000000002s)]
*  and virtual success and virtual this. [[02:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9719.300000000001s)]
*  But everyone in reality is just sitting in their apartment [[02:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9722.1s)]
*  fucking eyes glazed over, head back in the couch. [[02:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9725.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9729.539999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9730.38s)]
*  I think that's some version of that [[02:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9731.22s)]
*  is probably inevitable at this point. [[02:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9733.34s)]
*  What is gonna be weirder is if we integrate with technology [[02:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9736.42s)]
*  to the point where you're not wearing something, [[02:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9740.5s)]
*  but it's a part of your body, like a Neuralink. [[02:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9742.46s)]
*  And the thing that's gonna be crazy about that [[02:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9745.539999999999s)]
*  is then you're no longer interfacing [[02:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9748.18s)]
*  with some virtual reality headset [[02:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9751.699999999999s)]
*  and playing a game with some other people [[02:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9754.06s)]
*  that are on the cyber world. [[02:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9756.5s)]
*  Now your mind is connected to the cyber world permanently. [[02:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9757.7s)]
*  And I don't think humans have the willpower [[02:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9762.58s)]
*  to not just smash the dopamine button infinitely [[02:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9764.5s)]
*  if they were presented with it. [[02:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9768.619999999999s)]
*  Like any of these like rat studies [[02:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9769.94s)]
*  that look at what happens when they present them [[02:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9771.38s)]
*  with an opportunity to just like press a button [[02:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9773.7s)]
*  and then it hits them with dopamine [[02:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9775.82s)]
*  and they have like an orgasm or something. [[02:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9777.539999999999s)]
*  Yep. [[02:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9779.38s)]
*  Like do you think humans are gonna just sit there [[02:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9780.22s)]
*  and fucking- [[02:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9781.34s)]
*  Hammer it. [[02:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9782.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9783.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's the real problem [[02:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9783.84s)]
*  when they have virtual sex. [[02:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9784.84s)]
*  When they really do develop some sort of [[02:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9786.64s)]
*  either a haptic feedback suit [[02:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9789.64s)]
*  or some sort of a neural implant [[02:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9791.84s)]
*  that can hijack all of your sensitivity cells [[02:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9794.28s)]
*  and all the skin cells and all the things [[02:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9800.76s)]
*  that are designed to detect, feel and touch and warmth, [[02:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9804.08s)]
*  they can hijack those and you could feel a woman [[02:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9808.460000000001s)]
*  wrap her legs around you. [[02:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9811.24s)]
*  You're like, holy shit. [[02:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9812.68s)]
*  No one's gonna avoid that. [[02:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9815.16s)]
*  You're gonna be on it all day long. [[02:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9816.36s)]
*  Why would you, you wanna be alone? [[02:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9817.480000000001s)]
*  What do you wanna do? [[02:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9819.68s)]
*  You wanna be alone playing checkers? [[02:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9820.5s)]
*  No, you're gonna put that thing on, [[02:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9822.04s)]
*  you're gonna fuck this tent [[02:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9823.800000000001s)]
*  and you're gonna be in a water bed with great music playing [[02:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9825.560000000001s)]
*  and it's gonna feel amazing. [[02:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9828.460000000001s)]
*  And if it's gonna be so good [[02:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9829.82s)]

*  Like this is one of the weirder things that Elon believes. [[02:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9836.640000000001s)]
*  He believes there's a high likelihood [[02:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9839.560000000001s)]
*  that we are currently in a simulation. [[02:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9841.12s)]
*  And when I said to him, I said, [[02:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9844.32s)]
*  he goes, well, with probability theory, [[02:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9845.44s)]
*  and you think about all the planets that there are [[02:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9847.64s)]
*  and all the potential for advanced civilizations, [[02:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9849.960000000001s)]
*  the potential for advanced life, [[02:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9852.68s)]
*  one day they will create a technology [[02:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9854.52s)]
*  that's unrecognizable from reality. [[02:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9857.62s)]
*  You will develop some sort of a virtual environment [[02:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9860.960000000001s)]
*  that you cannot, you can't discern [[02:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9865.48s)]
*  whether or not this is physically real [[02:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9868.960000000001s)]

*  that recreates life. [[02:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9875.960000000001s)]
*  And then that's probably the future. [[02:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9877.48s)]
*  Yeah, and do you foresee that as a overly negative thing? [[02:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9880.8s)]
*  I think it just is what it is. [[02:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9885.960000000001s)]
*  Like if you talk to people about, [[02:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9889.0s)]
*  there's a great book that I read [[02:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9891.2s)]
*  that Neil Brennan told me about, [[02:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9893.28s)]
*  what's it called, Amusing Ourselves to Death? [[02:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9896.32s)]
*  Is that what that it's called? [[02:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9898.32s)]
*  Yeah, which is about television in the 80s. [[02:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9899.72s)]
*  It was like during the Reagan administration, [[02:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9903.96s)]
*  they were talking about how stupid people are getting [[02:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9906.08s)]
*  because of television. [[02:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9907.48s)]
*  That's the book, really good book. [[02:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9908.92s)]
*  And it's really fascinating to look back, [[02:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9911.599999999999s)]
*  you know, all these decades later, 1984, [[02:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9914.279999999999s)]
*  and all these decades later to read what they thought [[02:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9918.519999999999s)]
*  about what was happening to people because of television. [[02:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9922.16s)]
*  And that's just fractional compared to the dramatic, [[02:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9925.119999999999s)]
*  what's happening now. [[02:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9928.480000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's just happening. [[02:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9929.800000000001s)]
*  I think it just is. [[02:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9931.68s)]
*  And I don't think we're getting away. [[02:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9933.68s)]
*  Yeah, sketchy, dude. [[02:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9935.880000000001s)]
*  It's sketchy. [[02:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9937.800000000001s)]
*  I don't necessarily think it's good, [[02:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9939.84s)]
*  but whatever it is, it is. [[02:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9941.12s)]
*  Yeah, I don't even know what to make of it [[02:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9943.08s)]
*  because it's like, I don't know, [[02:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9944.800000000001s)]
*  for the people who very much value achievements [[02:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9946.4s)]
*  in real life and chasing success [[02:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9950.16s)]
*  or doing things that are rewarding, [[02:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9952.52s)]
*  it kind of like shits on that. [[02:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6NWaynfRz4&t=9953.800000000001s)]
