*  I was just very, very, it was just cool. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=58.0s)]
*  It was cool to be in that. You got a torch? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=60.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah there's one right there. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=62.0s)]
*  Oh that's a torch too? Look at you. You got all the gadgets. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=64.0s)]
*  Yeah we shout out to Foundation Cigars. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=67.0s)]
*  They actually made us some comedy mothership logoed cigars. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=70.0s)]
*  They're really good. Is it out? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=75.0s)]
*  Yeah here try this one. Sorry. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=77.0s)]
*  It might be almost out of juice. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=81.0s)]
*  Got it. But yeah I get it. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=84.0s)]
*  I was nervous when I first did stand up there too. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=87.0s)]
*  Yeah it's like that. It was my first set there. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=90.0s)]
*  It was weird. I was like are we really doing this? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=93.0s)]
*  Yeah it's in your dad. We're talking about this for two years. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=95.0s)]
*  And then all of a sudden we're doing it. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=99.0s)]
*  We were all shit in our pants. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=101.0s)]
*  Every one of us backstage was like fuck. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=102.0s)]
*  Yeah it's such a cool place. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=104.0s)]
*  But the thing is we had been doing so much stand up. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=106.0s)]
*  Yeah your whole life. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=108.0s)]
*  To get weirded out by this one set for some reason. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=110.0s)]
*  It's special. Yeah it felt like the audience was like that too. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=113.0s)]
*  They felt a little weirded out too. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=116.0s)]
*  They were like wow this is real. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=118.0s)]
*  They got to be there at the very first show. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=120.0s)]
*  I used to feel like that at the store a bit. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=122.0s)]
*  I would literally crush at the Laugh Factory 25 minutes before I walked over to the comedy store. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=124.0s)]
*  And then I was like gosh I hope Adam sees this. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=130.0s)]
*  For whatever reason. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=133.0s)]
*  I think every comic has some sort of weird issues with the comedy store. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=135.0s)]
*  For sure. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=139.0s)]
*  All different things but I don't know how. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=140.0s)]
*  Dude when I was a kid, when I was 21, when I first started doing stand up, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=142.0s)]
*  people would talk about the comedy store like it was Mecca. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=146.0s)]
*  Like you had to make your pilgrimage. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=151.0s)]
*  This was where Richard Pryor came from. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=153.0s)]
*  This is where Sam Kinison came from. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=156.0s)]
*  It was Mecca. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=158.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=159.0s)]
*  And you only heard about you know like this is the spot. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=160.0s)]
*  There was no other one place you had to go. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=164.0s)]
*  Like you could go to Catch. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=166.0s)]
*  You could go to Catch Rising Star which is in New York. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=168.0s)]
*  You could go which is a great club. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=171.0s)]
*  You could go to the Improv and Melrose. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=172.0s)]
*  That was a great club. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=175.0s)]
*  It was all great. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=176.0s)]
*  The store. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=177.0s)]
*  The store was Mecca. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=178.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=179.0s)]
*  And when you got past there, I was already on a television show when I got past. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=180.0s)]
*  And when getting on the television show was cool. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=184.0s)]
*  It was cool to be on TV like wow I can't believe I'm on TV. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=188.0s)]
*  This is nuts. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=191.0s)]
*  But the real thing for me was when Mitzi passed me. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=192.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=196.0s)]
*  I was like oh my god. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=197.0s)]
*  Like I think I'm a real comedian. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=198.0s)]
*  Like I'm a real professional. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=200.0s)]
*  Like because you know in the beginning, the few years, you feel like such a fraud. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=202.0s)]
*  You feel like. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=206.0s)]
*  Any stage time. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=208.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=209.0s)]
*  You're learning it as you go. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=210.0s)]
*  You're not really sure if you're going to make it. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=212.0s)]
*  Some of your jokes suck. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=214.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=216.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=217.0s)]
*  Now and then though you get one that pops. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=218.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=219.0s)]
*  You're like god I need more of those. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=220.0s)]
*  Like I need more like that one. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=221.0s)]
*  That's why so many comics go edgy or like dirty soon. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=222.0s)]
*  Of course. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=225.0s)]
*  Because they're like at least the reactions better than bombing. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=226.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=228.0s)]
*  I'd rather that than silence. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=229.0s)]
*  And there's always some subjects that just have built in laughs. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=230.0s)]
*  You know there's some subjects that you pretty much can't fuck it up. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=234.0s)]
*  If you got to. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=237.0s)]
*  It's a topic that people like to laugh just at the top. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=239.0s)]
*  I feel like every comic when you start, tell me if you found this to be true. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=242.0s)]
*  Of course they all start with the I know what I look like. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=246.0s)]
*  Or I look like. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=248.0s)]
*  Or that you hear that version of that. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=249.0s)]
*  Or they come up with a. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=251.0s)]
*  Or they like some sort of song lyrics. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=255.0s)]
*  That's all because songs are poems. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=257.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=258.0s)]
*  And they're metaphors. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=259.0s)]
*  So for whatever reason every comic is like I was listening to this song the other day. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=260.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=263.0s)]
*  And the lyrics. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=264.0s)]
*  You're like yeah. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=265.0s)]
*  Because it's a metaphor. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=266.0s)]
*  Like you're going to take the most literal route on this writing. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=267.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=270.0s)]
*  To make yourself sound smarter than the artist. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=271.0s)]
*  But it's like it's kind of like trying to get to you and that monkey. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=272.0s)]
*  And you're like he's trying to get to a monkey. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=277.0s)]
*  No. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=278.0s)]
*  That's the radio edit of booty. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=279.0s)]
*  You know they can't say trying to get to you and that pussy or booty or whatever the real [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=283.0s)]
*  lyric is. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=286.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=287.0s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=288.0s)]
*  Well it's just pop culture too right. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=289.0s)]
*  So you really you're terrified to talk about something that people don't know about. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=291.0s)]
*  You don't want to have to explain something while you're. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=296.0s)]
*  Because then you have to get their full attention. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=299.0s)]
*  It's not an immediate. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=301.0s)]
*  Like if you wanted to bring up LeBron James. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=302.0s)]
*  You say the name LeBron James. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=305.0s)]
*  Everybody knows who LeBron James is. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=306.0s)]
*  It's an instantaneous reference. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=308.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=310.0s)]
*  But if you want to talk about some weird sect of the Christian church that you grew up in. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=311.0s)]
*  You're like what. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=315.0s)]
*  What. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=316.0s)]
*  What. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=317.0s)]
*  Like that's a fucking black belt joke. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=318.0s)]
*  You know like you have to. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=320.0s)]
*  You're not there yet. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=321.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=322.0s)]
*  You're not ready for like esoteric subject. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=323.0s)]
*  You're not ready for any weirdness. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=325.0s)]
*  I had a comic tell me the other night. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=326.0s)]
*  We did this corporate event. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=328.0s)]
*  I don't want to say his name because you know. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=329.0s)]
*  But he's just new. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=331.0s)]
*  That's all. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=332.0s)]
*  He's not guilty of being unfunny. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=333.0s)]
*  He's not guilty of being a bad guy. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=334.0s)]
*  He's just guilty of being new. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=335.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=337.0s)]
*  That's all we all were. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=338.0s)]
*  And he goes what do you think about this joke. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=339.0s)]
*  It's this wildly insensitive joke about the Bible and Mary. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=340.0s)]
*  And it's a gross oversimplification. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=344.0s)]
*  But it's also just latently disrespectful. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=347.0s)]
*  Like and that's OK. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=349.0s)]
*  You know Louie wants to do that joke. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=350.0s)]
*  You want to do that joke. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=352.0s)]
*  Some people want to limp in on that subject. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=353.0s)]
*  You can do it. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=354.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=355.0s)]
*  And I go you can't. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=356.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=357.0s)]
*  Like what do you mean I can't. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=358.0s)]
*  No. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=359.0s)]
*  It's just you're not ready for that. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=360.0s)]
*  You're trying to tackle that. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=361.0s)]
*  Like it's not going to work. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=362.0s)]
*  An abortion joke in your first five minutes. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=363.0s)]
*  Like settle down. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=365.0s)]
*  These people have no idea what you're talking about. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=366.0s)]
*  It's just like it's not going to work. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=368.0s)]
*  Leave that to Buildbur. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=369.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=370.0s)]
*  Leave the abortion joke to Buildbur. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=371.0s)]
*  Maybe not month one. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=372.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=373.0s)]
*  You're not. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=374.0s)]
*  You don't have any idea what you sound like. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=375.0s)]
*  You have any idea how that people are perceiving you. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=376.0s)]
*  It's chaos up there. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=377.0s)]
*  It doesn't seem like it should be. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=378.0s)]
*  I feel like we understand it more than most people which is why so many people think they [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=379.0s)]
*  can do it. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=381.0s)]
*  But even we kind of barely understand it. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=382.0s)]
*  Like I understand how I do it. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=384.0s)]
*  Like I know this is what you're talking about. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=385.0s)]
*  I know this is what you're talking about. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=386.0s)]
*  And when you see the video you're like wow. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=387.0s)]
*  You're like I'm going to have to do this. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=388.0s)]
*  I'm going to have to do this. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=389.0s)]
*  I'm going to have to do this. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=390.0s)]
*  so many people think they can do it. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=391.0s)]
*  But even we kind of barely understand it. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=393.0s)]
*  Like I understand how I do it, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=395.32s)]
*  but there's a lot of guys I see them like, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=397.28s)]
*  I don't know what you're doing, but it's hilarious. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=399.88s)]
*  Harlan Williams. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=402.28s)]
*  I love Harlan. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=403.12s)]
*  I just did his podcast. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=403.94s)]
*  He's so silly. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=404.78s)]
*  He's so silly. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=405.84s)]
*  When you watch him on stage, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=407.24s)]
*  like if you wrote that out, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=408.28s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=410.4s)]
*  It would not make any sense. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=411.24s)]
*  Sir, can you please look away? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=412.08s)]
*  I'm trying to perform up here. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=413.16s)]
*  I'm fucking dying. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=414.8s)]
*  He was on Kill Tony and he brought a checkbook [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=416.56s)]
*  and started just writing checks to people [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=420.52s)]
*  for like a billion dollars. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=422.79999999999995s)]
*  It just became this running gag. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=424.47999999999996s)]
*  It was hilarious. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=426.35999999999996s)]
*  Jeff Ross roast a roast. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=427.76s)]
*  He pulled out a roast [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=430.32s)]
*  and he put two little googly eyes on it. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=431.56s)]
*  And he goes, I want you to roast this roast. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=433.64s)]
*  And that's only Harlan can do that. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=435.71999999999997s)]
*  Only Harlan. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=438.32s)]
*  If anyone else did that, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=439.15999999999997s)]
*  I'd be like, get this dog shit out of here. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=440.0s)]
*  But like Harlan Williams, it's perfectly his voice. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=441.24s)]
*  Like get yourself. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=443.35999999999996s)]
*  I've known that guy for probably like 25, 26 years. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=444.2s)]
*  He's always been super cool. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=448.03999999999996s)]
*  No one hates Harlan Williams. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=449.74s)]
*  No one. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=451.38s)]
*  You will never meet anybody who doesn't like Harlan Williams. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=452.3s)]
*  He isn't like, but is exactly like Norm MacDonald [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=454.3s)]
*  where he's got his own thing. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=458.94s)]
*  His own thing. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=460.78000000000003s)]
*  And they're both Canadian and they're not similar, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=461.62s)]
*  but they're both these unique one of a kind men. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=463.34000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, he doesn't vary. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=467.34000000000003s)]
*  He's always that guy. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=469.34000000000003s)]
*  He's always like this super sweet guy. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=470.54s)]
*  That's got that guy off stage, on stage. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=472.34000000000003s)]
*  Hey fella, what a great club. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=474.94s)]
*  You pumpkin pie haircut freak. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=477.78s)]
*  He improved that on the movie Dumb and Dumber to Jim Carrey. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=479.9s)]
*  And it stays in the script. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=483.5s)]
*  Like that's how. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=484.62s)]
*  Yeah, that's Harlan. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=485.73999999999995s)]
*  He's such a fun guy. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=486.9s)]
*  But like, I don't know how he does it. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=488.18s)]
*  Imagine being Harlan's comedy coach. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=489.34s)]
*  I don't know what to tell you. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=491.7s)]
*  Yeah, just do you. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=492.78s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know how to tell you. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=493.7s)]
*  William Montgomery is another one. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=494.76s)]
*  Have you seen William? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=496.02s)]
*  He's a young guy from Austin. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=496.85999999999996s)]
*  He was in LA for a while and then he came out here. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=499.03999999999996s)]
*  His comedy is so, I wish I could do one of his bits, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=501.09999999999997s)]
*  but I don't want to give up some of his material. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=504.4s)]
*  You got a kid that works at Mothership, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=506.02s)]
*  who I'm obsessed with. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=507.65999999999997s)]
*  And I don't know if he'll be a star. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=509.18s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=510.38s)]
*  I've never been able to predict any of this shit. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=511.21999999999997s)]
*  If you'd have asked me if I'd have thought a lot [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=512.38s)]
*  of these people that became stars are stars. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=514.02s)]
*  I'm not a good read of this. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=515.8199999999999s)]
*  But I do know a brilliant comic when I see one, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=517.8199999999999s)]
*  a K.C. Rocket. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=519.9399999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah, he's very funny. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=521.06s)]
*  Well here's the difference. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=522.22s)]
*  So for me, here's the difference. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=523.5s)]
*  Is when you watch me, you go, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=526.6999999999999s)]
*  oh, I know who Jeff's inspired by. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=528.54s)]
*  He likes Patrice, he likes Norm, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=530.74s)]
*  he likes these truth tellers, and he loves the Simpsons. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=532.26s)]
*  And if you know that formula when you watch me, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=535.1s)]
*  you go, that's what this guy liked. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=536.98s)]
*  That's what he watched. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=538.22s)]
*  No one's doing what K.C. Rocket's doing. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=541.5s)]
*  No. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=543.78s)]
*  So at least it's different enough [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=544.74s)]
*  that whether you love it or hate it, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=547.0600000000001s)]
*  you go, I've never seen it before. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=548.9s)]
*  Well, even if you, first of all, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=550.34s)]
*  you should appreciate that, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=552.22s)]
*  but then also appreciate that whatever he's doing, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=553.46s)]
*  it's funny right now and he's gonna get better. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=556.02s)]
*  Yeah, I love it. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=558.46s)]
*  It's gonna get even more better. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=559.78s)]
*  I watched him, I don't know if you'll like me saying this, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=561.3000000000001s)]
*  he didn't do too great on the show that I watched, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=562.98s)]
*  and I'm in the back going, whatever that is, sign me up. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=565.9399999999999s)]
*  I'll watch that. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=568.5s)]
*  He varies, but he does well a lot. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=569.54s)]
*  He does well a lot. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=572.46s)]
*  He's got real potential. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=573.46s)]
*  He's a funny dude. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=575.06s)]
*  He did like six minutes on Jimmy Carter. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=575.9s)]
*  Kid's in his 20s, and he's doing Jimmy Carter jokes. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=578.66s)]
*  And I'm in the back going, no one's gonna, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=582.22s)]
*  cause you know, it was like a bar show in Manhattan Beach, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=583.98s)]
*  and they want some race hustling jokes. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=586.34s)]
*  Oh yeah, if you're doing a bar show in Manhattan Beach, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=589.78s)]
*  that's, well that's hit or miss. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=592.22s)]
*  Boy, those are good for like, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=595.86s)]
*  just stress testing the vehicle though. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=597.4200000000001s)]
*  And who cares if the joke doesn't work? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=600.0200000000001s)]
*  I watched you last night for probably 30 minutes [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=603.9000000000001s)]
*  of the hour that you did. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=608.1s)]
*  It seems like you're having a lot of fun. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=609.3000000000001s)]
*  I'm having a lot of fun. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=611.46s)]
*  Is this new or is this, I mean, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=612.4200000000001s)]
*  I've seen you a bunch of times, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=614.82s)]
*  but I mean like, it's been a few years I think [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=616.1s)]
*  since I've got to see you on stage, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=618.58s)]
*  and you seem like you're having so much fun. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=620.1400000000001s)]
*  I'm having a good time. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=622.34s)]
*  That's inspiring to watch. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=623.3800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, well first of all, you know, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=625.5s)]
*  I'm in a place where I can do whatever I want, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=627.2199999999999s)]
*  so I'm doing as much standup as I want, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=629.42s)]
*  and I'm doing it specifically [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=632.06s)]
*  just to make the standup better. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=633.66s)]
*  Like that's how I think about it. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=635.5799999999999s)]
*  All I'm doing is like, I treat it like, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=637.3s)]
*  well what is the most important thing of it? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=639.9s)]
*  The most important thing is the show. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=641.78s)]
*  Like try in some way to like always tweak it, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=644.06s)]
*  always make it better, figure out what you're doing. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=649.3s)]
*  Add a thing. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=651.22s)]
*  And to have all this opportunity for stage time [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=652.06s)]
*  at the club, I basically set up a residency in my home city. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=655.1s)]
*  Yeah, it's pretty sweet. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=657.26s)]
*  It was fun to watch. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=658.62s)]
*  It's fun, dude, it's fun. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=659.82s)]
*  I like seeing that more than I like seeing [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=661.82s)]
*  a lot of things in our business. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=664.66s)]
*  I just, I love it. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=666.42s)]
*  I like comedy so much. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=668.48s)]
*  I do too. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=669.9s)]
*  That I want to see some, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=670.74s)]
*  so I went on the road with this guy named Kermit Appeal [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=671.58s)]
*  from Washington state, and he's a road dog [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=674.46s)]
*  and a really talented guy. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=678.06s)]
*  He won Seattle International Comedy Competition, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=679.34s)]
*  which when I first started comedy, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=681.38s)]
*  it was a huge deal to us up in Seattle. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=682.62s)]
*  And he brought me on the road, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=684.42s)]
*  and I was terrible, I was a terrible open micer [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=686.34s)]
*  that got some loud, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=688.26s)]
*  I was a king of the open micers in Seattle. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=689.1s)]
*  And so he brings me on the road open for him. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=691.54s)]
*  And he goes, you know the only reason I'm bringing you [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=693.34s)]
*  on the road is you make me like stand up comedy again. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=695.14s)]
*  You're so excited about it, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=698.46s)]
*  and the way you don't shut up about it, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=699.86s)]
*  and you want to tell jokes, and you want to write jokes, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=701.3s)]
*  or you tell me like, hey, last night after that bit, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=703.66s)]
*  have you thought about adding this? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=705.98s)]
*  And you make me remember that I like it. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=707.82s)]
*  And I do feel like, and I've been doing comedy since 2005, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=711.06s)]
*  I do feel a little bit of that, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=715.78s)]
*  where I'm looking for someone to, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=717.18s)]
*  I just, I like, I love being in that green room and hanging. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=719.2199999999999s)]
*  I love this, I love the stand up part, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=722.54s)]
*  but like, that's really fun. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=724.54s)]
*  It doesn't, I don't want to just perform and go home. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=725.9799999999999s)]
*  I want it to be like in the comedy. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=727.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=729.9399999999999s)]
*  I don't know, I like that part of it. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=730.78s)]
*  Yeah, we feed off each other. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=731.9s)]
*  That's what, that's the reason why I created the club. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=733.42s)]
*  We were already performing out here. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=736.3399999999999s)]
*  We started performing out here in November of 2020, indoors. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=738.98s)]
*  And it was, it was sketchy. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=743.54s)]
*  And everyone was- [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=746.6999999999999s)]
*  Like, there was a feeling of sketchiness. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=747.54s)]
*  I was like, I remember we got really high one time, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=749.06s)]
*  and I went on stage, I was like, this is so not safe. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=751.42s)]
*  It's like the middle of- [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=754.6999999999999s)]
*  What are we doing? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=756.18s)]
*  The middle of COVID, and they have indoor shows packed. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=757.02s)]
*  There's no, the social distancing had sucked my dick. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=760.18s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, well. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=762.54s)]
*  There was no social distancing, it was just packed. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=763.38s)]
*  Everybody was just going out like they were going out. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=765.3s)]
*  I love that. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=768.7800000000001s)]
*  And we were at, how many of you guys have had COVID? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=769.62s)]
*  Like fucking half the crowd already- [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=770.46s)]
*  And we're fine. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=771.3000000000001s)]
*  Already had it. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=772.1400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it was wild times, but what we needed was a home base. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=772.98s)]
*  And I was like, this place that we're at, the Vulcan, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=779.0600000000001s)]
*  which is a really fun place to play, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=781.0600000000001s)]
*  and a really fun place to see stand up. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=782.5400000000001s)]
*  It's a real fun room. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=784.6600000000001s)]
*  But I wanted to do it where we had full control of it. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=785.9000000000001s)]
*  Where it was just comics. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=792.3800000000001s)]
*  We have a group of humans that are really good [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=794.94s)]
*  at an art form, and I say, what do you think we should do? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=798.9s)]
*  And we all just talk, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=802.0600000000001s)]
*  and everybody's suggestion got in there. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=802.9s)]
*  The reason why the ceiling is the height that it is, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=804.98s)]
*  because I took Louis, and Louis went and looked around, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=806.66s)]
*  he goes, can you lower the ceiling? [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=809.22s)]
*  And I said, I think we can. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=810.7s)]
*  Can we lower the ceiling? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=812.46s)]
*  And I brought over the construction guys, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=813.4200000000001s)]
*  I'm like, what can we do? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=814.86s)]
*  And like, yeah, we can get it down three more feet. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=815.98s)]
*  And he's like, get it down as low as you can get it. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=817.82s)]
*  We just wanted to make sure [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=819.78s)]
*  that we could see from the balcony. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=820.62s)]
*  That was the critical thing. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=822.22s)]
*  Make sure the ceiling didn't impede the view [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=823.5799999999999s)]
*  from the balcony. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=825.74s)]
*  So we got to right where it doesn't. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=826.5799999999999s)]
*  And then it really tightened the room up. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=828.74s)]
*  But he also told me, he goes, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=830.62s)]
*  comics like to hear that sound of echo, but that sucks. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=832.5799999999999s)]
*  It sucks for the sound. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=835.38s)]
*  You want the sound to be as clean as possible. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=838.38s)]
*  You should make everything almost like a sound studio. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=841.0999999999999s)]
*  Like, have you done the old ice house? [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=843.38s)]
*  Yeah, love the old, no one bombs there. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=844.74s)]
*  Oh, all that hard wood that pops, the comedy pops there. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=845.5799999999999s)]
*  It's also great crowds out there too. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=849.66s)]
*  But it's the structure of the building adds to the sound. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=852.46s)]
*  But you don't really necessarily want that. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=856.78s)]
*  You really want the actual laughs [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=859.98s)]
*  and like everybody to hear everything you're saying. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=862.3s)]
*  Yeah. Clearly. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=865.34s)]
*  Wait, do you think there was a problem [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=866.46s)]
*  with the ice house in the old way? [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=867.9399999999999s)]
*  Like the way it was too easy and popped? [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=868.9399999999999s)]
*  It wasn't a problem because it was really small room. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=871.22s)]
*  But it would have been a problem in a slightly larger room. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=873.98s)]
*  It gets slightly larger and those echoes get weird. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=877.46s)]
*  They get weird in corners. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=880.3s)]
*  That's one of the things about the Vulcan. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=882.06s)]
*  I've had friends come to the show and they would go, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=883.5s)]
*  we couldn't hear right where we were. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=886.66s)]
*  We had to move. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=888.4599999999999s)]
*  I go, what was the matter? [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=889.3s)]
*  Everything is echoing. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=890.6999999999999s)]
*  I was like, oh no, really? [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=891.74s)]
*  So I guess there was like, you know how sound works [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=893.86s)]
*  and hard surfaces and corners. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=895.9399999999999s)]
*  If you're in like the back of a little corner area [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=898.42s)]
*  and sounds coming from a speaker [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=901.8199999999999s)]
*  pointed a specific direction, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=903.38s)]
*  it's probably not set up for comedies [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=905.34s)]
*  when I'm trying to say. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=906.86s)]
*  So we decided to just set it up from the jump. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=907.6999999999999s)]
*  It's great. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=910.5799999999999s)]
*  Best way we could, the whole tunnel system, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=911.42s)]
*  the whole, there's an elevator. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=914.78s)]
*  It's perfect. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=917.06s)]
*  It's literally you've made, it's a masterpiece. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=917.9s)]
*  So when we opened it, it was nerve wracking. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=920.3399999999999s)]
*  It was like, what are we doing? [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=923.06s)]
*  Me and my buddy, Brandt, this was literally last weekend. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=924.4599999999999s)]
*  I think it was last weekend. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=929.18s)]
*  We're playing a club and the club's great. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=930.62s)]
*  I don't wanna name it because I'm about to say something [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=932.5s)]
*  that's not great about the acoustics. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=934.4599999999999s)]
*  But he gets on stage, he's crushing [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=936.02s)]
*  and he's doing all these little bullshit savers. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=937.98s)]
*  Well, that did better last week. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=940.5799999999999s)]
*  You know those little things you say [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=941.9399999999999s)]
*  after a joke does bad. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=943.78s)]
*  The crowd's looking around going, what is he talking about? [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=944.62s)]
*  So then he does another joke and then he's like, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=946.8199999999999s)]
*  all right, you guys don't like. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=948.5799999999999s)]
*  And he keeps narrating. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=950.18s)]
*  But like Brandt, you're crushing, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=952.02s)]
*  but I can't talk to him, he's on stage. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=953.6999999999999s)]
*  And so then I get on stage and I'm like, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=955.38s)]
*  fucking tough crowd, man. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=958.8199999999999s)]
*  What's going on here? [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=960.0999999999999s)]
*  Like these. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=960.9399999999999s)]
*  Oh, you can't hear them. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=961.8199999999999s)]
*  Couldn't hear, I thought I was doing bad. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=963.3s)]
*  And Brandt's like, that was amazing. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=965.8199999999999s)]
*  And then Brandt was doing amazing. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=968.42s)]
*  And he thought he was doing bad up there. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=970.74s)]
*  So we came up with like a symbol for the next shows. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=971.74s)]
*  Like if you're doing. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=974.42s)]
*  How far was the audience from you that you couldn't hear them? [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=976.54s)]
*  We heard laughs, we heard laughs. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=978.9s)]
*  But we just don't, we're used to a sound [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=980.9s)]
*  as a comedian of what killing is. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=983.26s)]
*  So you know, we get laughs on every sentence. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=986.18s)]
*  Doesn't mean you're killing. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=988.54s)]
*  And so we were just saying, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=990.14s)]
*  so me and Brandt came up with like a code. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=990.98s)]
*  We're like, all right, this means don't worry about it. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=992.22s)]
*  You're doing good. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=993.74s)]
*  And if it is that the joke sucks or the bit sucks, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=994.58s)]
*  we'll do this. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=997.42s)]
*  Like, hey, it's you. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=998.58s)]
*  It's you that is. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1000.42s)]
*  But like you need to know, is it me or is it the crowd? [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1001.26s)]
*  You got like a line coach. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1005.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1007.3s)]
*  We're like, we're going, you know, signals. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1008.14s)]
*  But we, it's because that sound is so important. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1010.22s)]
*  If you think you're doing bad. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1012.66s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1014.26s)]
*  You know, and the crowd doesn't think you are [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1015.1s)]
*  or vice versa. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1016.46s)]
*  That's the problem. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1017.42s)]
*  Did you watch any of the Zoom comedy people tried to do? [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1018.26s)]
*  Joe, I was one of the Zoom people. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1020.5s)]
*  No, just no. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1022.66s)]
*  I had to, dude. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1024.38s)]
*  I had to. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1025.94s)]
*  Hey, I would have done it. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1026.78s)]
*  I would have done it. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1028.02s)]
*  I had one corporate event that was like $10,000 [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1029.74s)]
*  a corporate that was supposed to be in a theater. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1031.3400000000001s)]
*  And then they're like, well, we can't now. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1033.38s)]
*  Cause COVID, so I'm thinking, I just don't give that money [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1034.74s)]
*  or they're going to have to reschedule for another time. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1036.78s)]
*  And they go, but we can do it on Zoom. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1038.74s)]
*  And I was like, well, that's 10 grand. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1040.7s)]
*  And it would do it. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1042.8200000000002s)]
*  It was terrible. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1043.66s)]
*  So you did a corporate gig on Zoom. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1044.5s)]
*  Yes. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1046.22s)]
*  And I couldn't hear them. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1047.0600000000002s)]
*  Cause their things aren't on. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1048.1000000000001s)]
*  It's a bunch of people. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1049.78s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1050.6200000000001s)]
*  Dude, it was a nightmare, Joe. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1051.5800000000002s)]
*  Also, I got to say, it's really nice for me to be here [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1053.1000000000001s)]
*  because during COVID, I was like, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1055.22s)]
*  enemy number one in Los Angeles in a lot of ways. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1059.82s)]
*  Really? [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1061.66s)]
*  I'd have people at my house. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1062.5s)]
*  I was like, I'm not doing this shit. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1063.42s)]
*  I was like the only guy who was like [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1064.94s)]
*  actually putting on a story. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1066.1s)]
*  Like I'm not doing this. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1067.38s)]
*  I'd like go to coffee shops, you know, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1069.6200000000001s)]
*  I'd wear a mask when they, you know, [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1072.26s)]
*  I'd be one of those guys, you know, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1074.06s)]
*  I'd wear the mask in the store, but then, you know, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1075.18s)]
*  whatever, I'm going to drink my coffee. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1077.18s)]
*  You want to drink it through a mask, you know? [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1078.6200000000001s)]
*  So there were comics who are now cool with me again, [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1080.3s)]
*  but at the time we're like, can you believe Jeff Die [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1083.8600000000001s)]
*  is just not taking this serious? [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1086.46s)]
*  I was like, I wish I lived in a place like this [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1088.58s)]
*  or Florida or something during that lockdown. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1092.38s)]
*  Well, I kind of saw what was going on in the beginning, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1094.74s)]
*  but I was hoping that we would come out of it [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1100.8600000000001s)]
*  and it really would just be a couple weeks [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1103.5s)]
*  and everything would be back to normal. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1105.26s)]
*  But when it got to a month and there was no talk at all [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1106.78s)]
*  about reopening and then there was talk about [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1110.82s)]
*  it might be six months, it got real weird. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1112.74s)]
*  And then there was the George Floyd riots. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1115.98s)]
*  And then there was the lines outside the gun stores. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1118.4199999999998s)]
*  And I was like, okay, I see where this is going. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1120.4199999999998s)]
*  I'm getting the fuck out of here. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1124.58s)]
*  So I came out here in May of 2020. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1126.22s)]
*  That's when I first started looking. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1129.22s)]
*  Found a house, moved in August, so that quick. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1131.3s)]
*  In August of 2020, I'm like, see ya. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1134.46s)]
*  And it was in the middle of my Spotify deal. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1136.74s)]
*  The beginning, excuse me, not even the middle. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1139.02s)]
*  Spotify deal hadn't even started. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1141.3s)]
*  It started from out here. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1142.8999999999999s)]
*  And they were like, what the fuck are you doing? [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1144.26s)]
*  As from us going, what do you mean he's moving? [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1146.98s)]
*  He's gonna change. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1149.8200000000002s)]
*  Also, you're a weed guy. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1150.8600000000001s)]
*  We're going to Texas? [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1151.78s)]
*  He's gonna go to Texas with the weed? [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1152.6200000000001s)]
*  Well, apparently it's decriminalized here in Austin. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1154.38s)]
*  Praise Jesus. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1157.3s)]
*  But then I heard that Ken Paxton is trying to sue [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1158.8200000000002s)]
*  the city of Austin, who I've met, [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1162.7s)]
*  he's a very nice gentleman. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1164.74s)]
*  Ken, how dare you? [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1166.1000000000001s)]
*  What's he suing it for? [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1168.98s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1169.94s)]
*  I think it has something to do with the marijuana laws. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1171.22s)]
*  Listen, maybe it has something to do [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1173.54s)]
*  with something other politically, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1176.8999999999999s)]
*  like they sue you for this, so you refund the police. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1178.42s)]
*  I don't know how all that shit works, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1181.74s)]
*  but there's a lot of weirdness when it comes to that. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1183.18s)]
*  Ken Paxton sues Texas cities, including Austin, [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1185.3799999999999s)]
*  for decriminalizing weed. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1188.94s)]
*  Dude, listen. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1190.62s)]
*  But why, Ken? [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1191.46s)]
*  This is stupid, Ken. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1192.3s)]
*  Don't get involved in this. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1193.78s)]
*  This is a dumb perspective. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1195.06s)]
*  The whole law is dumb, and it was based on fraud [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1197.98s)]
*  from the very beginning. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1201.6599999999999s)]
*  If you look at the history of why marijuana is illegal, [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1202.86s)]
*  it goes back to William Randolph Hearst and Harry Anslinger. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1206.1399999999999s)]
*  They conspired. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1210.06s)]
*  That's the reason why they made movies like Reefer Madness. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1211.82s)]
*  They wrote all these stories in the newspaper [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1215.06s)]
*  about marijuana and how marijuana was causing blacks [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1217.5s)]
*  and Mexicans to rape white ladies. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1221.82s)]
*  And they did it. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1224.54s)]
*  Which turned out not to be true. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1225.3799999999999s)]
*  They made this shit up. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1226.74s)]
*  Well, you know, you can find instances. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1228.3799999999999s)]
*  There's a lot of people. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1230.58s)]
*  But the point is that they made all this shit up just [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1231.98s)]
*  so they could stop hemp. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1234.5s)]
*  Because they had come up with a new method [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1236.98s)]
*  of processing hemp fiber. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1240.42s)]
*  There was a new machine that was invented called a decorticator. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1242.02s)]
*  And the decorticator allowed them to economically, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1245.22s)]
*  effectively process hemp without using slave labor. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1248.14s)]
*  See, when they stopped using slaves, [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1251.98s)]
*  and then when they started picking cotton, [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1253.7s)]
*  people moved from hemp to cotton. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1255.98s)]
*  But cotton sucks compared to hemp. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1258.14s)]
*  Hemp is a way better cloth. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1260.58s)]
*  It's way more durable. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1262.46s)]
*  My friend Todd says it's like an alien plant. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1264.9399999999998s)]
*  Because it is like an alien plant. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1267.86s)]
*  There's nothing like it. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1269.6999999999998s)]
*  You could use its fiber to make clothes. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1271.26s)]
*  It's the best clothes on Earth. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1274.46s)]
*  The most durable. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1276.6999999999998s)]
*  I have a hemp jujitsu gi. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1278.22s)]
*  That fucking thing never rips. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1280.34s)]
*  When I get cotton gis, these motherfuckers, [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1282.1399999999999s)]
*  after a few months of hard rolling, [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1285.1399999999999s)]
*  this thing start getting loose. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1287.3s)]
*  And they start ripping. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1289.5s)]
*  If you had a gi for a year or two years, [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1291.3s)]
*  it's probably got a ripper to it already. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1293.06s)]
*  The hemp gis don't rip. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1295.22s)]
*  You can take hemp paper. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1296.8600000000001s)]
*  You can take hemp paper. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1298.1000000000001s)]
*  You can barely tear it. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1299.26s)]
*  Really? [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1300.66s)]
*  It's weird. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1301.5s)]
*  I've never known less about a subject [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1302.3400000000001s)]
*  than hemp or any of this stuff. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1304.14s)]
*  I got fascinated because my friend Todd McCormick [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1306.26s)]
*  had a hemp stalk on his table, his desk table. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1308.74s)]
*  And he goes, pick this up. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1312.82s)]
*  And I pick it up. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1314.02s)]
*  And it feels like there's nothing there. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1314.8600000000001s)]
*  It's like styrofoam. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1316.7s)]
*  But it's hard. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1318.1000000000001s)]
*  Like oak. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1319.38s)]
*  Yeah, it's interesting. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1321.0600000000002s)]
*  It's a fucking weird plant. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1322.14s)]
*  You can make houses with it. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1323.8600000000001s)]
*  They use something called hemp creek. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1326.0600000000002s)]
*  And it's hemp, and it's mixed together [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1328.5s)]
*  with some sort of a solvent [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1330.5400000000002s)]
*  or something that solidifies it. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1331.5400000000002s)]
*  And it's way more durable than wood. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1333.3400000000001s)]
*  A living house. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1335.7800000000002s)]
*  It's stronger than concrete. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1336.6200000000001s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1337.7800000000002s)]
*  It's wild. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1338.94s)]

*  And the fact that it's illegal [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1341.18s)]
*  because it makes people happy [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1343.42s)]
*  and makes food taste better. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1345.5s)]
*  Shut the fuck up. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1346.9s)]

*  I've always said the best way to get killed by weed [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1363.58s)]
*  is you take a 35 pound bag of it [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1365.6200000000001s)]
*  and drop it on your head from a CIA drug plane. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1368.5s)]
*  That's how people die from it. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1372.46s)]

*  Shut the fuck up. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1375.46s)]
*  I had a buddy who was driving from Boston, [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1376.46s)]
*  Randy Valerio, he was driving from Boston [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1379.54s)]
*  with marijuana products. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1381.34s)]
*  But it was medicine in Boston. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1383.34s)]
*  And he's moving to LA to live. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1385.46s)]
*  And as he's driving through Texas, he gets pulled over. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1387.58s)]
*  So it's legal in Boston and it's legal in LA. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1390.58s)]
*  And it's considered medicine in these two places. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1393.34s)]
*  But if he takes his medicine through Texas, [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1395.4199999999998s)]
*  felony charges. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1398.7s)]

*  Look, it's just not me. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1441.74s)]

*  At all. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1499.44s)]
*  A baseball player in the 90s, Chuck Finley got beat up [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1500.28s)]

*  I'm a big guy, you know? [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1504.28s)]
*  So he just called the cops. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1505.72s)]

*  Yeah, block. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1517.24s)]
*  The problem is you should never be around anyone [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1518.08s)]
*  who wants to hit you, whether it's a friend [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1519.96s)]

*  no, you don't get to hit people to that girl. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1550.04s)]
*  And then he tried to defend his wife's honor. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1552.44s)]
*  You go, no, no, no. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1554.8799999999999s)]
*  If you guys want to hit each other at home, [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1555.8s)]
*  you can do whatever you want, [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1557.42s)]
*  but you don't get to hit people just because you're upset. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1558.6399999999999s)]
*  And then he tried to come to you and you grabbed him. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1561.28s)]
*  And everyone realized real quick, [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1564.48s)]
*  I mean, maybe at that time it wasn't public knowledge [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1566.0s)]
*  how trained you were at like fighting and stuff. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1567.84s)]
*  All he did was grab his neck. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1570.28s)]
*  Yeah, but it was, you shut it down quick. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1571.84s)]
*  No TV host has ever shut down a conflict of like that fast. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1574.12s)]
*  Well, that guy they'd warned me about. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1578.84s)]
*  He had a history of violence [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1580.8s)]
*  and he had done some violent things [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1582.76s)]
*  on some other reality shows. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1584.4399999999998s)]
*  Dude, it was amazing. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1585.28s)]

*  Joe's got this. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1589.0s)]
*  There was no security. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1589.84s)]
*  That was part of the problem. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1590.6599999999999s)]
*  That was around maniacs. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1592.28s)]
*  That was a big show. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1593.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1594.52s)]
*  There was zero security. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1595.34s)]
*  There was zero security. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1597.08s)]
*  There was me and a bunch of random maniacs [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1598.24s)]
*  that were trying to eat bull dicks [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1600.9599999999998s)]
*  and jump off buildings. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1602.8s)]
*  And we don't need security. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1603.6399999999999s)]
*  And some of them were super sketchy. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1604.48s)]
*  That guy was, he maybe could have hit me. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1606.52s)]
*  He was thinking about hitting me. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1610.48s)]
*  When he got in this fight, his body was so tense [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1612.52s)]
*  and he got so close to me. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1615.36s)]
*  I was like, the thing about, [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1617.32s)]
*  people have to realize about getting punched [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1619.12s)]
*  is very important to know. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1621.32s)]
*  Sucker punching works because your reaction time [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1622.96s)]
*  is far slower than action time. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1627.44s)]
*  Action time is very fast. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1630.26s)]
*  It's probably five to 10 times faster than reaction time. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1632.88s)]
*  So if I go like that and I hit you, [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1637.4s)]
*  by the time you register that I've turned my shoulders [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1639.24s)]
*  and that my fist is heading in your direction, [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1643.3600000000001s)]
*  you're hit. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1646.38s)]
*  And you're gonna get knocked out. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1647.8000000000002s)]
*  You're gonna be unready for it. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1649.0800000000002s)]
*  Your jaw's gonna slide back. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1650.88s)]
*  Your head's gonna snap sideways [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1653.0400000000002s)]
*  because you're not resisting it. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1654.8600000000001s)]
*  Your brain's gonna wash around inside your head [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1656.5400000000002s)]
*  and you're going out, unless you're a tank. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1659.2s)]
*  You're a big fucking Samoan dude. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1661.16s)]
*  And then he's gonna look at you, [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1663.24s)]
*  you're gonna, Mike, what a fucking terrible thing [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1664.0800000000002s)]
*  you've done. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1666.0800000000002s)]
*  And then he's gonna eat you. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1666.92s)]
*  Joe Rogan says sucker punch. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1668.76s)]
*  That's what I got from that. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1670.92s)]
*  I got a sucker punch if I'm gonna win. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1672.68s)]
*  Well, just sucker punching is something that people do. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1674.68s)]
*  So if someone gets that close to you, [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1678.44s)]
*  even a trained fighter has to be prepared [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1680.24s)]
*  for a sucker punch. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1682.68s)]
*  Didn't kill Houdini? [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1683.52s)]
*  No, no, he got punched in the stomach. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1685.0s)]
*  He had a gag that he would do. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1687.3600000000001s)]
*  We would let people punch him. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1688.8s)]
*  And yeah, this guy. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1690.04s)]
*  But I think there was something else wrong with him too. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1691.14s)]
*  I also think- [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1693.4s)]
*  He was doing a lot of weird shit. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1694.6s)]
*  I know, I'm jumping around a lot. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1696.4s)]
*  But that- [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1697.68s)]
*  He had appendicitis. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1698.52s)]
*  Yeah, oh, he had appendicitis. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1699.36s)]
*  So that was probably it. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1701.2s)]
*  Isn't that kind of funny that [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1702.76s)]
*  we just get up there and do jokes. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1704.32s)]
*  But like a magician will do a trick and then be like, [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1706.08s)]
*  also someone come punch me. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1708.48s)]
*  That's not a magic trick. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1710.22s)]
*  That sounds like some frat guy, [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1713.96s)]
*  like a big Samoan guy would say, [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1715.28s)]
*  someone punch me. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1717.24s)]
*  There's like no magic to it that will really work. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1718.08s)]
*  Like if someone says, kick me, [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1721.6399999999999s)]
*  there is no magic that's gonna save you. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1723.9199999999998s)]
*  That's so silly. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1726.4399999999998s)]
*  There's no magic. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1727.28s)]
*  You can't tighten up your abs and let me kick you. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1728.1s)]
*  This is my magic trick. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1730.48s)]
*  You're gonna get really injured. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1731.56s)]
*  You think you punch good? [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1733.28s)]
*  I'm a magician. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1734.96s)]
*  This is stupid. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1736.28s)]
*  Cover cadaver. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1738.36s)]
*  Francis Engadu liver punching you. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1739.84s)]
*  Well, like David Blaine will do that. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1742.08s)]
*  He'll do seven things that you're like, [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1743.84s)]
*  this guy's a witch or a warlock or something. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1745.12s)]
*  But then he'll be like, [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1747.24s)]
*  and now I'm gonna live in a box above New York City [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1748.08s)]
*  for a month. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1750.36s)]
*  And you're like, don't do that. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1751.4s)]
*  That's not magic. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1752.24s)]
*  He made me stab him with an ice pick. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1753.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1755.2s)]
*  I stabbed his arm with an ice pick. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1756.04s)]
*  I went through his arm to the other side with an ice pick. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1757.96s)]
*  Yeah, I saw that. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1760.28s)]
*  He did that to Ricky Gervais or something. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1761.1200000000001s)]
*  And Ricky Gervais is just like, why? [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1762.84s)]
*  That's the best answer to most magic. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1764.84s)]
*  Why? [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1766.24s)]
*  This is the answer to the Houdini thing. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1767.08s)]
*  It says on Friday morning, [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1768.08s)]
*  October 22nd in his dressing room [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1769.28s)]
*  at the Princess Theater in Montreal, [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1771.04s)]
*  he was punched hard in the stomach [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1773.6s)]
*  by an excitable McGill student, [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1775.18s)]
*  Jay Gordon Whitehead, [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1777.42s)]
*  who wanted to test the theory [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1779.14s)]
*  that Houdini was capable of withstanding hard blows [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1780.66s)]
*  to the abdomen. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1783.18s)]
*  A week later, Houdini was dead. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1784.14s)]
*  Excitable. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1786.54s)]
*  Is that really what killed him or was it appendicitis? [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1787.6200000000001s)]
*  Did you say it was appendicitis, Jamie, [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1791.7s)]
*  that you read that? [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1793.1000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1793.94s)]
*  Great headshot. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1797.38s)]
*  So maybe you can rupture someone's appendix with a punch. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1798.22s)]
*  Oh, so that's how it happened. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1801.78s)]
*  Which is the inflammation of the abdominal wall. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1803.18s)]
*  His appendix was removed, [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1804.82s)]
*  but the poison from the ruptured appendix [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1806.02s)]
*  was already in his bloodstream. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1807.86s)]
*  Geez. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1809.7s)]
*  Maybe, I mean, it makes sense. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1810.54s)]
*  I know guys lose their spleens from really bad accidents. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1812.3s)]
*  You can, you know, if your body gets damaged, [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1817.7s)]
*  they could remove your spleen. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1820.62s)]
*  It might be like it fucks your appendix up too. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1822.9399999999998s)]
*  I mean, it makes sense if something's hitting it. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1824.9399999999998s)]
*  These UFC guys, I mean, [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1826.98s)]
*  the blows they take for this kind of stuff. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1829.5s)]
*  Dude. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1832.02s)]
*  You get too accustomed to it. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1833.66s)]
*  It's so normal for me to see guys fight. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1835.94s)]
*  It's weird. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1840.3400000000001s)]
*  It's real weird. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1841.94s)]
*  Like I'm super accustomed to it, [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1842.78s)]
*  but it really is shocking. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1844.46s)]
*  It is. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1845.8600000000001s)]
*  If you just step back and watch like a real high level fight, [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1846.7s)]
*  the impact. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1849.42s)]
*  It's terrifying. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1850.26s)]
*  Shocking. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1851.1000000000001s)]
*  If it was dogs, it'd be illegal. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1851.94s)]
*  Right. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1853.98s)]
*  Like you watch UFC fight, you go, [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1854.8200000000002s)]
*  you know, we couldn't do this if this was dogs. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1855.66s)]
*  Like, I can't believe. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1857.78s)]
*  I can't believe what, [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1859.26s)]
*  and there's people gathered around, people, I'm gamblers. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1860.22s)]
*  And you just go, I don't think that this should be allowed, [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1862.66s)]
*  but they do. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1867.94s)]
*  I know it's wild. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1868.78s)]
*  When every now and again, you mean it, it always, [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1871.02s)]
*  I'm always aware of how dangerous it is for the fighters [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1876.1000000000001s)]
*  and how wild it is to see. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1879.46s)]
*  But every now and then someone would get really injured. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1882.18s)]
*  And when I'm like, oh shit, [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1885.26s)]
*  like when Chris Weidman broke his leg, I was like, oh shit. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1887.22s)]
*  Or when Anderson Silva broke his leg. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1890.42s)]
*  That clean break on his shin. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1892.78s)]
*  They both had it. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1894.3799999999999s)]
*  Both, this is the craziest thing. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1895.22s)]
*  It's only happened four times in the UFC [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1896.5s)]
*  and two times have been with Chris Weidman. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1898.42s)]
*  Oh really? [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1900.42s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1901.26s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know who that guy is. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1902.1s)]
*  I don't watch a lot, but I saw the silver one and I go, [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1903.62s)]
*  oh, he was striking him and he broke his leg. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1905.82s)]
*  Weidman was the, yeah, right there. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1908.22s)]
*  That's the one I saw a lot. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1909.06s)]
*  Weidman was UFC middleweight champion at the time. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1910.18s)]
*  That's Weidman and he was defending his title [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1912.98s)]
*  against Anderson, who he beat in the first fight. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1914.94s)]
*  And then Anderson just threw that. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1917.42s)]
*  So gross. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1919.54s)]
*  Oh, so disgusting, dude. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1920.3799999999999s)]
*  And he had hurt it on a check earlier. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1921.6999999999998s)]
*  Boom. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1923.6599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it just gave out. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1924.5s)]
*  Chris said that he checked it earlier [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1926.34s)]
*  and he thinks that it had hurt. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1928.74s)]
*  Check means when Anderson throws a kick, [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1930.6599999999999s)]
*  you lift up your leg and you try to get it [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1933.1799999999998s)]
*  where his shin hits the top of your, [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1935.62s)]
*  like right below your knee. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1939.1399999999999s)]
*  Because that's like indestructible. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1941.1s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1942.54s)]
*  So it's like, what's the weakest point? [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1943.3799999999999s)]
*  The middle of your shin, [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1944.78s)]
*  if it hits that top area of the knee, [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1946.1399999999999s)]
*  that top area is not giving. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1948.98s)]
*  It's also, it's like, you can take a shot like that [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1952.54s)]
*  or like pretty hard. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1955.18s)]
*  But in the middle of the shin, [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1956.82s)]
*  you got all that crazy leverage. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1958.58s)]
*  And down there where Anderson broke his, [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1960.1399999999999s)]
*  think of how thin that is compared to the bones at the top. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1962.1399999999999s)]
*  So something had to give. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1965.02s)]
*  Coming at that. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1966.1399999999999s)]
*  It happens all the time. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1966.98s)]
*  Well, not all the time, but it's happening a lot more now [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1967.8s)]
*  because so much stuff is filmed. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1972.1399999999999s)]
*  I've seen a dozen of them at least. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1974.18s)]
*  It does happen. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1976.42s)]
*  I used to work at this moving company. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1977.26s)]
*  It used to be super rare. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1978.1s)]
*  When you work at a place like a moving company [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1980.3400000000001s)]
*  or like any of these kind of jobs [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1982.3400000000001s)]
*  where they just hire criminals. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1984.58s)]
*  Like people with criminal records, [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1986.18s)]
*  they're like, you wanna make 20 bucks an hour? [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1987.3s)]
*  Just load up this big rig with frozen groceries. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1988.66s)]
*  I've had a lot of those jobs when I was young [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1991.8s)]
*  because I didn't go to college. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1993.3400000000001s)]
*  And you could tell me if this is real or not, [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1994.66s)]
*  but it's an unreliable source. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1997.7s)]
*  But this guy's a guy who used to be in the Marine Corps [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=1999.74s)]
*  and they used to tell us, [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2001.58s)]
*  you're gonna get punched. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2004.1000000000001s)]
*  You wanna get hit in the face, [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2004.94s)]
*  you wanna get hit right here. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2005.94s)]
*  And we always picked the face. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2007.5s)]
*  Does that make fight sense? [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2009.7s)]
*  Or is this guy just trying to be cool at the warehouse? [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2011.98s)]
*  I don't think he knows what the fuck he's talking about. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2015.38s)]
*  Okay, fair enough. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2016.74s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2017.6200000000001s)]
*  These guys were like, you know. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2018.46s)]
*  Yeah, I take it in the gut all day long over the face. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2019.28s)]
*  Really? [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2021.42s)]
*  Yeah, but the thing about the face is it puts you out. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2022.24s)]
*  If someone's gonna just hit you, [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2024.16s)]
*  if you know you're gonna get hit [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2026.22s)]
*  and you get to choose where you get hit, [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2027.9s)]
*  you take it in the stomach and you prepare for it. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2029.58s)]
*  It's still gonna suck, but you could take a few. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2031.74s)]
*  If you get punched in the face by the right guy. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2034.88s)]
*  He told us that, it blew our mind. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2037.64s)]
*  Man, I don't think he knows what he's talking about. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2039.3200000000002s)]
*  I think he was trying to be a tough guy. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2040.88s)]
*  It depends. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2042.3200000000002s)]
*  If someone hits you in the liver, [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2043.5600000000002s)]
*  like if you get someone who's really good, [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2045.2800000000002s)]
*  like Ryan Garcia, he's got this nasty liver punch. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2049.7200000000003s)]
*  Oh God, he hits people, they just blap. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2052.8s)]
*  Canelo Alvarez has a wicked liver punch. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2056.1600000000003s)]
*  When you have that shot, it's like a left hook [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2058.6400000000003s)]
*  that's kind of almost partially an uppercut. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2062.1400000000003s)]
*  It's like a body left hook [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2065.56s)]
*  and they'll slam it right here, [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2067.0s)]
*  right here with the rib cages [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2069.3999999999996s)]
*  and the livers right below it. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2070.8799999999997s)]
*  Oh my goodness. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2072.8399999999997s)]
*  It's the worst feeling. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2074.3599999999997s)]
*  You get electrocuted. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2075.7999999999997s)]
*  Your whole body shuts off. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2077.7999999999997s)]
*  It's so crazy. It's like a kill switch. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2079.3999999999996s)]
*  It is a kill switch. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2081.08s)]
*  It really is. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2082.08s)]
*  And some guys are masterful at hitting that kill switch. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2083.12s)]
*  You know what the sad part about this is, Joe? [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2086.16s)]
*  What, it's been 30 years, probably? [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2088.56s)]
*  25 years I've been telling that story. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2090.68s)]
*  I heard if you had to pick between the face and the thing, [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2093.24s)]
*  you'd take the face because this one idiot. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2096.36s)]
*  Don't let somebody punch in the face. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2098.24s)]
*  Yeah, you go unconscious. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2100.24s)]
*  You lose your vision. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2101.6s)]
*  Yeah, you want to be able to see. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2103.2s)]
*  You'll recover from a body shot. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2104.52s)]
*  You might not recover from getting punched in the face. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2106.76s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot of buttons on your face. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2109.68s)]
*  Like you've seen slap fighting. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2110.52s)]
*  They get slapped unconscious. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2112.12s)]
*  Just a slap. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2113.64s)]
*  And they're ready for it. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2115.12s)]
*  And they're like professional slappers. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2116.36s)]

*  Oh yeah, yeah. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2288.44s)]
*  You have to figure it out. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2289.44s)]

*  You carry yourself in a different way. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2296.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2297.84s)]

*  Things like that. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2303.8s)]

*  Yes. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2307.68s)]
*  I got something now to prove kind of thing. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2308.68s)]
*  Not to make Conor Greger about myself, but just there is a thing about getting your s*** [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2312.16s)]
*  together. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2317.04s)]

*  You know? [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2319.04s)]
*  Like, there's something to that. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2320.04s)]
*  It's not, again, it's not guaranteed. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2321.04s)]
*  It's like it's a part of the equation. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2323.28s)]

*  It's not like you live in a land of only fate. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2326.6000000000004s)]
*  It's not like you can just make things happen with your mind and random things don't happen [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2330.76s)]
*  to people. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2336.0400000000004s)]

*  Random things do happen to people. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2338.48s)]

*  The energy you put out there in the world probably has an effect on the life that you [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2344.0800000000004s)]
*  live. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2347.44s)]

*  applaud it. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2354.8799999999997s)]

*  100%. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2362.7999999999997s)]
*  That's the reason we like basketball. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2363.7999999999997s)]
*  Like Jordan. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2365.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2366.44s)]
*  We saw someone accomplish something and we go, oh hey, f***ing they did that thing. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2367.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2371.16s)]

*  You know? [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2373.16s)]
*  Of just seeing someone who is the best at anything or just extraordinary at anything, [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2374.16s)]
*  it makes you realize that people can do wild shit, man. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2381.68s)]
*  And it might not be the people that you're around. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2385.56s)]
*  It might not be the people that you surround yourself with. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2387.12s)]
*  But just knowing that those other people are out there in the world, you know that there's [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2390.3799999999997s)]
*  a higher bar to set. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2394.8599999999997s)]
*  You could do it. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2396.8799999999997s)]
*  Like something, in whatever field you're doing. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2397.8799999999997s)]
*  You watch a Mike Tyson fight from the 1980s. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2400.3599999999997s)]

*  It made you think that you could get better at everything you do. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2407.12s)]
*  Well, and it's not like Tyson had some silver spoon. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2410.0s)]
*  The opposite. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2412.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2413.8399999999997s)]

*  This kid. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2415.8399999999997s)]
*  The opposite. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2416.8399999999997s)]

*  I'm not going to tell you anything you don't know. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2419.24s)]
*  But I love they did that documentary where he's like, he's being so sweet about his coach [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2420.6s)]
*  and he's going, I'm nothing. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2425.3199999999997s)]
*  I'm like a piece of s***. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2427.0s)]
*  And they let me live in their house and he's teaching me boxing. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2429.24s)]
*  And they're being so nice to me and these white people and they're letting me sleep [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2432.16s)]
*  with them in the house and they're feeding me. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2435.64s)]
*  And I'm thinking, I'm going to rob these motherf**kers. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2438.58s)]
*  His instinct was still like, they didn't lock the house up. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2440.58s)]
*  But like, I just love that, his mentality. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2445.7999999999997s)]
*  They took like a straight kid, you know, as guarding pigeons from his buddies. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2448.8399999999997s)]
*  And he could be that. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2453.5s)]
*  I'm never going to be a boxer, but I could go, maybe I could do something great. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2456.7999999999997s)]
*  Do you ever see the movie The Color of Money? [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2460.48s)]
*  It's Tom Cruise and Mary Elizabeth, Master Antonio, and she plays his girlfriend. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2463.08s)]
*  She's so f**king hot. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2467.56s)]

*  It's with Paul Newman. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2470.0s)]
*  I hate watching movies that are old but with hot chicks. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2471.0s)]
*  Oh, she was so hot back then. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2473.36s)]
*  Because I know that they're not alive no more. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2474.56s)]
*  I think she's still alive. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2476.52s)]
*  But anyway, the point is she's an amazing actress too. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2478.0s)]
*  And she played his girlfriend and she was talking to Paul Newman and she had this chain [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2481.8s)]
*  around her neck. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2487.82s)]
*  And the dad was like, or Paul Newman was like, where'd you get it? [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2489.86s)]
*  And she's like, oh, it came from Vincent. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2494.46s)]
*  You know, it was Vincent's mom. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2497.02s)]
*  It was Vincent's mom's. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2498.46s)]
*  And then he goes, did he give it to you? [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2500.54s)]
*  She goes, no. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2503.26s)]
*  When I was with my ex-boyfriend, we stole it from his house. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2504.52s)]
*  So she was still wearing a stolen Tom Cruise's mom's chain that she stole from his house [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2508.86s)]
*  while they were dating. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2515.7400000000002s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2517.26s)]
*  But it was cool. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2518.26s)]
*  It was like, whoa. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2519.26s)]
*  Just to know there's vipers like that out there. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2521.2200000000003s)]
*  We can all be the viper. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2524.42s)]
*  Tom Cruise plays this genius pool player that's probably autistic. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2527.6200000000003s)]
*  And this is the girlfriend. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2531.42s)]
*  The girlfriend is just like a total hustler. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2533.5400000000004s)]
*  Just controlling him, steering him, completely in control of Vincent. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2538.5800000000004s)]
*  And if she leaves the room, he panics. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2544.58s)]
*  It's really wild. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2547.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2548.42s)]
*  I feel like I know some women like that. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2549.42s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2550.86s)]
*  They're the fun ones. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2551.86s)]
*  This is Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2553.7599999999998s)]
*  She is hot. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2555.66s)]
*  I watched, I'm going to slaughter the name, but I was at Terry Bradshaw's house on Christmas. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2559.2599999999998s)]
*  And he likes these old movies. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2564.42s)]
*  So he puts in like, it's something like I'll see you in St. Louis or meet me in St. Louis [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2566.22s)]
*  or something. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2571.14s)]
*  It's an older movie. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2572.14s)]
*  And I'm there. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2573.22s)]
*  I got some cigars and we're just watching. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2574.22s)]
*  He falls asleep. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2575.7s)]
*  I'm watching this movie. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2576.7s)]
*  This kind of goes back to what I was saying. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2577.7s)]
*  I don't like to watch old films with beautiful women like that. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2578.7s)]
*  Because Judy Garland's on the screen and she's just so pretty and sweet and nice. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2581.06s)]
*  I'm falling for Judy Garland in the movie. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2585.7s)]
*  Oh, she's beautiful. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2588.3799999999997s)]
*  And then I was like, I'm going to look her up, you know? [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2589.3799999999997s)]
*  See what she's. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2591.94s)]
*  And I was like, I'm about 40 years late. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2592.94s)]
*  And she just gone, oh yeah. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2595.74s)]
*  But that's how dumb I am. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2597.54s)]
*  I'm getting a crush on a woman that's been gone for 30 years and also didn't age great. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2598.94s)]
*  Well don't you ever imagine living life back then? [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2604.7000000000003s)]
*  It's like living with children. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2609.06s)]
*  Oh, for sure. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2610.62s)]
*  Like people back then were like, culturally, they were like children. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2612.02s)]
*  But it's kind of sweet. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2614.34s)]
*  Yeah, kind of sweet. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2615.34s)]
*  I know it's a mushrooms idea. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2617.1s)]
*  I'm a big mushroom guy. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2618.34s)]
*  But like, I always, I don't know how, when you do new mushrooms, when I do mushrooms, [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2619.42s)]
*  I'm with my friends. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2625.26s)]
*  And it's a, we're not. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2626.54s)]
*  We're usually in the woods, camping or something. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2627.66s)]
*  I don't like to go to concerts. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2629.38s)]
*  I don't want to be on mushrooms. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2630.38s)]
*  Too much randomness. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2633.18s)]
*  Yeah, I can't do that. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2634.18s)]
*  Noise. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2635.18s)]
*  I don't want to hit her a guy I don't know well. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2636.18s)]
*  Right. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2637.18s)]
*  I want to be around some people I love. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2638.18s)]
*  I want to be around. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2639.18s)]
*  But I was thinking about like, in the old days, we'd ride our horses, you know? [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2640.18s)]
*  And we'd have like a little picture of our lady back home. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2646.38s)]
*  And we'd clean up the horses and we'd make some food and we'd eat whatever. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2648.64s)]
*  And we'd go, I wonder what's going on out there? [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2651.5s)]
*  What do you think's going on? [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2652.98s)]
*  We might talk about it a little, call it a night. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2654.58s)]
*  We had our responsibilities. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2657.34s)]
*  We had our little things. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2658.34s)]
*  You knew your girl and you knew some girls in town, but you knew your woman that you [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2659.88s)]
*  loved and your family. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2663.5s)]
*  And then it's like, now, now I don't wonder what anyone's doing. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2665.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2668.6200000000003s)]
*  Can't even escape my ex-girlfriend's breakfast post. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2669.6200000000003s)]
*  We know it's, there's got to be some happy medium. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2673.02s)]
*  Those guys knew nothing. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2675.54s)]
*  Kind of a sweet time. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2676.54s)]
*  Kind of a sweet time, but which one would you choose? [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2677.54s)]
*  I'm only thinking I want that because I got now. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2680.06s)]
*  Yeah, it's nonsense. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2683.5s)]
*  It's like, what do you want to do? [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2684.5s)]
*  Go back to being a chimp and throw shit at each other? [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2685.5s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2687.74s)]
*  Because they were probably like, what are these people going to live in houses? [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2688.74s)]
*  Yeah, but maybe. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2690.9s)]
*  You know, that was one of the things that Genghis Khan. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2691.9s)]
*  You'd crush it as a chimp, Joe. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2694.58s)]
*  I don't know if you know that. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2695.58s)]
*  You'd get to be Joe Rogan of the chimps, I'm pretty sure. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2696.58s)]
*  When Genghis Khan, like one of his titles was he who rules in all, it's like something [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2699.66s)]
*  about felt houses. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2706.22s)]
*  So that they had such disdain for people who lived in houses. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2708.5s)]
*  Look at them fat cats with their houses. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2714.68s)]
*  They all lived in tents. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2716.56s)]
*  They lived in felt tents. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2718.24s)]
*  So they never had houses. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2720.0s)]
*  They thought you were a pussy if you lived in a house. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2721.0s)]
*  You're too protected. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2724.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2726.7599999999998s)]
*  So like, and you think about how horrific the Mongol Empire was and what they did. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2727.7599999999998s)]
*  The Mongols killed somewhere around 50 to 70 million people during Genghis Khan's life. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2733.08s)]
*  They reduced the population of the planet by 10%. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2739.22s)]
*  They changed the carbon footprint, dude. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2743.0s)]
*  I think Hitler gets too much credit. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2744.68s)]
*  That's the one everyone knows. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2746.28s)]
*  Everyone wants to reference Hitler. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2747.76s)]
*  Nobody's talking about Napoleon or... [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2749.32s)]
*  What about what Stalin did? [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2750.92s)]
*  Mussolini or Stalin or even the Mongol. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2752.44s)]
*  Like you know what I'm saying? [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2755.68s)]
*  Those ones don't get enough kind of like, you know like... [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2756.68s)]
*  Well I used to have a joke about it. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2759.7200000000003s)]
*  Like that you could be a pirate for Halloween. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2761.64s)]
*  Like you know how crazy it is? [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2763.4s)]
*  Like pirates are some of the most fucking evil creatures that ever existed. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2765.32s)]
*  They're the most famous rapists. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2769.52s)]
*  That's what you go, what do pirates do? [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2771.88s)]
*  Rape and pillage. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2773.88s)]
*  Rape and murder. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2774.88s)]
*  Rape is the first thing... [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2775.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2776.88s)]
*  You can't be a pirate. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2777.88s)]
*  You should be able to be... [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2778.88s)]
*  It's synonymous with the title. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2779.88s)]
*  It's like priest child molester. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2780.88s)]
*  You think about it. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2781.88s)]
*  Don't cancel the white girl with the Indian headdress at Halloween. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2782.88s)]
*  You should be canceling the pirates. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2785.52s)]
*  That was not a fair comparison. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2787.76s)]
*  There's way more pirates raped than priests. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2789.1200000000003s)]
*  Probably all pirates raped. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2792.2400000000002s)]
*  Priests that are pedophiles, it's probably only like one out of a thousand. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=2794.2400000000002s)]

*  It makes things, it's like, how much can you control the crazy? [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3042.48s)]
*  It's like, do you have a Ferrari? [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3045.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3047.3199999999997s)]
*  That Ferrari has 700 horsepower. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3047.8399999999997s)]
*  Do you know how to drive that? [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3049.72s)]
*  Like, how much can you control that crazy? [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3050.96s)]
*  Because occasionally you're going to fucking spin out around the crooners. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3052.6s)]
*  One of my best friends is a crazy person who I love him. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3055.96s)]
*  But you know, I can't tell you how often there's some situation where I go, [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3059.7999999999997s)]
*  hey, bud, we can't do that again at a comedy club. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3063.96s)]
*  You know? [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3066.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3067.08s)]
*  But he is the guy that I promise you, probably my only friend, [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3067.48s)]
*  who if I went to his house and goes, hey, something bad happened. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3071.2400000000002s)]
*  We got to get rid of this body. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3074.08s)]
*  You know, he would just be like, all right, let's do this. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3075.76s)]
*  And I mean, he really would. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3079.0s)]
*  And that's scary a little. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3080.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3082.32s)]
*  But that's the kind of humans you want. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3083.0s)]
*  Because all these rules that we have are all just created by humans. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3084.8s)]
*  We've agreed to them as if they're unbreakable doctrine. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3087.7200000000003s)]
*  Listen to me and listen very carefully. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3091.08s)]
*  If the power goes out for too long, all those rules are bullshit. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3094.7599999999998s)]
*  And that guy who will bury a body for you is the kind of person you want in your team. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3100.48s)]
*  100%. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3105.04s)]
*  Also, if the power goes out, I'm probably going to show up to your place. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3106.04s)]
*  I got a spot for you. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3109.92s)]
*  Be in the gym. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3110.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3111.2799999999997s)]
*  Can I just be in your gym? [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3111.8s)]
*  I've thought about literally setting up a ranch out here, [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3113.16s)]
*  just specifically for if things go sideways. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3116.0s)]
*  Yeah? [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3119.96s)]
*  I think you're pretty set up. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3120.8s)]
*  This place is safe. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3121.92s)]
*  It's not that safe. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3123.36s)]
*  Dude, if things go sideways, it's not safe anywhere. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3124.64s)]
*  We have to understand that this society that we have that stays civil and beautiful [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3129.04s)]
*  and equitable, and we have all this change that's happening in the world, [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3135.08s)]
*  this is only possible if you can get goods and services to people [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3139.04s)]
*  and if people have access to information. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3143.44s)]
*  It is not hard to shut that off. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3145.68s)]
*  If the power went out in this country, if someone attacked the grid [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3147.84s)]
*  and just destroyed our power grid and destroyed our satellites, [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3151.76s)]
*  if there was a coordinated effort by multiple superpowers [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3155.76s)]
*  to just destroy our satellites, destroy our grid, [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3160.0s)]
*  we would be in chaos quickly. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3164.52s)]
*  Pretty fast. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3166.92s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3167.48s)]
*  Quickly. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3167.84s)]
*  Very quickly. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3168.76s)]
*  And then if it lasts too long and there's some sort of a hostile military takeover [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3170.1600000000003s)]
*  of the country, you're living in a totally different world than the one you live in now. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3176.44s)]
*  Now you live in China, and you never thought that was possible. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3181.08s)]
*  You thought that you would be able to just exist here and demand universal basic income, [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3185.6800000000003s)]
*  and you would have all these ideas in your head about the border wall is racist and this and that. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3193.04s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, you live in a world that's unrecognizable. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3198.8s)]
*  And that's just an example of what could happen if someone acts, [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3205.6s)]
*  if a human being does something, which is very similar to what other human beings are doing right now all over the world. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3209.96s)]
*  What's happening right now in Ukraine, what's happening right now in Israel, [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3215.7999999999997s)]
*  that is human beings launching bombs at people they've never met. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3220.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3224.52s)]
*  That's happening for sure. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3224.8399999999997s)]
*  The idea that that is not going to happen here is just stupid. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3226.72s)]
*  It's stupid. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3231.96s)]
*  If you're living in Gaza right now, think about that reality. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3233.2s)]
*  Think about the reality of where you used to sleep at night is now rubble. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3237.3599999999997s)]
*  Everything around it is rubble. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3242.7599999999998s)]
*  If you're lucky, and you can see that because you're alive. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3244.64s)]
*  Yeah, but some women have to deal with catcalling, Joe. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3247.7599999999998s)]
*  Listen, it's always good to move forward. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3252.0s)]
*  It's always good to call out bullshit, but at a certain point in time, you need perspective. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3254.48s)]
*  You know, don't clean your bathroom while your fucking house is on fire. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3258.72s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3262.3199999999997s)]
*  Figure out what the fuck we need to do to make sure we don't blow ourselves up. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3263.48s)]
*  And that's just if humans act. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3269.52s)]
*  The real thing is stuff from somewhere else. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3273.0s)]
*  The real thing is asteroids. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3276.08s)]
*  That's the real one, kids. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3278.16s)]
*  If you look at the moon, that's us. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3280.2799999999997s)]
*  The moon is pelted, pelted by asteroids. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3283.44s)]
*  There's craters everywhere. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3288.16s)]
*  You look at every other planet that we could see, they all get hit. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3290.56s)]
*  You look at the surface of our planet, there's craters everywhere, everywhere. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3294.08s)]
*  This fucking place gets hit a lot. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3299.44s)]
*  I don't like to think about space for those reasons. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3302.32s)]
*  Nobody likes to think about it. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3306.52s)]
*  Well, because I can't control anything but me, right? [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3307.72s)]
*  And so if I can't even control the people in my, you know, the governor can't even control that guy. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3310.72s)]
*  Space just seems so big. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3318.92s)]
*  Going like, oh, an asteroid. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3321.1600000000003s)]
*  What are you going to do? [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3322.76s)]
*  What's the plan for an asteroid? [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3324.4s)]
*  There's no plan right now. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3326.36s)]
*  I think they've got some theories of how to do something. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3328.2000000000003s)]
*  But last time I spoke to someone who's an expert on the subject, he said it was about 10 years away from them being able to actually successfully divert asteroids. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3330.44s)]
*  And then also, you got to spot them all. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3339.84s)]
*  Some of them are coming from behind the sun. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3341.88s)]
*  And apparently, the way the gravity of the sun works, it's so massive. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3343.84s)]
*  It distorts the view of things that are coming from behind it. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3348.0s)]
*  Yeah, the asteroid goes, how about a sucker punch? [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3351.7200000000003s)]
*  You know, just a sucker punch earth. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3353.6s)]
*  They won't be ready. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3355.28s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3355.96s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3356.92s)]
*  Bro, have you ever looked at the size of our sun in comparison to earth? [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3358.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3362.88s)]
*  And then looked at other suns in comparison to our sun, the biggest suns that are out there? [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3363.76s)]
*  I don't know those other suns. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3368.32s)]
*  That's where I'm at educationally. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3369.4s)]
*  I didn't even know there was other suns. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3371.6800000000003s)]
*  Well, stars, other stars. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3373.12s)]
*  Stars are suns, basically. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3374.92s)]
*  But the really big ones are bigger in proportion to like when you see earth and the sun. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3376.4s)]
*  When they see the sun and it, they're bigger than that. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3384.2000000000003s)]
*  Like these things are so big. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3387.0s)]
*  I hate Neil deGrasse Tyson or whatever that guy's name is. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3389.1600000000003s)]
*  I hate you. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3393.7200000000003s)]
*  You suck, in my opinion. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3394.36s)]
*  I think you're a bozo. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3395.56s)]
*  But he did say a really interesting thing once where he was talking about aliens. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3396.7200000000003s)]
*  It might have been to you. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3399.8s)]
*  Why do you hate him? [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3401.0s)]
*  Well, he said this thing. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3403.84s)]
*  I'll get to that in a second. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3404.6800000000003s)]
*  OK. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3405.44s)]
*  He said, he goes, he's talking about life on other planets. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3406.0s)]
*  And he goes, saying that there isn't life other than us is like taking a thimble of [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3409.88s)]
*  ocean water and going, look, there's no whales. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3415.52s)]
*  There's no whales in here. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3418.44s)]
*  And it's really like that's a great analogy. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3420.44s)]
*  Like, of course, there's life out there. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3423.36s)]
*  Yeah, most likely there's life. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3426.0s)]
*  So this is just somewhere. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3427.28s)]
*  This is just showing the relative sizes. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3428.4s)]
*  Oh, my gosh. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3430.24s)]
*  So you go all the way from Earth to the sun and now Sirius A. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3432.2s)]
*  And then look at this one. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3436.96s)]
*  Look at Pollux. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3438.7999999999997s)]
*  And look at this one, Arcturus. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3440.2s)]
*  Now, look how much bigger they are than the Earth. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3441.3599999999997s)]
*  Look at this one. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3444.08s)]
*  Look at that one, Aldura. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3446.2s)]
*  What is this guy? [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3448.0s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3448.7599999999998s)]
*  Wait. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3449.68s)]
*  Just wait. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3450.16s)]
*  Look at this motherfucker. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3451.2799999999997s)]
*  What's that? [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3453.04s)]
*  That's a blue hypergiant star called Pistol Star. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3454.12s)]
*  Well, he's just called God. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3457.2799999999997s)]
*  No, look. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3458.6s)]
*  He keeps going, dude. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3459.08s)]
*  What is this one? [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3460.04s)]
*  Oh, these are the stars. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3460.76s)]
*  This is how crazy the universe is. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3462.84s)]
*  Look at that one, Stevenson. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3465.5600000000004s)]
*  Now, no, no, no. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3467.32s)]
*  We're not done. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3468.2400000000002s)]
*  Look at the size. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3469.1200000000003s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3469.92s)]
*  Bro, look at the size of a black hole. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3470.84s)]
*  Supermassive black hole. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3475.92s)]
*  Now, look at the size of this one. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3478.6800000000003s)]
*  This is blowing my mind. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3480.48s)]
*  Bro, there's black holes out there that are the size of galaxies. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3481.76s)]
*  Joe, if we were on mushrooms right now, [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3484.88s)]
*  I would be quiet for about four minutes after this, [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3487.36s)]
*  Can you give me four minutes to just look at your roof [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3491.0800000000004s)]
*  for a second? [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3493.76s)]
*  For sure. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3494.28s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3494.88s)]
*  Dude, look at the size of these galaxies, too. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3496.04s)]
*  220 light years across, 1,862 light years across. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3499.88s)]
*  Look at this one, 54,000 light years across. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3506.0800000000004s)]
*  There's us, 105, Milky Way. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3510.28s)]
*  Do you ever been to a place where you could really [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3513.96s)]
*  see the stars at night? [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3516.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, that's one of my favorite things about being like camping. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3517.32s)]
*  Camping out in the dark and beautiful it is. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3520.0s)]
*  It's really beautiful. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3524.16s)]
*  It's wild, right? [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3525.6s)]
*  When you go, that's up there all the time. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3526.4s)]
*  Do you think aliens are looking at us going, [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3528.2s)]
*  these guys, he's all losing his mind over a slam dunk. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3533.0s)]
*  You know, he's going like, they're all, [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3537.24s)]
*  everyone on this planet is going, that guy slam dunked the best. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3539.04s)]
*  When you look at the world, the universe like that, [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3543.36s)]
*  and you go, all these earthlings are wearing the same shirt [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3547.04s)]
*  as that guy that dunks the best. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3549.48s)]
*  Not the guy that survives the best, [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3553.28s)]
*  not the guy that can feed the most, or is the most noble, [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3554.96s)]
*  or is the most, we're all losing our mind about the guy that [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3558.76s)]
*  made the most three pointers. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3562.72s)]
*  Well, I think it all has to do with war. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3565.12s)]
*  That's what I think. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3568.04s)]
*  How so? [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3568.96s)]
*  I think the desire to be good at competitive athletics, [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3569.46s)]
*  the roots of it are all in war. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3575.2s)]
*  It all started in war. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3577.12s)]
*  That's what I think. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3579.04s)]
*  And I think that that instinct to dominate [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3580.12s)]
*  and to get better at one-on-one competition or team [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3583.84s)]
*  competition all started from tactics and strategies in war. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3588.16s)]
*  And that desire, that human reward system [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3593.68s)]
*  is still in our heads. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3598.72s)]
*  And we know that we don't want to do that anymore. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3600.2799999999997s)]
*  So we have to find other ways of doing it. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3602.4s)]
*  A little game. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3604.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3604.72s)]
*  So I think the aliens would realize, [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3605.22s)]
*  oh, their human reward system got [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3606.88s)]
*  hijacked for something that doesn't even matter. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3609.32s)]
*  I play pool. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3612.96s)]
*  I love pool. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3614.1600000000003s)]
*  And when I play it, it's like, if you watch it, [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3615.6400000000003s)]
*  it's like, why do you give a fuck [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3617.84s)]
*  if the ball goes in the hole? [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3618.96s)]
*  That's so stupid. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3620.12s)]
*  It's the goal. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3620.8s)]
*  But it's this coordinated mind effort thing [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3621.8s)]
*  that ignites that part of the brain that [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3627.84s)]
*  wants you to be good at war. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3631.48s)]
*  That's why we love competition. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3633.6800000000003s)]
*  That's why we watch it. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3635.56s)]
*  It's like a built-in reward system in our mind. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3637.16s)]
*  And then also, if we're a society that's constantly [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3640.44s)]
*  looking to innovate, we're constantly [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3643.08s)]
*  looking for people that are pushing [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3644.7999999999997s)]
*  the boundaries of whatever they do, [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3647.32s)]
*  whether it's music, whatever they do, comedy, [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3649.2s)]
*  pushing the boundary, like someone [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3652.2s)]
*  who's at the front of the line just out there chasing it. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3654.04s)]
*  Because that sort of applies to society as a whole. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3656.54s)]
*  So if someone's doing that in a very public sphere, [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3661.12s)]
*  like playing in the NFL, it excites the energy [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3663.36s)]
*  of the people to do more things. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3668.96s)]
*  I think it's like a tribal reward system [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3671.1200000000003s)]
*  that's in our head, too. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3673.7200000000003s)]
*  Like a little mini. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3675.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3676.56s)]
*  So I think the aliens would recognize that. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3677.32s)]
*  I think they would say, this is probably [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3679.6s)]
*  a normal progression of territorial apes [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3681.36s)]
*  than territorial apes with nuclear weapons. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3684.84s)]
*  And the territorial apes that eventually evolve and then [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3687.04s)]
*  go out into the stars, that's probably [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3689.88s)]
*  how it always has to happen. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3693.24s)]
*  Neither one of them died, and that one's better. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3694.4399999999996s)]
*  Because I don't think with competition, [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3697.04s)]
*  I don't think you ever get the kind of innovation [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3698.64s)]
*  that you have today or that you've probably had in the past. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3701.3199999999997s)]
*  I don't think you build the pyramids without competition. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3704.6s)]
*  Well, that's a fact. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3706.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3707.68s)]
*  Yeah, there's something about that aspect of the human spirit [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3708.2s)]
*  that we want to compete, we want to win. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3712.9199999999996s)]
*  Like that fuels us in a way that people are embarrassed by, [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3714.9599999999996s)]
*  I think, sometimes. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3720.7999999999997s)]
*  It's one of the things they hate about Trump. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3721.64s)]
*  We're winning. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3723.12s)]
*  We're always going to win. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3724.04s)]
*  We're winners. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3725.3199999999997s)]
*  They're losers. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3726.4s)]
*  I like that about him. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3727.2s)]
*  They're all losers. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3728.0s)]
*  If you read his book, I don't read any books. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3729.16s)]
*  I listen to books. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3731.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I listen to books mostly. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3732.16s)]
*  I listen to about 10,000 books a year. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3733.44s)]
*  That's what I'm doing. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3737.52s)]
*  Joe, I'm reading 10 books a day. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3739.2799999999997s)]
*  I heard there's another guy who does that, too. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3741.68s)]
*  Oh, yeah? [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3743.72s)]
*  Kindred spirit to me. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3744.24s)]
*  So I listen to about one book probably every week and a half, [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3746.24s)]
*  because Audible, you can crank them out. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3750.0s)]
*  I don't know if you like playing video games or driving [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3751.8s)]
*  or on an airplane or something. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3753.92s)]
*  So I just listen to a lot of books. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3755.36s)]
*  And I'm trying to think why I brought that up. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3756.84s)]
*  What were we saying before the book? [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3759.6800000000003s)]
*  Trump winning. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3761.2000000000003s)]
*  Oh, yeah, Trump's book. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3761.96s)]
*  Thank you, Jim. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3763.2400000000002s)]
*  The art of the deal. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3765.5200000000004s)]
*  He's always talked like that, even before he was president. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3766.36s)]
*  So if you know that that's just kind of how he is, [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3769.0s)]
*  you'd have totally understood that that's how real estate [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3771.1200000000003s)]
*  guys talk. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3773.88s)]
*  My building's the best, and it's the biggest. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3774.6000000000004s)]
*  And they go, it's not the biggest. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3776.5200000000004s)]
*  And they go, it's the best hotel. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3778.2400000000002s)]
*  That's how he is. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3779.92s)]
*  So once you know that it isn't like he's lying or anything, [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3780.92s)]
*  it's just that's how the man is. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3784.6s)]
*  Also, he comes from a different era. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3786.48s)]
*  And by the way, he was celebrated forever. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3788.6800000000003s)]
*  Forever. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3791.32s)]
*  And then they turned him into a monster [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3792.28s)]
*  for the presidential campaign. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3793.84s)]
*  Before that, oh, he turned himself into a monster, [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3795.8s)]
*  initially, because he was claiming [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3799.0s)]
*  that Obama was from Kenya. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3800.76s)]
*  That was a tough hill to die on, too. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3802.56s)]
*  Here's my take. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3805.7200000000003s)]
*  Who gives a fuck what patch of dirt you're born on? [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3807.12s)]
*  Are we trying to pretend that he was like some embedded? [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3809.64s)]
*  He was a strange one, that one. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3812.92s)]
*  Yeah, was he like an embedded enemy operative [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3814.2799999999997s)]
*  that was going to rule the country? [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3816.2799999999997s)]
*  Because I'm not an Obama guy by any means, [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3817.0s)]
*  but I remember being like, I don't care where it is. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3818.24s)]
*  It's a weird thing to care about. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3820.08s)]
*  Why do you care? [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3822.04s)]
*  Especially Obama. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3822.7599999999998s)]
*  Trump was a lifelong Democrat. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3824.2s)]
*  Most of his life, he was Democrat, [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3827.2s)]
*  which is a weird thing to care that this one guy who was, [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3829.0s)]
*  listen, put policy aside. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3833.36s)]
*  I've said this a thousand times. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3834.92s)]
*  I'll say it again. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3836.2799999999997s)]
*  That's the best president we've ever had. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3836.7599999999998s)]
*  Most charming. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3838.3199999999997s)]
*  Best representation of what we would hope [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3838.96s)]
*  we would want the world to see of America. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3842.32s)]
*  Very highly educated, well-spoken, even-keeled, [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3844.48s)]
*  emotionally balanced, brilliant man. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3848.64s)]
*  Not too black. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3851.2400000000002s)]
*  Who was, but also pulled himself up from hard times. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3852.12s)]
*  Single mother, very likable, very charismatic. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3857.08s)]
*  So all those things, and you care [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3859.88s)]
*  what patch of dirt he was born on. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3862.6800000000003s)]
*  You should really care. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3864.44s)]
*  What are the policies? [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3866.44s)]
*  What's good, what's bad? [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3868.36s)]
*  What's good for business? [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3869.52s)]
*  What's bad for business? [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3870.4s)]
*  What's good for the world order, the economy? [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3871.28s)]
*  What's good for international relations? [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3873.96s)]
*  That's what you should be, why do you care about [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3876.16s)]
*  what he's born? [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3877.64s)]
*  And that's the adverse problem with Trump, [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3878.08s)]
*  is that nobody's looking at the policies. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3879.68s)]
*  They're just going to unlikable talks from the hip. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3881.36s)]
*  And so it's the reverse problem. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3885.2s)]
*  We have a guy who I think, I like Trump [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3887.64s)]
*  for being America first, and I like [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3889.88s)]
*  that he's honest and unapologetic about the way [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3891.36s)]
*  he talks about other people. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3894.36s)]
*  Like, if you don't like a guy, you don't like a guy. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3895.6s)]
*  But he's so unlikable, that that's what works against him. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3897.92s)]
*  The media also, you gotta realize that for all these years, [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3901.2400000000002s)]
*  all these years, they were pushing this bullshit [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3905.64s)]
*  about this Russia collusion. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3908.84s)]
*  They were talking about the Steele dossier, [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3911.04s)]
*  this fake thing that the Clinton campaign funded. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3914.0s)]
*  They were doing all these things to demonize him. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3918.08s)]
*  At the same time, they were lying about [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3921.36s)]
*  the Hunter Biden laptop. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3923.2s)]
*  You got spoon-fed some bullshit, unfortunately. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3925.92s)]
*  And on top of that, he's an easy guy to hate. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3929.56s)]
*  So it's both of those things. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3932.48s)]
*  He doesn't try to be, he never played the game. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3933.32s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, he's definitely got [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3935.44s)]
*  some stretches of the truth. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3938.8s)]
*  You know if I was Joe Rogan, you know who I'd try [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3940.32s)]
*  to hang out with all the time is? [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3941.96s)]
*  Who? [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3943.4s)]
*  George W. Bush. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3944.2400000000002s)]
*  Oh, right. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3945.36s)]
*  I think he'd be a cool guy to hang out with. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3946.2s)]
*  He might be depressed. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3947.04s)]
*  He might be just painting, thinking about [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3948.64s)]
*  all those people that died. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3950.08s)]
*  It's exact. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3951.28s)]
*  I like the thing that he's doing. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3952.88s)]
*  Just painting and thinking about a million dead Iraqis. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3955.0s)]
*  But I mean, as a guy. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3960.52s)]
*  That's one of those ones, dude. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3961.36s)]
*  That one, like if I was president while the Iraq, [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3962.52s)]
*  I was responsible for that and I was still alive, [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3966.56s)]
*  I'd be like, check please. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3969.4s)]
*  I don't want this fucking vibe on me. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3971.2400000000002s)]
*  There's no way you're having good days. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3973.04s)]
*  If you're a conscience-able person, [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3975.16s)]
*  and you think, look, we know that weapons [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3977.76s)]
*  of mass destruction's shit was bullshit. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3980.96s)]
*  We know it now. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3983.12s)]
*  It's universally accepted. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3984.52s)]
*  That's why that war was started. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3986.36s)]
*  For sure, and Obama, he's got a lot of deaths on his. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3988.8s)]
*  A lot of drones. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3992.72s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of drones. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3993.64s)]
*  A different type of. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3994.48s)]
*  Ramped up that fucking. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3995.32s)]
*  He went for the number. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3996.48s)]
*  He went for the record. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3997.32s)]
*  Sky robot. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3998.16s)]
*  He went for the record. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3999.0s)]
*  The sky robots with missiles were the scariest, dude. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=3999.82s)]
*  I know. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4002.04s)]
*  Every Sam Triply tweet that I see is of some robot [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4002.88s)]
*  chasing a soldier and then touching the soldier in blunt. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4006.96s)]
*  You imagine in Yemen. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4009.8s)]
*  Like a video game. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4011.64s)]
*  Imagine being in Yemen and you're on your way [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4012.48s)]
*  to a wedding and there's a whole line of you [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4014.68s)]
*  driving towards this wedding. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4017.6s)]
*  And you're like, what are the odds [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4019.8s)]
*  we get nuked from the sky? [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4021.2s)]
*  Pretty good. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4023.64s)]
*  That's gotta be scary. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4025.04s)]
*  To be in a line of cars headed somewhere in Yemen. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4029.04s)]
*  I just meant George W. seems cool, [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4032.72s)]
*  you know, with the baseball and the cigars and the beers. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4034.28s)]
*  I don't want to think about that part of it. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4037.64s)]
*  Your cousin's a terrorist, [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4038.48s)]
*  and he happens to be in the third car back. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4040.08s)]
*  Can't do that. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4042.72s)]
*  He's just here for the wedding. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4043.56s)]
*  Don't let the cousin come. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4044.38s)]
*  He's got metadata. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4046.88s)]
*  You should stay home, Andre. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4047.96s)]
*  Cause that's what they did with some of those drone attacks. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4050.0s)]
*  They attacked metadata. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4052.0s)]
*  I know. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4053.24s)]
*  So if you are texting. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4054.3199999999997s)]
*  I don't know what metadata is. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4056.12s)]
*  This is what it is. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4057.3199999999997s)]
*  So if you are texting from a cell phone, [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4058.16s)]
*  if you're calling from a cell phone, [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4060.36s)]
*  they can locate that cell phone. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4061.7999999999997s)]
*  They can triangulate the area where that cell phone is. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4063.58s)]
*  There's been times where they just send a missile. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4067.52s)]
*  To that cell phone. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4070.36s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4071.36s)]
*  He's in a cafe. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4072.36s)]
*  You could be, that cell phone, [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4073.28s)]
*  your baby could be sitting in the crib [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4074.32s)]
*  playing a game on your phone. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4075.84s)]
*  Yeah, it can. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4078.44s)]
*  Legitimately. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4079.28s)]
*  And the number of people that are just innocent civilians, [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4080.12s)]
*  versus the number of targets [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4085.12s)]
*  that get killed by drones is off the charts. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4086.96s)]
*  You don't even know what your dad does for a living. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4089.12s)]
*  You don't even know what he's, how he's making money. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4091.24s)]
*  You're a baby. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4094.28s)]
*  And he's like watching a YouTube video. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4095.12s)]
*  You get hit with a missile. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4097.72s)]
*  Yeah, see that. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4098.72s)]
*  This is why America's great, is that I don't, [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4099.76s)]
*  you know, we have the luxury of, [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4103.2s)]
*  I mean, at least I do. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4105.0s)]
*  I have the luxury of not thinking about that all day. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4106.4s)]
*  Yeah, you know the people that think about it, [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4109.4s)]
*  the drone operators. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4111.64s)]
*  They go through a very bizarre state of PTSD apparently. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4112.84s)]
*  See if you can find anything on that, [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4117.5599999999995s)]
*  because I was reading something about that, [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4118.5599999999995s)]
*  like that's a weird PTSD that a drone operator gets. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4120.08s)]
*  To be separated from it? [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4123.32s)]
*  Well, dude, you just want to. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4124.5599999999995s)]
*  It's like playing Call of Duty all day, [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4125.4s)]
*  but you're really killing people. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4126.44s)]
*  Yeah, people are really dumb. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4127.599999999999s)]
*  I had a guy. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4129.0s)]
*  You're watching him on a screen. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4129.839999999999s)]
*  I don't think he would want me to say his name. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4130.719999999999s)]
*  I won't say it. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4133.639999999999s)]
*  So, but he was like, I'm Joe, I met this guy for, [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4134.879999999999s)]
*  I'm pretty good at making friends pretty quick. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4139.919999999999s)]
*  I'm just chatting him up at the bar in San Diego. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4141.4s)]
*  Military guy, he's all jacked. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4144.04s)]
*  He just seems like a cool guy. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4145.599999999999s)]
*  And he's like, oh, I know your comedy, man. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4147.24s)]
*  You're friends with Josh and blah, blah, blah. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4148.48s)]
*  So I just chop it up with him. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4150.16s)]
*  I'm probably talking to this guy for minimum five minutes. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4151.48s)]
*  And I go, what do you do, man? [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4154.5599999999995s)]
*  He's like, oh, I'm in the military. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4155.84s)]
*  And I was like, you know, San Diego. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4156.96s)]
*  So I go, oh, nice. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4158.320000000001s)]
*  Thanks for your service. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4159.400000000001s)]
*  I do the whole thing. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4160.24s)]
*  And he goes, you want to see? [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4161.06s)]
*  I was like, yeah, yeah. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4162.320000000001s)]
*  I didn't think anything of it. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4163.16s)]
*  He pulls up on his phone a drone attack that he did. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4164.400000000001s)]
*  And it looks like a video game. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4169.16s)]
*  That's the only context I have [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4172.16s)]
*  is of what a video game would look like. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4173.56s)]
*  And there's a guy here, a guy here, a guy here. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4175.72s)]
*  And he gets the one guy, the two guys run away. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4177.76s)]
*  And then a dog was like right next to that guy. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4180.8s)]
*  The dog's fine too. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4182.56s)]
*  And he was gone. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4183.68s)]
*  See that? [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4184.52s)]
*  And even the dog lived. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4186.12s)]
*  And those two guys next to him, I got him. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4187.599999999999s)]
*  But I've never seen anything like this in my life. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4189.96s)]
*  And I look at this guy and I go, wait, wait. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4192.639999999999s)]
*  That guy's dead now. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4195.0s)]
*  He goes, yeah, I did that. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4196.0s)]
*  Literally like last week. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4198.04s)]
*  And he showed it to me on his phone. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4200.12s)]
*  He's got like a saved file [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4201.16s)]
*  to a stranger that he met five minutes ago. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4203.0s)]
*  I don't think that's legal. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4205.2s)]
*  Really? [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4207.0199999999995s)]
*  I bet that footage is like highly classified. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4207.86s)]
*  Really? [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4210.12s)]
*  Yeah, I bet you can get really fucked. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4210.94s)]
*  Well, it's good I didn't say his name. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4212.5199999999995s)]
*  I think that's the conclusion of a study on it done in 2021. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4213.84s)]
*  And right here it says, [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4216.72s)]
*  because if they admit psychological issues, [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4219.400000000001s)]
*  they could lose their job. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4221.92s)]
*  So there's not a lot of known. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4223.64s)]
*  It's like the concussion thing in the NFL. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4225.92s)]
*  Yeah, like they're saying in this whole study, [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4227.72s)]
*  like they know there is something here, [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4229.280000000001s)]
*  but because it's really hard to study and it's all secret. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4230.84s)]
*  I mean, I think it has to be a thing. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4235.0s)]
*  There's no way you could be able to launch missiles [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4237.24s)]
*  out of a robot in the sky [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4240.12s)]
*  and accidentally kill 80% civilians. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4241.88s)]
*  And feel nothing. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4244.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4245.28s)]
*  What is the actual numbers [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4246.12s)]
*  of civilians killed in drone strikes? [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4248.0s)]
*  I know we've done this before, but I can never remember. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4250.2s)]
*  But it's kind of nuts. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4252.6s)]
*  It's not like it's 50-50. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4254.42s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4256.2s)]
*  Yeah, that'd be great. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4257.04s)]
*  50-50 is like the negotiable. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4258.4400000000005s)]
*  About half. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4260.04s)]
*  You know, the guy's a really bad guy. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4260.88s)]
*  He's gonna kill a million people with a nuclear bomb. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4262.08s)]
*  We could bomb his apartment building, [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4264.58s)]
*  kill a few unfortunate folks [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4266.12s)]
*  that happen to be in the vicinity, but we have to get them. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4268.14s)]
*  That's why it's good to be a comedian. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4270.5199999999995s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4272.28s)]
*  The decisions I have to make. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4273.639999999999s)]
*  So much better. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4274.879999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4275.719999999999s)]
*  It's so much better. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4276.5599999999995s)]
*  But also just the thinking about, you know, [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4278.879999999999s)]
*  because the guy that I'm referencing, [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4281.959999999999s)]
*  he didn't make those decisions. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4283.639999999999s)]
*  He's been trained to do that. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4285.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4287.48s)]
*  Someone else has to make that decision. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4288.32s)]
*  I just don't think he's supposed to show people that video. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4289.28s)]

*  I haven't shut the fuck up about it since it happened. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4293.24s)]
*  That was like four years ago, five years ago. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4295.2s)]
*  I was going, I just couldn't believe it. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4297.16s)]

*  It's fucking nuts. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4300.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's so many of those videos now. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4301.2s)]
*  You can see so much war footage now. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4302.84s)]
*  How do you see all this stuff? [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4305.16s)]
*  I remember a long time ago, [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4306.6s)]
*  they showed you two girls, one cup. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4307.44s)]
*  And yours was red bed. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4309.2s)]
*  Your reaction was like, man, this is nothing. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4311.32s)]
*  I've seen, you know, and then the, what you referenced, [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4313.16s)]
*  we all as fans go, what is he talking about? [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4316.08s)]
*  And then we find that stuff, we're going, holy shit. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4318.92s)]
*  Like, but like, what is the, [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4320.88s)]
*  I don't even know what the dark web is. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4323.16s)]
*  Well, you don't have to go, I don't do that. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4325.08s)]
*  But just on Instagram alone, every day. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4326.96s)]
*  Yeah, Instagram is bananas now. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4330.84s)]
*  But back then you knew where stuff was. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4332.36s)]
*  Oh, you, US air strikes. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4334.92s)]
*  Okay, hold on a second. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4337.16s)]
*  US air strikes killed at least 22,000 civilians [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4338.12s)]
*  since 9-11. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4341.72s)]
*  So what is the, that's the number of people that were killed. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4342.8s)]
*  But like, what's the percentage? [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4346.28s)]
*  Cause there was a crazy percentage of casualties [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4348.68s)]
*  that were not, you know, they're just civilians. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4352.28s)]
*  Oh no. Right, right. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4355.92s)]
*  Right, but I'm saying, what is the percentage? [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4357.0s)]
*  There was a percentage number, something nuts, [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4358.68s)]
*  like over 80% civilian deaths. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4361.56s)]
*  You think it'd be like 400, right? [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4364.04s)]
*  You go, oops, 400, not oops, 22,000. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4365.56s)]
*  The deadliest year was during Trump, 2017, [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4369.2s)]
*  when at least 4,931 civilians were likely killed. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4372.08s)]
*  The vast majority in coalition bombings of Iraq and Syria. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4376.4800000000005s)]
*  However, the, going by maximum estimates, [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4380.88s)]
*  2017 emerges as the worst year for civilians [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4383.44s)]
*  with up to 19,623 killed, [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4386.759999999999s)]
*  almost all in the bombing campaign against ISIS. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4390.4s)]
*  Death toll from US air strikes, [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4395.24s)]
*  387,000 civilians who are believed to have been killed [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4397.5599999999995s)]
*  by all parties during the war on terror. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4402.12s)]
*  Wow. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4405.5199999999995s)]
*  I take it back. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4406.599999999999s)]
*  I get, I get why the aliens go, [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4407.759999999999s)]
*  oh, I get why he likes the guy that dunks. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4409.879999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4412.28s)]
*  That guy didn't, way better than this. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4413.4s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, unfortunately, [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4416.16s)]
*  no one can imagine a world without that stuff. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4417.88s)]
*  That's what's crazy. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4420.0s)]
*  It's if you, if you said to people, [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4421.24s)]
*  like what are the odds there'll be no war in five years? [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4422.8s)]
*  Everyone's gonna say fucking zero. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4424.88s)]
*  Okay, here it is. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4426.44s)]
*  Suggest that civilians make up between 7.27% and 15.47% [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4427.4s)]
*  of the deaths in US drone strikes in Pakistan. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4433.679999999999s)]
*  Hmm. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4436.679999999999s)]
*  This doesn't include, it's just those three places. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4437.5199999999995s)]
*  It doesn't include Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4439.2s)]
*  Hmm, I've heard it way skewed in the other direction. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4442.12s)]
*  Sure, I'm also under the assumption [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4445.36s)]
*  that this data isn't gonna be most prevalent in a search. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4448.0s)]
*  Right, but it seems like there's gotta be somebody [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4452.24s)]
*  who compiled that. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4454.639999999999s)]
*  I'm looking, but I still like getting lost [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4456.5199999999995s)]
*  in different websites that are old, [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4459.24s)]
*  2014 when people were talking about this a lot more. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4462.0s)]
*  And there's nothing just like saying the number [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4465.92s)]
*  right up front. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4470.4800000000005s)]
*  Hmm. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4471.32s)]
*  It's so, it's a crazy way to kill people. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4473.24s)]
*  It really is. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4477.28s)]
*  It's just, I mean, and ultimately we're probably [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4478.12s)]
*  gonna look at this the way we look at cannonballs. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4482.08s)]
*  You know, like cannonballs now are ridiculous. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4485.36s)]
*  Because we have missiles. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4488.68s)]
*  Why would you use a cannonball when I could just. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4489.64s)]
*  Can a ball wreck in through there? [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4491.16s)]
*  We have hypersonic missiles. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4492.08s)]
*  Hypersonic missiles are a real thing [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4493.72s)]
*  that human beings are created. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4495.240000000001s)]
*  They can change direction in the air. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4496.360000000001s)]
*  That's amazing. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4498.400000000001s)]
*  You can't figure out where the fuck they're going, [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4499.240000000001s)]
*  and by the time you do, they've already hit. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4501.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4503.2s)]
*  They go faster than the speed of sound. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4504.04s)]
*  Imagine a cannonball coming at you, [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4505.400000000001s)]
*  you go, oh, he's still using this? [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4506.72s)]
*  What is this? [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4508.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, so Murphy misfired and claimed [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4509.280000000001s)]
*  that eight out of 10 US drones missed their target. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4511.64s)]
*  Eight out of 10? [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4514.08s)]
*  I'm just saying that this is not the correct quote. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4514.92s)]
*  I mean, he fucked up by saying that. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4517.240000000001s)]
*  That's not accurate. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4519.12s)]
*  Oh, he just made a mistake. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4520.04s)]
*  Well, I'm glad they made it the headline, you know. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4520.88s)]
*  That's good for guys like me. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4523.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4526.52s)]
*  Either way, civilian death toll is calculated between. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4529.36s)]
*  So here's the other problem, too, that I've been told. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4532.64s)]
*  The problem is a lot of times when [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4535.56s)]
*  they get their death numbers, they're [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4537.2s)]
*  getting them from the ground. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4538.4800000000005s)]
*  They're getting them from people on the ground, [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4540.08s)]
*  whether it's ISIS or whoever, will exaggerate [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4543.0s)]
*  the amount of civilian deaths. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4546.0s)]
*  And so to make it look terrible, I mean, [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4548.16s)]
*  this is one of the reasons why Hamas does things in hospitals. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4550.88s)]
*  They just killed those guys in hospitals the other day. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4555.2s)]
*  So don't they live under the hospitals and stuff? [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4557.68s)]
*  Or that's where the base is? [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4559.64s)]
*  That's supposedly, I don't know enough to comment on that. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4560.8s)]
*  But I do know that that's what they've always said. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4563.32s)]
*  These guys operate in places where you can't bomb, [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4565.4400000000005s)]
*  like hospitals. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4568.400000000001s)]
*  And it turns out that was true in this case. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4569.2s)]
*  They killed these three guys in the hospital. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4570.88s)]
*  It was true over a five-month period in Afghanistan [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4572.68s)]
*  over a decade ago. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4576.400000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4577.68s)]
*  That eight out of 10. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4578.2s)]
*  Eight out of 10. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4579.2s)]
*  So what'd he get in trouble for saying it for? [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4581.16s)]
*  Because he was telling him, I don't know. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4583.12s)]
*  So what were you mad at Neil deGrasse Tyson for? [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4584.84s)]
*  I'm not mad at him. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4587.28s)]
*  I'm annoyed that a man of science would say things like, [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4588.12s)]
*  I like to get my information from smart people. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4593.44s)]
*  I like to think that a guy like him, who's very smart, [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4595.599999999999s)]
*  would say a smart thing that has no emotions linked to it. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4598.92s)]
*  You like to think, give me the facts. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4603.4s)]
*  Give me some stuff. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4605.28s)]
*  Which he does with a lot of things. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4606.12s)]
*  I used to really like him a lot. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4607.96s)]
*  And then you'll say something like, [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4610.5599999999995s)]
*  someone will say, well, like biologically, we [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4612.679999999999s)]
*  have a male and a female has chromosomes, [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4614.879999999999s)]
*  different chromosomes than a man. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4617.48s)]
*  You can look at the bones of a man and the bones of a female. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4618.799999999999s)]
*  And despite what's going on in your emotions [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4621.44s)]
*  and in your soul or spirit or whatever we want to label it, [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4624.5599999999995s)]
*  if we're just talking about the biological makeup of something, [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4627.48s)]
*  we can put them into two categories. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4630.719999999999s)]
*  Forget what your spirit is or your essence or how you feel. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4633.16s)]
*  If we're just looking at the meat and bones and cells [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4637.16s)]
*  and chromosomes of something, we can make biological arguments [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4640.92s)]
*  that there is a male and a female. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4645.16s)]
*  And then his argument goes, why do you care? [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4646.72s)]
*  What do you mean, why do I care? [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4649.44s)]
*  You're the man of science. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4651.88s)]
*  You should tell me that that should be your argument, [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4653.12s)]
*  is that if we're just looking at biology and not [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4656.4s)]
*  the spirit of someone or whatever, the feelings. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4658.5199999999995s)]
*  And instead his argument is, why do you care? [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4661.32s)]
*  I care. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4664.5599999999995s)]
*  I want you to tell people facts about things scientifically, [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4665.56s)]
*  not just go, what does it matter? [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4668.96s)]
*  You go, well, when you go on about the cosmos, [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4670.88s)]
*  people don't go, why do you care? [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4673.96s)]
*  We care. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4675.84s)]
*  That's not a good scientific argument for things. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4677.72s)]
*  And he's really jumped ship on science as a science guy. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4680.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, it's bizarre. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4684.4400000000005s)]
*  It's a mind virus. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4685.92s)]
*  And it's a mind virus that demands compliance. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4687.400000000001s)]
*  You have to comply to this ridiculous new ideology. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4691.72s)]
*  And a part of that, and this is where it really annoyed me [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4696.360000000001s)]
*  about his argument, was that that should apply somehow [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4699.4400000000005s)]
*  to sports. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4702.0s)]
*  And this is where this is going. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4703.8s)]
*  This is why it's so crazy. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4705.200000000001s)]
*  That is absolutely insane. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4706.84s)]
*  That's absolutely insane. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4708.84s)]
*  This is not saying that people shouldn't [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4710.0s)]
*  be allowed to be transgender. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4711.6s)]
*  Of course they should. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4712.72s)]
*  You're allowed to do whatever you want to do. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4713.6s)]
*  We can treat them nice, but then also have facts. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4714.240000000001s)]
*  But you cannot just say you're a woman [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4716.6s)]
*  and compete with women in sports. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4719.4800000000005s)]
*  And if you support that, scientifically, [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4721.08s)]
*  that is untenable. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4723.88s)]
*  Just scientifically, with the amount of data [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4726.08s)]
*  that we have about the differences between males [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4728.44s)]
*  and females in sports, the gap is so wide [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4731.4s)]
*  that you're going to have your outliers, [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4734.8s)]
*  your extraordinary females, and your weak men. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4736.4s)]
*  And they're going to cross over. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4738.76s)]
*  They love to use those examples. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4739.76s)]
*  Yeah, but those examples aren't valid. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4741.0s)]
*  Because if you take a biological male [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4742.6s)]
*  of normal athletic ability competing [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4746.2s)]
*  against a biological female who is elite of elite, [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4748.5199999999995s)]
*  the biological male has massive advantages, [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4752.12s)]
*  especially in things like combat sports. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4754.799999999999s)]
*  So they just passed a thing allowing biological males [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4757.24s)]
*  to identify as females and box females. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4761.919999999999s)]
*  That's crazy to me. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4765.08s)]
*  And I don't know what parameters they have. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4766.08s)]
*  You can't just be making weight. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4769.679999999999s)]
*  Because if it's just making weight, like, holy shit, [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4772.04s)]
*  are you testing testosterone levels? [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4774.2s)]
*  Are you making sure? [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4776.44s)]
*  What are you doing? [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4778.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4779.92s)]
*  What are you doing? [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4780.28s)]
*  There's a reason it's separated. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4780.92s)]
*  It's so crazy to let them do this. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4782.96s)]
*  Because there are people that are legitimately transgender. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4785.84s)]
*  And again, should be able to do whatever they want to do. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4789.5599999999995s)]
*  But there's also people that are out of their fucking mind. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4791.76s)]
*  Be reasonable. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4794.88s)]
*  That's all it is. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4795.5599999999995s)]
*  And there's people that literally, [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4796.32s)]
*  if you allow them to pretend to be a woman and beat women up, [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4798.5599999999995s)]
*  they will do it. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4801.639999999999s)]
*  Yep. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4802.5599999999995s)]
*  Well, it's funny. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4803.04s)]
*  I use Brendan Schaub in the bit. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4803.76s)]
*  I'm doing on my special, The Last Cowboy in LA. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4806.16s)]
*  I have a bit where I talk about Fallon Fox. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4808.84s)]
*  Because I used to be one of these guys. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4812.8s)]
*  I'm a comedian. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4814.8s)]
*  I want everyone to laugh. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4815.5599999999995s)]
*  I want to be the clown. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4816.84s)]
*  People go, they say, I saw the clown. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4818.5599999999995s)]
*  He made me happy. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4820.0s)]
*  Going to work tomorrow happy. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4820.92s)]
*  So I used to be one of these guys that goes, I don't know. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4822.5199999999995s)]
*  Ask someone else. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4825.24s)]
*  That used to be me from Seattle going, hey, I don't know. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4826.599999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4830.12s)]
*  Can you believe they're letting a woman fight in UFC? [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4831.12s)]
*  She's a biological male who? [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4834.68s)]
*  It wasn't in the UFC. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4836.0s)]
*  It was in a smaller organization. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4836.84s)]
*  Then I say to myself, hey, I don't have no opinions. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4839.4400000000005s)]
*  But then you watch it. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4842.400000000001s)]
*  And it's like the one girl in the corner, I'm D'Amica. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4843.56s)]
*  And then they go, versus Fallon Fox. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4847.16s)]
*  And I was like, oh, maybe I have some opinions. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4850.12s)]
*  Wait, they're going to let them fight? [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4853.64s)]
*  That's when you start going, maybe I do have some. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4855.4400000000005s)]
*  And you saw the fight. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4857.4800000000005s)]
*  And I go, all right, I formed a few opinions [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4859.0s)]
*  about this subject. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4860.88s)]
*  It looked like domestic violence. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4861.8s)]
*  It was crazy. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4863.08s)]
*  And he's going, you like that? [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4863.72s)]
*  We don't like it. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4864.76s)]
*  And then you hear the voice. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4865.52s)]
*  What the fuck? [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4866.68s)]
*  But you can't watch that and then still be a tepid guy [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4867.88s)]
*  who's like, oh, I don't really have an opinion on this. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4871.08s)]
*  Let them do what they want. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4874.280000000001s)]
*  Well, back then, Neil deGrasse Tyson [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4875.6s)]
*  wasn't chiming in like this. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4877.8s)]
*  Ever. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4878.92s)]
*  No. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4879.400000000001s)]
*  So he got caught up in that same silly mind virus. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4879.92s)]
*  Look, it doesn't mean you're not a compassionate person that [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4885.0s)]
*  recognizes that there's a whole wide variety of human beings [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4887.92s)]
*  that feel different than you. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4891.320000000001s)]
*  And we should be open minded to that, for sure. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4893.56s)]
*  But you should also protect women. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4895.52s)]
*  You should protect women's sports [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4897.240000000001s)]
*  and protect women that are forced to, in high school, [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4898.64s)]
*  in college, and even in some professional sports, [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4903.160000000001s)]
*  forced to compete against people that have [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4906.360000000001s)]
*  significant physical advantages. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4908.280000000001s)]
*  And I bet a lot of those people were out of their fucking minds. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=4910.72s)]

*  I think it was, right? [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5216.2s)]
*  Didn't it start off as a 4chan troll? [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5217.4s)]

*  OK. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5339.92s)]
*  That's when they add the LPGA into the headline. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5340.92s)]
*  It makes more news than when you say NNXT or whatever. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5343.16s)]
*  That's why you shouldn't believe everything [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5345.6s)]

*  All real. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5351.4400000000005s)]

*  and I'm going, is that true? [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5355.04s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5356.4800000000005s)]
*  That's where I'm at. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5356.96s)]
*  It always happens. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5357.68s)]
*  So is this the first transgender woman to win Golf Tour? [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5358.400000000001s)]
*  I believe so. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5363.64s)]
*  To win an event, yeah. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5364.88s)]
*  And then what happens, though, by winning this event, [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5366.360000000001s)]
*  she earns a opportunity to play more, which could [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5369.240000000001s)]
*  lead to a LPGA qualifying spot. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5373.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5376.64s)]

*  There you go. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5388.8s)]
*  The claim also is that, after having all of the surgeries [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5390.080000000001s)]
*  and stuff, lost 15 miles an hour on clubhead speed, which is... [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5393.280000000001s)]
*  A lot. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5400.080000000001s)]

*  Yeah, so the average for a man, it was saying, [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5408.120000000001s)]
*  is about 115 on the PGA Tour, and the average LPGA is about 95. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5411.44s)]
*  And it doesn't say where they were before or after. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5416.44s)]
*  Also, is that what he said, or was that what was measured? [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5418.44s)]

*  Women kickers, there's such a vast difference [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5462.84s)]
*  between a woman kicker and a man kicker. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5466.72s)]
*  It's kind of stunning. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5468.5199999999995s)]
*  I wonder if a lot of that has to do with the shape of the hips. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5471.2s)]
*  Because if you get a woman who is 135 pounds and ever hit a bag, [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5474.84s)]
*  and then you have a man who's 135 pounds and hit the bag, [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5482.96s)]
*  the difference is so stark. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5486.12s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5487.5199999999995s)]
*  You're like, this is crazy because your legs are [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5488.16s)]
*  carrying you around all day long. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5490.08s)]
*  But there's a lot of other shit going on. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5491.719999999999s)]
*  There's tendon strength. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5493.36s)]
*  There's bone density. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5494.44s)]
*  There's the shape of the hips, I'm sure, too. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5495.76s)]
*  But there's also something that happens to the human body [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5498.36s)]
*  when it evolves, or it develops rather, with testosterone. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5502.759999999999s)]
*  You're going to be stronger forever. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5507.44s)]
*  You're never going to go back to what [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5510.799999999999s)]
*  it would be like if you had been born a woman. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5512.4s)]
*  It's like taking steroids for 20 years, [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5515.4s)]
*  hardcore, that literally turn you into a guy. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5518.04s)]
*  And be like, I have no advantage. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5520.799999999999s)]
*  I'm done. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5522.04s)]
*  I'm like you. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5522.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm not taking steroids anymore. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5522.799999999999s)]
*  We're the same. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5523.88s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5524.5199999999995s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5524.84s)]
*  You were cheating your whole life. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5525.4s)]
*  If you got caught doing that in the UFC, you're fucking banned. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5527.2s)]
*  You're banned for two years. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5531.08s)]
*  And if you get caught again, I think you're banned for six years. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5532.48s)]
*  It's something wild like that. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5535.04s)]
*  So if you're just taking testosterone your whole life, [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5536.92s)]
*  your whole life, and all these other women are just fucking [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5540.76s)]
*  being normal and cheerleading and going to parties, [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5544.24s)]
*  you're competing against them, that's insane. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5547.4s)]
*  I know a girl who is a professional foosball player, [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5549.84s)]
*  Kelsey Cook, the comedian, Chad Daniels' girlfriend. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5552.2s)]
*  I don't know why I said that. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5555.08s)]
*  Anyways, I love them. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5556.36s)]
*  And she's talking about foosball. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5557.5199999999995s)]
*  I find it interesting because I don't know anything about foosball. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5560.4s)]
*  And I go, oh, this is probably one of those sports where the men can play [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5563.16s)]
*  with the women because it's foosball. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5565.5599999999995s)]
*  And she goes, I hate that I'm admitting this to you. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5567.8s)]
*  Because she knows I'm a man's guy. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5570.08s)]
*  And she goes, men have an advantage in foosball. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5573.599999999999s)]
*  And I go, even foosball? [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5576.32s)]
*  And she goes, yes, because it's like that torque of a man's arm [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5578.2s)]
*  versus a woman's arm. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5582.72s)]
*  Even the arm. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5583.96s)]
*  She goes, the men can hit it harder, the spin rate. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5586.0s)]
*  So even something as what we might think is a frivolous kind of thing [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5589.24s)]
*  like foosball, even that, there is just so much of a difference. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5593.08s)]
*  How about chess? [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5597.04s)]
*  Men have an advantage in chess. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5599.16s)]
*  Really? [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5600.84s)]
*  I did not know that. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5601.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5602.48s)]
*  How? [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5603.56s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5604.28s)]
*  Yeah, that's interesting. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5604.96s)]
*  But for whatever reason, maybe it's more men do it. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5606.04s)]
*  I don't know what it is. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5608.96s)]
*  Maybe it's the mind, the way the mind works. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5609.96s)]
*  It's different, the competitive mind. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5611.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5613.52s)]
*  I don't know if it's actually showing it's coming from a table. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5614.64s)]
*  Men have a large and consistent advantage over women [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5617.04s)]
*  in spatial ability, of which chess relies to a large extent. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5619.8s)]
*  And this is a difference in average, not just at the high end. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5624.360000000001s)]
*  The male advantage is present pre-puberty, [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5627.400000000001s)]
*  is present across cultures and time. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5631.08s)]
*  Another one is pool. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5634.6s)]
*  The best professional female pool players [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5636.320000000001s)]
*  never win male tour events. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5639.04s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5640.8s)]
*  They're allowed to enter them. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5641.6s)]
*  Men can't enter women's events. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5642.8s)]
*  There's certain major events that women enter all the time, [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5645.36s)]
*  but they never win them. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5648.599999999999s)]
*  Well, a smart man would say, why do you care? [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5649.719999999999s)]
*  Why do you care who's better? [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5653.32s)]
*  Because it's a statistic, and it's a sport I care about. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5654.44s)]
*  It's important. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5656.36s)]
*  I think it's interesting. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5656.759999999999s)]
*  Look, there's a lot of women that are really good, [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5658.04s)]
*  and they can beat a lot of men. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5660.28s)]
*  They beat a lot of men. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5661.759999999999s)]
*  But when they get to the very top, [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5662.799999999999s)]
*  like when you're playing through a pool bracket, [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5664.96s)]
*  say if there's 100 or so professionals that [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5667.92s)]
*  are in this tournament, they're playing in this double elimination [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5670.719999999999s)]
*  bracket. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5673.2s)]
*  So you lose once, go to the one lost side, you lose there, [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5673.72s)]
*  you're out of the tournament. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5675.84s)]
*  So you running against killer after killer, [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5677.08s)]
*  because there's 100 professionals there. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5679.639999999999s)]
*  And there's a high likelihood that someone [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5681.36s)]
*  gets a bunch of good rolls, you scratch on the break, [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5683.44s)]
*  a bunch of things happen, person runs out a lot, [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5685.679999999999s)]
*  and you lose seven nothing to some person, [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5688.24s)]
*  and that person happens to be a chick. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5693.44s)]
*  That's totally possible. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5695.36s)]
*  You could lose to a woman. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5696.599999999999s)]
*  But over the course of the tournament, [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5697.88s)]
*  that luck will wear out, and the elite male players [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5701.04s)]
*  will beat the elite female player. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5704.28s)]
*  I didn't know you were so into pool. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5706.08s)]
*  Where do you play pool? [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5707.4s)]
*  Like you personally. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5708.48s)]
*  Oh, you play here. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5709.64s)]
*  But also, I'll go places where I can play. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5710.64s)]
*  I played Amstam Billiards when I'm in New York City. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5713.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'll go to pool halls. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5715.56s)]
*  Yeah, that's such a bar game. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5717.72s)]
*  It is a bar game, but the type I play [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5720.8s)]
*  is like tournament professional style pool. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5723.88s)]
*  It's a different kind of pool. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5728.16s)]
*  It's not like eight ball. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5729.36s)]
*  I play mostly nine ball and 10 ball, and it's a rotation game. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5730.6s)]
*  I have not, but it looks very difficult. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5735.08s)]
*  It's fucking huge. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5737.04s)]
*  That table's gigantic, and the balls are little, [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5737.92s)]
*  and the holes are little. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5740.0s)]
*  And it's confusing. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5740.92s)]
*  Yeah, I don't understand it. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5742.04s)]
*  We were in Thailand. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5743.320000000001s)]
*  We were like, let's play pool. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5743.96s)]
*  We walked over there. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5744.76s)]
*  We were like, this is a different table here. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5745.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I don't even know what to do. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5747.0s)]
*  I don't even know how it works. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5748.320000000001s)]
*  I like watching it, though. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5749.84s)]
*  It's cool when they're really good at it, [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5751.120000000001s)]
*  because I know how hard it must be to be doing that. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5752.88s)]
*  They used to make a shit ton of money, [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5755.0s)]
*  but there was one guy over there that [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5757.56s)]
*  was a big top guy that got busted fixing a game. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5759.0s)]
*  They caught him on camera. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5763.0s)]
*  They got a hidden camera. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5764.68s)]
*  See if you can find that story, because he was like a top dog. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5766.88s)]
*  Put the ball in with his hand? [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5770.28s)]
*  Well, you just miss. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5771.48s)]
*  Oh, I see. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5772.52s)]
*  Yeah, it's not hard to do at all. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5773.04s)]
*  Wait, what do you mean? [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5774.32s)]
*  So that doesn't. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5774.88s)]
*  You can fix a pool match. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5775.4s)]
*  So say if I'm a gangster, and you're a killer pool player, [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5776.52s)]
*  and you're going to play some guy. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5781.28s)]
*  And I'll say, Jeff Die, I got a proposition for you. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5782.8s)]
*  I'm going to give you $100,000 to blow this game. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5785.88s)]
*  So you're the favorite in the game. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5789.24s)]
*  So maybe there's a lot of people gambling. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5790.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5793.24s)]
*  I'd be good at losing. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5793.64s)]
*  Yeah, you lose on purpose. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5794.4400000000005s)]
*  That's how it works. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5795.84s)]
*  You can lose on purpose. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5796.72s)]
*  So is this the story, or is this the match? [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5798.12s)]
*  I thought that was the way he was fixing it to win. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5799.96s)]
*  Dennis Taylor is caught cheating. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5802.0s)]
*  No, it's not him. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5804.08s)]
*  What did he do? [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5805.24s)]
*  I don't understand the game. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5806.96s)]
*  I don't know how he could do this. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5808.72s)]
*  Sharp dressed guy. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5810.04s)]
*  Look at these guys. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5811.0s)]
*  I wonder how he got caught cheating. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5811.88s)]
*  A million views, I figured it was it. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5813.24s)]
*  Putting an extra red ball on the table. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5815.36s)]
*  He just literally added a ball. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5818.839999999999s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5820.88s)]
*  He climbs on the table and still misses. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5821.679999999999s)]
*  You could do that. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5823.48s)]
*  Are you allowed to climb on the table? [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5823.88s)]
*  Look at this guy. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5825.28s)]
*  And he touched the mess. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5826.48s)]
*  Look at his goofy glasses. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5827.639999999999s)]
*  Are you allowed to climb on the table? [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5828.639999999999s)]
*  This might have been a celebrity match, I feel like. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5830.5199999999995s)]
*  Oh, it looks like. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5832.32s)]
*  They're all laughing. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5833.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5834.4s)]
*  No, it's not that. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5835.12s)]
*  It was like a bribery scheme. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5836.16s)]
*  He was caught fixing snooker games, [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5838.5199999999995s)]
*  and it became a criminal investigation. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5840.92s)]
*  Because there's so many people that gamble on snooker. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5843.36s)]
*  Sure. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5846.48s)]
*  10 people charged, that kind of thing? [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5846.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's probably it. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5848.36s)]
*  Match fixing scandal. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5849.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5850.4s)]
*  How long ago is this? [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5851.719999999999s)]
*  Read this last year. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5852.679999999999s)]
*  Oh, no, this is a new one. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5853.719999999999s)]
*  10 Chinese players. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5856.08s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5857.28s)]
*  Listen, pool players are dirty. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5858.679999999999s)]
*  They're dirty people. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5860.5199999999995s)]
*  Not all of them, but a lot of them. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5861.599999999999s)]
*  It's a game where dudes will dump you. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5864.04s)]
*  You have to have a really good relationship [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5866.88s)]
*  with your backers, and you've got [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5868.799999999999s)]
*  to spread money around if you win. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5870.799999999999s)]
*  You've got to make sure that people don't dump on you. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5872.8s)]
*  Because if there's a lot of gambling involved, [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5875.0s)]
*  like say if you and I were in a match, [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5877.0s)]
*  and we're two top players, and you've [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5878.72s)]
*  got a bunch of people that are coming from fucking Cincinnati [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5881.6s)]
*  and Kansas City and Chicago, they're [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5884.28s)]
*  coming to watch this match, and there might be a half [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5886.72s)]
*  a million dollars on the side. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5889.6s)]
*  Sure. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5891.6s)]
*  It might be more. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5892.08s)]
*  Like, it happens all the time with top players. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5892.96s)]
*  John Higgins, that's the guy. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5894.88s)]
*  Banned for six months, but cleared of match fixing. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5896.400000000001s)]
*  Not guilty. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5899.360000000001s)]
*  Tough to prove, maybe. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5901.36s)]
*  Isn't it weird that gambling is so prevalent in sports now? [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5903.799999999999s)]
*  What did he say, though? [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5906.36s)]
*  He said something. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5907.36s)]
*  Like, they were talking to him about fixing the game. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5908.24s)]
*  There was a recording, right? [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5910.44s)]
*  I'll look into this. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5912.839999999999s)]
*  He was also a very beloved player. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5915.08s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5918.32s)]
*  But the point is that, like, that can- [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5919.08s)]
*  The cover reporter discussed the possibility [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5921.679999999999s)]
*  of throwing frames? [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5924.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5926.24s)]
*  OK. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5927.24s)]
*  Mooney discussed the possibility of throwing frames, [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5927.88s)]
*  which is like fixing a game, like missing, [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5930.2s)]
*  with the undercover reporter. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5932.84s)]
*  The News of the World's Mazer Mahmood for weeks [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5934.5199999999995s)]
*  before the trip to Keefe. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5940.24s)]
*  Unbeknownst to Higgins, Mooney had taken him to Keefe [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5941.76s)]
*  specifically to discuss the matter of throwing frames, [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5944.76s)]
*  but had not raised the possibility of the subject [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5947.5599999999995s)]
*  might come up until minutes before the meeting started. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5949.639999999999s)]
*  Mills said he was unimpressed by Mooney as a witness [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5953.0s)]
*  and found much of his account highly implausible. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5955.84s)]
*  Hm. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5958.8s)]
*  Ruling that he should be banned from the sport for life. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5959.92s)]
*  Woo. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5963.4400000000005s)]
*  His lawyer said in a statement, Mr. Mooney bitterly [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5965.200000000001s)]
*  regrets being caught up in the News of the World's entrapment [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5967.240000000001s)]

*  that sting had on Snooker and Mr. Higgins in particular. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5973.8s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5978.280000000001s)]
*  It is fascinating. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5980.4400000000005s)]
*  There were some lies. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5981.76s)]
*  How latent gambling is now. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5982.56s)]
*  Where it's like, I'm not an old man or anything, [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5986.6s)]
*  but they used to act like nobody was gambling on football [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5989.92s)]
*  or basketball. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5993.52s)]

*  I mean, it's pretty like, it's like weed, I guess. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=5999.92s)]
*  Like the way the government's like, we're just [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6002.92s)]

*  I know people who are gambling addicts. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6015.24s)]
*  It scares the shit out of me. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6017.0s)]
*  But I think it should be legal, just like I think weed should [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6018.48s)]
*  be legal and I think alcohol should be legal. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6021.28s)]
*  I think you should be able to be responsible [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6022.92s)]
*  with your own decisions and make your own choices [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6024.88s)]

*  The problem is not gambling. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6028.28s)]
*  The problem is gambling addicts. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6030.2s)]
*  Because I can go and gamble, and I'm [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6032.48s)]
*  smart about knowing that this is very addictive. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6035.04s)]
*  And I do it, and I'll get the fuck out of here. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6037.76s)]

*  The fucking shoe thing is so stupid. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6284.08s)]
*  I can't believe they're still doing that. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6286.5599999999995s)]
*  One dickhead tries to blow his shoes up. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6287.639999999999s)]
*  One guy. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6290.44s)]
*  I was laughing about, this is an old current event, [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6293.16s)]
*  but when it was a new thing [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6295.48s)]
*  that we had to take our shoes off for TSA, [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6297.16s)]
*  like after 9-11, George Bush is like, [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6298.679999999999s)]
*  even I will be going through TSA checkpoints [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6300.96s)]
*  for Air Force One. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6303.88s)]
*  I was like, no, not you. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6305.52s)]
*  Fucking liar. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6307.04s)]
*  We should be able to trust you. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6307.88s)]
*  That's a lie. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6308.84s)]
*  Yeah, he was going, even me. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6309.68s)]

*  Imagine that you have to have the president checked [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6315.52s)]
*  because he might be a terrorist secretly. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6319.0s)]
*  That's just the visual of it was ridiculous. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6320.88s)]
*  Yeah, do you see the ones that they scan your whole body [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6324.08s)]

*  I don't think they use them anymore. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6333.32s)]
*  How do I get the job of just being there? [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6334.16s)]
*  Just wanna see the people. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6336.24s)]
*  Yeah, see all these. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6337.08s)]
*  If you go to, see if you can find that [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6337.92s)]
*  because they show the images [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6341.0s)]
*  of what it looks like for a human. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6342.32s)]

*  Oh wow. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6345.24s)]
*  How crazy is that? [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6346.08s)]
*  I got to see a Bill Burbit in real life. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6347.04s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6349.4s)]
*  Oh yeah, that is weird. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6350.96s)]
*  See the man's dick. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6352.08s)]
*  Yeah, that's me actually. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6352.92s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6353.74s)]
*  Yeah, that's weird. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6354.58s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6355.42s)]
*  So I was at LAX, this is years ago, [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6356.26s)]
*  and it's when the big scan, [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6359.12s)]
*  the whoop thing went around your body. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6360.599999999999s)]
*  I see Bill and he's at TSA. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6364.0s)]
*  I've known him for, I've known of him [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6366.5199999999995s)]
*  and he's known of me since 2008 [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6368.14s)]
*  because he played Giggles Comic Club in Seattle [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6370.08s)]
*  when I was a young comic. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6371.88s)]
*  I go, hey Bill, and he's like, hey Jeff. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6373.84s)]
*  And he's clearly irritable. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6375.2s)]
*  And he's just waiting at the side [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6377.64s)]
*  and I'm going through the thing [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6379.32s)]
*  and a guy comes over to him and he goes, [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6380.16s)]
*  hey, if I could just get you to stand over here [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6381.08s)]
*  next to the machine [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6383.04s)]
*  because he was refusing the big scan around thing. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6383.86s)]
*  And he's like, yeah, I know you don't wanna do the machine [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6387.56s)]
*  but just stand. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6389.9s)]
*  He goes, what kind of defeats the purpose [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6390.74s)]
*  to go stand by the fucking machine? [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6392.24s)]
*  He's like, that's the machine I don't wanna be [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6394.4s)]
*  and now you want me to stand by it? [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6396.0s)]
*  But I got to watch the whole thing happen. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6397.28s)]
*  I'm kinda like, this is like a Bill Burr bit in real life. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6398.719999999999s)]
*  Getting to watch it happen. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6402.719999999999s)]
*  I'm sure he's gonna talk about this on stage. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6403.8s)]
*  It was kinda fun to just kinda see a bit formulate. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6405.92s)]
*  Yeah, Ari used to do that too. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6409.48s)]
*  He made them all check them down. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6412.04s)]
*  He refused it? [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6413.44s)]
*  Yeah, he would not go through the machine. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6414.28s)]
*  I mean, I don't think it's great for you. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6417.12s)]
*  It's not, it can't be. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6418.8s)]
*  And we fly all the time. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6420.4s)]
*  It can't be good for you, right? [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6421.76s)]
*  If you're doing it three or four times a week. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6423.12s)]
*  I think the radio one is different. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6425.96s)]
*  The one they do now is not an X-ray. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6427.6s)]
*  I don't know what it used to be. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6430.4400000000005s)]
*  What did it used to be? [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6433.2s)]
*  Like what was the original ones? [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6434.24s)]
*  Metal. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6435.96s)]
*  The thing about those kind of things is [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6436.8s)]
*  they really don't know how bad they are for you [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6438.5s)]
*  until it's too late. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6441.2s)]
*  Sure. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6442.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah, we won't know. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6443.2s)]
*  Until 10 years down the line, [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6444.02s)]

*  Well, cigarettes was like, [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6446.320000000001s)]
*  doctors would be like, oh, it calms your nerves. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6447.96s)]
*  What's a millimeter wave? [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6449.68s)]
*  I've never really heard. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6450.76s)]

*  Privacy concerns. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6461.22s)]

*  No, yeah, the women used to run it. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6553.26s)]
*  So back then, when you were an x-ray technician, [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6555.8s)]
*  you would have to test the x-ray [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6559.8s)]
*  to make sure it's calibrated, [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6561.8s)]
*  make sure it's working right. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6563.0s)]
*  So the way they would do it, [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6564.16s)]
*  they would x-ray their own hand. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6565.0s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6566.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, with no. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6567.599999999999s)]
*  Over time. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6568.919999999999s)]
*  They did it a lot. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6569.759999999999s)]
*  They did it a lot. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6571.839999999999s)]
*  So their fingernails were falling off. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6573.0s)]
*  Like, look at that. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6575.0s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6575.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah, hand of an x-ray technician [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6576.96s)]
*  at the Royal London Hospital [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6579.12s)]
*  showing damage of radiation exposure. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6580.5199999999995s)]
*  So this is from 1900. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6582.4s)]
*  Why does it say, oh, I see. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6584.679999999999s)]
*  Bro, they didn't know any better. [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6586.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6587.32s)]

*  Something. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6593.32s)]
*  Those ladies that used to put lume [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6594.16s)]
*  on watches. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6597.44s)]
*  No. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6600.28s)]
*  When you. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6601.12s)]
*  Cyanide is used for that, right? [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6602.16s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6603.799999999999s)]
*  It's radioactive. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6604.799999999999s)]
*  I think it's radium, right? [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6606.5199999999995s)]
*  No, they're called the radium girls. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6609.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6610.5599999999995s)]
*  They sound hot. [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6611.4s)]
*  They use it in tubes. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6612.919999999999s)]
*  So what happened was these women, [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6614.44s)]
*  they would lick their paintbrush [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6616.4s)]
*  because you lick your paintbrush sometimes. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6619.96s)]
*  And they would lick their paintbrush [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6621.639999999999s)]
*  to try to form a better tip so they could do it better. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6623.08s)]
*  And every time they did it, [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6626.44s)]
*  they got radium in their mouth. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6628.0s)]
*  God. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6630.16s)]
*  And they would get horrible cancers [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6631.0s)]
*  and they're fucking, you know, a lot of them died. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6632.679999999999s)]
*  Like see that image of that lady [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6635.12s)]
*  where her jaw was rotted off. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6636.5199999999995s)]

*  This from. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6640.48s)]
*  Girls who licked radioactive paint. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6641.32s)]
*  You just remind me of the funniest thing [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6642.919999999999s)]
*  I've ever seen on morning television. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6644.44s)]

*  Lady goes, she goes, isn't it true that glass blowing [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6698.76s)]
*  is like really hard on your lungs [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6701.68s)]
*  and it's hard on your vision and it's very dangerous. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6703.080000000001s)]
*  It takes years off of your life. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6705.0s)]

*  but to die a little sooner to put my art into the world [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6708.320000000001s)]
*  is worth it. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6712.84s)]
*  I was like, wow, that's beautiful, right? [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6714.200000000001s)]

*  And then she goes, what do you make? [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6717.200000000001s)]
*  He's like, mostly bongs and dildos. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6718.240000000001s)]
*  And she's like, back to you in the studio. [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6721.96s)]

*  Like he went from being profound to just dropping. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6725.360000000001s)]
*  His art form is bongs and dildos. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6729.200000000001s)]
*  But just the idea of saying that to die sooner, [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6731.64s)]
*  that's hilarious. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6735.6s)]
*  Yeah, it was a beautiful one, two punch of like, [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6736.4400000000005s)]
*  yeah, just have my art in the world. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6738.4800000000005s)]
*  Bongs and dildos. [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6740.400000000001s)]
*  That's like a dude from a movie. [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6742.04s)]
*  Like he probably heard something like that in a movie. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6746.4s)]
*  It's like super profound. [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6748.96s)]
*  I was thinking of these poor girls, they're going, yeah, [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6750.28s)]
*  but you know, I painted a lot of clocks. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6751.68s)]
*  Yeah, no one told them either. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6754.08s)]
*  They'll link in the thing. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6755.56s)]
*  And I think that radium, that loom on clocks and watches, [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6756.4s)]
*  it was like, nobody had ever done that before. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6760.28s)]
*  Was it like glow in the dark or something? [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6761.92s)]
*  Or was it some sort of? Yeah, it glows in the dark. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6763.28s)]
*  They do it now in glass tubes. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6764.76s)]
*  So like if you get a tactical watch, [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6767.08s)]
*  that's like, a good example is Marathon. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6769.44s)]
*  Marathon makes these like military grade tactical watches [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6772.08s)]
*  that are like super durable [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6776.16s)]
*  and they have radium tubes in it. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6778.04s)]
*  So no matter what time of night it is, pitch blackness. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6779.839999999999s)]
*  You look down at that watch [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6782.799999999999s)]
*  and it doesn't have to be glowing in the dark. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6784.2s)]
*  It just glows. Cool. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6786.5599999999995s)]
*  It's lit up. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6788.04s)]
*  So like loom on a regular watch, [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6789.16s)]
*  like when it has a loom painted into it, [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6791.759999999999s)]
*  what happens is when you're in the sunlight [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6794.24s)]
*  and in the flashlights and in studio lighting [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6796.48s)]
*  and whatever, fluorescent lighting, [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6800.32s)]
*  it charges that paint. [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6802.16s)]
*  And so then when you go in the dark, then it glows. [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6804.5199999999995s)]
*  And it'll glow for like a little while, [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6806.4s)]
*  like a few hours maybe. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6807.5599999999995s)]
*  This shit never goes out. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6809.44s)]
*  But it's these little glass tubes. [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6810.919999999999s)]
*  So you can find like a Marathon watch. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6813.36s)]
*  I think it's radium. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6816.24s)]
*  I think it's that same radioactive shit. [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6817.599999999999s)]
*  It's just in a gas form that's encased in a tube. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6819.879999999999s)]
*  And I think it has a half life of 20 years. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6823.12s)]
*  So I think it glows for 20 years on your wrist. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6827.28s)]
*  It's pretty sweet. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6829.24s)]
*  No wonder it's jacking up the chins and noses and stuff. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6830.08s)]
*  Oh dude, it has to wreak havoc [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6833.16s)]
*  if you're licking that thing every day. [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6835.92s)]
*  Like that is just some fucking nuclear space dust. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6838.04s)]
*  One of the articles I was just reading about it [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6840.5599999999995s)]
*  said that they liked it so much, [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6841.88s)]
*  they would also be painting it on their face, fingernails. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6843.04s)]
*  Oh gosh. God damn it. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6845.2s)]
*  Yeah, they're like, I get free radium at work. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6847.36s)]
*  I don't do my makeup anymore [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6850.0s)]
*  and their fucking eyes right over their head. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6851.5199999999995s)]
*  Isn't it funny? [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6853.28s)]
*  I have so much radium, I made it eyeliner. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6854.12s)]
*  Show me a Marathon watch. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6856.04s)]
*  I was just trying to find it. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6857.76s)]
*  I couldn't find the glasses. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6859.36s)]
*  Marathon Divers Watch Loom. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6860.2s)]
*  Just write divers watch. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6864.68s)]
*  You have a big watch I noticed last night. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6867.5199999999995s)]
*  This is just a digital watch. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6869.76s)]
*  So that's what it looks like. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6873.8s)]
*  And then we see it at nighttime, [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6875.0s)]
*  that's what it looks like. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6876.6s)]
*  So it's always lit. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6877.6s)]
*  It's pretty fucking dope actually. [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6878.64s)]
*  I don't think I've owned one, [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6880.88s)]
*  but I've seen that for sure. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6881.76s)]
*  I love those things. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6885.08s)]
*  I love watches. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6886.32s)]
*  And there's another company called Ball, B-A-L-L. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6887.16s)]
*  They make way cooler looking watches. [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6891.0s)]
*  The Marathon watch is tactical military style watch, [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6894.32s)]
*  but Ball watches, they make these killer dress watches. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6897.759999999999s)]
*  But that's all got the loom too. [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6901.2s)]
*  So that looks like that. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6903.839999999999s)]
*  That looks great. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6904.959999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah, and it's a dope watch. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6905.799999999999s)]
*  Look how cool that looks. [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6907.839999999999s)]
*  Ooh, and it's also radioactive. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6909.08s)]
*  But apparently it's completely, [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6912.2s)]
*  it's encased, you have no fear of it hurting you. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6915.08s)]
*  If it breaks, it just dissipates in the atmosphere. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6918.5199999999995s)]
*  If it breaks, you lick it a bunch. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6920.36s)]
*  Just sniff it, just sniff it and get superpowers. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6921.28s)]
*  Hey, my tongue's glowing. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6923.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I can see through walls. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6924.599999999999s)]
*  I know things now. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6926.2s)]
*  Free radio. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6927.44s)]
*  You were telling me you were a Bigfoot guy. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6928.4s)]
*  Big Bigfoot guy. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6929.92s)]
*  Tell me about this. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6930.76s)]
*  Here's the problem. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6931.599999999999s)]
*  When you grew up in an area, [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6932.44s)]
*  you're in the Pacific Northwest. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6934.92s)]
*  That's Bigfoot country. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6936.599999999999s)]
*  That is. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6937.599999999999s)]
*  I think that's the only reason I'm so into it. [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6938.44s)]
*  Also, here's the thing you gotta know [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6940.36s)]
*  about talking about me. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6941.599999999999s)]
*  It's not ever funny. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6942.68s)]
*  And it's just something I like so much [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6944.400000000001s)]
*  that it ends up me giving you the same arguments [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6946.92s)]
*  you've heard a billion times. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6948.8s)]
*  Oh, it's gigantopithecus, came over the Asian plain, [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6950.6s)]
*  it's a bipedal hominid. [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6953.12s)]
*  And then at the end, [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6956.8s)]
*  and everyone of my friends have experienced it. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6957.92s)]
*  Harlan Williams just experienced it [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6959.88s)]
*  when I was on his podcast. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6961.64s)]
*  Anytime I talk about Bigfoot, [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6962.8s)]
*  it ends up with me just going, [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6964.12s)]
*  please, Joe, can you just say it's maybe a possibility? [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6966.4800000000005s)]
*  Like that's what it always ends up being. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6969.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6971.64s)]
*  I remember you one time going, [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6973.4800000000005s)]
*  there's nothing out there. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6974.96s)]
*  Didn't you say that about Bigfoot? [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6976.92s)]
*  Hunters don't see it. [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6977.76s)]
*  That's why I don't believe in it. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6979.56s)]
*  Some hunters do. [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6980.76s)]
*  Not many. [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6982.160000000001s)]
*  People that see it are usually loggers, hunters, natives, [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6983.08s)]
*  people that are out in the woods. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6985.92s)]
*  There's another problem. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6987.52s)]
*  Another problem is dusk. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6988.52s)]
*  You see things at dusk or at dawn. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6990.4400000000005s)]
*  It's very confusing. [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6992.64s)]
*  Bears walk on two legs all the time. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6994.04s)]
*  I have personally watched bears walk on two legs. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=6996.320000000001s)]
*  If I didn't know any better [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7001.0s)]
*  and if it was a dark environment, like it was dusk, [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7002.68s)]
*  you know, you like barely can see, [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7006.68s)]
*  I would think it's Bigfoot. [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7008.4400000000005s)]
*  Right. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7009.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7010.320000000001s)]
*  But I do think Bigfoot existed. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7011.16s)]
*  There's some insane number of Native American words [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7013.84s)]
*  for Bigfoot. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7018.400000000001s)]
*  Sasquatch is just one of them. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7019.240000000001s)]
*  There's a bunch of them. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7021.0s)]
*  There's a bunch of Native American words [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7022.56s)]
*  for this one animal that's fake, [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7024.6s)]
*  but all the other words they have are for real animals. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7027.240000000001s)]
*  They don't have a bunch of dragons. [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7030.0s)]
*  They don't have like mythical creatures [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7031.8s)]
*  in Native American mythology, [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7033.4s)]
*  but they do have this one giant man thing [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7035.4s)]
*  that definitely existed. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7040.12s)]
*  At some point. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7041.72s)]
*  At 100% Gigantopithecus was a real animal. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7042.56s)]
*  It was eight to 10 feet tall, bipedal hominid. [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7046.96s)]
*  It was a huge gorilla looking primate [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7049.92s)]
*  that died off somewhere around 100,000 years ago, [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7053.08s)]
*  but they don't know really for sure. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7056.96s)]
*  100,000. [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7057.8s)]
*  Yeah, but they don't know for sure. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7058.68s)]
*  The thing about it is it's like, [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7060.84s)]
*  if you only find fossils from 100,000 years ago, [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7061.92s)]
*  you could assume that this animal at least lived then, [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7064.72s)]
*  but you don't know when it went extinct. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7070.04s)]
*  Right. [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7071.32s)]
*  You might find some new fossil like 10 years from now. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7072.16s)]
*  They might find some new site and wait a minute. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7074.84s)]
*  These are 20,000 years old, [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7077.4800000000005s)]
*  or these are 30,000 years old, [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7079.56s)]
*  or these are 50,000 years old, [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7081.2s)]
*  but either way, anatomically identical human beings [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7082.72s)]
*  have been around for 500,000 plus years, maybe even more. [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7086.2s)]
*  Or similar human beings. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7090.0s)]
*  So then we definitely interacted with them. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7091.32s)]
*  Or they were around when we were around. [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7094.2s)]
*  I think they're still around. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7096.16s)]
*  I think there's hundreds, maybe thousands of them. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7097.2s)]
*  That's what I believe. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7100.32s)]
*  I think they're in caves or something, or maybe it's... [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7101.96s)]
*  You know what the problem with that is? [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7105.44s)]
*  What? [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7106.5199999999995s)]
*  They're too big. [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7107.36s)]
*  The amount of food that they would need to eat, [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7108.799999999999s)]
*  you would have to be grazing all day long. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7111.5199999999995s)]
*  See, if you're Bigfoot. [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7113.679999999999s)]
*  Posted in the Journal of Zoology, [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7116.2s)]
*  if it's there, could it be a bear? [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7120.0s)]
*  They're saying it's American black bear. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7121.72s)]
*  Yeah, American black bear that stands up. [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7123.36s)]
*  But even little kids would know the difference [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7124.88s)]
*  between a monkey and a bear. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7127.16s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7128.639999999999s)]
*  First of all, let me tell you something. [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7129.599999999999s)]
*  If you're in the woods and you're in a heightened state [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7132.08s)]
*  because you're looking around, [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7135.2s)]
*  you don't know what's out there. [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7136.04s)]
*  It's all thick woods, it's weird. [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7136.86s)]
*  Woods are weird. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7138.72s)]
*  And you see something, you could trick your brain. [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7139.72s)]
*  I saw a squirrel, and for two or three seconds, [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7141.72s)]
*  I thought it was a wolf. [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7144.44s)]
*  Really? [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7145.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7146.599999999999s)]
*  I was like, is that a wolf? [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7147.44s)]
*  I'm seeing something moving in between thick trees [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7148.9400000000005s)]
*  and I see gray fur. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7152.360000000001s)]
*  I'm like, oh my God, is that a wolf? [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7153.9400000000005s)]
*  Because there's wolves out there. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7155.5s)]
*  I'm in Canada. [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7157.06s)]
*  I'm like, oh, it's a fucking squirrel. [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7158.02s)]
*  What the fuck is wrong with me? [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7159.74s)]
*  What the fuck is wrong with me? [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7161.5s)]
*  Shoot it. [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7162.42s)]
*  Yeah, it's like, people see what they wanna see. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7163.26s)]
*  And the problem is you get something into someone's head, [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7166.780000000001s)]
*  a mythological thing, whether it's a UFO [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7168.9800000000005s)]
*  or whether it's Bigfoot. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7172.02s)]
*  I think the world is way more slippery [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7173.78s)]
*  than we like to think. [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7179.0199999999995s)]
*  And I think there's states of consciousness [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7180.179999999999s)]
*  that people can achieve during high anxiety levels, [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7182.0599999999995s)]
*  definitely during the use of psychedelic drugs, [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7185.0199999999995s)]
*  sometimes during weird states in their life, [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7187.62s)]
*  like near death experiences, loss of a loved one, [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7189.719999999999s)]
*  extreme emotion, a lot going on, [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7192.9s)]
*  a lot of anxiety and fear, like you would have [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7196.259999999999s)]
*  if you were in the woods. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7198.3s)]
*  Sure, you're on edge. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7199.219999999999s)]
*  And then you see a light across the sky. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7201.219999999999s)]
*  It might have been just a meteorite. [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7204.3s)]
*  But you're in the wrong head space to see that meteorite. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7205.42s)]
*  And you just fucking, you just freak. [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7208.7s)]
*  You just freak. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7211.54s)]
*  And maybe for a brief moment, you can see something [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7212.38s)]
*  that's been there all along. [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7214.62s)]
*  You know how defeated I am right now? [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7216.1s)]
*  I just want you to tell me, like dude, [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7217.66s)]
*  there's some crazy stuff out there. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7219.94s)]
*  I've interviewed a lot of Bigfoot people. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7222.54s)]
*  I had one joke I used to do about Bigfoot. [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7225.18s)]
*  Here's what you don't find when you go looking for Bigfoot. [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7227.06s)]
*  Black people. [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7230.54s)]
*  You're more likely to find Bigfoot [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7231.82s)]
*  than you are black people looking for Bigfoot. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7233.299999999999s)]
*  It's a bunch of unfuckable white guys out camping. [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7235.219999999999s)]
*  That is a thing. [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7238.78s)]
*  It's a community of people that want to believe something [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7239.62s)]
*  that there's zero evidence for, [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7241.86s)]
*  and they're fucking locked in. [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7243.24s)]
*  They're hitting a tree with a stick, [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7245.299999999999s)]
*  going like, we're gonna wait for a knockback. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7246.66s)]
*  And it's different Bigfoot researchers [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7248.46s)]
*  hitting a different tree, talking back to them. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7250.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's like if you go to public land elk hunting, [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7252.38s)]
*  there's a bunch of people elk calling. [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7254.78s)]
*  You think, oh, there's an elk. [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7256.0599999999995s)]
*  It's a dude with a two. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7257.0599999999995s)]
*  It's another guy. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7257.9s)]
*  Two men doing elk calls. [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7258.719999999999s)]
*  Exactly, to each other. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7260.82s)]
*  That literally happens. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7261.94s)]
*  It does, 100%. [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7263.94s)]
*  It's one of those things where I wish it was real. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7265.7s)]
*  I wish Bigfoot was real. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7268.42s)]
*  Bobcat Goldway believes. [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7269.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he loves it. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7270.9s)]
*  He's all in. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7271.74s)]
*  Did you ever watch Willow Creek? [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7272.58s)]
*  I didn't, piss me off, because at the end, [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7273.86s)]
*  it turns out to be, I'm gonna spoil the Willow Creek, [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7275.42s)]
*  but at the end, it's just a bunch of hillbillies out there [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7277.759999999999s)]
*  killing and blaming it on Bigfoot, basically. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7280.82s)]
*  That's like, the end is like, you don't- [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7283.0199999999995s)]
*  Wait a minute, which one are you talking about? [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7284.38s)]
*  That you don't really- There's no Bigfoot movie? [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7285.34s)]
*  I think that's what the end is, [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7286.98s)]
*  that it's just some crazy people that live in the woods. [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7288.0199999999995s)]
*  It's not really a Bigfoot. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7290.38s)]
*  Is that true? [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7291.82s)]
*  I think that's the end of Willow Creek. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7292.66s)]
*  I don't remember how it ends. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7294.82s)]
*  Because they kind of have this one [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7296.74s)]
*  kind of Blair Witch-like shot, [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7297.86s)]
*  and it's just a bunch of mountain people, [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7299.7s)]
*  which is the scariest thing you'll find in the woods. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7302.14s)]
*  People. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7304.6s)]
*  Well, that's that- [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7305.4400000000005s)]
*  People that wanna be off that grid. [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7306.26s)]
*  People that- [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7307.42s)]
*  There's that documentary Sasquatch. [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7308.26s)]
*  Do you ever see that? [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7309.46s)]
*  It's like a documentary series. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7310.3s)]
*  Yeah, and it turns out just to be the cartel. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7311.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7313.34s)]
*  Blame, oh, not the cartel, but weed people. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7314.18s)]
*  Weed people killing other- [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7315.78s)]
*  Blaming it on a Bigfoot, framing it [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7317.26s)]
*  to look like a Bigfoot's out there. [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7319.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7320.76s)]
*  Yeah, they killed somebody. [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7321.599999999999s)]
*  Apparently, when marijuana was, [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7323.28s)]
*  when they were growing it up there, [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7328.04s)]
*  these hippies started arming themselves. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7329.4s)]
*  And then they had rival gang wars [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7332.5199999999995s)]
*  with people that would come in [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7334.639999999999s)]
*  and try to steal their crop. [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7335.639999999999s)]
*  Sure. [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7336.92s)]
*  So they'd start shooting at each other, [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7337.76s)]
*  killing each other. [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7338.58s)]
*  That's what that's all about. [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7339.68s)]
*  Or also, some cute girl that's like, [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7340.639999999999s)]
*  oh, I'm gonna clip weed all summer [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7343.28s)]
*  and make five grand and hang out with other potheads [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7345.72s)]
*  You don't realize how terrible that job is. [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7348.4s)]
*  Well, you're involved in illegal business. [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7350.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7353.36s)]
*  And the cartel's in that business. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7354.2s)]
*  I had a friend who found a cartel grow operation [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7356.04s)]
*  on a ranch. [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7358.82s)]
*  Yeah, they were- [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7360.36s)]
*  Scary. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7361.2s)]
*  He works on a ranch in California, [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7362.04s)]
*  and he was doing his thing out in the ranch, [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7363.84s)]
*  and he found some water piping. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7365.92s)]
*  And he followed the water piping, [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7368.6s)]
*  and it was pretty considerable distance. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7371.6s)]
*  And they found this grow-op. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7375.2s)]
*  So this guy had diverted water, or many guys. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7376.84s)]
*  They didn't see the humans that did it. [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7380.52s)]
*  They took their shit, [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7382.68s)]
*  and then they never caught the guys, I don't think. [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7383.56s)]
*  But they would set up these camps in, [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7385.6s)]
*  they would go to national forests. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7389.52s)]
*  Apparently, it's big in Northern California, [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7391.78s)]
*  where they go deep, deep, deep in the woods. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7393.7s)]
*  They backpack in, and then they have a massive grow-op [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7395.64s)]
*  on public land. [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7399.72s)]
*  And they just get it till the time it's ready to harvest, [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7400.72s)]
*  and then they get out of there. [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7404.84s)]
*  But if someone interrupts that, [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7406.24s)]
*  if they get in the middle of that, they'll kill them. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7408.8s)]
*  These are cartel guys. [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7411.76s)]
*  So my friend John Norris, [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7412.96s)]
*  he's been on the podcast before, he was a game warden. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7414.76s)]
*  And he found a creek that had been redirected, [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7418.36s)]
*  and he thought maybe a farmer had did this. [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7421.88s)]
*  What's going on? [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7424.0s)]
*  Maybe someone put an illegal dam on this. [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7424.84s)]
*  They follow it, and they find this crazy grow-op [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7426.599999999999s)]
*  with the cartel and guns. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7430.8s)]
*  So he winds up, instead of just being a game warden, [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7433.8s)]
*  now all of a sudden he's got a tactical team [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7436.84s)]
*  with attack dogs. [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7439.68s)]
*  Crazy. [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7440.76s)]
*  And they're running in fully armed with flak jackets on, [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7441.6s)]
*  having gunfights with the cartel in the woods over weed. [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7445.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7449.04s)]
*  I will say that that's the most frustrating part [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7450.52s)]
*  about the Bigfoot subject, [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7453.16s)]
*  is you got guys who really like, [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7454.56s)]
*  oh, I think an ape could, [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7456.72s)]
*  like a pod of apes could live out here and this thing. [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7458.12s)]
*  And so you'll start to, guys like me will be like, [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7461.360000000001s)]
*  yeah, this makes good sense. [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7463.679999999999s)]
*  And then they'll get like a Native American [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7464.759999999999s)]
*  to talk about it, and he'll be like, [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7466.44s)]
*  it's the magic man of the woods. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7467.8s)]
*  And you're like, no. [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7469.759999999999s)]
*  And they're like, he disappears. [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7470.639999999999s)]
*  He flies, he can stop the rain. [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7472.599999999999s)]
*  And you're like, no, no, this is, [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7474.2s)]
*  gosh dang it, we were making real good ground here, [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7475.88s)]
*  making arguments for it to be an ape. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7477.92s)]
*  I think the Native Americans are right. [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7480.719999999999s)]
*  I think that's what it is. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7483.88s)]
*  Some sort of paranormal woods thing? [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7485.16s)]
*  Yeah, I do. [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7486.759999999999s)]
*  I think it's like, [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7488.28s)]
*  listen, if you have, [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7490.280000000001s)]
*  let's imagine that states of consciousness [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7493.56s)]
*  can interface with other things [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7496.400000000001s)]
*  that are around us all the time [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7498.4800000000005s)]
*  that we don't necessarily see. [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7500.160000000001s)]
*  Now we know that's true if you take psychedelics. [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7501.84s)]
*  And we know that psychedelics are produced in the brain. [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7504.360000000001s)]
*  I can imagine a moment [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7507.4800000000005s)]
*  where you are in such a state [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7511.200000000001s)]
*  that you could see something [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7513.52s)]
*  that you would not be able to see under normal conditions. [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7515.160000000001s)]
*  It's not outside the realm of possibility. [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7518.04s)]
*  I'm not married to it, [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7519.76s)]
*  but it's not outside the realm of possibility. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7520.88s)]
*  Now, if that is what we're seeing with UFOs, [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7522.68s)]
*  if what we're seeing is our future, [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7525.84s)]
*  if what we're seeing with those beings [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7528.64s)]
*  is the eventual shape that human beings will take [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7530.4800000000005s)]
*  as evolution progresses, [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7535.52s)]
*  we become these genderless little spindly things, [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7537.200000000001s)]
*  giant heads. Big brains, yeah. [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7540.0s)]
*  Flying spaceships with our minds. [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7541.64s)]
*  That kind of makes sense to me. [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7543.56s)]
*  If that makes sense, [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7545.320000000001s)]
*  why wouldn't I be able to also see what we used to be [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7548.0s)]
*  or what we could have been [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7550.759999999999s)]
*  or what other things used to live with us? [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7552.08s)]
*  And maybe it's almost like a ghost, [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7555.12s)]
*  almost like a memory that you can access [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7557.639999999999s)]
*  of a different timeline, a different dimension [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7561.2s)]
*  where this thing does exist. [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7564.759999999999s)]
*  And that's why it's so elusive and it comes and goes [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7566.88s)]
*  because it's not a real material thing. [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7570.799999999999s)]
*  It's a construct of the human psyche. [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7572.92s)]
*  But these people that are seeing it, [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7575.48s)]
*  they might even literally be seeing footprints. [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7578.08s)]
*  It might literally leave footprints. [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7579.5599999999995s)]
*  It might exist for brief moments. [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7581.16s)]
*  Makes sense, passing in and out [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7584.2s)]
*  of this dimension kind of thing. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7585.48s)]
*  There's so many wacky stories about it. [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7586.92s)]
*  So then you have to apply the wacky stories [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7588.639999999999s)]
*  to human psychology and say, [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7590.16s)]
*  okay, people are in a heightened state. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7591.32s)]
*  They're in the woods, they're alone, they're nervous. [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7592.679999999999s)]
*  There's cats out there and fucking bears. [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7594.76s)]
*  Ah, so you're kind of freaking out already. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7596.599999999999s)]
*  So you're in this weird mind state already [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7598.679999999999s)]
*  where it seems like more things are possible out there [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7602.48s)]
*  because there's no one to help you. [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7606.28s)]
*  There's no city, there's no hospital. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7608.48s)]
*  Can't call the cops on a big flood. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7611.04s)]
*  You got no fucking cell phone signal [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7612.12s)]
*  and you're out there alone. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7614.5599999999995s)]
*  There's so many possibilities. [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7615.92s)]
*  It's terrifying. [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7617.599999999999s)]
*  And that, to me, makes sense. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7618.88s)]
*  If there's a mindset that can be achieved, [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7622.24s)]
*  it's a mind state to be achieved [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7623.96s)]
*  where you interact with things [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7625.88s)]
*  that aren't there all the time, like UFOs. [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7627.48s)]
*  That would be when it would happen. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7630.16s)]
*  Well, there's tons of interesting stories [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7632.759999999999s)]
*  that you'll just read about, [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7635.72s)]
*  like a thing just walking behind the tree. [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7636.68s)]
*  But if it was a massive 10-foot thing, [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7639.240000000001s)]
*  you'd probably be able to see it [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7643.200000000001s)]
*  come out on the other side of that tree. [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7644.64s)]
*  And you see a lot of those kind of, [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7646.64s)]
*  I read a lot of those kind of stories [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7648.92s)]
*  and I'm like, I don't know the heck that. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7650.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, it could be that, [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7652.08s)]
*  but it could also be black bears. [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7653.68s)]
*  It could be that you're just seeing things [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7655.280000000001s)]
*  because they're freaking out. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7656.64s)]
*  Bears freak you out, man. [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7658.12s)]
*  You see a bear in the wild, it freaks you out. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7659.320000000001s)]
*  And if you see a bear in between trees, [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7661.240000000001s)]
*  you can just convince yourself that it's something. [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7663.76s)]
*  And then your brain plays tricks on you. [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7666.24s)]
*  The memory is a slippery bitch. [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7667.36s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7669.44s)]
*  Especially under heightened circumstances like that, [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7670.28s)]
*  like in the woods. [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7672.12s)]
*  Your memory's weird. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7673.32s)]
*  And it's more exciting to believe that it's real. [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7674.96s)]
*  So that's what you wanna, [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7676.96s)]
*  my biggest, I think what I'm holding onto so much [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7679.48s)]
*  is that I think it's so boring [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7681.639999999999s)]
*  if we just know all the stuff on our planet. [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7683.28s)]
*  I don't think we do. [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7685.879999999999s)]
*  But that's my point. [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7686.759999999999s)]
*  It's way more exciting to think, [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7687.599999999999s)]
*  yeah, there's Bigfoots and there's- [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7689.04s)]
*  Yeah, pterodactyls is one of my favorites. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7690.719999999999s)]
*  Wolf, wolf man or dog man or- [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7692.96s)]
*  Mothman or any of these kind of exciting things. [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7696.08s)]
*  I want to believe that. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7698.32s)]
*  You know about that hobbit man [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7700.8s)]
*  that they found on that island of Flores? [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7702.88s)]
*  No. [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7704.679999999999s)]
*  No? [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7705.5199999999995s)]
*  Hobbit man. [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7706.36s)]
*  Oh, good, yeah, this is a good one for you. [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7707.2s)]
*  This is a thing that absolutely lived alongside people. [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7709.44s)]
*  And I think they don't know [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7712.639999999999s)]
*  the timeline of this fucker either. [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7714.48s)]
*  But they think it might have been as recently [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7716.719999999999s)]
*  as like 50,000, 30,000 years ago. [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7718.639999999999s)]
*  And they were little tiny people. [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7721.04s)]
*  Three foot tall, almost like ape-like creatures. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7722.6s)]
*  That's what they looked like. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7726.400000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, see? [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7727.240000000001s)]
*  Like a little baby Bigfoot. [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7728.080000000001s)]
*  Yeah, well like little hobbits, man. [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7728.92s)]
*  And they lived on this island. [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7731.52s)]
*  And they were like a different branch [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7733.080000000001s)]
*  of the human chain that lived alongside homo sapiens. [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7734.72s)]
*  Yeah, you see that? [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7738.96s)]
*  You just think you see a juvenile Bigfoot or something. [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7739.8s)]
*  Well, there's people that have sighted these things [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7742.84s)]
*  in other parts of the world still to this day. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7745.160000000001s)]
*  They still claim that they exist. [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7747.200000000001s)]
*  You seen that video recently where [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7748.72s)]
*  these guys, I'm gonna make up a place, [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7751.28s)]
*  but it's someplace like, but not necessarily Thailand. [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7754.24s)]
*  And they're on these motorcycles. [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7756.879999999999s)]
*  And this little man comes out with like a spear. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7758.48s)]
*  And then they chase it into the high grass. [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7760.799999999999s)]
*  Well, it runs across the road, right? [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7762.839999999999s)]
*  Doesn't it run across the road? [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7764.2s)]
*  Well, it has a spear [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7765.04s)]
*  because it's kind of startled by their motorcycles. [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7765.879999999999s)]
*  And then they're going, wow, wow. [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7768.08s)]
*  And they kind of chase it down this little trail. [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7769.5199999999995s)]
*  But then this is it, right? [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7770.839999999999s)]
*  This is it, yeah, this little guy. [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7771.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7773.4s)]
*  Like a tiny person. [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7774.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7776.2s)]
*  And then it runs into the grass and they lose it. [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7777.04s)]
*  But it's a tiny little guy. [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7779.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7780.66s)]
*  And he's got like some sort of spear. [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7781.5s)]
*  Do you see a spear? [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7784.22s)]
*  You'll see it in the very beginning before, [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7785.9400000000005s)]
*  because one guy gets off his bike in the very beginning. [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7787.74s)]
*  When it first comes out, it has like a little spear. [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7790.62s)]
*  Maybe even before this. [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7793.9400000000005s)]
*  So they're riding the bike. [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7797.14s)]
*  This video replays itself a lot. [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7798.78s)]
*  Oh, sorry. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7800.1s)]
*  It's like on loop. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7800.9400000000005s)]
*  Oh, okay. Oh, okay. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7801.76s)]
*  Yeah, so this one, they chase him into the grass. [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7802.9400000000005s)]
*  This is when they lose him. [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7805.46s)]
*  They pop around looking for it. [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7806.3s)]
*  Do they see him again? [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7808.78s)]
*  No, no, this is where they, [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7809.74s)]
*  when they first stumble upon him, [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7810.82s)]
*  he has like a spear. [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7813.26s)]
*  Right here. There you go. [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7814.099999999999s)]
*  He's holding something. [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7814.94s)]
*  There was something. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7815.78s)]
*  I mean, whether I get, if this is a real video, [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7816.599999999999s)]
*  it definitely looks like there's something in the sand. [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7818.9s)]
*  There. Right here. [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7820.54s)]
*  Yeah, he's like dragging something. [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7821.46s)]
*  Jamie, does that look real to you? [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7822.74s)]
*  You're good at this. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7825.66s)]
*  Let me see it. [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7828.0199999999995s)]
*  Let it play again? [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7828.86s)]
*  No, first, cynicism goes, no, that's not real. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7829.7s)]
*  Hmm. [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7836.86s)]
*  And that guy dumps, cause he's like, what the hell? [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7839.46s)]
*  First Instinct says this is someone in that side of the world [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7843.86s)]
*  playing around with computer graphics. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7847.0199999999995s)]
*  And that's just, they just shrunk a person. [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7848.5s)]
*  But that's just being cynical. [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7851.3s)]
*  Right. And that seems the most likely scenario. [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7853.18s)]
*  I would like to hear their voices. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7857.66s)]
*  Are they speaking in English? [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7859.38s)]
*  There's no sound. [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7861.0599999999995s)]
*  It doesn't seem like. [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7861.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7862.72s)]
*  On this one probably. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7863.54s)]
*  I feel like we have heard it before, but. [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7864.38s)]
*  It just sounds like a lot of motorcycles. [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7865.82s)]
*  It's like, [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7867.46s)]
*  Cause they're all on motorcycles. [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7868.860000000001s)]
*  It's like a 12 year old GoPro video. [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7870.42s)]
*  See, the thing about that is fascinating, [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7872.62s)]
*  cause you're dealing with insane jungle, [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7875.22s)]
*  like insane dense terrain. [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7878.22s)]
*  There's where the orange pendek is, [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7880.66s)]
*  where do they think that thing exists? [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7882.5s)]
*  It was like Vietnam and some other area. [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7884.860000000001s)]
*  But it just, if the island of Flores [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7887.3s)]
*  had these creatures on them, [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7889.1s)]
*  like the idea that there would be just a small population [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7891.06s)]
*  of them that still existed, [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7895.74s)]
*  that seems to me to be more likely than Bigfoot. [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7897.14s)]
*  Cause that one gets seen a lot. [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7901.38s)]
*  And that looks, the lighting on it is so strange to me. [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7903.22s)]
*  Yeah, it looks weird. [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7906.34s)]
*  That it looks unnatural. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7907.18s)]
*  It definitely looks weird. [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7908.9800000000005s)]
*  But also everything is blurry. [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7909.820000000001s)]
*  But they could doctor up a thumbnail. [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7910.660000000001s)]
*  Sure, sure, sure, yeah, yeah, definitely. [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7911.9400000000005s)]
*  Cause I watch these sir spooks. [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7913.3s)]
*  That looks like Groot. [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7915.3s)]
*  It looks like a version of Groot. [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7916.14s)]
*  Right, but everything looks blurry there. [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7917.18s)]
*  The motorcycle looks like shit. [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7918.4400000000005s)]
*  Everything looks fucked up. [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7919.700000000001s)]
*  And on all these videos like this, [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7920.660000000001s)]
*  when you try to get issue to click on it, [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7922.34s)]
*  they doctor the thumbnail up [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7923.900000000001s)]
*  so that you'll click on it. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7925.78s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, they jazz up. [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7927.5s)]
*  That looks jazzed up, right? [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7928.86s)]
*  Right, but that's the. [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7930.3s)]
*  So it was Indonesia. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7931.7s)]
*  Yeah, so that's where they claimed to have sighted [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7933.219999999999s)]
*  this thing. [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7935.66s)]
*  But most likely it's bullshit. [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7936.679999999999s)]
*  So many people have cell phones. [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7939.94s)]
*  Oh yeah, that thing. [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7941.3s)]
*  That one's bullshit. [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7942.139999999999s)]
*  So many people have cell phones. [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7942.96s)]
*  The idea that no one's filmed one yet. [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7944.259999999999s)]
*  But for sure we know it did exist. [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7946.44s)]
*  And how long ago did the Homo floresiensis, [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7948.7s)]
*  how long ago did that one live? [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7954.7s)]
*  They used to think it was like much more recent. [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7957.34s)]
*  I think they were thinking at one point in time [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7959.44s)]
*  it was only 10,000 years ago. [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7960.74s)]
*  But I think they think it's quite a bit older than that now. [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7963.0599999999995s)]
*  50,000. [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7967.46s)]
*  So here it goes. [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7969.26s)]
*  Okay, so initially thought to be only 12,000 years ago. [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7971.7s)]
*  However, more extensive stratigraphic [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7975.5s)]
*  and chronological work has been pushed, [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7978.48s)]
*  dating of the most recent evidence of its existence [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7981.54s)]
*  back to 50,000 years ago. [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7984.9400000000005s)]
*  So that's the most recent evidence. [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7986.42s)]
*  It's 50,000 years ago. [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7988.38s)]
*  And Homo floresiensis skeletal materials [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7989.9800000000005s)]
*  now dated from 60,000 to 100,000 years ago. [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7992.58s)]
*  Stone tools recovered alongside the skeletal remains [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7996.14s)]
*  were from archeological horizons [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=7999.12s)]
*  ranging from 50,000 to 190,000 years ago. [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8000.820000000001s)]
*  That's for the stone tools. [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8004.46s)]
*  Found it in this little cave. [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8006.1s)]

*  They found quite a few of them. [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8008.8s)]
*  You're out shooting these elks, right, [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8009.62s)]

*  Why would I do that? [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8028.24s)]
*  Because then you proved that it's, [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8029.28s)]
*  because now if you try to tell the story, [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8031.76s)]
*  if he was like Joe, you saw a bear. [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8033.32s)]

*  but knocks him out and then fled. [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8268.64s)]
*  Cause he realized, oh, I'm gonna get in trouble [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8270.52s)]
*  or maybe someone's gonna beat me up [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8272.12s)]
*  and he ran from the cops. [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8273.24s)]
*  But we all saw the fight. [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8274.08s)]
*  So the police were like, [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8275.32s)]
*  would you recognize him if you saw him? [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8276.56s)]
*  I go, yeah, I'd recognize him. [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8277.64s)]
*  So they put me in the back of the cop car. [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8278.68s)]
*  They were gonna drive me around to see if I could spot him. [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8280.039999999999s)]
*  But I figured, cause I'm in the back of the cop car, [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8282.4s)]
*  you know, I look like I'm a bad ass, you know? [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8284.84s)]
*  So I kept like whenever we drive by girls, [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8287.0s)]
*  like I put my hands like this [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8289.48s)]
*  and I'd be like kissing at the window, like, you know, [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8291.4s)]
*  like, like, like, oh, that guy's nuts, you know? [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8293.64s)]
*  Handsome outlaw. [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8296.0s)]
*  Stole the valor of the fight kid. [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8296.84s)]
*  But what a weird, [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8299.32s)]
*  that shook me a little bit. [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8301.68s)]
*  What is that guy's background, Jamie? [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8303.0s)]
*  He also, so they found, the wife called it in. [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8304.92s)]
*  He then drove a hundred miles [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8308.04s)]
*  and broke into a fort Indian town gap base [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8309.640000000001s)]
*  and stole a gun to Pennsylvania National Guard headquarters. [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8314.04s)]
*  He was found with a gun, but he didn't resist arrest. [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8317.48s)]
*  Holy shit. [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8320.2s)]

*  before that there was just like, he's just a guy. [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8323.28s)]
*  And then he's like, well, cut the head off. [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8326.04s)]
*  Now it's time to, right? [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8327.56s)]
*  Do you think there was things leading up to that? [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8328.84s)]
*  Or is that just, that's the- [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8330.72s)]
*  I would imagine there were signs. [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8331.92s)]
*  Right. [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8333.76s)]
*  2016, his college roommate said [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8334.599999999999s)]

*  Or maybe they did manchurian- [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8342.519999999999s)]
*  They were looking at him for a while. [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8344.8s)]
*  When I first heard the story, the FBI was looking at him. [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8345.8s)]
*  Yeah, we're looking at him. [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8348.359999999999s)]
*  Yeah, we're just taking a, we're observing him. [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8349.32s)]

*  I will say the signs thing, [[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8354.48s)]

*  they always do those serial killers. [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8361.4s)]
*  They'll say, look, we looked at his Facebook [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8362.24s)]
*  and there were signs and no one did anything about it. [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8363.68s)]
*  It's because people don't want to believe [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8366.119999999999s)]
*  that that's possible. [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8368.72s)]
*  Well, also you don't want to look for it everywhere. [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8370.0s)]

*  Right. [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8373.72s)]

*  with a rifle. [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8377.64s)]
*  There's a guy who I got banned from the improv in Hollywood. [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8378.56s)]
*  And it's because while he was sitting there, [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8382.16s)]
*  he's a lower level comic, so he's not like past, [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8384.32s)]
*  it's not like he would be working at the improv. [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8387.359999999999s)]
*  But he goes, hangs out at the improv [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8389.08s)]
*  because he wants to be a successful comedian. [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8390.84s)]
*  Excuse me. [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8393.560000000001s)]

*  I could chalk it up to like whatever these excuses are. [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8398.0s)]
*  But what he was saying was so problematic. [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8400.800000000001s)]
*  The way he was like, you know what? [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8403.960000000001s)]

*  And he goes, he's like kind of taunting me a little bit [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8414.84s)]
*  because I went and I was just on the lineup. [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8417.16s)]
*  So I'm one of the comedians that he thinks. [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8420.48s)]
*  And he goes, you know, and guys like you [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8422.28s)]
*  are worth extra points. [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8424.72s)]
*  And I was like, what does that mean? [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8426.28s)]
*  And I said it, my manager was sitting there listening to it. [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8427.36s)]
*  I go, are you like threatening me? [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8428.960000000001s)]
*  Or like, I don't understand what you're doing. [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8430.56s)]
*  Because I just want to be friends with everyone. [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8432.4s)]
*  Just trying to break bread. [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8434.36s)]

*  I took it as like, this is a sign. [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8442.76s)]
*  So I told the Hollywood, the next day I called [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8445.2s)]
*  and I say, hey, you know, maybe you don't have a guy [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8448.72s)]
*  that's bragging about how he's going to shoot up [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8450.359999999999s)]
*  everybody eventually. [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8452.16s)]

*  I know him really well. [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8469.4s)]
*  I go, yeah, but you might be enabling a guy like this [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8470.76s)]
*  until he pops. [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8474.039999999999s)]

*  I saw the signs and I told. [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8480.64s)]
*  Whereas to this day, she's like, [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8482.56s)]
*  I just can't believe you got it. [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8484.519999999999s)]

*  And he comes here. [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8487.88s)]
*  Oh my god, he comes and ruins this place? [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8488.72s)]
*  Yeah, you don't want him doing that. [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8490.24s)]
*  I was fine with telling on him. [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8491.84s)]
*  And you can't talk like that. [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8493.72s)]
*  Even if you're never going to do anything. [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8495.039999999999s)]
*  Was he funny? [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8496.199999999999s)]

*  Doesn't bother me. [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8498.439999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8499.279999999999s)]
*  He's out of here. [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8500.279999999999s)]
*  Probably wasn't going to work out anyway. [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8501.32s)]
*  That's probably why he was upset with you. [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8503.119999999999s)]
*  He said that to me. [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8505.32s)]
*  He goes, I bet you made everybody laugh. [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8506.36s)]
*  Yeah, that's kind of the idea. [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8508.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8510.039999999999s)]
*  He goes, I don't even care if they laugh. [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8510.92s)]
*  I don't give a shit about any of that. [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8513.039999999999s)]
*  And I was like, that's the whole point. [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8514.84s)]
*  He was romanticizing about being the guy who doesn't. [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8516.96s)]
*  Well, those are the people who can't do it. [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8520.039999999999s)]
*  Need the crowd to like him. [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8521.36s)]
*  And I was like, well, but that is the job. [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8522.84s)]
*  I want them to laugh. [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8524.64s)]
*  Yeah, you're in the entertainment business. [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8526.08s)]
*  It makes no sense. [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8528.56s)]
*  He thinks he's better, more cerebral, [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8530.6s)]
*  because he doesn't get laughs. [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8533.0s)]
*  That's what people do when they don't have an option. [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8534.52s)]
*  That's the only way they can find any kind of status. [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8537.12s)]
*  Their status is that they don't give a fuck. [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8540.52s)]
*  Yeah, it's so tired. [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8542.560000000001s)]
*  So stupid. [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8544.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8545.16s)]
*  Of course you give a fuck. [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8545.48s)]
*  Right, and also we don't need people that don't give fucks. [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8546.32s)]
*  We want you to give some fucks. [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8549.52s)]
*  It's not powerful to not give a fuck. [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8551.28s)]
*  It's stupid. [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8554.24s)]
*  It's lazy. [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8554.880000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8555.4s)]
*  It's stupid. [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8556.12s)]
*  It's like what babies do. [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8556.84s)]
*  Yeah, you're trying to do something. [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8558.880000000001s)]
*  You're involved. [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8560.880000000001s)]
*  You're at the place of where it gets performed. [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8561.92s)]
*  You're involved. [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8565.039999999999s)]
*  You're involved. [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8566.119999999999s)]
*  You just suck at it. [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8566.599999999999s)]
*  And so you're trying to find some way [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8567.56s)]
*  to sort of make you the more whatever, virtuous, more [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8569.56s)]
*  someone who's like cooler. [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8576.64s)]
*  Yeah, and that's all in a need to be like. [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8578.039999999999s)]
*  Like we talked about a guy last night that's like, [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8580.519999999999s)]
*  he would treat people terribly. [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8583.96s)]
*  But then when you'd hear him talk about people [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8586.679999999998s)]
*  that he liked, he would say like, he was a real jerk to me. [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8589.080000000002s)]
*  You're like, yeah, see how that made you feel? [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8592.6s)]
*  That's what you do to people. [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8594.68s)]
*  Like you think that that, you know, it makes no sense. [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8596.160000000002s)]
*  Wow, people are just trapped in their own head. [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8599.0s)]
*  Silly. [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8601.44s)]
*  So many people are not aware of how other people are perceiving [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8602.36s)]
*  them. [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8605.44s)]
*  They're trapped in their own head. [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8605.960000000001s)]
*  And they just know what they want. [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8607.320000000002s)]
*  And they get upset if other people are getting things. [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8608.720000000001s)]
*  It's just so toxic. [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8611.800000000001s)]
*  So bad for you. [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8612.92s)]
*  But I think like you can learn that at a pretty low, [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8613.960000000001s)]
*  like a pretty young age to go. [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8616.04s)]
*  Yeah, you should learn that. [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8617.640000000001s)]
*  Do you know how you feel when people are nice to you? [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8619.08s)]
*  That's how they're going to feel if you're nice to them. [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8621.44s)]
*  It's such a child, like kindergarten lesson. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8623.64s)]
*  And these are grown people that you have to go, [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8626.32s)]
*  you should treat people good. [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8628.76s)]
*  That's kind of the idea. [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8630.039999999999s)]
*  Hey man, they're artists. [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8631.8s)]
*  They're artists. [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8633.52s)]
*  They're artists, man. [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8634.64s)]
*  You can't be an artist. [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8639.6s)]
*  You're too handsome. [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8640.48s)]
*  Yeah, you should want them at all to not like you. [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8641.64s)]
*  You should be depressed. [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8644.119999999999s)]
*  Can we not depressed? [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8645.2s)]
*  No way to live. [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8646.880000000001s)]
*  No way to live. [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8648.92s)]
*  It isn't any way to live. [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8650.32s)]
*  That is a powerful statement to just like, how you doing? [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8651.880000000001s)]
*  I'm happy. [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8654.32s)]
*  They go, what? [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8655.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8656.36s)]
*  What do you mean you're happy? [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8656.8s)]
*  Well, that's the really annoying thing [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8657.68s)]
*  about this perception of comedians [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8659.2s)]
*  that we're not supposed to be happy. [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8660.56s)]
*  So dumb. [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8661.76s)]
*  Says who. [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8662.48s)]
*  We literally make people happy for a living. [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8663.2s)]
*  You shouldn't be enjoying yourself. [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8665.2s)]
*  Like last night hanging around the green room. [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8666.68s)]
*  That, to me, is like ultimate playground. [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8668.6s)]
*  Everyone's just having fun and laughing. [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8671.880000000001s)]
*  We're just talking shit and having a good time. [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8674.52s)]
*  And the idea that that wouldn't make you happy. [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8677.16s)]
*  And then you go on stage and then people laugh. [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8680.0s)]
*  That doesn't make you happy. [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8682.68s)]
*  You know what's better? [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8684.640000000001s)]
*  It's a lot better than pouring concrete for 10 hours. [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8686.04s)]
*  Like you're at work. [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8689.44s)]
*  And we're having fun and talking. [[02:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8690.720000000001s)]
*  I think that's why podcasts are so huge, by the way. [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8694.04s)]
*  Because it's the green room hang. [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8697.08s)]
*  Holding court, telling stories. [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8700.6s)]
*  Get in on it. [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8702.04s)]
*  They listen to it. [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8702.76s)]
*  And then they get inspired to have those kind of conversations [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8704.2s)]
*  with their friends. [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8707.16s)]
*  If you're not around anybody interesting, it sucks. [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8708.28s)]
*  It sucks. [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8712.0s)]
*  100%. [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8712.52s)]
*  It's like a kind of, it's like a social starvation. [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8713.24s)]
*  Part of you just fucking withers. [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8717.96s)]
*  Part of you that likes to have a good time [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8721.0s)]
*  and have fun with cool people. [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8722.8s)]
*  Yeah, and it's also like I love the idea [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8724.72s)]
*  that if I say something to my comedy buddies, [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8728.28s)]
*  they know me well enough to go, he's a comedian. [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8730.8s)]
*  Trying to be funny. [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8734.16s)]
*  Dude, I say a lot of stinkers. [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8735.28s)]
*  There's going to be people in the comments, [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8736.48s)]
*  you see Jeff try to make Joe laugh right there. [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8737.88s)]
*  But Joe knows I'm just trying to make you laugh. [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8740.36s)]
*  Listen, we have no conversation at all [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8742.52s)]
*  about what we're going to talk about. [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8745.0s)]
*  Every podcast is like this. [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8746.44s)]
*  We just sit down and have a good time. [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8747.56s)]
*  Some of them are going to... [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8749.72s)]
*  You take some swings. [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8750.72s)]
*  Yeah, that's kind of how it goes. [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8751.6s)]
*  Some are going foul ball. [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8752.96s)]
*  Also, I might say something horrific. [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8753.92s)]
*  And you go, yeah, that's what Jeff was just talking. [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8756.04s)]
*  That's what talking is. [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8758.28s)]
*  Yeah, especially talking and thinking in public out loud. [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8759.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8763.6s)]
*  You bounce it off each other. [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8764.24s)]
*  I remember one time I said something terrible [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8765.439999999999s)]
*  at a woman that was just walking by the car. [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8767.8s)]
*  To my guy friends who aren't comics, [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8769.68s)]
*  we were pretty junior college age. [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8771.64s)]
*  And my friends were like, what the fuck, dude? [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8774.64s)]
*  And I was like, I don't know, I thought it'd be funny. [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8776.68s)]
*  And they just totally didn't get it. [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8779.279999999999s)]
*  And it was really horrific. [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8781.199999999999s)]
*  You tried. [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8783.279999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I tried. [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8784.039999999999s)]
*  But I think about that moment a lot now that I'm with comics [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8785.199999999999s)]
*  and I'm in these circles because they would just go, [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8788.279999999999s)]
*  yeah, I know exactly what he's trying to do. [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8790.48s)]
*  I did one of those jokes five minutes ago. [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8791.960000000001s)]
*  It's like the open mic or trying the abortion joke. [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8794.12s)]
*  Like, hey, you're not good enough for this yet. [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8796.68s)]
*  Swing, yeah. [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8799.8s)]
*  You got to learn. [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8800.76s)]
*  And one of the ways you learn is by swinging and missing. [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8801.48s)]
*  That's why a lot of comics will say, [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8804.2s)]
*  and I don't, again, won't name names, [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8805.68s)]
*  but they'll be like, I just went in there, I did my set, [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8807.12s)]
*  and I got the fuck out of there. [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8809.88s)]
*  Barry Katz used to tell comics to do that. [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8811.2s)]
*  Don't hang around. [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8813.32s)]
*  You don't want to be in these circles. [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8814.960000000001s)]
*  And it's like, well, one, that's how you make friends. [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8816.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8819.92s)]
*  When I love friends. [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8820.44s)]
*  And they're the friends that are going to most [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8821.640000000001s)]
*  relate to your life. [[02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8823.640000000001s)]
*  Yeah, we're doing the same stuff. [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8824.76s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8825.92s)]
*  And we're the same. [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8826.68s)]
*  We're cut from the same cloth. [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8827.28s)]
*  It's our only group. [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8828.52s)]
*  And that's why those comics, if I were to name their names, [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8830.68s)]
*  they don't do podcasts. [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8833.480000000001s)]
*  And they don't go because they've never done the hang [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8834.84s)]
*  part. [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8837.720000000001s)]
*  They've only done the jokes and the Judy Carter comedy [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8838.76s)]
*  Bible of like, you write this thing. [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8842.4s)]
*  So it's like, this job isn't about going up there [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8844.68s)]
*  and then leave. [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8846.880000000001s)]
*  It's about the community of stand-up comedy. [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8847.560000000001s)]
*  It's about both. [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8849.76s)]
*  And part of the enjoyment is the camaraderie. [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8851.16s)]
*  That's part of the enjoyment. [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8853.56s)]
*  Why would you want less enjoyment? [[02:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8854.72s)]
*  Yeah, makes no sense. [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8856.880000000001s)]
*  Also, like that socially, they're [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8857.76s)]
*  the most fun people to hang out with for me. [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8859.800000000001s)]
*  So why would you want to deny yourself [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8862.28s)]
*  of the most fun people to hang out with socially? [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8864.12s)]
*  That's why it's like, I have to keep [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8866.36s)]
*  going to these meetings and stuff for booze. [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8869.28s)]
*  Yeah, for the drinking. [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8873.04s)]
*  And I just sit in there going, I've [[02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8874.64s)]
*  got to listen to these hacks. [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8876.12s)]
*  I know some of the funniest people in the world. [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8877.44s)]
*  This guy's telling me some stupid story. [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8879.68s)]
*  Like, I'm just listening to the stories. [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8881.24s)]
*  I'm so judgmental of people's stories [[02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8882.56s)]
*  because I'm going, geez, get in, get out. [[02:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8884.279999999999s)]
*  There's no punch line here. [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8886.16s)]
*  What's the point of this story? [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8887.68s)]
*  And he's like, the guy's just got a disease. [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8889.68s)]
*  He's just trying to, he has to share or whatever. [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8892.92s)]
*  But then a lot of people go up in front of those things [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8895.16s)]
*  and they learn how to do stand-up [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8897.96s)]
*  because they tell funny stories. [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8899.88s)]
*  You know who doesn't tell funny stories, Joe? [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8901.8s)]
*  Who? [[02:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8903.519999999999s)]
*  The mothers against drunk driving. [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8904.019999999999s)]
*  Talking about a buzz kill. [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8906.92s)]
*  These gals. [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8908.52s)]
*  I'm just watching them going on. [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8909.880000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you don't want to be on those conversations. [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8911.52s)]
*  Bad storytelling. [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8913.44s)]
*  Those are bad stories. [[02:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8914.560000000001s)]
*  But it is. [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8916.44s)]
*  It's just like, I've become such a snob about the company [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8917.4s)]
*  because I get to be around such funny people. [[02:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8921.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8923.6s)]
*  You know, that it's like now I'm having [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8924.12s)]
*  to listen to a girl I like's friend talk about shopping [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8925.720000000001s)]
*  that day or something. [[02:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8930.68s)]
*  I'm being irritable about it. [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8931.800000000001s)]
*  Like, ugh. [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8933.24s)]
*  That's brutal. [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8934.08s)]
*  Assault on your attention span. [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8934.800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I'm just going, I can't hear this. [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8936.16s)]
*  You just got to filter those people out of your life. [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8937.8s)]
*  Yeah, I try. [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8939.4s)]

*  Yeah, keep your circle tight, Jeff. [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8941.72s)]

*  If I could do stand up every night, five times a night, [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8971.92s)]
*  that's what I want. [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8974.44s)]

*  And then I have a few podcasts. [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8977.16s)]
*  One's called Wrestling with Freddie, [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8978.84s)]
*  where me and Freddie Prince Jr. talk about wrestling. [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8980.32s)]
*  Once a week. [[02:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8982.4s)]
*  And it's like UFC, but choreographed. [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8983.720000000001s)]
*  Pro wrestling? [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8986.84s)]
*  Yeah, pro wrestling. [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8987.48s)]

*  Me and Josh Nelson, we just play a simple game with our guests. [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8991.04s)]
*  How much to eat the hottest pepper in the world? [[02:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8994.160000000002s)]
*  And then the people that listen can say, [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=8996.880000000001s)]
*  I'd pay Joe Rogan, whatever. [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=9000.0s)]
*  They make a pot of money. [[02:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=9002.0s)]
*  And then we film you doing whatever the thing is. [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=9003.08s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=9005.08s)]

*  I would never do that. [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=9007.720000000001s)]
*  I have money. [[02:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=9008.640000000001s)]
*  You can then say, I'll put this much in to watch someone do it. [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD-T6QIuxj8&t=9009.480000000001s)]
