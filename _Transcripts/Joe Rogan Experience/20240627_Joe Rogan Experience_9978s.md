# Joe Rogan Experience #2072 - Stavros Halkias
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6.0s)]
*  I don't know, I think it's their own blend. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=10.0s)]
*  Some kind of tobacco thing, yeah. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=14.0s)]
*  Let's go live and sort this out. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=16.0s)]
*  Yeah, come on, you know how podcasting works. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=18.0s)]
*  We're wasting all this beautiful... [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=21.0s)]
*  I was recording it, I was recording it. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=23.0s)]
*  We use every part of the buffalo. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=25.0s)]
*  We missed this entire Jamie ordering a half cow. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=27.0s)]
*  What's wrong with the cows? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=30.0s)]
*  I love that. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=32.0s)]
*  I'm with Homesteader, I'm with Prepper Jamie. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=33.0s)]
*  Jamie's got canned peaches in his basement. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=36.0s)]
*  I just thought it was a Texas thing. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=39.0s)]
*  Getting a half a cow? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=41.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=42.0s)]
*  Well, it is. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=43.0s)]
*  Well, one of the beautiful things about living around here is that there are a bunch of really [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=44.0s)]
*  good ranchers. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=47.0s)]
*  And you could buy meat from someone who you know, they grew the cow, you know they didn't [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=48.0s)]
*  pump it full of antibiotics and hormones. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=54.0s)]
*  There's a lot of grass fed ranchers out here. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=56.0s)]
*  That's nice. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=58.0s)]
*  I think that's what I was thinking one day. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=59.0s)]
*  I would love a nice, I would love a nice fucking grass fed ribeye. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=61.0s)]
*  Oh, better rest. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=65.0s)]
*  I'm a big fan of the grass fed ribeyes. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=68.0s)]
*  But most people are so used to corn fed though. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=70.0s)]
*  You get that pinkish sort of fatty. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=73.0s)]
*  Do you know the difference between prime or whatever? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=76.0s)]
*  I do not. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=79.0s)]
*  Wait, what's the difference between corn fed and grass fed? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=80.0s)]
*  Grass fed is how they normally eat. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=82.0s)]
*  That's how a cow usually eats. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=84.0s)]
*  They just eat grass. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=86.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=87.0s)]
*  But then when they want to really plump them up quickly, they feed them corn. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=88.0s)]
*  So most steaks, if you go to like a steak house, unless they specify it's corn fed or grain [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=93.0s)]
*  fed. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=99.0s)]
*  Gotcha. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=100.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=101.0s)]
*  The BBL, the BBL of cow trough is fucking corn fed. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=102.0s)]
*  I like my, yeah. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=107.0s)]
*  A grass fed is nice. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=108.0s)]
*  But I couldn't tell you the difference. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=110.0s)]
*  They're darker. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=112.0s)]
*  It's a little chewier. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=113.0s)]
*  Tastes better to me. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=114.0s)]
*  I like the flavor more. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=115.0s)]
*  The BBL, who was the fucking first doctor that was like, I know what to do with this [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=117.0s)]
*  extra fat. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=123.0s)]
*  It's like how a baby would be a doctor. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=124.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=127.0s)]
*  It's like, oh, let's put it in their cheeks. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=128.0s)]
*  Have you seen one in real life though? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=129.0s)]
*  I have. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=131.0s)]
*  And it was pretty good. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=133.0s)]
*  Yeah? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=134.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=135.0s)]
*  If you get them fresh, BBLs are like fish. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=136.0s)]
*  You know? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=140.0s)]
*  You don't want them hanging out too long. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=141.0s)]
*  You don't want too many kids. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=145.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=147.0s)]
*  But if you get them right after Dr. Miami, you know what I mean? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=148.0s)]
*  Four months after healing. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=152.0s)]
*  Some pretty cool stuff. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=154.0s)]
*  Dry aged beef. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=156.0s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=160.0s)]
*  I want to get that perfect 30 day march. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=161.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=163.0s)]
*  You scrape off that weird top part. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=164.0s)]
*  And underneath there's a nice bubbly butt cheeks. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=166.0s)]
*  It is funny to fuck somebody with a huge ass when your dick is so little though. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=171.0s)]
*  It's like my dick was being stopped by the cheeks. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=175.0s)]
*  My head was probably this much in her pussy. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=178.0s)]
*  That makes sense. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=181.0s)]
*  Really you have to concentrate on tightening up your butt cheeks. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=182.0s)]
*  And keeping that forward thrust. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=185.0s)]
*  You don't want to have too much laxity on the back end. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=187.0s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=190.0s)]
*  You want to have a rigid wall. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=191.0s)]
*  You're only going back in, boom. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=193.0s)]
*  And back in. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=195.0s)]
*  I have to get my deadlift formed down just so I can fuck a girl with a huge ass. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=196.0s)]
*  I think kettlebell swings. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=200.0s)]
*  It's all on the hips. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=202.0s)]
*  Kettlebell swings. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=203.0s)]
*  It's a hip hinge. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=205.0s)]
*  That's what you want to work on. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=206.0s)]
*  I think carrying a gigantic stomach has to kind of strengthen the back. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=208.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=213.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean it destroys your back too. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=214.0s)]
*  For those 45 seconds when I'm in those fake butt cheeks, it's pretty good. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=217.0s)]
*  Well, I was thinking that about like Ralphie May used to have the most fucking gigantic calves. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=222.0s)]
*  And I was like, Ralphie, if you lost weight, you'd be able to kick through a fucking wall. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=228.0s)]
*  Bro, check these fuckers. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=232.0s)]
*  Have you seen these little bad boys? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=233.0s)]
*  Let me see these bad boys. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=235.0s)]
*  Come on, dude. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=236.0s)]
*  This is awesome. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=237.0s)]
*  This is what I'm coming on the show for. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=238.0s)]
*  Huh? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=239.0s)]
*  Calfs. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=240.0s)]
*  Check these fuckers out. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=241.0s)]
*  Let me see the calves. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=242.0s)]
*  Would I put them up here? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=243.0s)]
*  Yeah, up there. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=244.0s)]
*  Oh, Jesus Christ. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=245.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=246.0s)]
*  That's massive. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=249.0s)]
*  Look at those. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=250.0s)]
*  But it makes sense. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=251.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=252.0s)]
*  I mean, you're basically rucking all day. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=253.0s)]
*  What's rucking? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=255.0s)]
*  Rucking is like when guys hike with a heavy, heavy, heavy backpack. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=256.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=259.0s)]
*  It's great cardio. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=260.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=261.0s)]
*  Yeah, you're rucking. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=262.0s)]
*  I'm doing a 34-year ruck. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=263.0s)]
*  We're shedding it any day now. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=266.0s)]
*  Bro, if you lost weight, you'd have fucking tremendous leg power. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=268.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=271.0s)]
*  I got to get in there. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=272.0s)]
*  Burt looks great. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=274.0s)]
*  He really does. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=276.0s)]
*  He sent us a picture today. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=277.0s)]
*  He's down to 230. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=278.0s)]
*  He drinks one day a week. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=280.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=281.0s)]
*  And he says he's on a strict carnivore diet. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=282.0s)]
*  Andrew, do you think his vices will undertake him? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=285.0s)]
*  He'll fall apart. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=288.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=289.0s)]
*  He's got no chance. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=290.0s)]
*  He just says he's going to gain it all back. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=291.0s)]
*  This is the montage? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=292.0s)]
*  He's going to gain it all back just so he can try to lose it again because he has something [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=293.0s)]
*  to do. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=296.0s)]
*  Oh, God. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=297.0s)]
*  That is so silly. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=298.0s)]
*  How about being on a constant world tour? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=299.0s)]
*  Is that something to do, Burt? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=301.0s)]
*  Yeah, that seems a little lunatic to do. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=302.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=305.0s)]
*  Well, you know, when I met Burt, Burt didn't have any money. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=306.0s)]
*  And now Burt is rolling in dough. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=309.0s)]
*  And I just think he just likes that too much and he wants that to keep coming. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=311.0s)]
*  And it's like, you know, to go from a guy who, you know, really didn't do well on the [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=315.0s)]

*  Right. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=347.0s)]
*  It is kind of like that, right? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=348.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=350.0s)]

*  He's very happy. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=353.0s)]
*  Yeah, you can't even. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=354.0s)]
*  You can't deny him that. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=355.0s)]
*  My instinct is to be like, dude, you got to slow down. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=356.0s)]
*  But I was with him. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=361.0s)]

*  And I was like, I have to go do an arena right now. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=376.0s)]
*  I just want to chill, man. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=379.0s)]
*  This is too much. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=382.0s)]
*  Well, he has a different constitution than most humans. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=383.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=386.0s)]
*  It's got to be genetic. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=387.0s)]
*  There's something going on there that he must have a long line of people from his ancestry [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=389.0s)]
*  that imbibed in alcohol. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=394.0s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=395.0s)]
*  He could just put it away. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=396.0s)]
*  No, it's crazy. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=397.0s)]
*  And he could put it away and just be hanging out with you. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=398.0s)]
*  And you're like, how many fucking drinks have you had? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=400.0s)]
*  Him and Gillis. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=402.0s)]
*  Shane's out of control. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=403.0s)]
*  Bro, he sat here with Ari and when Ari tried to go beer for beer with him, and he was 16, 17 beers in, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=404.0s)]
*  and the guy doesn't even have to slur his words. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=413.0s)]
*  Also, he's giant. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=415.0s)]
*  He's huge. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=416.0s)]
*  He's a big fucking dude. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=417.0s)]
*  And also, Ari's a lot of flesh. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=418.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=420.0s)]
*  Ari's a sickly old man. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=421.0s)]
*  That's elder abuse to do that to Ari. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=422.0s)]
*  Ari seems like he's 50 years older than me and he's younger than me by quite a bit. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=426.0s)]
*  He's at least 10 years younger than me, right? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=431.0s)]
*  How old is Ari? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=433.0s)]
*  Yeah, wait. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=434.0s)]
*  I think Ari's like 45? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=435.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=437.0s)]
*  Well, Google Ari Shaffir. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=438.0s)]
*  Yeah, James looking up into the sky instead of... [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=440.0s)]
*  What do you think that page looks like? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=443.0s)]
*  What do you think that search looks like? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=444.0s)]
*  You Google Ari Shaffir, it's probably 49. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=445.0s)]
*  49? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=448.0s)]
*  49. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=449.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=450.0s)]
*  He's a man whose, like, his genes are he should be a rabbi. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=451.0s)]
*  I mean, he looks like a rabbi. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=455.0s)]
*  What, he was on his way? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=457.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's what he was going to do. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=458.0s)]
*  I mean, he was literally studying the Talmud like 12 hours a day. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=459.0s)]
*  He did the whole deal. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=463.0s)]
*  He went to Israel and he was on his way. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=465.0s)]
*  He was very religious. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=468.0s)]
*  When I met him, he was just breaking out of that. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=470.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=473.0s)]
*  How long ago is this? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=474.0s)]
*  Boy, when did Ari first start coming to the store? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=475.0s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=479.0s)]
*  That's not a rabbi. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=480.0s)]
*  Look at his beard. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=481.0s)]
*  The beard's amazing. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=483.0s)]
*  The beard's so good. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=484.0s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=485.0s)]
*  His posture. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=486.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=487.0s)]
*  The beard's incredible. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=488.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=489.0s)]
*  I think I met him, boy, I guess it had to have been in the 2000s. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=490.0s)]
*  Makes sense. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=499.0s)]
*  Like, maybe 2000, 2001. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=500.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=502.0s)]
*  So that was somewhere around 23 years ago. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=503.0s)]
*  Yeah, Ari was like 25. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=508.0s)]
*  And he had lost his religion. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=511.0s)]
*  I'm not sure, because we didn't really start talking about that until afterwards when we became better friends. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=514.0s)]
*  I just knew him as a door guy at the store. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=520.0s)]
*  Just a really smart dude. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=523.0s)]
*  I remember talking to him like, oh, motherfucker's on the ball. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=525.0s)]
*  He's smart. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=527.0s)]
*  Yeah, before 23 years of destroying his brain. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=528.0s)]
*  Well, he's still smart as fuck. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=531.0s)]
*  But it's like, you know, when you talk to people, for me at least, when I'm talking to like a door guy or an open micro guy, I have all the hope in the world for you. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=534.0s)]
*  I really do. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=545.0s)]
*  But there's some dudes you talk to, you're like, oh, this guy's so dull. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=546.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's not happening. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=550.0s)]
*  He's dull. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=551.0s)]
*  His mind's not working well. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=552.0s)]
*  Or he's just like leaping to stupid conclusions. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=553.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=555.0s)]
*  Or he doesn't have a thing. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=556.0s)]
*  You try and slip him an HVAC. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=557.0s)]
*  You never know. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=558.0s)]
*  You never fucking know. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=559.0s)]
*  A brochure for an HVAC. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=560.0s)]
*  You never know. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=561.0s)]
*  I'm like, I'm going to go to the bathroom, fucking find mushrooms and crack through. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=562.0s)]
*  That's how they do it. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=565.0s)]
*  It does. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=566.0s)]
*  It does happen. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=567.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=568.0s)]
*  I've seen some guys, like, he's not going to make it. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=569.0s)]
*  And they make it. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=570.0s)]
*  And like, wow. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=571.0s)]
*  But you kind of look at them like a salmon going upriver. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=572.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=575.0s)]
*  Like, how many of you motherfuckers get past the grizzlies? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=576.0s)]
*  You're a bear food baby. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=577.0s)]
*  That's coming out of a motherfucker's fangs. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=580.0s)]
*  But I remember talking to Ari the first time I talked to him. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=582.0s)]
*  And I was like, oh, this fucking dude's clever. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=585.0s)]
*  He's smart. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=587.0s)]
*  And then once we became friends and he started telling me his background, then I was fascinated. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=588.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=593.0s)]
*  So what made you give up on this? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=594.0s)]
*  You know? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=596.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=597.0s)]
*  I know he's talked about it. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=598.0s)]
*  I don't remember the exact, whether it was a moment or it was multiple moments where [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=599.0s)]
*  he gave up on it. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=603.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=604.0s)]
*  Maybe getting pussy for the first time. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=605.0s)]
*  But bro. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=606.0s)]
*  Is he such a freak? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=607.0s)]
*  Do you imagine? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=608.0s)]
*  Yeah, I wonder when he got pussy. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=609.0s)]
*  But I think it was like when he was like 25. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=610.0s)]
*  But his fucking special Jew is so good. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=613.0s)]
*  Well, that's what I was going to say about what this conversation we're having. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=616.0s)]
*  Not only was it so good and it was like so interesting to hear from that, but I also [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=619.0s)]
*  felt like he just scratched the surface. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=623.0s)]
*  I feel like there's so much more in that self-reflection. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=625.0s)]

*  After COVID, I was like, oh, this might be the end. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=1390.24s)]
*  This might be just like when you go to visit Greece and the Parthenon. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=1392.82s)]
*  You're like, what happened? [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=1395.6399999999999s)]

*  He looks remarkably chill, I have to say. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=1405.92s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=1409.48s)]
*  Look at the size of their arrows. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=1410.92s)]
*  The arrows are like seven feet long. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=1412.92s)]
*  That's nuts. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=1414.6s)]

*  But they're pointing at random shit. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=1423.64s)]
*  Look, they're looking down their scope. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=1425.28s)]
*  Look where he's pointing to. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=1427.08s)]
*  They're pointing at their friends. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=1428.68s)]

*  Look at him. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=1435.68s)]
*  He's got a good trigger discipline, though. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=1436.68s)]
*  The guy pointing at his friends has good trigger discipline. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=1439.28s)]
*  But the guy to his right, to his right, to the left, that guy's got his fucking... [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=1442.08s)]
*  I can see the tension in his finger from here. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=1447.04s)]
*  That guy looks awesome. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=1449.08s)]

*  They're like, Mark, you get the little gun. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=1452.08s)]
*  We don't trust you with the fucking cool shit. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=1453.44s)]

*  Brutal stuff. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=1458.16s)]
*  Ten months of that? [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=1459.16s)]
*  Fuck. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=1460.16s)]
*  And how do they get you out without getting killed and them killing you? [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=1461.16s)]
*  It's probably really hard to do. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=1465.18s)]
*  Because they realize how valuable it is to have some westerner that they've got kidnapped. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=1467.74s)]
*  What is the whole deal? [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=1473.42s)]
*  What do they want? [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=1474.42s)]
*  I'll try to find something out. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=1475.42s)]
*  This is probably not going to show it on this article. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=1476.94s)]
*  What are the demands? [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=1480.64s)]
*  I was involved in talks to free a kidnapped Kiwi pilot. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=1481.64s)]
*  Is that him? [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=1484.74s)]

*  He's going to die. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=1509.3s)]
*  I was hoping maybe they'd want a couple fucking hot pockets. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=1510.3s)]
*  Maybe some Nutter Butters. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=1512.22s)]
*  Recognize our independence. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=1513.9s)]

*  That guy's done. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=1518.9s)]
*  Yeah, he's got no chance. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=1519.9s)]
*  That's ridiculous. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=1521.1s)]
*  Or you could just be like, all right, we did it. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=1523.14s)]
*  Like truly. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=1526.26s)]
*  It's a promising picture. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=1527.26s)]
*  Yeah, they're holding hands. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=1528.26s)]
*  They're holding hands. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=1529.26s)]
*  That's cute. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=1530.26s)]
*  Well, maybe they like the guy now. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=1531.26s)]
*  He seems like a chill guy, to be honest with you. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=1532.62s)]
*  Well, he probably legitimately is there trying to help people. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=1535.54s)]
*  So he's probably a good dude, which sucks even more that he got got got. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=1538.26s)]
*  Not some guy trying to start new slavery and pop up. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=1544.06s)]
*  Some guy who's over there trafficking Filipino girls. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=1548.54s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=1551.26s)]
*  Let him go. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=1552.78s)]
*  Why don't they fake a news broadcast? [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=1554.5s)]

*  Of course, yeah. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2144.34s)]
*  So you leave these books out pretending that you're like worldly. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2145.84s)]
*  You know what's so funny is that I have like an e-reader thing and I was reading like, you know, some book about, I was reading like about Goodfellas or like, you know, some trashy like, you're not even trashy but like a detective thing and then I switched it up to like, you know, something smart on the outside. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2147.84s)]
*  Some shit about like civil rights or something like that. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2163.84s)]
*  So the people would know, you can switch it on the outside? [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2168.84s)]
*  You can switch it on the outside. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2170.84s)]
*  I have done, I've done that before. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2171.84s)]
*  What does the outside look like? [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2173.84s)]
*  It's just like a screen. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2175.34s)]
*  Because an outside screen too? [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2177.34s)]
*  Yeah, just the screen, right, of the e-reader and it'll just show what you're reading. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2179.34s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2183.34s)]
*  And I was reading like, you know, like I said, some fucking book about, you know, oh I was reading about the Phoenix Sun, Seven Seconds or Less. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2184.34s)]
*  I read a lot of basketball books, you know, that kind of shit. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2190.34s)]
*  And then a girl was coming around and I was like, let's do some fucking, I don't even know what I had. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2192.34s)]
*  Some book I started, never even finished. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2196.34s)]
*  I was like, let's get this book. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2198.34s)]
*  Let's pretend I'm smart. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2200.34s)]
*  Or even like shit girls like, like a Murakami book, you know. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2201.84s)]
*  What's a Murakami book? [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2204.84s)]
*  He's good, dude. Those are good books. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2205.84s)]
*  They're like dreamy Japanese book. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2207.84s)]
*  Back to the Japanese thing. I don't know. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2209.84s)]
*  It's a book about, the guy does a lot of like magic, it's like some magical realism shit. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2211.84s)]
*  It's all about, it's always like a guy who, there's always like an insane woman who has like BPD and he always, it's always some nerd. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2216.84s)]
*  And in the book, the nerd always fucks the girl really well. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2225.84s)]
*  I don't know what that is about. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2228.84s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2229.84s)]
*  These are men without women. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2231.34s)]
*  Haruki Murakami, great stuff. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2233.34s)]
*  What I talk about when I talk about running. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2235.34s)]
*  I haven't read that one. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2237.34s)]
*  Norwegian Wood. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2239.34s)]
*  Norwegian Wood's good. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2240.34s)]
*  I know that guy. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2241.34s)]
*  I've seen his work. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2242.34s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2243.34s)]
*  It's blurred out but it's good. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2244.34s)]
*  He's the reason why Ron Jeremy had a career. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2246.34s)]

*  Yeah, in Norwegian Wood, he fucks two. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2254.34s)]
*  He fucks an old lady and a young woman. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2257.34s)]
*  Wow. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2259.34s)]
*  That shows you what I'm getting out of literature by the way. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2260.34s)]
*  It's just that who's the main character just getting pussy out of it. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2262.84s)]
*  There's some fucking like professor listening to this like that guy's dumb as shit. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2265.84s)]
*  That's what he gets out of Murakami but what can I say? [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2270.34s)]
*  Hey. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2272.84s)]
*  They're nice dream-like books. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2273.84s)]
*  Art is open to interpretation. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2274.84s)]
*  Different people get different things. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2276.34s)]
*  I'm a simple man. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2277.84s)]
*  I see things through one lens. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2278.84s)]
*  You should be you. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2280.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2281.34s)]
*  You and me. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2282.34s)]
*  You should be those motherfuckers. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2283.34s)]
*  How many professors of your method are happy? [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2284.34s)]
*  They seem perpetually conflicted. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2286.34s)]
*  Yeah, just the ones who fuck their students I'm pretty sure. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2289.34s)]
*  And they can't do that anymore. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2292.34s)]
*  That was like the main reason to be a professor. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2293.34s)]
*  Back in the Feynman days, those guys all banged their graduate students. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2296.34s)]
*  That was like part of the thing. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2301.34s)]
*  You get these really hot 22 year old students that are enamored by this amazing professor with his PhD. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2303.34s)]
*  Full library of books that he probably hasn't read even. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2310.34s)]
*  He actually probably has read them which is even more incredible. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2313.34s)]
*  He's not running a scam. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2316.34s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2317.34s)]
*  That's the payoff. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2318.34s)]
*  Yeah, you think in the application process or the interview process, they're like, look, we can't offer you that much money. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2319.34s)]
*  But here's a picture of all the girls that got in this year. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2326.34s)]
*  Here's the quality. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2329.34s)]
*  No, not only do they get paid well, they get tenure. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2331.34s)]
*  So they can't even get fired. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2334.34s)]
*  But I bet they can get fired now if they bang their students. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2336.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2338.34s)]
*  Also, I feel like higher ed in general is fucked. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2339.34s)]
*  When do you think they stop banging their students? [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2342.34s)]
*  Was it the same time they stopped fucking kids? [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2344.34s)]
*  Definitely after that. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2346.34s)]
*  More recent? [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2347.34s)]
*  I think that was more recent. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2348.34s)]
*  I think people are still picking their spots and fucking their students. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2349.34s)]
*  Really? [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2353.34s)]
*  I think it's up to grad student now though. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2354.34s)]
*  I don't think you can fuck an undergrad. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2356.34s)]
*  When I was in high school, my friend, she was 17, she was dating a Spanish teacher. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2358.34s)]
*  That guy should go to jail. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2362.34s)]
*  He was cool. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2364.34s)]
*  He was the cool Spanish teacher. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2366.34s)]
*  Oh, he's bringing in paella. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2368.34s)]
*  He was like 25. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2369.34s)]
*  I mean, relatively, the age gap wasn't that big. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2371.34s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2375.34s)]
*  Still, she's a student at the school. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2376.34s)]
*  But she was a little predator. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2378.34s)]
*  Yeah, she was. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2380.34s)]
*  I think at that time, that's the last hurrah. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2386.34s)]
*  The 80s? [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2389.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2390.34s)]
*  Once people started reading about the effects of it, like, hey. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2391.34s)]
*  This is kind of strange. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2393.34s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2395.34s)]
*  Maybe fuck a 21-year-old. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2396.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2398.34s)]
*  Also, if you're a teacher and you can affect their grades, how often does that happen? [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2399.34s)]
*  That must have been a big factor. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2405.34s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2407.34s)]
*  Big factor. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2408.34s)]
*  You're a professor. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2410.34s)]
*  If you're banging a student, you give her A's. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2412.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2414.34s)]
*  It seems, you know. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2415.34s)]
*  And if she's a sociopath and she just wants to get ahead no matter what. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2416.34s)]
*  Sure. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2419.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2420.34s)]
*  Look, there's definitely ... It's the thing where you're like, the guy's got to stop it [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2421.34s)]
*  because it's like, yeah, just because somebody wants to fuck you doesn't mean it's right. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2425.34s)]
*  Well, it's also like if you're a professor and you're ... I mean, literally, that's like [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2428.34s)]
*  you're setting up their career. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2434.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2436.34s)]
*  And you just hold too much juice over whether or not they're going to get an A and whether [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2437.34s)]
*  or not that's going to allow them. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2443.34s)]
*  And the power dynamics are all fucked. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2444.34s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2445.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2446.34s)]
*  But it's also corruption because without a doubt, there has been grades that were given [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2447.34s)]
*  to people that professors fucked that they didn't deserve. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2454.34s)]
*  Without a doubt. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2456.34s)]
*  Without question. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2457.34s)]
*  Without question. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2458.34s)]
*  Without question. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2459.34s)]
*  I need to do zero research to make this confident. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2460.34s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2461.34s)]
*  I'm with you. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2462.34s)]
*  I'm doubling down. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2463.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2464.34s)]
*  So that alone, it's like imagine if you hire someone for a firm and you're like, look, [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2465.34s)]
*  she's got straight A's. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2468.34s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2469.34s)]
*  And then she gets into the job and she's like, she's a moron. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2470.34s)]
*  Like, what happened? [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2473.34s)]
*  Yes. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2474.34s)]
*  She fucked everybody. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2475.34s)]
*  Maybe that's the pay gap. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2476.34s)]
*  Well, they used to. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2477.34s)]
*  You know, it started there. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2478.34s)]
*  There was an ad from like the 1950s about a secretary and it was something about has [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2479.34s)]
*  your boss been ignoring you? [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2485.34s)]
*  Maybe you needed to change your smell and like put different fucking deodorant on and [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2487.34s)]
*  shit. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2491.34s)]
*  But literally they were advertising that a secretary's like that that was the goal that [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2492.34s)]
*  a secretary had. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2497.34s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2503.34s)]
*  Going to college and being a secretary for a while was just like, all right, if you don't [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2504.34s)]
*  graduate with an English degree and a husband, you fucking wasted your four years. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2507.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2512.34s)]
*  I wonder if we're going to look back in the future about women entering into the workforce [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2513.34s)]
*  and like being forced to do of anyone's going to make a long term analysis of this shift [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2518.34s)]
*  in culture that that brought about because it pretty between that and birth control. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2524.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2529.34s)]

*  Totally. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2534.34s)]
*  Entirely. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2535.34s)]
*  Like, you know, every time you have sex, you don't have to worry about getting knocked [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2536.34s)]
*  up every time. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2539.34s)]
*  Imagine if you're a woman. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2540.34s)]

*  Yeah, I don't think we should do this. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2543.34s)]
*  You don't have a condom. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2544.34s)]
*  It's like, don't worry about pull out. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2545.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2547.34s)]
*  And meanwhile, you might have a fucking human life grow inside you. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2548.34s)]
*  That's and he's he's going to whack off six hours from now. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2551.34s)]
*  Hundred percent. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2554.34s)]

*  Trying to get the poison out. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2558.34s)]
*  And if you're a guy and you know, when when back in those days when I mean, you got to [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2559.34s)]
*  imagine it's hard for us to even contextualize what it must have been like before birth control. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2565.34s)]
*  And then there's the other thing. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2570.34s)]
*  The birth control pill is fucking terrible for them. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2571.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2574.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2575.34s)]
*  Terrible for them. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2576.34s)]
*  No, I know a lot of a lot of my friends will just go out there like it's not worth it. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2577.34s)]
*  Like if you get out of you get out of your early 20s, no kid. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2580.34s)]
*  You're like, all right, I can't do this to my fucking body anymore. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2583.34s)]
*  Well, it changes the way you view the world. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2586.34s)]
*  It changes the way what women are attracted to. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2589.34s)]
*  It changes everything. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2591.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2592.34s)]
*  You're take you're you're ingesting a pill that tricks your body into thinking you're [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2593.34s)]
*  already pregnant, which is just not. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2597.34s)]
*  So you're walking around perpetually pregnant. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2600.34s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2602.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2603.34s)]
*  So you just want like to feel safe, I guess. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2604.34s)]
*  I wonder. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2605.34s)]
*  I mean, it's got to have some I mean, there must be a way to I mean, with really intelligent [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2606.34s)]
*  women to rationalize and understand what's going on. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2611.34s)]
*  But for a lot of them, that shift in the hormonal balance, it has a significant impact on what [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2614.34s)]
*  you do. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2620.34s)]
*  A hundred. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2621.34s)]
*  I mean, it does make sense. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2622.34s)]
*  I wonder why the fuck we don't have any like sign me up for the guy pill. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2623.34s)]
*  Let me know why. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2626.34s)]
*  Why? [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2627.34s)]
*  Because the guy pill kills your testosterone. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2628.34s)]
*  They gave a guy pill and the guy turned the guy trans. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2630.34s)]
*  The shoulders slumped. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2634.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2636.34s)]

*  I feel like on the lens. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2643.34s)]
*  I feel like there's no other way. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2645.34s)]
*  There's got to be. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2647.34s)]
*  Is there like some fake vasectomy shit you could do? [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2648.34s)]
*  Well, there's a real vasectomy that you can do. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2650.34s)]
*  Guys can get their tubes tied and they supposedly can put them back together again. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2652.34s)]
*  But it's not 100 percent. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2656.34s)]
*  Yeah, they might not. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2658.34s)]
*  I mean, it might be scar tissue. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2659.34s)]
*  You don't want to freeze my frozen nuts not coming out. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2661.34s)]
*  Thought nice kind of psychopath baby. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2665.34s)]

*  Bro, have you ever read in how many doctors use their own jizz and it's not. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2675.34s)]
*  It's nuts. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2679.34s)]
*  What's even the fucking the psychology of that is insane to me. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2680.34s)]
*  I mean, I guess because it's like you think it's an animalistic thing to want to to like spread your seed right on some like evolutionary level. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2684.34s)]
*  But we've taken your eight steps away from that. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2692.34s)]
*  Right. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2695.34s)]
*  Well, you're not even getting like I could see the weird trying to fuck your patients. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2696.34s)]

*  Well, they don't even want to know the kids. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2702.34s)]
*  That's even more insane. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2704.34s)]
*  They just literally want their shit out there. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2705.34s)]
*  Well, Brett Weinstein, who's an evolutionary biologist, he he explained to me the difference between beautiful and hot. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2709.34s)]
*  He goes, you know, the difference between beautiful and hot. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2716.34s)]
*  I'm like, there's a difference. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2718.34s)]
*  Yeah. Like, what's the difference? [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2720.34s)]
*  He goes, hot is someone that's not going to require anything from you. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2721.34s)]
*  You could just have sex with them right away. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2726.34s)]
*  And that from an evolutionary perspective gives you an opportunity to spread your seed without having any sort of commitment. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2728.34s)]
*  Yes. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2737.34s)]
*  Whereas beautiful is someone that you want to settle down with and commit with. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2738.34s)]
*  Renaissance painting, a little chubby lady in the corner. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2741.34s)]

*  Yeah, I guess I also I guess I consider like hot more almost like dangerous on some level, too. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=2752.34s)]

*  Because of legal reasons, Smith couldn't talk further about the altercation. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=4256.1s)]

*  say you do skits. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=4753.0199999999995s)]

*  Right. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=4756.0199999999995s)]
*  And like somebody like like Drusky is really funny. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=4757.0199999999995s)]
*  That guy's hilarious. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=4759.74s)]

*  But then you see other people who don't have that like imagination. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=4768.58s)]
*  They don't want to work hard and craft their own special live show. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=4771.34s)]

*  Just yeah. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=4792.18s)]
*  But hypothetically a guy like that. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=4793.18s)]
*  It happens and they have no stage presence. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=4795.74s)]
*  They have nothing interesting about them. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=4798.02s)]
*  And all of a sudden they can sell out a fucking improv for the weekend. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=4800.22s)]
*  And now hopefully organically people will stop going to see them if they're bullshit. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=4804.22s)]
*  Or they can figure it out. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=4810.1s)]
*  Like come up with something that they can do. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=4812.38s)]
*  Maybe show video clips. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=4814.66s)]

*  Have a projector behind them. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=4817.62s)]
*  Somewhere they can juice it up. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=4819.62s)]

*  Somewhere they can juice it up. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=4824.62s)]
*  More often than not though I think if they figure it out they become hacks. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=4825.62s)]

*  There was a bunch of comics that really were like lounge acts but not a lounge act like [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5157.24s)]
*  a lounge act comedian like a lounge act comic like they weren't even really comedians. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5164.599999999999s)]

*  They would just laugh. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5178.639999999999s)]
*  And so they would pick premises that other people had covered and some of them were like [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5179.639999999999s)]
*  arrogant. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5184.92s)]

*  Like you're fucking terrible. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5186.92s)]
*  But they had this weird sort of way of delivering material that sounded like they were comedians. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5190.36s)]
*  They had their sleeves rolled up. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5196.4s)]
*  They would talk about things. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5197.88s)]
*  Little blazer. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5199.24s)]
*  God there was a lot of them. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5200.24s)]

*  Something like that. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5205.719999999999s)]
*  They had a way of talking that made them sound like a comedian. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5206.719999999999s)]
*  And there was a lot of them. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5210.92s)]
*  And some of them were headliners. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5212.48s)]
*  It was crazy. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5213.48s)]

*  It was like the whole world wanted comedy. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5216.24s)]
*  And then it kind of died off. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5219.16s)]
*  And then it died off and a bunch of the clubs went under and all the TV shows dried up. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5220.92s)]
*  There used to be like Evening at the Improv and MTV Half Hour Comedy Hour and all these [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5225.28s)]
*  different shows where you could go on and you could do five minutes and if you killed [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5228.92s)]
*  all of a sudden you're headline on the road. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5234.44s)]

*  So that's TikTok back then. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5239.08s)]
*  Something like that. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5240.88s)]
*  Something like a five minute spot. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5241.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5242.88s)]
*  Something like that. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5243.88s)]
*  And then you could do the road. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5244.88s)]
*  And so you wanted to have some sort of a credit. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5245.88s)]
*  Like if they saw you, oh Evening at the Improv. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5248.36s)]
*  Oh, let's go see you. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5250.36s)]
*  And then you had a credit. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5251.36s)]
*  And hopefully you could put together 45 minutes and close. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5252.4s)]
*  But there was it was so many comedians. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5256.0s)]
*  But it wasn't the quality that there are today. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5259.08s)]
*  Not even close. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5261.839999999999s)]
*  Like there are so many at the top end. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5262.839999999999s)]
*  Like back then at the top end, there was a dozen. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5265.96s)]
*  Like the NBA in the 50s. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5270.48s)]
*  Right. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5272.0s)]
*  It's like five of those guys can play today. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5273.0s)]
*  But most of them were fucking dog shit. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5276.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5278.839999999999s)]
*  There was like, you know, there was maybe a dozen. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5280.08s)]
*  Like real good comics. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5284.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5285.360000000001s)]

*  But also it's just it's the natural order of things. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5291.92s)]
*  It's like as long as something goes on, shit's going to get better. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5293.8s)]
*  I mean, I do think about sports as the analogy. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5297.0s)]
*  Like I mean, UFC, UFC 1 is one of the funniest things of all time, where it's like a guy [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5299.32s)]
*  with one boxing glove. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5304.72s)]

*  Or a jimerson. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5307.04s)]
*  It flies forward to now and it's like you have like, you know, fucking, you know, the [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5308.2s)]
*  fucking all the the Dagestani motherfuckers are just trained to destroy people. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5313.4s)]
*  It's like you drop that guy in the UFC one. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5318.8s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5321.56s)]
*  It's like fucking crazy. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5322.56s)]
*  Yeah, they would steamroll everybody. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5323.88s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5325.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5326.12s)]
*  But that sport is the most obvious example of something that is almost unrecognizable [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5327.12s)]
*  from 30 years ago. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5331.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5332.16s)]
*  Because the first UFC was 30 years ago. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5333.16s)]
*  Wow. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5334.44s)]
*  If you go to 1993 to 2023, the difference is so fucking stark. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5335.44s)]
*  Yeah, I think the people are so good now. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5340.759999999999s)]

*  And it's just so funny to watch like Ken because we were wrestling fans. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5348.799999999999s)]
*  And it's like, I heard Ken Shamrock fought in this thing. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5351.839999999999s)]
*  That was the draw for us for me and my brothers. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5354.5199999999995s)]
*  And you just watch and you're like, what the fuck is this? [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5356.24s)]
*  World's most dangerous man. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5359.08s)]
*  And they were fighting every day or they all those fights happen in one day. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5361.599999999999s)]
*  They had multiple fights in a day. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5365.2s)]
*  That's fucking wild. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5366.52s)]
*  Yeah, they did a lot of those. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5367.52s)]
*  Yeah, they did a lot of those up until like the late 90s. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5369.0s)]
*  And then they started doing individual matches. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5372.96s)]
*  So were you fighting when you were trying also like starting comedy? [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5375.84s)]
*  Was that like your dual? [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5379.36s)]
*  Yes. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5380.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5381.36s)]
*  I had three kickboxing fights while I was still doing stand up. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5382.36s)]
*  But then I realized I can't do it. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5385.28s)]
*  I wasn't all and I was not all in in fighting or comedy. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5387.52s)]
*  Right. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5391.32s)]
*  So all not being all in and fighting is fucking dangerous. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5392.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5394.48s)]
*  You know, you get stomped and then not being all in in comedy. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5395.48s)]
*  It's like, what am I doing? [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5398.44s)]
*  Like, why am I doing this? [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5399.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5400.44s)]
*  I mean, there's plenty of guys like that getting drunk, [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5401.44s)]
*  trying to get pussy after open mics. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5403.32s)]
*  But it was really just not knowing what I wanted to do with my life [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5405.28s)]
*  and not being very good at comedy and still like I was still pretty good at fighting. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5408.32s)]
*  So it was like it was easier at the time. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5412.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I was like, maybe this is maybe this is what I should do. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5414.16s)]
*  Maybe I should go all into that. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5416.36s)]
*  But with fighting, if you have a thought in your head [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5417.679999999999s)]
*  that you maybe shouldn't be doing this, you better get out now. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5421.44s)]
*  Really should get out now. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5424.76s)]
*  Even that much down. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5425.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5427.76s)]
*  It kills you. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5428.76s)]
*  Because the guys who don't have that much doubt are going to fuck you up. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5429.76s)]
*  Because the guy like me when I was 20 would have fucked up me when I was 22. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5431.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5436.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5437.76s)]
*  You know, because I was a different person. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5438.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5439.76s)]
*  When I when I was all in, that's all I did. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5440.76s)]
*  And I breathe. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5443.04s)]
*  I would wake up in the middle of the night kicking. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5445.679999999999s)]
*  I would have fucking kicking dreams. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5447.76s)]
*  So I literally like throw kicks in the middle of the night. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5449.76s)]

*  And head kicks. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5455.84s)]
*  But it was just I didn't know what I was going to do. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5457.28s)]
*  And I was like, I don't know if I can really make it as a comedian. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5461.08s)]
*  And then I just had to I had to pick one or the other. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5464.08s)]
*  You just get your shit split once and you were like, I lost my last fight. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=5466.72s)]

*  So God, this is how you got to get your weight in it to generate more power. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6552.4800000000005s)]
*  The problem is you're hitting it and then you're bouncing off. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6555.72s)]
*  And you want to bounce off, you want to drive through. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6558.160000000001s)]
*  So me, I'm teaching you to teach this guy how to kill. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6559.76s)]
*  Teach this guy how to smash. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6561.68s)]
*  God damn. It's crazy. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6563.88s)]
*  How old were you? [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6565.6s)]
*  I guess 19, somewhere around. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6567.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that was before I ever did comedy. [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6570.68s)]
*  And that was when I was at my most insane with martial arts. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6573.6s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Whereas I just got out of high school. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6578.280000000001s)]
*  I had all the time in the world now. [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6581.04s)]
*  And when you're 19, that kind of shit is cool. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6583.0s)]
*  Yeah, I lived at home until I was 20. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6584.84s)]
*  So still, I still didn't have bills, really. Right. [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6586.56s)]
*  And I was traveling all over the country fighting. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6589.72s)]
*  That's what I was doing. So and I taught. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6592.04s)]
*  So I was teaching at Boston University. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6594.68s)]
*  I had a credited course. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6597.08s)]
*  So it was the J. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6598.72s)]
*  Kim Takwan no Institute was a very prestigious place that I went to in Boston. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6600.16s)]
*  And they, you know, they had developed like a bunch of national champions. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6604.599999999999s)]
*  Michael Malley and John Lee and guys who represented the United States [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6609.04s)]
*  in major world competitions. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6613.0s)]
*  So it was like an elite gym. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6614.68s)]
*  I just got lucky that I found this place. [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6615.84s)]
*  It was where you were. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6617.72s)]
*  That's where I started. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6619.599999999999s)]
*  No, I was I was. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6620.8s)]
*  It wasn't even anywhere near my house. [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6621.84s)]
*  Oh, really? I was coming home from a baseball game with a buddy of mine. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6623.28s)]
*  And as we were coming home, we were waiting to get on the T. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6626.36s)]
*  The T is like the public. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6629.92s)]
*  Yeah. So I was 15 and maybe 14. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6631.4800000000005s)]
*  And so we were just walking down the street and we were. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6634.360000000001s)]
*  There were so many people that were going to get on the T. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6637.88s)]
*  The line was going to be crazy. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6639.52s)]
*  And so we said, let's go check this karate place out. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6640.92s)]
*  And I walked up the stairs. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6644.76s)]
*  And as I was walking up the stairs, I caught at the perfect moment, [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6647.0s)]
*  one of the best guys in the world training. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6651.4400000000005s)]
*  Damn. So this guy, John Lee. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6654.16s)]
*  And John Lee was the national one hundred seventy five pound champion. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6656.56s)]
*  And he was preparing to fight in the World Cup. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6661.4400000000005s)]
*  So as I'm going up the stairs, I'm hearing this sound. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6665.240000000001s)]
*  And this sound is a whoop, kachin, whoop, kachin. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6668.52s)]
*  Yeah. And that whoop is him kicking the bag. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6673.320000000001s)]
*  And the kachin is the chains rattling as his bag goes flying through the air. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6676.6s)]
*  So he's got a hundred pound heavy bag. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6681.92s)]
*  And he's sending this thing into the air. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6684.200000000001s)]
*  And I remember watching going, this is insane. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6686.92s)]
*  Yeah. You had no idea you're watching the best in the world. [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6690.240000000001s)]
*  I had no idea. You're like, I can not just the best of the world, [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6692.280000000001s)]
*  but one of the best in the world in his prime, [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6694.96s)]
*  fully prepared for the world championships. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6698.240000000001s)]
*  So he's just full training at his most focused. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6701.76s)]
*  And I'm looking at this dude and I said, I want to know how to do that. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6706.400000000001s)]
*  I had to fuck. I didn't know a person could do that. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6711.56s)]
*  He was kicking so hard. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6714.959999999999s)]
*  I'd never seen anybody kick anything hard before. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6717.5199999999995s)]
*  So for me to, and he was known for, he had the best spinning back kick in the world. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6719.959999999999s)]
*  And everybody who fought him, there was always a moment you had to wonder [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6725.48s)]
*  if he's going to spin, if you got too close and he spun, it was so fast. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6729.0s)]
*  And when it hit you, your, your liver's destroyed. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6733.4s)]
*  He would just slam his right heel into the right side of your body. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6736.759999999999s)]
*  And you would just go down like you got hit by a car. It was horrible. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6741.599999999999s)]
*  He did it to so many people and he taught me, he taught me how to do it. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6745.44s)]
*  That's why I became my number one technique learning from this guy. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6749.36s)]
*  Holy shit. Total dumb luck. Insane. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6752.24s)]
*  So that was the place that I was, I was teaching out of. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6754.92s)]
*  And that was the place where I was teaching this fucking hit man. Right. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6757.04s)]
*  Yeah. And this, I know he was a, what did the guy look like? Was he like, [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6761.24s)]
*  that was, that's the place. That's the place. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6764.28s)]
*  I, I walked up those stairs thousands of times. Damn, dude. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6765.76s)]
*  I used to teach there. That's fucking sick. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6769.16s)]
*  I taught there and then they got me the job at BU. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6771.44s)]
*  So I was 19 years old teaching kids my age, taekwondo. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6774.16s)]
*  And I just told them, I go, I'll give you an A if you just try. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6777.68s)]
*  I said, this is pass fail A. So it counts towards your GPA. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6780.88s)]
*  I go, all you have to do is show up. And if you can't make it, just tell me. [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6783.88s)]
*  I go, but if you just show up, I go, you get an A. That's awesome. Just try. Yeah. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6786.92s)]
*  And I go, we're going to have fun. I'll show you some stuff. Yeah. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6791.16s)]
*  That's a good guy to get. You're in the, you love this shit so much. [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6793.72s)]
*  You're also a kid. It was such a weird job though. [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6796.5599999999995s)]
*  Cause I was a kid going into a college to teach them this thing. Yeah. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6799.599999999999s)]
*  And I just, you know, [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6803.28s)]
*  so I always had to like put on a display before I taught. [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6804.839999999999s)]
*  To prove that you know what the fuck you're talking about. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6809.4s)]
*  Cause we had to get the court cleared and these guys are playing basketball and [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6811.679999999999s)]
*  they didn't want to give up the court a lot of times. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6815.04s)]
*  You know, it's like basketball players a lot taller than me too. [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6817.48s)]
*  So I would have some dude hold the pad and hold this like body shield. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6820.799999999999s)]
*  And I would just start wailing on that thing. And then next thing, [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6825.6s)]
*  everybody's going, what is this? Like what are you doing here? [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6829.080000000001s)]
*  You have to teach class. Yeah. So that must've been cool though. Cause you, [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6831.88s)]
*  you graduate at, you're out of high school and you're not, [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6834.68s)]
*  did you spend time on the campus at all? Or it was just to teach? [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6837.96s)]
*  Just to teach. I went to school. I was going to UMass Boston, [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6840.6s)]
*  but it was a waste of time. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6843.76s)]
*  I was literally only doing it so people didn't think I was a loser. Yeah. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6846.0s)]
*  Like I could say, Oh, I'm going to UMass. Go to college. Yeah. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6849.84s)]
*  I didn't drop out to do back kicks. Yeah. Well, [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6852.88s)]
*  there was no money in this thing that I was obsessed with. Of course. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6856.4400000000005s)]
*  The only money was there's a little bit of money like you can get by teaching, [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6859.4800000000005s)]
*  teaching, you know, but even single mothers while you teach their kids. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6862.6s)]
*  None of that. I was too young. No, I was dating girls my age. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6867.92s)]
*  I didn't get a MILF until I was 21. Ooh, what was the set up? She was 25. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6872.28s)]
*  She was one of my students. Yeah. She was, she was older than me. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6875.84s)]
*  She was like the first girl that I ever dated that used to tell me what to do. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6879.32s)]
*  And I think it was fun. Oh yeah. That's nice. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6881.68s)]
*  When you get somebody who knows what the fuck's going on. Sort of. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6883.64s)]
*  She was off by a lot. Okay. Also very judgmental, but hot. She was fun. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6886.280000000001s)]

*  She saw white snake and made me leave it in the car. She was leaving the car. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6909.92s)]
*  I'm like, what? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=6914.639999999999s)]

*  He literally fucked the piss out of them. [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7396.44s)]
*  That's awesome. And he was like, you thought I'd never amount to anything? [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7397.76s)]
*  That is wild. Okay. Here's, okay. Ready? Here about this. Okay. [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7401.12s)]
*  It has piss in it, right? But they have something else in there too, right? [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7403.96s)]
*  So whatever pussy juice they couldn't say. [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7407.68s)]
*  Yeah. Whatever's on the walls of the vagina as it comes squirting out like a [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7410.12s)]
*  geyser. There's probably detectable amounts. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7414.68s)]
*  It's probably steroids they find in supplements. You can find it. [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7416.68s)]
*  Absolutely. So here's what I posit. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7420.56s)]
*  Even if it starts as piss water, you add Kool-Aid to it. [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7422.96s)]
*  Kool-Aid powder. Now it's Kool-Aid. So the piss, [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7427.8s)]
*  you add special little concentrated pussy juice in there. Now it's squirt. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7430.96s)]
*  All right. Pissed. [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7435.6s)]
*  Maybe a couple, maybe a couple of those. [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7438.120000000001s)]
*  I'm not scared of piss, but let's just be honest about what it is. [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7439.92s)]
*  Like that wouldn't bother me if someone peed on me. [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7443.160000000001s)]
*  Agree to disagree. It's not that big a deal. I wouldn't want, [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7445.48s)]
*  I guess if it was very clear pit, I guess it was like the squirt I found. [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7448.639999999999s)]
*  Look, if you're really into a girl and you're having sex that she accidentally [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7452.2s)]
*  pees on you, are you going to stop? [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7455.24s)]
*  You know what? I actually, no. Well, have I busted yet? No. [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7456.48s)]
*  No. Let it go. Let it go. It's a fucking body fluid. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7461.48s)]
*  I will say actually, maybe I have encountered some [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7466.639999999999s)]
*  tough squirt. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7471.839999999999s)]
*  Tough squirt. [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7472.68s)]
*  Now that I'm thinking about it. [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7474.52s)]
*  Tough squirt. That should be the name of your next special. Tough squirt. [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7476.6s)]
*  Tough squirt. Oh my God, dude. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7482.6s)]
*  I have, now that we're thinking about it, it probably, [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7484.72s)]
*  and she was not hydrated and it was like, you know, [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7488.200000000001s)]
*  when you crack open crabs and it has that little yellow shit in there, [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7491.320000000001s)]
*  that was left on the fucking sheets. Yeah. And it was so frank. [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7495.4800000000005s)]
*  I couldn't get hard afterwards. [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7499.52s)]
*  I hate her pussy. And then I got like, oh my God. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7503.360000000001s)]
*  Oh man. Oh my God. And she even was like, damn, I need to drink more water. [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7509.360000000001s)]
*  Did she blast on you? Yeah, dude. In the mouth everywhere? Very much so. [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7513.6s)]
*  Oh my God. I'm just picturing this. [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7517.64s)]
*  The amount of urine depends on when the person peed last and how hydrated they are. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7521.64s)]
*  New York University sex researcher Zana Vranglova told MindBodyGreen. [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7526.240000000001s)]
*  That's a hot name too. I bet she's hot too. [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7531.24s)]
*  She sounds like the evil lady we were talking about earlier. [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7535.0s)]
*  Probably perfect features. Talking about piss. Angular big ass tits. [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7537.48s)]
*  Yeah. All right. How wild is that Japanese study though? [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7541.04s)]
*  But that's the kind of science you can get away with if you're living in a [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7544.639999999999s)]
*  country that's more open-minded. [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7547.92s)]
*  Yeah. But then again, they fucking blur out the genitals. That's the fucking trade off. [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7549.599999999999s)]
*  That's what's wild, but I'll take both. The other thing is like, [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7554.96s)]
*  the weird thing is like that this guy, how did he get that job? [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7558.64s)]
*  Did he have to audition? People just knew he was going to fall apart. [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7562.8s)]
*  It says he was recruited. Right. But how did they know he was going to get hard? [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7566.0s)]
*  Someone was sent out to recruit the best. Maybe one of the doctors was a freak. [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7568.72s)]
*  Yeah. They found this dude. You got to find the best. They were told. [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7571.160000000001s)]
*  That sounds also like the plot. [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7573.92s)]
*  This study probably was recorded and put out with blurred genitals. [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7576.72s)]
*  This sounds like the plot of a Japanese. [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7581.160000000001s)]
*  This story could be a comedy movie if we had a time machine. [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7583.04s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. You know, if we could bring it back to like 1994, [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7587.08s)]
*  when you can make a movie like this and not go to jail. Yes. Yes. [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7592.76s)]
*  And not get canceled. [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7595.96s)]
*  Like if we tried to make this movie today, the outrage would be off the charts. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7597.32s)]
*  The squirt doctor. You think he couldn't make the squirt doctor? [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7600.28s)]
*  No chance. This guy, you're going to have him finger banging these women and fuck [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7602.5199999999995s)]
*  the shit out of them, all five of them. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7607.2s)]
*  And they're hiring this guy to come in and sling dick. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7608.92s)]
*  It would probably have to be a lesbian. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7611.5199999999995s)]
*  And you find out that these women are just pissing all over him. [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7612.8s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7615.16s)]
*  And all their dreams are shattered because they thought they were squirters. [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7615.6s)]
*  They were the rare hot squirter. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7618.28s)]
*  But meanwhile, just peeing on guys. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7620.12s)]
*  And now these guys are like leaking that to the world. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7621.8s)]
*  What is on the Internet? [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7624.12s)]
*  And everybody knows just peeing on folks. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7625.0s)]
*  You just peeing on folks. [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7627.16s)]
*  The guy was hot and it's for women. [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7628.2s)]
*  There's something real piece of ass. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7630.56s)]
*  I'm sure he's probably hot. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7632.16s)]
*  They wouldn't force the women to. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7633.2s)]
*  I mean, if they forced the women to have sex with some gross guy. [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7634.72s)]
*  I made a nice discovery just now. [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7637.72s)]
*  What? I found a video of the test. [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7639.96s)]
*  No. Yeah. [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7642.84s)]
*  Put it on the actual test. [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7644.2s)]
*  Yeah, let's go. Put it on. [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7645.48s)]
*  I love learning, dude. I love science. [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7646.72s)]
*  Well, no, this can't be the fucking actual. [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7649.08s)]
*  This is it. [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7653.16s)]

*  You think it's learned behavior? [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7869.56s)]
*  I think it came about because of porn. [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7870.8s)]
*  Interesting. [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7872.96s)]

*  But it was never a thing that was discussed. [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7880.0s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7882.8s)]
*  When I was in high school, no one ever talked about a squirter. [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7883.88s)]
*  What was the... [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7887.0s)]

*  What was the wildest shit anybody did? [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7899.96s)]
*  If it was anal, the most wild shit anybody would do, [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7902.96s)]
*  there was no squirting. [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7905.2s)]
*  There was no, I think, even anal back then. [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7906.04s)]
*  It felt like a taboo. [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7909.0s)]
*  Yeah, and girls didn't shave. [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7910.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7912.36s)]

*  First mentioned in the seventh century poem, [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7916.4800000000005s)]
*  female ejaculation and the Graftenberg spot, the G spot, [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7919.56s)]
*  are described in detail in most works of Kama Sutra. [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7923.92s)]
*  In ancient Western writings, the emission of female fluid [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7927.52s)]
*  is mentioned even earlier, depicted in about 300 BC [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7930.56s)]
*  by Aristotle in the second century by Galen. [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7933.56s)]
*  So even Aristotle got duped. [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7936.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7938.280000000001s)]
*  They didn't have a piss study. [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7939.240000000001s)]
*  So this magical piss study from Japan, really? [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7940.52s)]
*  We needed the orient. [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7944.84s)]
*  Aristotle was in the dark. [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7945.8s)]
*  He's like, bro, I'm telling you, I get them to squirt. [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7947.200000000001s)]

*  There was no squirters. [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7952.160000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7953.200000000001s)]
*  No one talked about it. [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7954.280000000001s)]
*  Maybe that's why they killed Socrates, [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7955.040000000001s)]
*  because he said it was piss. [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7956.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7957.88s)]
*  They're like, shut the fuck up. [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7958.200000000001s)]
*  Probably. [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7959.48s)]

*  How did this become an issue for them, like in porn or just [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7994.12s)]
*  in movies? [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=7996.5199999999995s)]

*  Well, I find it rather distasteful [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8018.32s)]
*  when they drink the squirt. [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8020.24s)]
*  Can we make a compromise? [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8022.8s)]
*  Perhaps. [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8024.4s)]
*  I would say, what if the squirt doesn't land on anyone? [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8024.92s)]
*  What if it's only for a short duration? [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8029.2s)]
*  Let's put a time limit on the squirt. [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8031.719999999999s)]
*  I believe five seconds is sufficient. [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8034.719999999999s)]
*  A female ejaculating? [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8037.44s)]
*  Oh, no. [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8039.759999999999s)]
*  That won't do. [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8040.679999999999s)]
*  Unfortunately, it is piss. [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8043.0s)]
*  Kill him. [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8047.28s)]
*  I love this idea. [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8051.4s)]
*  I love this idea that this is the biggest conspiracy. [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8052.76s)]
*  Now only the Japanese have brought it to light. [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8057.0s)]
*  But it's interesting, because that research would have never [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8059.08s)]
*  been done in America. [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8062.44s)]
*  And if it was done in America, it would seem creepy. [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8063.599999999999s)]
*  It would seem like there's some doctors trying [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8066.48s)]
*  to fuck some patients. [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8068.44s)]
*  But because it's done in Japan, I'm like, oh, they probably [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8070.08s)]
*  followed the rules. [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8072.76s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8073.639999999999s)]
*  They probably did it exactly. [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8074.28s)]
*  Back to the pussy after every time. [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8075.6s)]
*  Yeah, thank you. [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8077.04s)]
*  Respectful. [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8079.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8080.080000000001s)]
*  I feel like it doesn't bother me. [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8081.4400000000005s)]
*  But if I found out it came out of Cincinnati, I'm like, oh, [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8085.080000000001s)]
*  this is fucking freak. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8087.96s)]
*  What agenda do they have? [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8091.400000000001s)]
*  Like that doctor. [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8092.8s)]
*  What was his name? [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8093.76s)]
*  No. [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8095.0s)]
*  Who was that sex doctor, the famous sex doctor [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8095.52s)]
*  that made a documentary about? [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8098.0s)]
*  Dr. Ruth? [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8099.68s)]
*  No. [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8100.92s)]
*  Kinsey? [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8102.400000000001s)]
*  Kinsey, yes. [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8103.080000000001s)]
*  Was it a documentary? [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8104.56s)]
*  I saw they had like a, didn't Liam Neeson play him? [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8105.6s)]
*  That was right. [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8107.56s)]
*  It was a movie. [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8107.88s)]
*  It wasn't a documentary. [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8108.68s)]
*  I think there has been a documentary as well. [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8109.96s)]
*  There's probably a documentary about him as well. [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8111.160000000001s)]
*  This guy was into some wild shit. [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8112.88s)]
*  Oh, yeah? [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8115.4800000000005s)]
*  And so much of what people quote his studies, [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8116.56s)]
*  as if this is information that we now [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8122.400000000001s)]
*  know about people and sexuality. [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8125.240000000001s)]
*  But hold on. [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8128.0s)]
*  Coming from who? [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8129.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, Kinsey. [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8130.400000000001s)]
*  Some freak in a lab coat. [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8131.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah, what are you into, buddy? [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8132.8s)]
*  Widely regarded as the first major figure [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8135.320000000001s)]
*  in American sexology, his research [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8137.12s)]
*  helped pave the way for a deeper exploration [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8138.68s)]
*  of sexuality amongst sexologists and the greater [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8140.56s)]
*  public, as well as liberating female sexuality. [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8144.28s)]
*  But what is the controversial aspects of his work, though? [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8146.6s)]
*  There's some controversial shit about him. [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8151.08s)]
*  The thing I know about him is the Kinsey scale, which [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8154.76s)]
*  is basically saying no one's fully gay, [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8157.52s)]
*  no one's fully straight. [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8160.24s)]
*  Zero is you're the gayest guy of all time. [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8162.84s)]
*  Five is you're the straightest guy of all time, I think. [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8164.88s)]
*  Which seems to make sense. [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8167.84s)]
*  Well, I would imagine if you lived in Roman times, [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8169.56s)]
*  everybody went gay. [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8174.4400000000005s)]
*  But as a straight man. [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8176.4800000000005s)]
*  The curve. [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8177.68s)]
*  A straight man. [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8178.72s)]
*  You've got a curve in Rome. [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8179.320000000001s)]
*  Who's reproduced. [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8180.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8181.6s)]
*  You're lying if you think that if you were born in Rome, [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8184.76s)]
*  let's get into it. [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8189.96s)]
*  In one BC that you wouldn't be engaging in gay sex. [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8191.08s)]
*  Get your dick sucked after a nice bath. [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8195.960000000001s)]
*  They all did it. [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8197.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8198.52s)]
*  So what are you going to do? [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8199.04s)]
*  You going to be the one guy who doesn't get your dick sucked? [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8199.960000000001s)]
*  No. [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8201.64s)]
*  One guy who doesn't suck a little cock? [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8202.08s)]
*  Come on, dude. [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8203.36s)]
*  You're being fucked. [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8203.960000000001s)]
*  You're bringing down the vibes, dude. [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8205.04s)]
*  And I think there was a thing back then with men [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8206.68s)]
*  where they would go to war, and they'd go on these campaigns. [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8209.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8212.28s)]
*  And they're just a bunch of horny dudes fucking each other. [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8212.78s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8214.8s)]
*  And it became, if it's acceptable, [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8215.28s)]
*  it's way more convenient. [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8217.2s)]
*  Right. [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8218.52s)]
*  The Spartans were gay as hell. [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8219.76s)]
*  Gay as hell. [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8221.24s)]
*  They only saw women to fuck them to reproduce, [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8222.800000000001s)]
*  and then they're just hanging out in the barracks, [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8225.08s)]
*  and they're fucking each other. [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8227.48s)]
*  There's no way around it. [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8228.800000000001s)]
*  Fighting like savages. [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8229.720000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8230.720000000001s)]
*  That's what's crazy. [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8231.220000000001s)]
*  It's like some of the scariest armies in history were gay. [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8232.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8235.12s)]
*  Absolutely. [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8236.12s)]
*  Wild. [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8236.960000000001s)]
*  The British, they were taking over the world [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8237.6s)]
*  and fucking each other in the ass on the ships. [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8239.800000000001s)]
*  What do you think was going on in that long boat ride to India? [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8242.0s)]
*  Bro, why do you think pirates dress like that? [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8244.36s)]
*  Why is a pirate got a scarf on and big earrings? [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8248.04s)]
*  Shut the fuck up. [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8251.52s)]
*  That guy's gay as fuck. [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8252.56s)]
*  Sorry to bring it back to this ejaculation. [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8253.76s)]
*  Oh my god, Jamie's obsessed. [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8255.08s)]
*  They didn't have one guy do it, apparently. [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8256.56s)]
*  Most of the samples also contained [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8258.2s)]
*  prostate-specific antigen, which does not [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8259.96s)]
*  originate in the bladder. [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8262.8s)]
*  That suggests that squirting is not entirely composed of urine. [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8264.16s)]
*  That's the Kool-Aid powder in my hypothesis. [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8266.8s)]
*  It's this prostate-specific antigen. [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8269.28s)]
*  Three were able to use their hands alone to squirt, [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8271.12s)]
*  while the other two required penetrative sexual stimulation. [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8273.84s)]
*  In this case, from two male partners to squirt. [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8277.52s)]
*  She was getting tag-teamed? [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8280.44s)]
*  No, each of them had their own guy. [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8282.04s)]
*  Oh, I see. [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8285.36s)]
*  That makes sense. [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8286.52s)]
*  The guy's going to get tied to your shoulders. [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8287.04s)]
*  Maybe the girl's like, I can squirt, but I need two dicks. [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8288.800000000001s)]
*  This only happened five times. [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8291.68s)]
*  Maybe a thumb in my ass, too. [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8292.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and someone needs to choke me. [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8294.720000000001s)]
*  Who's got a tie? [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8297.08s)]
*  They all do. [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8299.08s)]

*  with the right doses for people and develop centers [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8547.32s)]
*  where professionals can introduce people to them. [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8551.08s)]
*  Because just what they've found with people recovering, [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8553.88s)]
*  like soldiers coming back from the war, [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8556.6s)]
*  it's one of the very best things to help them get over it. [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8558.64s)]
*  I mean, just that alone, you would [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8561.52s)]
*  think that that's a resource that's very valuable. [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8563.08s)]
*  If you require of people to go to a foreign land [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8566.48s)]
*  and kill people they don't know, and then when they come back, [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8571.08s)]
*  you just don't address the fact that their mind is completely [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8574.24s)]
*  fucked. [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8577.48s)]
*  Totally. [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8578.0s)]
*  Or you purposely ignore one ancient method that's [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8579.52s)]
*  not dangerous, that's been shown to be effective. [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8583.68s)]
*  And if you're worried about abuse, I get it. [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8587.08s)]
*  I get the worry about abuse. [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8589.52s)]
*  But then we need to figure out places [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8591.0s)]
*  where you have treatment centers for people [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8592.8s)]
*  that do wind up abusing things, and that you also [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8596.32s)]
*  have trained physicians that can determine the effective dose [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8599.92s)]
*  and give you a pure product. [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8604.84s)]
*  Well, you don't have to worry about buying it off [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8606.68s)]
*  some fucking weirdo you met in a parking lot. [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8608.6s)]
*  Some hippie. [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8610.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8611.279999999999s)]
*  Those are some mushrooms. [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8611.779999999999s)]
*  Mushrooms and fentanyl. [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8612.68s)]
*  I think they're starting to do. [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8614.039999999999s)]
*  I mean, I think there are some states and stuff like that. [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8615.36s)]
*  Well, they just denied it in California. [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8618.4s)]
*  What? [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8620.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8620.92s)]
*  Which I would think of any place that would take it. [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8621.44s)]
*  But Newsom, even though I don't agree with him on most things, [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8624.0s)]
*  I saw his point. [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8628.84s)]
*  Because he was saying that they didn't submit a protocol [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8629.96s)]
*  for use and for a bunch of other things. [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8633.76s)]
*  Like if it's going to be used therapeutically, [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8637.2s)]
*  like what are the guidelines? [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8639.76s)]
*  How does it get administered? [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8641.48s)]
*  They were just kind of decriminalizing it. [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8643.04s)]
*  Hey, come on. [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8644.8s)]
*  Let's do it. [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8645.32s)]
*  And he felt like it should be decriminalized [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8645.82s)]
*  with information. [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8647.64s)]
*  Medically first. [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8648.44s)]
*  The same way we would. [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8649.32s)]
*  Come up with a protocol. [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8650.2s)]
*  Come up with like, this is what we can fall back on. [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8651.48s)]
*  This is what we know you should do. [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8653.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8655.279999999999s)]
*  Amsterdam, they're legal, but it's like truffles. [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8656.32s)]
*  It's like the fresh ones. [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8659.039999999999s)]
*  You can only buy certain doses. [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8660.4s)]
*  But those bad boys will fuck you up. [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8662.439999999999s)]
*  They'll all fuck you up. [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8664.08s)]
*  When Duncan Trussell lived in Asheville, [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8665.039999999999s)]
*  he lived in North Carolina. [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8667.16s)]
*  And they started putting certain chemicals into the cow's feed [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8668.84s)]
*  to keep them from making mushrooms. [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8673.64s)]
*  Because so many of them made mushrooms. [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8675.84s)]
*  Because apparently the spores are everywhere up there. [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8677.439999999999s)]
*  Really? [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8679.88s)]
*  That's sick. [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8680.48s)]
*  It's a mushrooms town. [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8681.439999999999s)]
*  But that's why the town's fucked now. [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8683.24s)]
*  They took the mushrooms away? [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8685.84s)]
*  Well, you're filled with crime now. [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8687.08s)]
*  Asheville, Duncan was telling me, has a crazy high crime rate. [[02:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8690.48s)]
*  Really? [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8693.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8694.26s)]
*  I mean, I haven't been there for 10 years. [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8694.76s)]
*  But it felt like a real hippie town. [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8697.119999999999s)]
*  What's the crime rate of Asheville, North Carolina? [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8698.44s)]
*  A lot of fucking wind chimes are getting stolen. [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8701.44s)]
*  All their money went away during the pandemic. [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8704.08s)]
*  I would imagine that ramped up crime everywhere. [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8706.24s)]
*  Everybody's forced to not work. [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8709.92s)]
*  Also, it's a small town. [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8711.68s)]
*  It's a big, robust town that's backed up by a big industry [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8714.039999999999s)]
*  or anything like that. [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8717.32s)]
*  Are those people like service workers? [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8718.76s)]
*  Because I had friends in New York who were like, [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8720.32s)]
*  they were on unemployment. [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8722.4s)]
*  And they were like, whoa, this is better than my shitty job. [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8723.44s)]
*  That was a problem. [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8727.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8728.6s)]
*  That was definitely a problem. [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8729.24s)]
*  And that made me rethink universal basic income. [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8730.44s)]
*  Like, pro or negative? [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8733.68s)]
*  Well, I used to be pro. [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8735.16s)]
*  I used to be super pro universal basic income. [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8736.28s)]
*  And my thought was, if you give people, no. [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8738.6s)]
*  I can only speak from this isn't a study. [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8743.36s)]
*  But it helped the people I knew, where it was like, [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8746.6s)]
*  they didn't get lazy. [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8749.800000000001s)]
*  They were just like, holy shit, I can pay my bills. [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8750.640000000001s)]
*  That's unemployment. [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8752.640000000001s)]
*  I'm talking about universal basic income. [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8753.52s)]
*  So universal basic income would be that everybody gets [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8755.24s)]
*  a certain amount a month, like 1,200 bucks. [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8758.04s)]
*  And the idea is you never have to worry about food. [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8760.720000000001s)]
*  You never have to worry about shelter. [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8762.480000000001s)]
*  Now you can pursue whatever you want to do. [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8763.960000000001s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8767.2s)]
*  Part of me thinks there's going to be a bunch of people [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8768.68s)]
*  that never do anything. [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8770.84s)]
*  They're just going to live off that 12. [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8772.880000000001s)]
*  Which is fine though, right? [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8773.84s)]
*  Kind of. [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8775.400000000001s)]
*  But if that wasn't available to them, [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8776.92s)]
*  would they figure out a path in life? [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8780.08s)]
*  And how many people get tripped up [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8782.160000000002s)]
*  by winning a lottery ticket? [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8784.6s)]
*  Don't all of them get tripped up by winning a lottery? [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8787.76s)]
*  Doesn't everybody get tripped up? [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8790.52s)]
*  It's pretty high, yeah. [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8791.68s)]
*  Unless you do certain things. [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8792.68s)]
*  There's a human psychology aspect to giving people free shit [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8794.160000000002s)]
*  that I don't think is beneficial. [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8797.400000000001s)]
*  I just don't think it's beneficial. [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8799.68s)]
*  I don't think there's anything wrong [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8801.12s)]
*  with having a social safety net. [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8802.32s)]
*  I feel like welfare's important. [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8804.08s)]
*  I feel like food stamps are important. [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8805.6s)]
*  I feel like healthcare's important. [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8807.48s)]
*  All those things are very important. [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8808.76s)]
*  Education, I fully support that. [[02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8810.36s)]
*  I mean, if you're going to use taxes, [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8812.4s)]
*  I fully support using- [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8813.84s)]
*  Let's do that instead of tanks. [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8815.24s)]
*  Yeah, well that's the best one. [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8816.4s)]
*  But I kind of think that people need to do things. [[02:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8818.52s)]
*  And I kind of think giving people free money [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8822.76s)]
*  is a bad idea. [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8824.64s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think given those two options, [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8825.84s)]
*  I much prefer a social safety net for that reason. [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8827.8s)]
*  Where it's like- 100%. [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8830.0s)]
*  Even if your job is kind of bullshit, [[02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8831.68s)]
*  if your basic human needs are taken care of, [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8834.56s)]
*  you can still go to work and make ends meet, [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8837.4s)]
*  but it's like, if you get sick, [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8839.84s)]
*  you're not worried that you're gonna fucking [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8841.36s)]
*  bankrupt your life's over. [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8843.24s)]
*  If you get- [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8844.72s)]
*  But the thing is, you're not contributing [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8845.56s)]
*  if you're not doing anything. [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8846.8s)]
*  If you're just taking that 1,200 bucks [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8848.48s)]
*  and you're just living, [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8850.28s)]
*  and you're not contributing at all, [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8851.4s)]
*  you're literally a sponge. [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8852.960000000001s)]
*  I think people would feel better [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8855.48s)]
*  if they had something that they did [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8857.64s)]
*  that gave them a sense of purpose, whatever it is. [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8859.6s)]
*  And I think that trying to find that thing [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8862.84s)]
*  and be successful at that thing [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8866.16s)]
*  is a part of the process that everybody has to go through [[02:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8868.4s)]
*  to find themselves. [[02:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8870.76s)]
*  And you deny someone that thing [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8872.36s)]
*  if you just give them free money. [[02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8874.800000000001s)]
*  Now, I'm not saying that you shouldn't be able [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8877.08s)]
*  to give money to unemployed single mothers, [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8879.12s)]
*  people that get fucked over by society, [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8883.32s)]
*  you get fired, you have a monthly nut. [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8886.16s)]
*  I think we should have a social safety net. [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8889.76s)]
*  I think it's important. [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8891.560000000001s)]
*  But I also think if you just gave people money, [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8892.52s)]
*  a lot of people wouldn't do shit. [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8896.36s)]
*  Yeah, no, definitely. [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8898.2s)]
*  More people than would. [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8899.04s)]
*  The rare person that even with that free money says, [[02:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8900.880000000001s)]
*  I'm gonna take this fucking money, [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8904.0s)]
*  and I'm only gonna spend half of it, [[02:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8905.32s)]
*  and I'm gonna invest the other half, [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8906.720000000001s)]
*  and I'm gonna get a job as well. [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8908.0s)]
*  And I'm gonna go out there [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8909.960000000001s)]
*  and I'm gonna fucking make something. [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8910.800000000001s)]
*  There's some of those people, but those are super rare. [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8912.32s)]
*  No, you're right about that. [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8915.16s)]
*  It's human nature, man. [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8916.08s)]
*  And I think the thing, yeah, I think the, [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8917.16s)]
*  I prefer what you're saying is like, [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8918.72s)]
*  yeah, let's cover our bases, which we don't do right now. [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8920.16s)]
*  And I think the thing that, I think just as likely for, [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8924.0s)]
*  if you give somebody free money, [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8928.16s)]
*  they're not gonna do shit, [[02:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8929.24s)]
*  we're fucking trapped in this opposite thing [[02:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8930.4s)]
*  where it's like people have to fucking work hard as shit [[02:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8932.199999999999s)]
*  to barely make it. [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8934.92s)]
*  Where it's like that zapping all that human potential too, [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8936.8s)]
*  because those people are just surviving at shit. [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8939.519999999999s)]
*  They don't have time to fucking, [[02:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8942.199999999999s)]
*  because they just have to make rent fucking, [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8944.08s)]
*  everything is more expensive. [[02:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8946.08s)]
*  They don't have any time to fucking, [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8947.72s)]
*  and I do agree with you that kind of the middle ground is, [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8949.48s)]
*  get their basic needs met, [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8952.16s)]
*  and then let them be able to work, [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8953.76s)]
*  but not have to fucking work 60 hours a week [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8955.359999999999s)]
*  or whatever the fuck, or work 40 hours, [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8958.439999999999s)]
*  but it's grueling for less pay. [[02:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8960.32s)]
*  Because you do need that time, you need that space to, [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8962.64s)]
*  I think you're absolutely correct. [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8964.679999999998s)]
*  If you wanna get ahead [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8965.519999999999s)]
*  and you wanna figure your own path in life, [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8966.359999999999s)]
*  you gotta have some time. [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8968.08s)]
*  It's gonna either cut into your sleep [[02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8969.92s)]
*  or it's gonna cut into your social life. [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8971.359999999999s)]
*  It's gonna cut, but you're gonna need some time. [[02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8972.96s)]
*  Totally. [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8975.76s)]
*  That's the one benefit for a motivated person [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8976.6s)]
*  for universal basic income. [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8979.28s)]
*  But my feeling was when I watched everybody [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8981.08s)]
*  during the pandemic when they were all getting unemployment, [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8984.0s)]
*  how many people didn't wanna go back to work? [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8987.800000000001s)]
*  They just wanted that free money. [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8989.640000000001s)]
*  I was like, ooh, this is wild. [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8990.84s)]
*  But some of that also is that they were like, [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8992.52s)]
*  because my friends were like, what the fuck? [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8995.04s)]
*  This is like the, like I'm making less money [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=8997.800000000001s)]
*  working hard as fuck on what unemployment pays. [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9001.48s)]
*  Like this is what the government thinks [[02:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9004.44s)]
*  you barely need to subsist. [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9005.52s)]
*  And when I go back to work, I make less than this [[02:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9006.800000000001s)]
*  and I work fucking hard as shit. [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9009.08s)]
*  I mean, it's also a problem of like, [[02:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9010.44s)]
*  I think people also saw in that moment [[02:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9011.76s)]
*  how mistreated they were being [[02:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9014.24s)]
*  and how underpaid they were being a lot of the time [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9015.68s)]
*  where it's like this low pay, [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9017.6s)]
*  which it wasn't that much money, right? [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9019.720000000001s)]
*  Well, they started ramping up pay [[02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9021.2s)]
*  at a lot of places after the pandemic. [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9022.48s)]
*  They ramped up pay everywhere. [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9025.36s)]
*  Like they advertise like high pay, [[02:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9027.24s)]
*  like places like McDonald's. [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9030.16s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9031.68s)]
*  Like what does McDonald's pay now? [[02:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9032.52s)]
*  I think it pays like $18 an hour or something. [[02:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9033.68s)]
*  What is how much does McDonald's pay? [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9037.0s)]
*  I think it depends. [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9039.24s)]
*  I was walking through Buc-ee's yesterday. [[02:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9040.08s)]
*  Buc-ee's is famous for paying well. [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9042.24s)]
*  I was looking at like, if you're a manager, [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9044.32s)]
*  you make a quarter million dollars a year. [[02:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9046.84s)]
*  Pretty sick. [[02:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9048.4s)]
*  And probably the only place [[02:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9049.6s)]
*  where that's kept pace with inflation. [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9051.24s)]
*  It still says pretty low depending on. [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9052.880000000001s)]
*  Well, yeah, see 7 to 21. [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9054.24s)]
*  21, 10, 21, 20. [[02:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9055.08s)]
*  7, 25 is in like Dothan, Alabama. [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9057.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9059.44s)]
*  But I wonder, I wonder even this, I wonder. [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9060.720000000001s)]
*  Austin, Texas, 725 to 21. [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9063.28s)]
*  Boy, that's a big jump. [[02:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9065.84s)]
*  That's probably like. [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9067.24s)]
*  That's three times as much. [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9068.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9069.48s)]
*  That's a cashier. [[02:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9070.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9071.88s)]
*  That's what a cashier makes. [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9072.72s)]
*  Not a manager. [[02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9073.56s)]
*  That's good. [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9074.4s)]
*  The manager gets double that sum. [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9075.24s)]
*  Yeah, but I would, [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9076.76s)]
*  even the place where they're ramping up pay, [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9077.92s)]
*  I wonder what that even is in comparison to inflation [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9079.84s)]
*  from that same job in 1970. [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9084.24s)]

*  They're trying to get rid of voter ID [[02:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9149.0s)]
*  and they're trying to bring people in [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9151.32s)]

*  that many people to cross over? [[02:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9195.16s)]

*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9209.02s)]

*  But also, well, oh yeah. [[02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9210.68s)]
*  Struck down, okay. [[02:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9213.14s)]
*  State Supreme Court judge from Staten Island said, [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9214.14s)]
*  click on it so I can read it. [[02:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9218.14s)]
*  So, State Supreme Court judge from Staten Island said, [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9221.94s)]
*  the measure which would have allowed [[02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9225.66s)]
*  more than 800,000 non-citizens to vote [[02:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9227.06s)]
*  violated the state constitution. [[02:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9229.62s)]
*  So, they're trying to pass this measure. [[02:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9231.06s)]
*  Imagine what would be the motivation, [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9233.9s)]
*  what would be the motivation of allowing people [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9236.54s)]
*  that are illegal aliens to vote. [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9239.54s)]
*  Well, they're permanent legal residents. [[02:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9242.060000000001s)]
*  Permanent legal residents. [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9243.68s)]
*  So, they're basically guys like my dad who've been here [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9244.980000000001s)]
*  and don't have a citizenship. [[02:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9247.300000000001s)]

*  Yeah, yeah, like, yeah. [[02:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9249.7s)]
*  Some people, they're green. [[02:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9251.42s)]
*  I mean, some people, like I said, [[02:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9252.26s)]
*  I don't think my dad is ever gonna become a citizen. [[02:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9253.26s)]
*  Also, only applied to local. [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9254.900000000001s)]
*  So, non-citizens, what's the technical term [[02:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9256.900000000001s)]
*  for a non-citizen? [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9260.84s)]
*  If you're not a citizen and you're here. [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9261.980000000001s)]
*  Illegal resident. [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9263.62s)]
*  Illegal resident. [[02:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9264.660000000002s)]

*  Forever? [[02:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9269.62s)]
*  Like, or does it expire? [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9270.460000000001s)]
*  Age and residency requirements. [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9272.26s)]
*  Age and residency requirements. [[02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9274.18s)]
*  Yeah, so it's like, I mean, look, you could debate that, [[02:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9276.14s)]
*  but it's not the same as illegal immigrants. [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9278.06s)]
*  It's like people, it's basically people that have been [[02:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9279.58s)]
*  in that place and they don't wanna become citizens. [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9281.6s)]
*  They could be able to vote for municipal elections, [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9284.66s)]
*  not national elections. [[02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9286.7s)]
*  But if you're a Democrat or if you're a Republican, [[02:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9287.82s)]
*  let's see it on the other side. [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9290.62s)]
*  Imagine you're a Republican and you do this. [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9291.460000000001s)]
*  And you say, we're gonna let people [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9293.62s)]

*  Who do you think those people are gonna vote for? [[02:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9297.1s)]
*  They're gonna vote for the people [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9299.2s)]
*  that are allowing them to vote. [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9300.18s)]

*  Just, especially if you're not politically savvy. [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9302.26s)]
*  Now, imagine you're- It is kinda like the old, [[02:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9305.06s)]
*  it's like fucking Tammany Hall, like in Gangs of New York, [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9306.5s)]
*  where it's like, you vote like four times [[02:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9309.34s)]
*  and they just bring the fucking Irish people off the boats [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9311.02s)]
*  and like, shave your mustache and go vote again, [[02:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9313.18s)]

*  That's how they always did it. [[02:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9320.18s)]
*  But the thing is, it's like, [[02:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9321.9s)]
*  if you wanted the laws on voting to be more lax [[02:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9323.06s)]
*  and you wanted citizens that are here, [[02:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9327.84s)]
*  but they're not legal, they're not- [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WiRrHcWVQ&t=9330.539999999999s)]
