# Joe Rogan Experience #2340 - Charley Crockett
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5.82s)]
*  Doing something at the Viper Room and then trying to come here the next day. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=14.08s)]
*  The Viper Room is just notorious. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=21.92s)]
*  Like even when you're in the building, it's just like, ugh. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=23.48s)]
*  It is notorious. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=27.16s)]
*  It's funny because the only way I'd ever been in there was through the door on the side street there. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=28.48s)]
*  Uh-huh. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=33.6s)]
*  You know? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=34.6s)]
*  But they had all the cameras out and took me around. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=35.6s)]
*  I'd never come in through the door on sunset before, even recognize the place. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=39.32s)]
*  No, I'd never been through that door either. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=42.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=44.44s)]
*  Like I said, I've only been there once. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=45.44s)]
*  I was there for a comedy show. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=46.44s)]
*  This feels weird. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=48.2s)]
*  There's certain buildings that just have bizarre history. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=49.2s)]
*  Yeah, well, Shooter was telling me last night, man, River Phoenix died on the sidewalk right [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=52.08s)]
*  out that door on the, I didn't know that. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=57.4s)]
*  I thought it was in front of the, I thought it was in front of the whiskey for some reason. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=58.88s)]
*  No, no, it was the Viper Room. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=62.56s)]
*  I never realized that. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=64.16s)]
*  No. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=65.64s)]
*  It's a fucked up place. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=66.64s)]
*  Hey, man. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=67.64s)]
*  Nice to meet you. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=68.64s)]
*  Pleasure's all mine, Joe. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=69.64s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=70.64s)]
*  I love your music. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=71.64s)]
*  Really? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=72.64s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=73.64s)]
*  Yeah, well, my friend Jake turned me on to you. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=74.64s)]
*  Your music is like, you've lived a life. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=75.64s)]
*  You can't fake that. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=78.48s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=79.48s)]
*  There's something about certain dudes' voices and songs. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=80.88s)]
*  They're like, all right, that guy's done some living. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=84.4s)]
*  You can't create that with AI. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=88.04s)]
*  They're going to try. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=89.04s)]
*  Everybody, I mean, it's crazy. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=90.04s)]
*  We were, I mean, we're kind of reaching singularity, you know? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=93.04s)]
*  Where nobody can tell the difference. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=101.44s)]
*  I know. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=102.44s)]
*  I think we're right about there. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=103.44s)]
*  There was a new one that just got released today. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=104.76s)]
*  Did you hear the new one today? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=106.48s)]
*  It's even better than the Google one that was insane. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=107.80000000000001s)]
*  It was released last week. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=110.76s)]
*  Yeah, it's weird. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=112.48s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=113.96000000000001s)]
*  They have a new AI engine that does video. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=116.08s)]
*  I'll send it to you, Jamie. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=118.52s)]
*  It's pretty incredible. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=120.8s)]
*  The way they're able to make stuff now where it looks exactly like real human beings. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=123.2s)]
*  It doesn't look fake even a little bit. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=129.72s)]
*  I'll send it to you, Jamie. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=133.4s)]
*  It's called ByteDance. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=140.07999999999998s)]
*  So is that the China one? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=142.68s)]
*  That's the company. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=143.68s)]
*  Oh, OK. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=144.68s)]
*  ByteDance is the company that owns TikTok and stuff. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=146.28s)]
*  Oh, yeah, China. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=148.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=150.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=151.24s)]
*  This is their new AI. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=152.24s)]
*  So this is all fake. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=154.52s)]
*  All fake people. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=156.04000000000002s)]
*  All done by computers. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=157.26000000000002s)]
*  Indistinguishable. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=158.96s)]
*  You know, it's like very strange. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=159.96s)]
*  You got it? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=162.48000000000002s)]
*  Throw that up. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=163.48000000000002s)]
*  Give me some sound. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=164.48000000000002s)]
*  You got to click on it. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=165.48000000000002s)]
*  This is all fake. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=170.48000000000002s)]
*  I mean, what the fuck, man? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=175.48s)]
*  We are living in the weirdest time ever, Charlie Crockett. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=205.48s)]
*  Oh, man, you're right. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=212.88s)]
*  This is the weirdest time ever to be alive because we are so close to not being able [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=214.12s)]
*  to tell what's real and what's fake. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=219.82s)]
*  We're so close. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=222.39999999999998s)]
*  I mean, we're essentially right there with video. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=223.39999999999998s)]
*  And then eventually it's going to move into some sort of perception. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=227.04s)]
*  It's going to be feel. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=232.29999999999998s)]
*  You're going to be able to put a helmet on and go into some bizarre world. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=234.44s)]
*  And you can't stop it. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=240.8s)]
*  You can't stop it. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=241.8s)]
*  It's coming. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=242.8s)]
*  It's coming. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=243.8s)]
*  And the people that are working on it in America, like we have to because China is working on [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=244.8s)]
*  them. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=248.88s)]
*  Like, OK, I guess that's just what we're doing. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=249.88s)]
*  Space race, even if it's just a show. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=252.68s)]
*  Yeah, it's essentially the Manhattan Project for artificial intelligence. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=254.76s)]
*  There's a race around the world. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=259.24s)]
*  Joe, did we go to the moon? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=260.72s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=261.72s)]
*  You know, I don't think so either. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=263.72s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=264.96000000000004s)]
*  It makes you sound fucking completely insane to say it, but I lost a lot of friends when [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=265.96000000000004s)]
*  I was younger when I started talking like that. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=269.6s)]
*  I gained a lot of friends, too, though. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=272.16s)]
*  I gained a lot of skin. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=275.36s)]
*  Listen, man, I've talked to scientists that don't want to talk about it publicly. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=276.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=280.48s)]
*  Scientists. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=281.48s)]
*  Well, see, you know what I figured? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=282.48s)]
*  I figured that would be the one time in the history of civilization that human beings [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=283.48s)]
*  got to a new place and said, no, I'm good and turned around. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=290.15999999999997s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=294.96s)]
*  I don't want to look around there anymore. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=295.96s)]
*  Well, Bart Sabrell, he's this researcher that's been doing these documentaries on the moon [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=296.96s)]
*  landing and he's been saying it's fake since like I met him sometime in the early 2000s, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=302.4s)]
*  I believe. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=307.88s)]
*  And he put out this this documentary called A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=309.03999999999996s)]
*  And he's got a great quote. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=312.59999999999997s)]
*  And he says, there's not a single thing that's not easier, faster and cheaper to reproduce [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=313.59999999999997s)]
*  today from 1969 except the moon landing. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=318.64000000000004s)]
*  It's the one thing. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=322.04s)]
*  Well, and everybody would go, oh, but they spent so much money. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=323.04s)]
*  Why would they spend the money on that again? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=325.76000000000005s)]
*  Well, why would they spend money on all the things they spend money on? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=327.32000000000005s)]
*  Like what are you talking about? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=329.64000000000004s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=330.64000000000004s)]
*  The moon has trillions of dollars in rare minerals on it. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=331.96000000000004s)]
*  There's all sorts of shit on the moon that would be very beneficial to society. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=336.84000000000003s)]
*  And it was always going to be that we're going to have a base on the moon and we're going [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=340.52000000000004s)]
*  to use that to go to other places. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=342.8s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=345.0s)]
*  I mean, if you look at the just the the way they filmed it, like when you watched it on [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=346.32s)]
*  television, the people that watched it on television, it was the first time ever there [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=352.4s)]
*  were where there was a news thing where the the news stations, the networks didn't have [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=355.88s)]
*  a direct feed. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=361.24s)]
*  What they had was they filmed the moon landing. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=362.92s)]
*  They showed it on a projection screen. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=366.84s)]

*  When I was a kid, that was the only reason we drank RC Cola is because it was 25 cents. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=806.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=810.24s)]
*  Because it was cheap. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=811.24s)]
*  That's it. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=812.24s)]
*  And you drank it and you knew it wasn't Coke. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=813.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=814.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=815.24s)]
*  They tried new Coke. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=816.24s)]
*  Do you remember that? [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=817.24s)]
*  When I was a kid, God, I think I was in high school. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=818.24s)]
*  They came up with a new formula of Coca-Cola somewhere around the 80s, I think. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=819.24s)]
*  It was terrible. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=824.24s)]
*  They tried new Coke. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=825.24s)]
*  They rioted. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=826.24s)]
*  They tried new Coke and everybody's like, what the fuck are you doing? [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=827.24s)]
*  Why would you get rid of Coke? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=828.24s)]
*  It's perfect. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=829.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=830.24s)]
*  Don't change that. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=831.24s)]
*  They can, they can change and try everything else and buy everybody out as long as they [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=832.24s)]
*  keep Coca-Cola flowing. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=836.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=837.24s)]
*  And then Pepsi is always like for weirdos. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=838.24s)]
*  People who prefer Pepsi. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=840.24s)]
*  I never liked it. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=841.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=842.24s)]
*  It's weird. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=843.24s)]
*  I like Dr. Pepper. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=844.24s)]
*  Well, you know, Coca-Cola is to this day flavored with cocaine. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=845.24s)]
*  Do you know that? [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=848.24s)]
*  You mean like? [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=850.24s)]
*  The Coca leaves. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=851.24s)]
*  That's the secret to the flavor of Coca-Cola. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=852.24s)]
*  Coca-Cola, the company that makes Coca-Cola, they are the biggest producers of medical [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=855.24s)]
*  grade cocaine for real. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=862.24s)]
*  So they take the Coca leaves, they extract the flavonoids out of the Coca leaves and [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=865.24s)]
*  they extract the cocaine. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=870.24s)]
*  So there's no cocaine in Coca-Cola, but then they take those Coca leaves and the flavor [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=871.24s)]
*  goes into Coca-Cola and then the cocaine goes into medical cocaine. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=877.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=881.24s)]
*  To this day. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=882.24s)]
*  Wow. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=883.24s)]
*  I think they're the only company that's allowed to use Coca leaves. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=884.24s)]
*  I think they're grandfathered in. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=888.24s)]
*  I think that's exactly, is that how it works? [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=890.24s)]
*  I believe they're grandfathered in, but to this day, that's what they use as I sniff, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=893.24s)]
*  as I sniffle. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=899.24s)]
*  But these are real sniffles, folks. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=900.24s)]
*  These are allergy sniffles. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=901.24s)]
*  I watched the fucking craziest movie last night. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=904.24s)]
*  The Substance. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=906.24s)]
*  Have you heard of that movie? [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=907.24s)]
*  I've heard of it. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=908.24s)]
*  That's that new Demi Moore movie. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=909.24s)]
*  Yeah, I was afraid to watch it. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=910.24s)]
*  Holy shit, man. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=912.24s)]

*  Oh my God. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=914.24s)]
*  One of the most insane movies I've ever seen in my life. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=915.24s)]
*  It's about this lady who's getting older and someone approaches her with this new experimental [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=918.24s)]
*  drug that allows you to live as a young person for seven days and then you have to switch [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=923.44s)]
*  back to the old person for seven days. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=929.24s)]
*  I don't want to spoil it for anybody, but it was fucking insane. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=931.24s)]
*  I was like, I got to watch something stupid on YouTube for a couple hours before I go [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=935.24s)]
*  to bed because I'm weirded out by this movie. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=939.24s)]
*  Yeah, that's the reason I haven't watched it yet. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=942.24s)]
*  I'm just saying. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=945.24s)]
*  I never liked the sensory overload horror movies. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=947.24s)]
*  I like classic horror movies. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=954.24s)]
*  This is a sensory overload times 10. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=956.24s)]

*  You know, I never knew he could act dramatically. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1022.24s)]
*  You know, I mean, he's always been great in comedies, but he's incredible in that movie. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1024.24s)]

*  I grew up around gamblers too. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1045.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1046.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1047.24s)]
*  My uncle was always a big gambler. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1048.24s)]
*  And my cousin and I spent a lot of time in casinos with him down in New Orleans on the [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1049.24s)]
*  Mississippi coast and all that. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1054.24s)]

*  Yep. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1057.24s)]
*  Those are the craziest. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1058.24s)]
*  Man, I didn't mind, you know, he let me and my cousin run all over the place. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1059.24s)]
*  So we were stoked. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1065.24s)]
*  So you liked the fact that he was a degenerate. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1066.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1069.24s)]
*  Oh, and anytime he won, like if he won big, we used to play his bingo. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1070.24s)]
*  He used to run this bingo hall in New Orleans. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1073.24s)]
*  And me and my cousin, we could, both of us with those bingo daubers, we could play like, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1078.24s)]
*  we could play nine card pages for him. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1083.24s)]
*  We got that good that we could keep up with it. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1085.24s)]
*  And because he was running the place, nobody in there ever said shit about me and my cousin [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1087.24s)]
*  being like, you know, eight and 11 or whatever. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1091.24s)]
*  And if we hit though, it was always a good time. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1094.24s)]
*  It was Toys R Us and fried shrimp. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1097.24s)]

*  And, you know, when I was in my early 20s and I just surround so many people that just live for gambling, they would go straight from off track betting right to the pool hall. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1191.24s)]
*  And, you know, they'd bet on anything. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1201.24s)]
*  They bet on two raindrops coming down a window pane. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1203.24s)]
*  Bet on roaches. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1206.24s)]

*  You name it. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1208.24s)]
*  They'd flip a coin for 10. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1209.24s)]
*  I saw dudes flip a coin for thousands of dollars. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1211.24s)]
*  The guy would win a tournament like this is like a famous thing in pool. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1213.24s)]
*  Guys win a tournament, win $10,000, flip a coin, lose the whole thing. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1217.24s)]
*  And you had to have heart. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1220.24s)]
*  You had to be willing. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1221.24s)]
*  Like that was like part of the culture. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1222.24s)]
*  You had to be willing to bet. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1224.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1225.24s)]
*  And everybody's always because the only way it's fun. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1226.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1228.24s)]
*  The only way it's fun is if money's constantly flowing. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1229.24s)]
*  So if someone's trying to be conservative, someone trying to save them, they called them a nit. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1232.24s)]

*  You know, nobody likes a nit. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1237.24s)]
*  Like those are the guys that get shunned by the pool hall. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1239.24s)]
*  They're bad action. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1242.24s)]
*  Where did you grow up? [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1243.24s)]
*  Well, all over the place, really. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1244.24s)]
*  But where were those pool halls? [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1246.24s)]
*  New York. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1248.24s)]
*  I moved to New York when I was in my 20s, my early 20s, like 23. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1249.24s)]
*  And that's when I got indoctrinated into pool culture. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1252.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1256.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1257.24s)]
*  It was just the most fun group of degenerates and weirdos and outcasts. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1258.24s)]
*  And, you know, as a comedian, I never felt like I fit in and normal society. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1262.24s)]
*  You know, and then I'm around those dudes. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1268.24s)]
*  I'm like, oh, OK, you guys are just like me. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1270.24s)]
*  You don't fit in either. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1272.24s)]
*  Like you're a bunch of fucking weirdos. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1273.24s)]
*  Man, you know, thing, what I just thought about Joe, when I was on the street in New [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1275.24s)]
*  York, you know, I played up there and I'm sure you know, but I'd play on the street [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1279.24s)]
*  all day. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1285.24s)]
*  And at first I was playing in the parks and then I went moved downtown. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1286.24s)]
*  I was trying to play on street corners in the villages and all that. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1291.24s)]
*  And you're dealing with traffic and cops. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1294.24s)]
*  And that's what drove me down into the into the subway platforms. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1298.24s)]
*  And those were really competitive, too. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1303.24s)]
*  So even there, I started playing at the stations that nobody wanted or, you know, weren't [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1305.24s)]
*  desirable or weren't, you know, nobody's really competing for the spots or whatever. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1311.24s)]
*  And I would do that all day and then I would hit open mics all over the five boroughs every [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1315.24s)]
*  night, everywhere. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1321.24s)]
*  And the comedy, the comedy guys were always the coolest because all of them, because we [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1323.24s)]
*  weren't in competition. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1331.24s)]
*  You know, like I know comedians can be really competitive on the circuit and obviously same [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1333.24s)]
*  thing on the music side. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1338.24s)]
*  But I ended up like playing a lot of I would open up for a lot of guys like I'm like at [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1339.24s)]
*  the Red Door and like in the circuit there in the city and shit. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1344.24s)]
*  Oh, cool. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1347.24s)]
*  Open guys up with two or three songs or play their breaks or whatever. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1348.24s)]
*  And, you know, all the comedy folks like me, I think because I wasn't one of them. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1351.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1356.24s)]

*  Right. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1358.24s)]

*  Like Oliver Anthony was at the mothership this weekend and the first music act we've ever [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1360.24s)]

*  There's certain songs that you can't fuck with. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1425.0s)]
*  Although I did see one time I saw Honey Honey and Gary Clark Jr. played Midnight Rider. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1427.5600000000002s)]
*  And I didn't think anybody else could play Midnight Rider. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1432.22s)]
*  And to hear Gary's song with Midnight Rider with that, you know, like Gary's signature [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1434.8400000000001s)]
*  sound. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1439.48s)]
*  Oh man. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1440.48s)]

*  Oh, I gave something to him and I got it for you too. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1452.04s)]
*  What is it? [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1453.72s)]
*  This is a real, genuine, wooly mammoth guitar pick that is made out of wooly mammoth tusk. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1454.72s)]
*  Man, that is something fierce, bud. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1462.92s)]
*  That is 10,000 plus years old. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1465.28s)]
*  And then that's a shout out to my friend John Reeves from the Boneyard in Alaska. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1467.6s)]
*  I got a buddy of mine who has this spot in Alaska where they just pull all kinds of crazy [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1471.96s)]
*  mastodon, wooly mammoth, fucking cave bear, all kinds of skulls, all kinds of wild shit [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1477.24s)]
*  out of this one piece of property where a lot of animals died. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1483.48s)]
*  And he's taken a lot of the wooly mammoth. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1486.72s)]
*  That's where I got this too. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1488.52s)]
*  This is a tooth. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1489.52s)]
*  This is a tooth that was carved into a piece of art with a mammoth in it. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1490.52s)]
*  That is a big old goddamn tooth, huh? [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1497.16s)]
*  Imagine. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1498.96s)]
*  Can I see how heavy that is? [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1499.96s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1500.96s)]
*  It's crazy, right? [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1501.96s)]
*  It's beautiful too, man. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1502.96s)]
*  Yeah, so that guitar pick is yours, brother. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1504.76s)]
*  Man, thanks, Joe. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1506.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1507.96s)]
*  Any cool guys who play guitar, I give them one of them picks. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1508.96s)]
*  You know, I've never been good at holding a pick. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1511.6000000000001s)]
*  I learned how to play with my hands because I could never hold a pick well. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1515.6000000000001s)]
*  But a lot of guys I know that are really great pickers, they play these really hard picks [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1519.24s)]
*  and can be real precise with them. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1525.52s)]
*  And I just still can't hold them. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1527.5600000000002s)]
*  You learned with your fingers? [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1529.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1531.2s)]
*  Yeah, I never held. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1532.2s)]
*  I just couldn't hold the pick. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1533.3200000000002s)]
*  I would try to hold it and it would get sideways. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1534.3999999999999s)]
*  And I never, like all this, you know, like the straight cowboy chords, you know, C, F, [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1536.4399999999998s)]
*  G, whatever. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1544.52s)]
*  I couldn't hold any of those chords. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1546.3999999999999s)]
*  Like when I was teaching myself, the positioning was weird for me, you know? [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1547.9599999999998s)]
*  And so like, I kind of threw away the book and I did what you call choking the chicken [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1552.04s)]
*  on the fret, you know, kind of hold it like you're choking the chicken. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1557.1599999999999s)]
*  And that's kind of where I developed my style. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1561.8s)]
*  And then I learned all the regular chords many years later. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1563.08s)]
*  You know? [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1565.2s)]
*  Are you totally self-taught? [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1566.2s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1569.2s)]
*  Wow. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1570.2s)]
*  When did you start? [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1571.2s)]
*  I was 17. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1572.2s)]
*  My mama got me a guitar out of a pawn shop in South Irving. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1576.04s)]
*  Wow. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1579.24s)]
*  It was a Hohner guitar. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1580.24s)]
*  And you just started messing around with it? [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1582.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1584.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1585.2s)]
*  You know, my mama tried to get me on the piano when I was younger and I just couldn't [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1586.2s)]
*  focus. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1589.2s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1590.2s)]
*  Seventeen was like the right age. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1595.2s)]
*  I needed it, you know? [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1597.2s)]
*  Started banging around on that guitar and I mean, it must have sounded terrible. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1599.2s)]
*  And my mama lived in this little ass place, this tiny place. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1604.64s)]
*  I was like scared to play in front of her, you know? [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1609.04s)]
*  But I was at first and I would say, mama, am I any good? [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1612.0s)]
*  You know, she wasn't going to lie to me. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1616.44s)]
*  And she said, well, son, when you play, people will believe you. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1617.68s)]
*  She wasn't going to lie to me and tell me I was good. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1622.8400000000001s)]
*  But she was trying to say, you know, just be honest with your music and the rest will [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1625.8400000000001s)]
*  take care of it. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1629.44s)]
*  That's great advice. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1630.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1631.44s)]
*  When you play, people will believe you. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1632.44s)]
*  That's what she said. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1634.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1635.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1636.04s)]
*  Yep. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1637.04s)]
*  And then the next time anybody believed in me wasn't until I started hitchhiking. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1638.04s)]
*  And I remember because I've been out in California a bunch recently and it was, I had caught [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1641.9s)]
*  a ride with this guy. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1647.42s)]
*  We were playing at this place called the Shanty up in the Farmers Branch in Dallas-Fort Worth [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1649.46s)]
*  areas years ago. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1654.1000000000001s)]
*  And there was this witch lady that, I mean, they called her a witch. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1656.7s)]
*  It was kind of a magic woman who had a barn out behind her house and they called it the [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1660.3000000000002s)]
*  Shanty. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1668.14s)]
*  And she would have people over on the weekends and just kind of any random night, travelers, [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1669.8600000000001s)]
*  misfits, whatever, back there in the barn and everybody would be telling stories and [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1675.5s)]
*  trading songs and, you know, taking potions, stuff like that. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1680.7s)]
*  Long story short, this guy I met one night, his parents had like worked, they worked for [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1687.8200000000002s)]
*  like Texas Instruments and he had disowned them, you know, because his parents were like [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1692.5s)]
*  scientists and he woke up one day as a young man and realized they were like, his parents [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1697.9s)]
*  were manufacturing like weapons, you know. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1702.22s)]
*  I never saw this guy again, but that was his whole deal why he left Texas. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1704.86s)]
*  And he was just back visiting this gal that had this Shanty deal. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1709.26s)]
*  And I talked that guy that he promised, he was describing this town of Booneville, which [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1714.1399999999999s)]
*  is this community in Mendocino County, Northern California. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1720.9399999999998s)]
*  And the way he was describing it to me at this, in this barn or whatever, it sounded [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1725.74s)]
*  like a garden to Eden or something. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1731.32s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1734.32s)]
*  Like, and I wanted so badly to go with him and he promised me and this other guy that [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1735.32s)]
*  was playing guitar too that he would take us. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1739.76s)]
*  And we passed out at the ladies house. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1742.34s)]
*  We woke up that next morning, he was still there. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1744.12s)]
*  And I was like, man, you ready to go to California? [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1747.36s)]
*  And he was like, what are you talking about? [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1748.36s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1751.36s)]
*  Like when I pressed him, he's like, man, I was on acid. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1753.6s)]
*  I was on acid. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1758.48s)]
*  I don't remember any of that. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1759.48s)]
*  But I don't have any room for you. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1761.1200000000001s)]
*  And I begged that I begged him like my life depended on it. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1762.6000000000001s)]
*  And he took me and this old boy who was playing guitar actually taught me a lot of songs back [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1765.64s)]
*  then he took us to California. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1769.2s)]
*  But as we got closer to Booneville, and we were talking to naive young Texas boys who [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1771.72s)]
*  had never been anywhere, he realized he, you know, didn't want us going anywhere near those [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1778.72s)]
*  hippies he was living with there in Booneville. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1782.92s)]
*  He left us like he pulled into like a grocery store and left us in this parking lot in Vacaville. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1786.3600000000001s)]
*  And that's when I really started hitchhiking in my life is like when we kind of got abandoned [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1793.3s)]
*  in a parking lot, kind of along the five, right? [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1797.3600000000001s)]
*  21 probably 22 something like that. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1801.44s)]
*  And I had done some a little bit of hitching before like around the south Texas and like [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1805.24s)]
*  Louisiana, but I'd never really been way out there. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1809.1000000000001s)]
*  And anyway, I started hitchhiking around because I had to. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1813.24s)]
*  But I remember it was in California the first time about anybody besides my mama ever looked [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1818.52s)]
*  at me playing guitar as it having any kind of value, you know, like any economic value [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1826.36s)]
*  or like it was a it was a trade of, you know, recognition, you know, it was kind of the [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1832.6s)]
*  was the first time was out there out there. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1840.8s)]
*  So you'd been playing about four or five years back then. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1843.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1845.8999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1846.8999999999999s)]
*  I was playing outside because our place was so small. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1847.8999999999999s)]
*  I wasn't playing outside to like make money or anything like that. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1850.62s)]
*  I would go to this park, have like a baseball diamond on it, sit on these bleachers or whatever. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1854.74s)]
*  And I'll never forget the first time anybody threw like just a pocket full of change in [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1860.3s)]
*  my case. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1865.3799999999999s)]
*  I'm sure it's because they, you know, were worried about me and felt bad for me. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1866.3799999999999s)]
*  Or whatever, you know, and it wasn't like that. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1872.74s)]
*  It wasn't like that money hit the case and not like a light went off or anything. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1874.94s)]
*  You know, it was a slow. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1879.4199999999998s)]
*  It was a slow, gradual deal like I was playing outside because there was, you know, there [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1882.1s)]
*  wasn't enough room to play in the house in the house or whatever, you know. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1887.98s)]
*  And then, you know, I got in a lot of trouble with the law, which kind of put me on the [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1892.4199999999998s)]
*  run, put me on the road. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1898.74s)]
*  And what was the trouble with the law? [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1901.26s)]
*  You know, my I've said it a lot and it's funny, I'm a lot better known than I used to be. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1907.06s)]
*  So it's like you say stuff about your family and they hear about it and they get mad. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1910.9s)]
*  But it's so funny because it's all over the Internet and they're the ones that have the [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1916.26s)]
*  government on their ass, not me. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1922.42s)]
*  But anyways, yeah, we just kind of, you know, shit hit the fan, got up in the newspapers. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1924.18s)]
*  My brother didn't go to high school, you know, neither my sister, neither went to high school. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1928.18s)]
*  They both dropped out, you know, because I'm from South Texas. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1931.74s)]
*  I was born in the Rio Grande Valley. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1935.1000000000001s)]
*  They were born up in Dallas. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1936.1000000000001s)]
*  But my mama had moved down there to South Padre Island area, McAllen, Harlingen area [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1937.42s)]
*  there and anyway, it's poor and pretty hard living down there. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1943.18s)]
*  And, you know, hell, I didn't wear shoes till I was like nine or 10 years old, you know, [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1948.46s)]
*  playing outside. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1953.9s)]
*  My brother and sister, they're 10 years older than me, half brother and sister, and we have [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1955.1s)]
*  different daddies. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1959.54s)]
*  And they really lived wild. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1960.9399999999998s)]
*  You know, it was things were pretty pretty tough back then or whatever. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1963.02s)]
*  I'm telling you that background because my brother became a hustler, you know, because [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1967.6599999999999s)]
*  he had to because of a lack of education, lack of access, you know, because of poverty. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1974.34s)]
*  And I've honestly always respected him for that. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1981.5s)]
*  You know, he took he used to take me around door to door selling newspapers when I was 11. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1983.74s)]
*  Right. And you want to know why? [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1989.02s)]
*  Because I had broken my arm and he realized if you carted that young boy out in front of [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1990.78s)]
*  those those apartments when that lady answered the door and it's these two brothers and one [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=1995.9s)]
*  of them's got a broken arm, she's going to buy the she's going to go ahead and subscribe. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2001.06s)]
*  Yeah, you know, bad. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2004.74s)]
*  Yeah. And in a nutshell, man, he, you know, through all that stuff, you know, he he started [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2006.14s)]
*  out as door to door salesman, you know, hustling newspaper subscriptions. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2012.7s)]
*  Right. Then he started like selling neckties and like men's clothing door to door in [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2016.9s)]
*  downtown Dallas office buildings, you know, and as a very young man. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2024.74s)]
*  And eventually he graduated, you know, hard knock boiler room type of guys. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2030.02s)]
*  You know, you keep knocking on those doors and that wild west business scene of towns [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2036.3400000000001s)]
*  like Dallas or Houston, you know, eventually you're going to find what you're looking for. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2041.74s)]
*  And he got in with some big old wolves, you know, and eventually it it knocked everybody out. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2047.06s)]
*  And a lot of people died. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2051.98s)]
*  A lot of people went to prison. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2053.3s)]
*  And, you know, we were in the paper and I couldn't I found myself not being able to get a bank [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2055.14s)]
*  account and nobody I knew would go near me, you know. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2063.82s)]
*  And so it ended up being like a Bob Marley type of thing. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2066.42s)]
*  You know, like, you know, he said, if you're not living good, travel wide. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2070.42s)]
*  Right. And I literally just walked out of town because, you know, we had scarlet letters on our [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2074.98s)]
*  chest. That's when I that's when I really started learning how to stand behind that guitar and [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2080.46s)]
*  write songs and slowly but surely start. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2086.06s)]
*  I learned how to play basically in front of people and people just were giving me money kind of [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2089.38s)]
*  over time that and, you know, food and shelter in exchange for my story at their back door. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2094.4199999999996s)]
*  This episode is brought to you by Netflix. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2101.02s)]

*  Well, just felt it all like really strong, you know, that's probably good. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2319.14s)]
*  Yeah. Maybe it's a survival instinct, too. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2322.46s)]
*  I've never really thought about why, you know, but I have considered it because my [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2325.5s)]
*  brother's been through, you know, he did a lot of time in prison and, you know, my [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2330.58s)]
*  I say my sister had and my mama, you know, I mean, they both had their first kid, you [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2335.66s)]
*  know, and they were teenagers, you know. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2341.38s)]
*  A lot of it, I do credit to my mama, you know, it's like, you know, she told me [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2345.7400000000002s)]
*  something I remember that stuck with me. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2349.1s)]
*  I've been saying this all the time, Joe, and like we had a lot of trouble in our [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2350.98s)]
*  family and a lot of people that we knew a lot of dysfunction, a lot of trauma. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2355.54s)]
*  But when my mama kind of got out of that, she kind of is the person in the family [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2363.6200000000003s)]
*  that said, I'm going to change the trajectory of this line and now in my [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2369.58s)]
*  generation, you know, and she didn't have an education. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2374.7s)]
*  And, you know, she took herself back to school after I was born, you know, and [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2378.14s)]
*  cleaned up her act and got out of it and isolated me from a lot of that shit. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2386.18s)]
*  And which I think is a big part of the reason that I maybe didn't. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2392.62s)]
*  Right. You had a role model. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2397.66s)]
*  Yeah, I had a role model. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2399.02s)]
*  You know, I did. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2400.18s)]
*  There was no male role models, at least not at home. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2400.98s)]
*  They were only they were only pro athletes and coaches at school. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2403.42s)]
*  You know, I mean, it's increasingly difficult for young men to find strong [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2407.34s)]
*  men of courage and vision that can help them grow into good men, too. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2414.94s)]
*  I mean, it's it's it seems almost impossible these days. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2418.94s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2421.34s)]

*  It's hard, man. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2424.54s)]

*  Like. Like excellence in like athletics, right? [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2436.1s)]
*  You know, where the only way you can get there is hard work. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2442.98s)]
*  Yeah. And odds are stacked against you and requires incredible focus. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2446.7s)]
*  I mean, I just I think that's why I'm always so, you know, in such awe of of those [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2451.5s)]
*  people when they're able to succeed like that. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2457.66s)]

*  You got to take responsibility. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2492.26s)]
*  That's hard for people to accept when they know they've been victimized. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2494.02s)]
*  When they know they've been dealt a shitty hand of cards. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2496.78s)]

*  another sense, you know, was that's been helpful to me, too, you know, because I [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2537.98s)]
*  remember he used to hand out flyers and shit all over the place. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2542.54s)]
*  And when I'd be like a teenager, he'd be like, he'd be like, listen to me now. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2545.2599999999998s)]
*  If you go, if you leave an event at the other day that you're handing out flyers [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2550.02s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2606.2200000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2606.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2607.1000000000004s)]
*  How they, you know, they introduced that concept of looking at the data to like [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2607.78s)]
*  maximize the potential of the athletes and all that kind of stuff, which has [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2612.3s)]
*  totally changed the game, you know, all the games. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2615.98s)]
*  I kind of call it money guitar, right? [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2619.42s)]
*  Which is like, you know, the business is seeding the young amateur and for the way [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2622.02s)]
*  that they spend and invest and can move on if it doesn't work out, it's like kind [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2629.74s)]
*  of a, you know, it's kind of a pump and dump, you know? [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2635.06s)]
*  And the thing about that, it works. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2639.9s)]
*  Like if somebody has a, you know, if somebody, like some of these guys that [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2643.34s)]
*  mentioned Oliver Anthony and some of these guys, they have a viral hit out of [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2647.9s)]
*  nowhere. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2652.06s)]
*  They've never played a venue or anything in their life. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2652.7000000000003s)]
*  You know, it can happen really fast. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2656.54s)]
*  And then obviously there's tremendous challenges, you know, down the line trying [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2660.3s)]
*  to keep that, you know, astronomical, you know, quick rise up there. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2665.58s)]
*  But back in the day, the business deals weren't any good. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2671.58s)]
*  You know that they were terrible. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2675.38s)]
*  Right. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2676.6600000000003s)]
*  What they were good about though, in a lot of cases was developing these artists on [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2677.38s)]
*  these rosters, even if they were taking advantage of these poor farm boys, taking [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2682.26s)]
*  advantage, you know, of, you know, poor black artists from the South or women or [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2686.3s)]
*  whatever. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2691.82s)]
*  Nobody was getting a good deal, basically. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2692.3s)]
*  But, you know, like guys like Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings, those guys were [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2694.6600000000003s)]
*  making two, three records a year. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2701.3s)]
*  You know, and you think about when Waylon breaks through, right, in the mid 70s, [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2703.86s)]
*  you know, like as he's doing, you know, coming into his own in 1974, 1975. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2709.26s)]
*  I mean, how many records in is he at that point? [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2718.7000000000003s)]
*  You know, he's, I mean, you know, Willie's read at a stranger, which [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2720.94s)]
*  revolutionized country music or like the outlaws compilation record that the two [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2727.46s)]
*  of them were on together, which was basically a compilation and kind of [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2731.82s)]
*  marketed as the outlaw subgenre. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2735.2200000000003s)]
*  You know, those guys were 15, those guys were 15, 16, 17 records in, you know, [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2739.98s)]
*  Aretha Franklin popped off on her ninth or tenth record. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2746.6600000000003s)]
*  Wow. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2750.3s)]
*  You know, and these, most of these artists, the way the business works, they won't [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2750.94s)]
*  make nine or 10 records in their career. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2755.54s)]
*  Right. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2757.7000000000003s)]
*  That's crazy to me. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2758.26s)]
*  That is crazy. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2759.26s)]
*  And what better way to develop than to just keep constantly producing new music [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2760.14s)]
*  and learn along the way. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2763.98s)]
*  And in being neglected or misunderstood by their business when I was first dealing [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2765.2999999999997s)]
*  with it, that was the, it was a really, a really a blessing because I ended up [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2772.42s)]
*  making so many records, you know. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2778.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2780.22s)]
*  The music business has always been so predatory, but it's, it's like, it's the [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2782.38s)]
*  way I describe a lot of things. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2788.58s)]
*  It's like when you get something that's good combined with a bunch of people that [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2790.06s)]
*  want to make money off that something that's good, you know, whether it's [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2794.1s)]
*  medicine or whether it's music or even in comedy, you get the same thing. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2798.2599999999998s)]
*  You get a bunch of people that just think they can make money off you. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2802.7s)]
*  Man, I always thought comedy was the hardest. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2805.94s)]
*  Always figured it was the hardest. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2808.62s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2810.58s)]
*  Cause you mean like you got to make them laugh or they're going to fucking kill you. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2811.02s)]
*  And you have new shit all the time. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2813.9s)]
*  There's nothing, there's nothing behind you. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2815.58s)]
*  There's not even a guitar covering you up. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2817.7000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2819.54s)]
*  That's crazy to me. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2819.94s)]
*  It's to watch all those guys do their bit and shit. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2820.7400000000002s)]
*  So like, I was always amazed by even a tent people going up at like the open [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2823.1400000000003s)]
*  mics and like trying out their routine, you know, that always terrified me. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2829.82s)]
*  It terrifies me still when I watch open mics, I watch open mics and I [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2833.6200000000003s)]
*  watch someone bombing, I got to leave the room. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2837.1800000000003s)]
*  I fear that it's contagious. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2840.34s)]
*  Like if I, if I was on the road and I didn't get to pick my opening acts, [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2843.1s)]
*  like if I was working at a club and they had some local act in Florida or [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2847.8199999999997s)]
*  something like that, and the guy was fucking terrible, I would literally [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2851.62s)]
*  have to like not listen, I'd have to leave the room and just sort of time [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2854.18s)]
*  when I was going to go on stage. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2858.9s)]
*  So I go on stage with a fresh mindset. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2860.2599999999998s)]
*  I couldn't think that this audience had been poisoned by this guy's shitty comedy. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2863.06s)]
*  I get that. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2867.62s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2868.22s)]
*  It's like, it's terrible and it's like you think that nothing could be funny. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2868.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2874.46s)]
*  He just, it's like this, like he's hypnotized them into this like mediocre [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2875.02s)]
*  state of mind, like, I can't listen. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2880.2999999999997s)]
*  I got to hide. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2883.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2883.7s)]
*  And it's crazy that they could have that, that strong an effect on the [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2884.14s)]
*  audience, like that, that quick. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2888.3399999999997s)]
*  I mean, somebody can be up there fucking it up like crazy musically. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2889.8599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2893.2599999999998s)]
*  And you kind of get a pass, you know, you know, poetic license or whatever. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2893.58s)]
*  Well, you know, people, it's tolerable if the guy's into it, you know, he could [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2898.42s)]
*  be into his own music and you're like, I'm not into it, but he's into it. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2902.5s)]
*  At least he's like doing his song. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2906.2200000000003s)]
*  If you're not into, if you're doing comedy and the audience is not into it, [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2907.86s)]
*  you're fucked. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2911.94s)]
*  You're like really fucked. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2913.14s)]
*  You have to engage those people. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2914.14s)]
*  I see that. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2915.14s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2915.6600000000003s)]
*  You got to be connected to those people and you can't fake it. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2916.38s)]
*  Like you can't even be saying the words perfectly and not be thinking about it. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2919.54s)]
*  You have to be thinking about what you're saying. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2923.46s)]
*  They know they're little animals. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2925.54s)]
*  They smell you. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2927.26s)]
*  They know they know if you're faking it and you just got to lock in, man. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2928.6200000000003s)]
*  And you got to learn how to lock in. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2934.1800000000003s)]
*  It takes about 10 years. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2935.6600000000003s)]
*  It takes 10 years of eating shit. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2937.7000000000003s)]
*  Just fucking bombing and traveling around and opening up for people and [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2940.6600000000003s)]
*  barely getting by. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2946.0600000000004s)]
*  That's the same thing with music though, but the 10 year deal, you know, the [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2947.34s)]
*  10,000 hour thing, there's no doubt about it. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2950.1000000000004s)]
*  I think it's probably almost everything. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2953.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2955.6200000000003s)]
*  Almost everything. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2956.0200000000004s)]
*  Anything you dedicate yourself to, you know, you like Noam Chomsky? [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2956.78s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2961.3s)]
*  You ever see? [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2962.3s)]
*  I like old Noam Chomsky. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2962.9s)]
*  I listened to him today. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2963.86s)]

*  He wanted people to be isolated and quarantined and taken away from society. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2971.98s)]
*  If they weren't willing to take this fucking experimental shit. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2976.7000000000003s)]

*  And old people, unfortunately also he's an academic. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2983.42s)]
*  So academics tend to trust experts in whatever field they're in. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2987.26s)]
*  And if he doesn't have an understanding, like he has a deep understanding of how [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2991.58s)]
*  compromise people are politically by money, you know, and he's written some [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=2996.1400000000003s)]
*  brilliant work on essentially the way the media is compromised and the way, you [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3000.3s)]
*  know, politics are compromised. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3007.7000000000003s)]
*  I don't think he applied that same step skepticism towards the [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3010.9s)]
*  pharmaceutical industrial complex. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3013.54s)]
*  Which is strange. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3015.38s)]
*  Well, people have their blind spots. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3016.46s)]
*  Yeah, we all do. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3018.7400000000002s)]
*  And they trust experts. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3020.2200000000003s)]
*  And if you, you know, he's got experts that are academics and you trust them. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3021.42s)]
*  And, and also he's old and old people get real scared of diseases. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3025.1s)]
*  They get real scared because they know how fucking vulnerable they are. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3029.5s)]
*  All the people that I knew that were old had the craziest reaction to COVID. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3032.26s)]
*  Terrified. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3036.58s)]
*  Even my own parents tried to, you know, talk them through some of this stuff. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3037.62s)]
*  They didn't want to hear it. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3041.8199999999997s)]
*  They only wanted to listen to doctors. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3042.54s)]
*  They're one like, I don't think this is what they're telling you. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3043.8999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3047.54s)]
*  You know, doctors are crazy. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3048.14s)]
*  They're just, they got a cabinet full of pills that they've been, they've been [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3049.62s)]

*  That's what's really crazy. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3060.14s)]
*  When I found that out, that means I learned so much during the pandemic about the [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3061.1s)]
*  medical industry where I just thought they were there. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3065.7s)]

*  I didn't even realize that hospitals are privately owned. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3070.42s)]
*  I thought these were things set up by the government to make sure [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3074.7s)]
*  that people can get healed. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3077.7799999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3079.3799999999997s)]
*  You know, I thought it was all about making people better. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3079.8599999999997s)]
*  And so they're not public. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3082.5s)]
*  The closest thing to public there is if they're owned by like a, you know, [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3083.3799999999997s)]

*  And they're just fucking shuffling people in and out, trying to prescribe them as [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3092.46s)]
*  many things and they're financially incentivized to prescribe things. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3096.38s)]
*  And then they have extreme overhead because they have liability insurance, [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3100.86s)]
*  they have student loan debt and they have, you know, a high overhead to [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3105.2200000000003s)]
*  keep their practice running and. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3108.7400000000002s)]
*  Where's Bernie Sanders when you need him. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3111.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3112.62s)]
*  Well, no, see, so I had, I had open heart surgery right here in Austin, uh, to fix [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3114.3s)]
*  it. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3119.66s)]

*  It's a, it's an electrical issue. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3125.34s)]
*  Um, in your heart, basically like your heart missed fires. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3127.82s)]
*  All this electricity is moving through it all the time. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3132.7000000000003s)]
*  Well, you know, like a semiconductor or whatever, and there was like a section [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3137.1800000000003s)]
*  of it that was like misfiring and it would cause my, an arrhythmia with me. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3140.58s)]
*  Wow. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3145.3s)]
*  Um, and when I was a kid in South Texas, we were told that was all I knew about. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3145.7000000000003s)]
*  And we were told that it was an annoyance, um, cause I almost died a couple [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3149.98s)]
*  of times and I was really, really young from it. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3153.9s)]
*  And you know, my mama noticed and saved my life a couple of times by getting [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3156.38s)]
*  driving in, you know, into the city there in the San Benito and them hooking me up [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3160.7400000000002s)]
*  to all the wires and saving me. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3166.7400000000002s)]
*  Anyways, they told me as I got older, that it would just, um, I could get, [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3169.1800000000003s)]
*  you know, a blade and ablation for it where they apply heat basically and close [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3175.2200000000003s)]
*  this electrical channel that's stuck in a loop or whatever. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3179.46s)]
*  Um, but it, but it wasn't life threatening. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3183.7s)]
*  And then I got out here, you know, I was on the street for years. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3187.7400000000002s)]
*  And then when I was coming off the street through kind of blues jams and I had been, [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3192.14s)]
*  you know, I was working on gonja farms and it started selling, you know, weed [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3196.5s)]
*  in the mail and all that to kind of get off street by myself, some better clothes, [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3200.94s)]
*  get myself a good guitar and amp and all that started showing up at blues jams. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3205.42s)]
*  And then I could like, you know, cause everything takes money, you know, like [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3209.22s)]
*  the problem with being a street player was you can go play the open mics that [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3213.62s)]
*  have a two damn drink minimum. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3216.22s)]
*  And they'd see my crazy ass come in and knew knew that I was, you know, pretty [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3218.58s)]
*  wild and they didn't have any money and it didn't smell and I didn't smell good. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3222.66s)]
*  So they really didn't like me for the, you know, for the longest time or whatever. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3227.14s)]
*  But I threw blues jams. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3230.54s)]
*  I started leading bands and bars and deep Elam first gig I ever got in Austin was [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3233.1s)]
*  right there at Darwin's pub, you know, on sixth street playing kind of solo in the [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3238.94s)]
*  afternoon. It was the only guy, CJ was the only guy who gave me a gig even on sixth [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3242.86s)]
*  street. I always owed him for that. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3246.6200000000003s)]
*  And I mean, he just gave me 50 bucks. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3248.5s)]
*  You know, he wanted me to get paid out of the well whiskey and those, those, uh, [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3250.46s)]
*  what does he sell over there? [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3257.1800000000003s)]
*  Those gyros or whatever the hell he's got over there. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3258.1800000000003s)]
*  Anyway, I get on the road, I get an agent. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3262.7000000000003s)]
*  I was standing out at Green Hall, handing CDs out on a street corner because I [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3265.58s)]
*  couldn't get into the show, handed a guy a CD. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3269.42s)]
*  His name's Evan Felker. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3272.86s)]
*  I didn't know who he was at the time, but he's front man for Turnpike Troubadours. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3274.38s)]
*  I gave him a CD and he, well, he took it home and he listened to it with his then [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3279.98s)]
*  girlfriend and now wife. And lo and behold, his agent, John Folt called me up and [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3286.02s)]
*  started booking me. And then that's when I started playing the old, uh, red dirt. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3290.58s)]
*  I like to call it the Hank Williams circuit, you know, the kind of old country [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3296.58s)]
*  chitlin circuit. John Folt had kind of inherited it, inherited it from like, uh, [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3299.42s)]
*  Buddy Lee attractions from an earlier generation. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3304.7s)]
*  It goes all the way back to Lucky Moeller and that old South circuit that all the [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3307.7s)]
*  R and B and the Hillbilly country boys were on and Folt kind of inherited it and [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3312.9s)]
*  rebuilt it. And then they, you know, then Coke and Pepsi came in, you know, [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3318.38s)]
*  CAA and, uh, William Morris and Wasserman and bought it all off, you know, [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3323.1400000000003s)]
*  bought it all out and you had no choice. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3329.06s)]
*  And they were going to part it out no matter what. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3331.1s)]
*  And that's the way that it works, right? When you get Coca-Cola's attention, [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3332.94s)]
*  right. And they show up and they're like, good job. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3336.5s)]
*  You're taking some of our money away from us. We're going to buy you out son. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3339.86s)]
*  And you, right. I think you can refuse them once or twice and they'll come back [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3343.5s)]
*  with a better deal. Right. After that, if you keep turning them down, [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3347.34s)]
*  then they put all their energy into knocking you out, you know? [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3351.38s)]
*  That's what I mean. As long as Coke doesn't change the flavor of Coca-Cola, [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3355.1000000000004s)]

*  As long as they don't fuck up the original flavor, right? [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3364.82s)]
*  So I'm on that circuit working my ass off 200 and whatever shows a year for a [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3367.86s)]

*  I was getting really lightheaded and I'd be sitting in the back of the bus and I [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3399.5s)]
*  would be so lightheaded. I'd be blacking out a lot. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3402.78s)]
*  Right. Just sitting there short of breath. But I just thought, you know, [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3405.98s)]
*  I'm grinding. I'm playing all these shows. I'm going, [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3411.58s)]
*  I'm going as hard as you can go taking potions, you know, [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3415.1800000000003s)]
*  just doing all this dumb shit, working hard. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3419.7000000000003s)]
*  And I was playing at the old Shady Grove here in town. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3422.5s)]
*  That's now closed down. They used to do, it was the KGSR radio thing. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3426.42s)]
*  Marshall Millum put it on or whatever. And then it turned into, you know, [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3431.34s)]
*  ACL radio and then Shady Grove closed down there on Barton Springs, wherever. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3434.14s)]
*  But I played it a handful of times. First time I played it, there was nobody there. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3439.06s)]
*  Second time I played it, it was packed and I had, [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3442.06s)]
*  I had Willie's old tour bus, the redheaded stranger. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3444.3799999999997s)]
*  It was one of the ones he lost in the IRS era that he never got back. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3447.98s)]
*  Oh wow. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3452.2599999999998s)]
*  And this fucking shyster Chuck Ligon. I remember he, [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3453.1s)]
*  some motherfucker was selling this thing on the side of the highway up in Oklahoma, [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3457.42s)]
*  the redheaded stranger with the murals on it and shit. It was a beautiful bus. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3461.06s)]
*  Somehow this guy gets it. Right? I shouldn't call him a shyster, [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3464.7s)]
*  but he definitely shyster me. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3467.8999999999996s)]
*  That's a shyster then. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3469.9399999999996s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. You know, the music business is crazy because so, [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3471.14s)]
*  here it is. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3475.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3476.14s)]
*  Wow. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3477.54s)]
*  That's the one man. Yeah, that's the one. On the other side, it says, [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3479.2999999999997s)]
*  driven only by the finest bass players. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3483.5s)]
*  You know, because somebody in the band always drove those old buses. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3486.5s)]
*  I had that bus. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3489.7400000000002s)]
*  I use that bus exclusively for about a year or whatever. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3490.62s)]
*  And we get off the stage at Shady Grove and my heart had gone out of rhythm. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3494.62s)]
*  I don't just say this. I almost died in the back of that bus. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3501.82s)]
*  I ended up finding because it won't go. Here I am 30 something years old, [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3504.62s)]
*  or my early thirties. My arrhythmia is out. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3508.7000000000003s)]
*  It's it's going out and it's getting harder and harder to get back in, [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3512.58s)]
*  to shock it back into normal rhythm. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3516.3s)]
*  And I just kept ignoring it because somebody told me in South Texas in the [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3519.2200000000003s)]
*  eighties not to, not to worry about it. Anyway, you know, [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3523.98s)]
*  it turned out that my heart had enlarged and all this shit was going on. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3528.94s)]
*  And I had to get surgery. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3532.7000000000003s)]
*  The point long round about point that I'm making to you about medical industry [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3534.78s)]
*  that I learned the hard way, man, is like, no one's advocating for you. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3538.78s)]
*  Only you, you have to be your own advocate. They don't give a fuck. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3542.6600000000003s)]
*  You know, they don't like they were just going to automatically put a mechanical [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3546.78s)]
*  valve in my heart, right? Automatically. Didn't present any other options, [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3550.82s)]
*  anything. Right. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3555.9s)]
*  And I get there on the American Heart Association webpage or whatever, [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3558.54s)]
*  because I have insurance at the time or anything, nothing, you know, [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3562.46s)]
*  the only reason that they covered me at the time was the affordable care act. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3567.3s)]
*  And I had the right window where they could not deny me. Right. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3570.86s)]
*  Otherwise I don't know what I would have done. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3574.2999999999997s)]
*  And that is absolutely an imperfect system. Right. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3576.66s)]
*  I just didn't have health insurance. So here they are covering me. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3579.8999999999996s)]
*  And probably because I don't have money and they're dealing with, you know, [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3583.14s)]
*  how it is, you know, American business practices or whatever. They're like, [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3586.3799999999997s)]
*  here's this mechanical valve. And I go and look it up, Joe. And it's like, [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3591.1s)]
*  you know, if you have a mechanical valve, [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3597.02s)]
*  you automatically are on blood thinner the rest of your life, [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3601.2599999999998s)]
*  automatically, no matter what there's, and you can't, [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3604.02s)]
*  that's just how it's going to be. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3606.9s)]
*  It lasts twice as long as a prosthetic valve, [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3609.94s)]
*  which I had not heard of at that point, but that was the whole thing. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3613.62s)]
*  This can last up to 20 years. But guess what? [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3616.58s)]
*  You have like 300% higher risk of a stroke with a mechanical [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3619.22s)]
*  valve as a prosthetic, a bio-prosthetic cow valve. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3623.94s)]
*  And then the third thing was that you can hear that thing [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3629.3399999999997s)]
*  clicking. You can hear the valve. Yeah. Ticking. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3634.14s)]
*  My buddy Everlast has one of those. Really? Yeah. He could go like this. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3638.2599999999998s)]
*  You can hear it. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3642.1s)]
*  And I was reading about that and man, I'm like neurotic. Like I knew, I'm like, [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3645.7s)]
*  I'll never get over it. So that's when I found out about the, [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3650.14s)]
*  about the bovine cow valve. So it's made out of a cow. Yeah. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3653.42s)]
*  Edward Scientific makes it. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3658.06s)]
*  I carry a little card around in my wallet with the tag of the, of, [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3659.86s)]
*  you know, that product number in case somebody sees me on the, [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3664.78s)]
*  finds me on the sidewalk. Wow. You know, and in that point, [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3667.06s)]
*  how long does that last? [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3670.7400000000002s)]
*  They're supposed to last around 10 years. And I had mine and, uh, [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3671.98s)]
*  I had mine done in right there at Seton, you know, [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3676.38s)]
*  Seton Medical there on 38th in January, 2019. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3681.2200000000003s)]
*  So we're coming back around to it. I'm kind of, [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3686.46s)]
*  So you have to get another operation? [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3688.1s)]
*  Yeah. But what they did is they put a, they put a, the way they did it. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3690.22s)]
*  And here's the thing about, right, medical and anything, right? [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3694.66s)]
*  The medical industry is, I think, really fucked up and really predatory, [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3698.7s)]
*  totally profit driven and like, you know, [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3702.9399999999996s)]
*  people's health and preventative wellbeing and all that. I mean, we don't get, [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3706.5s)]
*  they don't give, we don't give a fuck about that in this country. You know? [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3710.4199999999996s)]
*  I mean, there's no money to be made off of people look, [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3713.22s)]
*  taking care of themselves and eating right and being preventative and like, [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3716.5s)]
*  you know, there's, there's, there's nothing in that. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3720.8199999999997s)]
*  The part about it that is amazing though, [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3722.62s)]
*  even in the like kind of insanity of all the land of cheap traders [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3726.1s)]
*  is the technological advancements. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3731.7s)]
*  The technological advancements in the medical field, though, not really, [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3733.98s)]
*  you know, available to the common person. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3738.74s)]
*  They are incredible advancements, right? So it's like, [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3742.78s)]
*  they're moving so quickly that by the time I need to get another one, [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3746.38s)]
*  I don't think they'll ever have to open me, cut me up, open again, [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3750.46s)]
*  because they can like go in through a scope now. They could do it at that time. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3753.2200000000003s)]
*  It was just more experimental and they didn't want to do it. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3756.78s)]
*  They were only doing it on really high risk, older patients, you know? [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3759.94s)]
*  But I think it's already kind of gone more mainstream from where, [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3763.5800000000004s)]
*  when they cut me open to like, if I did it right now, [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3766.7400000000002s)]
*  I could probably get around cutting it. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3769.8599999999997s)]
*  So they'll go in through an artery. Yeah. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3772.8999999999996s)]
*  And then what do they have to do to it? [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3775.18s)]
*  Well, so with me, what was happening was, is so I had the Wolf Parkinson's white, [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3777.4599999999996s)]
*  had to get the ablation first to deal to, [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3781.74s)]
*  before I could deal with what aortic valve disease is, what it's called. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3783.8199999999997s)]
*  And what it, what it basically is, is that, um, over your aorta, [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3788.4199999999996s)]
*  there's these three valves that sit on the, over the top of your aorta, [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3794.18s)]
*  that they look like a Mercedes symbol is what they look like. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3797.86s)]
*  It's like the best example. It really looks like a Mercedes symbol. And, uh, [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3800.1000000000004s)]
*  some people, uh, it's a bicuspid or whatever. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3804.6200000000003s)]
*  Some people are born with two of the three fused together or just one missing [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3807.6600000000003s)]
*  altogether. And it turned out that I just missing one. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3812.5400000000004s)]
*  That's like a leaky carburetor, you know? [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3815.6600000000003s)]
*  So like as the time goes that old carburetor in that truck over time, [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3817.34s)]
*  just leaking more and more and more, you know? And I mean, [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3821.2200000000003s)]
*  I just got lucky man. Cause I was like in the back of that fucking bus. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3825.38s)]
*  And there was this lady driving us back then that like, [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3829.06s)]
*  it was like holding seances and burning sage over the top of me while I was like [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3833.1800000000003s)]
*  laying in the back of the bus. Like that was going to heal me. That shit, [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=3837.3s)]

*  like this amalgamation of a bunch of people just trying to fucking sell me [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4134.58s)]

*  I think he really liked me because he saw the way that I was living this [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4338.7s)]
*  American gypsy lifestyle. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4343.139999999999s)]
*  And he eventually helped me get over to Europe and I played the club circuit in [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4346.299999999999s)]
*  Copenhagen for like six weeks or whatever. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4351.0199999999995s)]
*  And I was really rough around the edges and like the American novelty in the [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4354.38s)]
*  folk and like blues clubs around Copenhagen wore off really quick. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4359.259999999999s)]
*  And I wound up back on the street, but this time in Europe. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4363.62s)]
*  And as soon as I started playing on the street in Copenhagen, man, [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4366.42s)]
*  then being a real Texan in Europe, [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4371.7s)]
*  in front of tourists on the street, man, I start, that's when I started making money. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4375.62s)]
*  It was crazy. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4379.66s)]
*  My money like quadrupled because all of a sudden I was like a truly exotic, [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4380.38s)]
*  Texas is exotic and everywhere you go in the world, it means something, right? [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4385.259999999999s)]
*  They either want to shake your hand or they step back. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4389.74s)]
*  And it doesn't matter where you go in the world. There's no, [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4392.339999999999s)]
*  there's not an inch of the world that hadn't heard of Texas, you know? And, [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4394.9s)]
*  and that's it. And so musically, you know, it, [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4399.139999999999s)]
*  and I think culturally it means something no matter what, you know, [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4402.139999999999s)]
*  and to play music and be a Texan is worth a lot on its own. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4406.94s)]
*  You know what I mean? It's a big part of it is just being a Texan. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4411.78s)]
*  Gary Clark Jr. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4414.86s)]
*  Learning how to hold his own under the tradition of [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4416.62s)]
*  Austin blues players in Texas, guitar slingers. I mean, that's, [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4421.62s)]
*  it's second to none in the world, you know? [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4426.7s)]
*  And so if you've seen them live, you know what it is. And, uh, [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4428.9s)]
*  but I remember seeing like, [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4433.46s)]
*  there were no self checkouts at grocery stores and shit in the United States back [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4436.34s)]
*  then, not one. And then I was like, [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4440.9s)]
*  I ended up down in France cause it was getting cold in Copenhagen and I had like, [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4444.26s)]
*  I had like two or 300 Kroner left and I put it all on a bus ticket to Paris [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4448.219999999999s)]
*  cause it was my mama's favorite city. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4453.0199999999995s)]
*  And I grew up quite a bit in Louisiana having some of that French heritage. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4454.94s)]
*  And I went down there. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4459.66s)]
*  I'm glad I didn't think about it, man, cause the language barrier was really difficult. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4462.299999999999s)]
*  And I didn't really realize it. So I was pulling into the city, you know, [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4465.82s)]
*  and actually there was an Algerian guy who spoke English that was like, man, [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4469.0599999999995s)]
*  go to Mon-Mart, go to Les Sacre-Cours, go to Les Sacre-Cours, [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4473.099999999999s)]
*  that's where the tourists are or whatever. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4475.82s)]
*  And I kind of learned how to hustle tourists with gypsies kind of that would [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4477.46s)]
*  were let, were using me kind of as a decoy on the steps. And I thought, [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4482.94s)]
*  this is great. These gypsies love me. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4487.0199999999995s)]
*  And I'm sitting there playing and while I'm playing, [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4490.0599999999995s)]
*  I realized that I'm just a distraction while they're pickpocketing these tourists. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4492.46s)]
*  It was a good trick. Of course, I didn't say anything. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4496.219999999999s)]
*  Also I didn't stick with them too much, but like, so like the automation thing, [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4498.54s)]
*  you know, they're, they're Europe is way ahead of us on all of that, [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4504.5s)]
*  because in a lot of ways America, [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4508.82s)]
*  when you try to like analyze America against Europe and these countries over [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4511.5s)]
*  there, like in some ways it's similar, [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4518.94s)]
*  but we're more similar to Latin or South America in a lot of ways with just how [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4521.74s)]
*  big the country is, you know, and you know, the, [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4526.74s)]
*  the ag, the, you know, [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4530.46s)]
*  because the country's so big, [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4537.58s)]
*  we got the States that are divided up on the type of shit, [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4538.94s)]
*  those kinds of technologies to like hit the people and become mainstream. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4541.02s)]
*  It's slow. It's a slower process here. Right. And one of the things, [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4545.82s)]
*  you know, about the pandemic that is obvious to me now is, you know, [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4550.22s)]
*  a lot of people realize that they could speed that up, you know, and, [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4555.26s)]
*  you know, I mean, they think they'd been trying to eliminate, you know, [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4560.5s)]
*  the, the risks and what's the word, what are they like, you know, [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4565.18s)]
*  externalizing costs, right? Once, like, how do we get, [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4570.02s)]
*  how do we get these machines in here and these people out? [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4574.3s)]
*  And it, [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4577.94s)]
*  we've probably jumped ahead in that process in America a decade or more in just [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4578.82s)]
*  a couple of years. And I just remember, [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4585.3s)]
*  this was probably 2010. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4588.0599999999995s)]
*  You'd go into a grocery store in Paris and there was, [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4590.58s)]
*  there was only one person working there and everything else was self checkout. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4593.86s)]
*  And that was years before I saw it here. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4598.74s)]
*  And then you think about the way that that's hitting in every single industry in [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4601.34s)]
*  America. Right. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4605.18s)]
*  Well, it's so easy for people to be completely disconnected from other people [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4607.38s)]
*  now. You know, you don't, you don't have to interact, you know, [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4610.38s)]
*  and that's part of it. And if they don't have to pay people, [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4615.46s)]
*  they can maximize their profits and then it becomes a very impersonal experience. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4618.66s)]
*  Soylent green is coming, baby. It's coming. You seen that movie? Yeah. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4623.06s)]
*  Good movie. That's a good movie. It's a scary fucking movie. Yeah. Well, [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4626.94s)]
*  I think all the dystopian movies about the future, they undersold it. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4631.22s)]
*  It's going to get real weird real soon. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4635.14s)]
*  And because automation is not just going to apply to self checkout, [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4637.54s)]
*  it's going to apply to everything. All the, all that truck driving shit, [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4641.22s)]
*  that's all gone. That's going to be gone. Right. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4644.5s)]
*  It's all going to be self driving trucks and they're going to be more efficient, [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4646.94s)]
*  less accidents, safer. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4650.82s)]
*  Just remember those big business people. Just remember those people. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4653.18s)]
*  I know a whole lot of people who have relied on undocumented [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4657.9s)]
*  workers in this state for decades, [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4662.38s)]
*  voting against the very thing that they were using themselves this entire time. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4665.66s)]
*  Yep. How are you going to rely on undocumented workers? Right. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4670.58s)]
*  Yourself. Right. You ain't paying taxes on it. You're not, you know, [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4674.98s)]
*  those people got no safety net or anything. Right. And then, you know, [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4678.94s)]
*  here comes the, that's where it's going to happen. You know, [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4683.42s)]
*  I'm not saying just as a negative thing, like, [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4686.62s)]
*  I think you can already see in social media, I do think there's this, [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4690.38s)]
*  um, this exhaustion, [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4695.14s)]
*  even in the youth with this, with this monolith, you know, with this thing, [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4698.82s)]
*  the phones. Yeah. You know, and I've been saying that in the music [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4703.46s)]
*  business, like in country music, you know, like Mark Twain said, history doesn't, [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4708.78s)]
*  um, it doesn't repeat it rhymes. Right. You know? And so it's like, [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4714.58s)]
*  it's 25 now, but I was thinking of it last year in 2024, [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4720.06s)]
*  cause like 1974 in music was this crazy year, you know, [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4723.82s)]
*  and like thinking about the Nashville system, [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4728.18s)]
*  the reason that Waylon Jennings is different than anybody else is because [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4731.54s)]
*  Waylon's the specific guy who breaks the stranglehold [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4735.22s)]
*  that the Nashville system has on its artists, that you can't use your band. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4741.02s)]
*  You can't choose your studio. Right. Like any of that, [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4745.780000000001s)]
*  like Waylon, you have to think how crazy that is. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4750.18s)]
*  You couldn't use your band and you couldn't even pick the studio. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4753.02s)]
*  You couldn't produce. You didn't have creative control at all. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4756.0199999999995s)]
*  Waylon's the guy that breaks that through that wall. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4759.42s)]
*  How did he do it? [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4763.5s)]
*  I think, I think a couple of ways it's all at the yin and yang of Willie Nelson [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4765.54s)]
*  and Waylon Jennings. They were both on RCA. Willie was, [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4770.98s)]
*  you know, at first, you know, it's like Stapleton. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4775.9s)]
*  Stapleton made his career as a songwriter early on, you know, and, [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4778.139999999999s)]
*  and that's what catapulted really for everything, you know, [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4782.7s)]
*  that he's got going on now. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4787.22s)]
*  There's a really great foundation there of a guy that's spent his whole life [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4788.46s)]
*  writing songs. And that's what Willie did, you know? [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4791.7s)]
*  So Willie actually had success pretty early when he got to Nashville with, [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4794.099999999999s)]
*  you know, songs like a nightlife and crazy and all that kind of stuff. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4799.5s)]
*  And Baron Young and Patsy Klein and these kinds of really big artists were [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4804.0599999999995s)]
*  cutting his songs pretty early on. Right. But he was so weird. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4808.0599999999995s)]
*  To the establishment at the time. And so, [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4812.94s)]
*  you know, kind of had this like philosophical thing into his writing that was [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4818.46s)]
*  going over the heads of the hillbilly deal. So he was really neglected as a, [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4824.3s)]
*  you know, Willie Nelson records with him singing them. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4829.38s)]
*  Waylon was more favored actually by like Chet Atkins and them. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4831.7s)]
*  But like you'd be, [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4836.7s)]
*  you'd be number one on the country charts in Nashville in the mid sixties and be [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4837.5s)]
*  in debt. You know, that's what Waylon said. Waylon was like, man, [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4842.06s)]
*  I'd be number one all the time. And I was fucking dead broke. You know, [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4845.5s)]
*  he's like, man, they got you out there seven nights a week and you're coming [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4849.02s)]
*  back and lucky Moller's telling them that you owe him fucking 10 grand. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4853.18s)]
*  You know, that was, that was a crazy system. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4857.3s)]
*  Willie ends up leaving RCA. They're over him. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4860.22s)]
*  He leaves RCA because Jerry Wexler is coming down and A&R and Texans out of [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4864.26s)]
*  this progressive central Texas scene of that era that was so unique. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4869.42s)]
*  And it happened then and just totally unique. The whole scene, [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4873.42s)]
*  everything here, the movement, the hippies and the Cowboys, [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4876.66s)]
*  the, the where everybody could like here in the capital of Texas, [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4880.1s)]
*  you know, it was weird, but they were in the same rooms. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4885.14s)]
*  We're still doing that here, you know, which is what I'm, [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4889.66s)]
*  what I'm really proud of, you know, [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4892.14s)]
*  and glad that this town never turned into Nashville or, [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4893.62s)]
*  LA or any of those towns. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4898.219999999999s)]
*  The best thing that ever happened to us is that the business didn't grow up [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4899.0599999999995s)]
*  like that. I really do believe that because it's allowed our unique culture to [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4901.62s)]
*  continue to grow. Even if it's, like I said, and sometimes it's, [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4906.0199999999995s)]
*  it's, it's good to be neglected by that machine for sure. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4910.0599999999995s)]
*  But so Willie leaves Jerry Wexler pulls them out of there because RCA doesn't [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4913.3s)]
*  give a fuck about him anyway. Right. He goes to Atlantic, [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4917.26s)]
*  sells 400,000 records. The boys up in New York, [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4921.179999999999s)]
*  don't even realize there's a country division after Willie sells 400,000 [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4925.06s)]
*  records, which is a lot, right? They closed the division. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4929.18s)]
*  And that's when Willie lands at Columbia and he's having success. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4933.06s)]
*  Well, they were starting to think that Waylon was past his prime too, [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4940.78s)]
*  but then Willie's blowing up on the other label and Willie and Waylon got the [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4944.9s)]
*  same manager at the time, Neil Reschen. And what's Reschen doing? [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4948.54s)]
*  Reschen's leveraging it all. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4951.9s)]
*  And so Waylon was about to leave RCA and they doubled down and matched kind of [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4952.94s)]
*  Willie's deal because they didn't want, [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4964.0199999999995s)]
*  because they didn't want to lose Waylon. And Waylon was like, [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4967.5s)]
*  I'm only, I'm only staying, you know, if I, [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4972.66s)]
*  like I gotta be producing my own records. I gotta, [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4977.26s)]
*  I gotta be my band and I gotta pick the place that I'm playing, you know? [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4979.38s)]
*  And he, he manages to do that. So it's not just Waylon. I mean, [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4982.62s)]
*  it's Willie and Waylon together. That's why they're so tied together. You know, [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4986.820000000001s)]
*  it was these two guys that their careers just kept, you know, [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4990.34s)]
*  they just kept, they're chasing each other kind of through the record books. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4996.34s)]
*  You know what I mean? And, uh, you know, [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=4999.7s)]
*  cause you'd be in Nashville and still like this now, right? [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5004.22s)]
*  Like when I got signed to Nashville by 30 tigers, [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5007.42s)]
*  it was purely because John Falk was my agent and those guys, [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5010.780000000001s)]
*  they'd tell you this themselves. They didn't understand what I was doing. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5015.42s)]
*  They didn't get it. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5018.860000000001s)]
*  I was only put on the roster as a favor to my agent because they were having [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5019.9400000000005s)]
*  success with some other artists openly saying, I don't understand this, [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5025.5s)]
*  right? Which at least they're being honest about, you know? [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5030.740000000001s)]
*  Um, but then what they would do that was so weird is like they'd give you, [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5033.740000000001s)]
*  like if a major label would give you, you know, [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5041.5s)]
*  half a million dollars on your deal, these guys would give you 50 grand, [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5044.820000000001s)]
*  right? Like a 10th of that, you know, [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5050.1s)]
*  kind of on the independent alt country Americana circuit. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5052.18s)]
*  But they would, what frustrated me, [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5057.42s)]
*  what frustrated me about it, Joe, was that they're only giving you a 10th of money, [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5059.14s)]
*  but they're behaving like major labels with these like two year record cycles. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5063.900000000001s)]
*  That just kills an artist that's like that note that hasn't broken through. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5070.46s)]
*  It just kills you. That's a, [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5075.46s)]
*  that's a 100% industry model because they can always get another horse. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5077.740000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? They can always get another horse and they can always, [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5084.18s)]
*  you know, they bet on 10 young guys and, [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5088.299999999999s)]
*  and one of those kinds of amateur realists blows up, you know, [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5090.78s)]
*  they're good, but you're never going to get a Waylon Jennings out of that model. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5095.5s)]
*  It's not going to, you know what I mean? It's not, it's not going to happen. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5100.9s)]
*  You know? [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5104.0599999999995s)]
*  And so how did, [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5105.42s)]
*  but how did Waylon get it so that he could do whatever he wanted? [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5107.219999999999s)]
*  Because Willie left, right? [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5113.54s)]
*  And they, because Willie left and all of a sudden Waylon was really going to [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5117.14s)]
*  leave. That's all of a sudden. That was his leverage. They gave him everything. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5121.9800000000005s)]
*  They gave him everything and everything was changing. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5126.38s)]
*  Everything was changing in Nashville. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5130.3s)]
*  Cause we're talking about when I say like 1974 here, you got to think about it. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5131.700000000001s)]
*  You know, this is America in Vietnam. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5135.22s)]
*  You know, this is America coming out of the sixties, [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5140.740000000001s)]
*  you know, it's coming. Everything was, [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5145.7s)]
*  you could, I feel like in a lot of ways, what was happening is like, you know, [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5150.0199999999995s)]
*  the commercial culture was really starting to take off. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5153.42s)]
*  You know what I mean? And then by the time we get to the eighties, you know, [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5159.26s)]
*  it's like this level of like pop culture and like American pop culture as a [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5162.74s)]
*  global export, you know, but it's like, [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5171.66s)]
*  I guess maybe it's finally truly realized by maybe by the time Michael Jordan [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5174.18s)]
*  becomes the like most visible person on the planet, you know, [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5179.66s)]
*  kind of in the eighties and nineties. It's like, [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5183.62s)]
*  Nashville was such an old system. It's kind of like in country music today, [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5187.700000000001s)]
*  like one of the reasons everybody's sprinting into it, right, [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5191.58s)]
*  is because it's one, [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5196.22s)]
*  it's like one of the only places left where [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5197.58s)]
*  there was like loyalty, [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5202.02s)]
*  long-term loyalty in the fan base compared to like, you know, [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5207.14s)]
*  what happened with pop music in the last 20 years with pop and hip hop and all [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5210.42s)]
*  that. I mean, I can't, [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5215.620000000001s)]
*  every one of those guys called me at one point and were like, [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5216.660000000001s)]
*  I want to get into country music cause you got loyal fans. Wow. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5218.900000000001s)]
*  All hip hop industry guys. Wow. All of them, every last one of them. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5222.06s)]
*  And they've had success with a whole bunch of guys since then. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5225.780000000001s)]
*  I just didn't do it. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5228.02s)]
*  Well, country music has always been connected to authenticity. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5229.34s)]
*  And that's the reason why you keep the loyal fans, right? [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5232.900000000001s)]
*  Cause people know that it's real, [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5235.740000000001s)]
*  whether it's Colter Wall or whoever it is, it's authentic. You hear it and you go, [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5238.3s)]
*  this is not mass produced. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5242.54s)]
*  This is not a bunch of executives sitting around looking at a focus group, [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5244.740000000001s)]
*  trying to figure out what's going to hit. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5248.9400000000005s)]
*  That's right. Yeah. Man, you mentioned Colter. I wanted to say this, [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5250.780000000001s)]
*  this is something I wanted to bring up with the Willie and Waylon thing. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5254.46s)]
*  And I've been meaning to tell Colter this. I'll just tell him on your show. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5258.38s)]
*  So we were both on the 30 Tigers roster for years. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5261.42s)]
*  I met Colter out at Willie's ranch, goddamn 10 years ago, right? [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5265.42s)]
*  And he's one of my favorites. I've always, always loved his songwriting. I mean, [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5270.14s)]
*  everything he puts out is great. Don't you agree? Yeah. Love him. Special, [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5273.78s)]
*  you know, really special. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5277.22s)]
*  Jamie turned me onto him when I heard Kate McCannon the first time. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5279.06s)]
*  Jamie Johnson. No, Jamie, this Jamie. Yeah. He texted me and he's like, [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5282.14s)]
*  you're going to love this guy. He sent me that song. I was like, holy shit. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5286.9s)]
*  When I found out he was 21 when he made that song, you gotta be kidding me. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5290.339999999999s)]
*  That sounds like a 60 year old chain smoker. Man, it bowled us all over. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5293.78s)]
*  And you know what's funny, man? He's just getting better. You know, he is. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5297.74s)]
*  And he's incredible. Here's something about that. I told him, I need to, [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5300.58s)]
*  I'm going to, I wanted to buy him a pickup truck as a gift for this. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5304.339999999999s)]
*  This is why. So he was on the roster. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5307.58s)]
*  I was on the roster and I started way down at the back of the line, right? [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5310.86s)]
*  And made a lot of records and [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5315.820000000001s)]
*  more and more of the labels are calling and each record I'm putting out is doing [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5320.780000000001s)]
*  better than the previous one. And, um, [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5324.06s)]
*  there's more money and promotion going into each album, [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5327.62s)]
*  but all a lot of outside guys are calling, you know, [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5331.860000000001s)]
*  all the coastal labels are calling New York and LA or all over me. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5334.02s)]
*  Culture ends up pulling up stakes and going to RCA. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5339.58s)]
*  And he didn't just go to RCA. He took everything with him. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5344.14s)]
*  And he took the whole catalog over there. Um, and I wasn't really aware of that. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5346.900000000001s)]
*  I didn't know what was going on. Um, and RCA, [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5351.58s)]
*  what like they had hollered at me, like there's one of their A and R guys or [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5355.9800000000005s)]
*  whatever, but their big guys were never really interested in me out there. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5359.46s)]
*  Right. They said they weren't one of the ones that was like really hot on me. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5363.1s)]
*  But David Macias at 30 tigers, [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5367.740000000001s)]
*  very similar to what I'm saying is, is culture to me, [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5372.38s)]
*  it's kind of like Willie left RCA back in the day. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5376.18s)]
*  And when he left all of a sudden those guys, [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5379.1s)]
*  because he took everything with them were about to lose me and they fucking [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5381.7s)]
*  handed the keys over to me. You know what I mean? [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5386.780000000001s)]
*  Because I think a lot of it had to do with the fact that culture had left and [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5391.38s)]
*  just took everything. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5395.54s)]
*  And so that ended up happening on a, on a, [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5397.3s)]
*  on a record cycle for me for an album called $10 cowboy. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5399.26s)]
*  And I was this close to go into, you know, [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5403.62s)]
*  the New York boys and Macias comes in last minute and beats them all on the [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5408.1s)]
*  royalty rate, on the money, on everything. Right. So, uh, [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5413.5s)]
*  I guess what I'm saying is culture is kind of my Willie Nelson. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5418.34s)]
*  Appreciate you bud. You're doing good. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5422.06s)]
*  Yeah. He won't do podcasts. I try to get him in. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5424.62s)]
*  He sent me a bunch of records and sent me some cool shit said, sorry, but no. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5428.0199999999995s)]
*  But I mean, that's probably better. Yeah. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5432.0199999999995s)]
*  He wants to just be as authentic as possible. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5434.58s)]
*  The dude spends time actually working on a ranch. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5437.379999999999s)]
*  Well that's what he loves to do. Yeah. You ever been up there to Saskatchewan? [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5440.419999999999s)]
*  No. Man. It's in their blood. Yeah. That's the, what that land is. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5443.299999999999s)]
*  That's what they do up there. Yeah. I've been right through Saskatoon, [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5448.419999999999s)]
*  even that big town there, you know, and he's, [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5451.58s)]
*  I guess he's not too far down south from there, but like it's a, [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5453.38s)]
*  those are ranching folks. Yeah. Well it's in his music, clearly. You know, [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5459.42s)]
*  I mean that, that guy screams authenticity. Yeah, he does. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5464.22s)]
*  And he grew up on on, you know, wayland and all that stuff, you know, [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5467.7s)]
*  and all the cowboy and all the, you know, [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5471.3s)]
*  he knows that cowboy music probably better than anybody. Yeah. Yeah. That, [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5472.86s)]
*  well that's, that's the thing that when you're talking about these hip hop [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5477.34s)]
*  artists and pop artists that that's what they feel, you know, all artists, [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5480.18s)]
*  I mean even someone is a pop artist. What do they want to be? They want, [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5484.5s)]
*  they want something that resonates with people. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5488.02s)]
*  They want something that really connects with people, you know, [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5489.900000000001s)]
*  and if they think the vehicle to doing that as a hip hop song, [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5492.54s)]
*  they'll take that route, but then they'll hear something like Kate McCannon, [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5495.820000000001s)]
*  like God damn, that's what I really want to do. Yeah. You know, [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5500.02s)]
*  you can't do, you can't duplicate that. The only, [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5504.54s)]
*  the only way to do that is to live it. Yeah. It's gotta be real. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5507.259999999999s)]
*  It's gotta be, you know, there's something, [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5510.46s)]
*  just like I was talking about with comedy, [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5513.98s)]
*  like they have to know that you're really thinking that it's something in music [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5515.54s)]
*  too. They have to know that this is, [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5519.7s)]
*  and they like when you write your own shit too, you know, [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5521.74s)]
*  you know that it's coming from someone's, someone's mind and their soul. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5524.219999999999s)]
*  It's coming from their life experience. It's who they are as a human being. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5528.86s)]
*  This is their art. This is a true expression of their, their, their being. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5532.339999999999s)]
*  And that that's what makes people loyal. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5537.0199999999995s)]
*  Those pop artists just want to take a picture standing next to authenticity. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5540.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah, they do. Well, they want to be it, [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5543.46s)]
*  but they don't know how to get there and they don't know how to do it. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5545.78s)]
*  And they've never lived it. And they've been, you know, [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5548.46s)]
*  they've been paying attention to all the polls and the focus groups and they've [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5550.62s)]
*  been listening to the executives and they've been taking the advances and [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5554.0199999999995s)]
*  driving the Mercedes. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5557.82s)]
*  They're doing all the shit that leads you down the wrong path. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5559.0199999999995s)]
*  And then one day you realize like, fuck, it's not what I want. You know, [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5562.58s)]
*  it's, it's interesting because it's like, you know, [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5567.9s)]
*  there's always going to be these examples of something that pops through. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5571.299999999999s)]
*  That's real that people gravitate towards. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5574.66s)]
*  And then there's always going to be these people trying to capitalize on it and [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5577.5s)]
*  make money off of it and trying to figure out how to recreate it in an [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5580.179999999999s)]
*  inauthentic way. It's not possible. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5583.259999999999s)]
*  That's the one thing that might save us from this AI shit. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5586.099999999999s)]
*  Cause AI is going to create a bunch of really catchy songs, you know, [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5590.66s)]
*  but it's never going to create an Oliver Anthony song. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5594.54s)]
*  It's never going to create hard times, you know, [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5596.66s)]
*  it's never going to create some of your shit. It's not, it's not going to, [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5599.18s)]
*  it's gotta come from a real human being. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5602.54s)]
*  And there's a thing that people are always going to want, you know, [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5605.18s)]
*  you're always going to want something that, you know, [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5607.98s)]
*  a real human being made that there's something in it, you know, [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5610.22s)]
*  that's why this building's filled with art. You know, [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5613.099999999999s)]
*  I love looking at something that somebody made, you know, it came from their, [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5615.7s)]
*  their soul came from whoever they are as a human. They laid it down, [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5620.7s)]
*  whether it's music or whether it's art, comedy, whatever it is. It's like that, [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5624.58s)]
*  that's coming from a human being, you know, [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5629.38s)]
*  and that's we're always going to want to be connected to that. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5632.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. I was looking at you saying that with your Joe Rogan experience sign and [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5636.18s)]
*  you telling me in the hallway that it's a name for Hendrix. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5639.7s)]
*  I stole it from Jimmy. When we first started doing it, [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5643.86s)]
*  the greats never reveal their sources. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5648.1s)]
*  Wow. I couldn't help it. I'm just kidding. I had to, I had, well, it's obvious. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5650.58s)]
*  I had to give it. It wasn't obvious to me, man. As I'm saying, I'm kind of slow. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5654.38s)]
*  I had to give it up. It's like, but you know, [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5657.900000000001s)]
*  Austin, Texas or bus that says right there, [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5660.38s)]
*  I used to listen to Jimmy all the time on the way to the comedy store. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5662.62s)]
*  That was like Jimmy and Led Zeppelin. I listened to whole lot of love. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5666.22s)]
*  And if six was nine, [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5670.26s)]
*  I'd listen to that all the time on the way down Laurel Canyon, doodoo, [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5672.38s)]
*  do do do doodoo. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5676.58s)]
*  Can you imagine how that crazy that must've sounded coming through the [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5679.34s)]
*  radio or coming through like people's sound systems in America in the, [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5684.1s)]
*  in the late sixties? [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5689.02s)]
*  Well, my friend Phil Hartman, when he was a kid, he used to work at the whiskey. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5690.06s)]
*  He was like, you know, like a grip and it was his job. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5695.18s)]
*  The speakers were precariously placed on the edge of the stage [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5699.860000000001s)]
*  and Jimmy performed there and it was his job to stand there and make [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5704.820000000001s)]
*  sure that Jimmy didn't kick over the speaker into the audience. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5709.620000000001s)]
*  So he stood right there while Hendrix played right above him. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5713.3s)]
*  And the way he talked about it, man, it's like, it was just to him, [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5718.38s)]
*  it was like this magical moment. Cause I think he was a teenager at the time. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5722.54s)]
*  And it was, you know, like in somebody else's band or something. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5727.54s)]
*  No, he was just working for the club. You know, [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5731.18s)]
*  he was just a guy that was hired to work there. You know, just a kid. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5733.780000000001s)]
*  And he was basically literally just there to make sure the speaker doesn't fall [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5738.1s)]
*  into the ground. And, you know, [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5741.5s)]
*  Jimmy was playing right above him, just right there. He said it was incredible. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5744.26s)]
*  It was insane. He said it was just like this magical moment. Cause Jimmy live, [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5748.58s)]
*  you know, there's something about seeing someone live, you know, [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5753.66s)]
*  like I was talking about when I saw Gary play midnight rider, [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5757.5s)]
*  there's something live and I was with my oldest daughter and we were at this [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5760.42s)]
*  downtown LA club and it was like a Monday or Tuesday night. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5764.18s)]
*  It was a weeknight and it was a midnight show. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5769.18s)]
*  It was like a real late night show and it was a sponsored by an alcohol company. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5771.62s)]
*  I wish I could remember the company, [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5776.38s)]
*  but they put together this very small show and it was just, [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5778.14s)]
*  they, it was a total impromptu session and Suzanne, [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5782.1s)]
*  my friend Suzanne Santo, who's the lead singer of honey honey at the time. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5786.38s)]
*  She's incredibly talented. She was singing it and she didn't know the exact words. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5789.9400000000005s)]
*  So she had to get the words off of her phone. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5795.46s)]
*  So she's singing midnight rider off her phone and Gary's in the [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5798.900000000001s)]
*  background and I recorded it on my phone and I upload, [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5803.660000000001s)]
*  see if you can find it. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5808.42s)]
*  Jamie version, but I have somebody else's version. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5809.1s)]
*  Oh shit. That's what I'm talking about right there. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5813.660000000001s)]
*  It was Jameson. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5819.820000000001s)]
*  Come on. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5825.06s)]
*  Love when he gets into it. Yeah. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5832.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5855.06s)]
*  The blues will never grow out of style. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5885.06s)]
*  Come on Gary. Let's go. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5945.06s)]
*  That's a nice jacket G. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5975.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5982.9400000000005s)]
*  Oh, that's it. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5985.9800000000005s)]
*  Jamie, see if you can find midnight rider on my Instagram. I know it's on there. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5989.700000000001s)]
*  I want to, I want to play that part because it was fucking insane. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5993.9400000000005s)]
*  It was just one of those magical moments where you see someone perform live. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=5998.26s)]
*  There's just something about, you get a lot of it. There it is. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6003.06s)]
*  This is it. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6014.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6033.06s)]
*  See how she's looking at her phone. She had to read the lyrics off her phone. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6064.06s)]
*  They're all doing that now. It's crazy. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6068.660000000001s)]
*  She had to cause she didn't know exactly the lyrics. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6070.06s)]
*  What if you didn't have this fucking thing though? [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6073.34s)]
*  Well, then you might have to remember them. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6075.860000000001s)]
*  Well, she would have had to get a piece of paper. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6078.3s)]
*  Or make some shit up. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6080.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Make some shit up. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6081.860000000001s)]
*  But man, you know, listening to Gary do that and you talking about how much he [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6082.9800000000005s)]
*  loves Stevie Ray Vaughan, it just, you know, it reminds me, it's like, you know, [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6086.700000000001s)]
*  you know, this to me, it's like, you know, it's like countries, everything, [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6091.0199999999995s)]
*  countries, nothing, you know, because if you're in, if you're in Texas, [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6097.259999999999s)]
*  all that shit over there on the other side of Mississippi, like it goes away for us. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6102.0599999999995s)]
*  You know, there's a, there's a, there's a brashness. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6106.58s)]
*  There's a, there's a boldness in any sound, [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6109.099999999999s)]
*  whether it's coming out of honky tonk or coming out of a blues joint in Texas. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6114.179999999999s)]
*  It's a totally different sound. You know, it's like, [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6118.66s)]
*  Billy Gibbons talked about this a lot, you know, [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6121.7s)]
*  like when those guys were trying to break through on the national scene, [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6123.74s)]
*  the idea of Texas is just a total stigma, right? [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6126.7s)]
*  It's all hillbillies. It's all provincial, you know, and all this shit, you know, [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6130.94s)]
*  and so it's like, you go to Nashville or whatever, [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6136.0599999999995s)]
*  and it's all Appalachia. It's all, you know what I mean? It's cause it's, [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6140.46s)]
*  and that's the thing. It's like, I can give a fuck about some genres, you know, [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6144.78s)]
*  because you get classified, but one thing you can't explain away is place, [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6148.1s)]
*  right? You can't explain away region, right? [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6154.860000000001s)]
*  Like you are from where you're from. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6158.780000000001s)]
*  Gary Clark Jr is from right here and he fucking sounds like it. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6161.5s)]
*  You know what I mean? He sounds like it. And it's like, [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6165.42s)]
*  it's not that it's rock, blues, soul, country, [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6168.22s)]
*  whatever it's, it's Texas. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6173.38s)]
*  And what happens with Texans of any background, right? [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6175.62s)]
*  They discount you for sure. Look at us as provincial, right? [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6179.42s)]
*  I mean, people got some ideas about what Texas is. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6184.66s)]
*  We've never stepped foot in the state. That's not any different than, you know, [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6187.46s)]
*  people who've never been to California claiming to be an expert on it. Right. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6191.82s)]
*  And so it's like, there's two roads for a Texas artist. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6195.58s)]
*  You either let somebody in Nashville or New York or LA convince you to lose your [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6200.1s)]
*  accent. You know, wash the Texas off, [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6205.46s)]
*  do it our way or which is the only way is to take your brand of Texas to the [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6210.58s)]
*  world, whatever it is, whether it's Gary or Selena or anybody. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6216.34s)]
*  Steve Rayvon. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6221.46s)]
*  Stevie Rayvon, man. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's with comedy too, man. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6222.3s)]
*  I mean, Bill Hicks, who's one of the greatest of all time. He's my favorite. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6227.3s)]
*  Right from here. That's right. The scene was hot, man. The scene was hot. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6230.3s)]
*  It was hot because of him. It was hot because of him and Kenison. It's Texas. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6233.58s)]
*  You know, I remember, you know, Hicks, no, met him once, [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6237.62s)]
*  met him once real briefly. Didn't even get a chance to talk to him, [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6240.82s)]
*  but I saw him perform live a few times before he died. You did see him live. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6244.38s)]
*  Saw Kenison a few times live. I saw Kenison live before he died too, [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6248.3s)]
*  but he had already passed his prime. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6252.26s)]
*  Kenison passed his prime real quick cause it was a, [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6254.46s)]
*  he's a cautionary tale because of the partying, you know, [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6257.38s)]
*  like he was the fucking man. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6261.58s)]
*  Oh, y'all got a party scene. Y'all, you comedians got a party scene. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6264.78s)]
*  Oh, it's well that party scene in LA at the time was the cocaine party scene. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6267.34s)]
*  It was a different party scene. You know, [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6272.26s)]
*  Mark Maron said that he hung out with Kenison and they did so much coke that he [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6274.66s)]
*  had voices in his head for a fucking year afterwards. A year. Like literally, [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6277.82s)]
*  like schizophrenic, you know, [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6281.78s)]
*  like hearing voices in his fucking head for a year before they stopped talking [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6283.62s)]
*  to him. Yeah, they were doing cocaine. They were doing it everywhere. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6288.14s)]
*  Yeah, he was doing it everywhere. But Kenison became almost like a caricature of [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6294.54s)]
*  himself. It became sort of captured by this, [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6298.14s)]
*  the perception by this character that they had created. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6301.34s)]
*  And Kenison is what birthed Hicks. You know, Hicks was, [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6305.5s)]
*  Hicks was a great comic, but he was one of the outlaws. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6309.3s)]
*  It was Kenison and Hicks that sort of defined the Texas style. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6312.9800000000005s)]
*  And when we were living in, at the time I was living in New York and there was, [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6317.18s)]
*  there was really two places in the country. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6322.38s)]
*  There was LA where you wanted to go to get on TV. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6324.099999999999s)]
*  Everybody wanted to go get a fucking sitcom. They all wanted to be Jerry Seinfeld. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6326.82s)]
*  And New York, which was like the club comics. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6330.5s)]
*  That was like the David Tells and the, these guys that would like, you know, [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6332.78s)]
*  the guys would do the clubs and they were, [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6336.58s)]
*  they were thought of as like the real pure comics, you know? [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6339.42s)]
*  And then there was this new scene, this new scene out of Houston, [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6342.3s)]
*  this new scene out of the laugh stop in river Oaks. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6345.7s)]
*  And I remember the first time I ever worked there, man, [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6349.34s)]
*  you could feel it in the building. You could feel that they had been there. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6352.58s)]
*  You know, they were both gone by the time I had worked there, they were both dead, [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6355.86s)]
*  but you could feel it in the building, man. You could feel it in the comics, [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6359.54s)]
*  the open mic scene. You could feel they were pure. You know, there was a, [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6362.82s)]
*  there was a Texas quality to the way they were doing comedy. It was a fuck you. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6365.94s)]
*  Yeah. Fuck you. That's what I like. Yeah. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6370.94s)]
*  Hicks would fuck with both sides of the room. Absolutely. And get, and, and, [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6374.22s)]
*  and just fuck them up and cross them over and put them in his pocket. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6378.34s)]
*  And no one knew what, what he was. They didn't know what he was. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6383.46s)]
*  The first time I ever saw him, he bombed. He bombed, except for the comedians. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6386.82s)]
*  We were dying laughing. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6390.74s)]
*  Cause you know, there's quite, [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6392.0199999999995s)]
*  there's quite a bit of video of him from these clubs here and in Houston when he [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6392.94s)]
*  was younger, cause they were even in the, you know, in the nineties, [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6397.3s)]
*  they were filming. And I've seen some of those clips where he's like, [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6399.5s)]
*  like you're talking about, he just couldn't fucking, [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6403.66s)]
*  the whole room's afraid of him. Like, no one's laughing. Everyone's afraid. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6405.94s)]
*  And he's like super fucked up. [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6410.98s)]
*  Well, he was the first comic really that had a message, right? You know, [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6412.46s)]
*  he had like a, there was a, [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6416.1s)]
*  there was a social commentary to his like a dark poetry to his comedy. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6417.34s)]
*  And so many people tried to emulate it that at the, [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6422.26s)]
*  the green room or the punchline in Atlanta, there was a, [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6424.94s)]
*  like people wrote a bunch of shit on the walls in the green room. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6428.0199999999995s)]
*  But one of the big ones that said quit trying to be Hicks. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6430.18s)]
*  Wow. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6433.54s)]
*  I remember seeing that guy. Yes, everybody did. We all did. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6434.38s)]
*  Everybody wanted to be Hicks. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6438.22s)]
*  Dude, you come. So after Stevie Ray Vaughn passed, right? [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6439.42s)]
*  I'm you know, we were up in Dallas, Fort Worth and you'd come down here. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6444.14s)]
*  We'd come down here and in, in, in high school and shit [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6447.94s)]
*  and go up and down six street. I will never forget this. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6452.42s)]
*  Every single guitar player and every little bar on six street, [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6457.42s)]
*  every single one of them was playing like Stevie Ray Vaughn. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6462.0199999999995s)]
*  Every single one of them. And there were 30 of them. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6465.86s)]
*  Like there were 30 different ones that coming in out of bars, [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6469.379999999999s)]
*  doing all the shit. It was, it was unbelievable. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6472.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah. There's always going to be someone like that. That like sets this standard. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6474.66s)]
*  Quit trying to be Hicks. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6477.5s)]
*  Yeah. Quit trying to be Hicks. But it was like, that was a, [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6478.62s)]
*  my daddy died for that flag. Oh, really? How about mine at Kmart? [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6481.46s)]
*  It's made in China. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6487.0199999999995s)]
*  But he could do it because he, because he was a Texan. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6488.46s)]
*  The vernacular is real. And then he'd turn around and, you know, [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6494.139999999999s)]
*  fuck up the other side. Yeah, no, it was genius. Well, when I, [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6498.139999999999s)]
*  when I first saw him, [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6502.0199999999995s)]
*  he went on in Boston and it was at Nick's comedy stop. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6502.94s)]
*  And the guy who went on before him was this, he was a nice guy, [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6506.099999999999s)]
*  but he was a hack. You know, he was just like cops and donuts, normal shit, [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6509.54s)]
*  stupid jokes, but the stupid jokes were working. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6513.179999999999s)]
*  It was cartoon characters smoking pot. You know, [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6515.78s)]
*  what would happen if Daffy Duck smoked a joint with Donald Duck? It was dumb, [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6517.9s)]
*  but it was watered down danger field, but it was getting people to laugh. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6522.7s)]
*  And then Hicks went on stage and like immediately started [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6526.3s)]
*  bombing, you know, [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6531.179999999999s)]
*  it immediately opened up with saying that he's tired of performing and [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6533.0199999999995s)]
*  tired of going up and telling people a bunch of shit you couldn't possibly think [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6537.82s)]
*  up on your own. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6542.66s)]
*  But the comics were dying and there was, [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6545.78s)]
*  there was like 300 people in the room by the time he was done performing. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6549.98s)]
*  There was 50, there's 50. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6553.62s)]
*  And there was maybe me and my friend Greg Fitzsimmons were in the back of the [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6555.82s)]
*  room, just dying laughing and maybe 10 comics. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6559.0199999999995s)]
*  We had all come to see Hicks because we had heard about him. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6561.62s)]
*  And then I saw him a month later at the comedy connection and he fucking murdered. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6564.38s)]
*  The comedy connection was this little tiny club. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6568.9s)]
*  It was like 150 seats, real low ceilings, Boston as well. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6571.0599999999995s)]
*  This is when I was first starting. So this is like 1988. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6575.06s)]
*  And it was before he had really popped. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6578.620000000001s)]
*  I had heard about him from the Rodney Dangerfield HBO special, you know, [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6580.06s)]
*  so the Rodney Dangerfield had these young comedian specials. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6584.02s)]
*  Rodney was the best at like introducing the world to talented comedians. [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6586.900000000001s)]
*  And he had these Rodney Dangerfield young comedian specials where he'd have on [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6591.580000000001s)]
*  like Robert Schimel and Lenny Clark and Andrew Dice Clay. [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6596.02s)]
*  And that's where Kinnison emerged and Hicks. Hicks was one of them too. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6600.38s)]
*  And I remember I'd seen Hicks on that. So I went to see him live. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6604.9s)]
*  And like I said, the first time he bombed, the second time he fucking murdered, [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6607.78s)]
*  it was Tiffany meeting Jimi Hendrix at the mall. He was doing this bit, [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6610.74s)]
*  bit about Jimi Hendrix, like Tiffany playing at the mall and Jimi Hendrix shows up. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6616.06s)]
*  And it was, it was just fucking just genius bit. It was so funny, man. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6620.42s)]
*  Is that something that's out there? Can you see that? [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6625.22s)]
*  I wonder, man, I wonder, cause I don't think he ever put that on anything. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6627.42s)]
*  It might be on an album somewhere, [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6630.54s)]
*  but it was back when there was all this like pop mall comedy or pop mall music [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6632.660000000001s)]
*  and he fucking hated it, you know, and it was, uh, [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6637.22s)]
*  and he was just rallying. There's a genre for you right there. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6640.34s)]
*  Rallying against corporatism. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6644.42s)]
*  It's going to make a comeback. That little sub genre. Yeah. I mean, [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6646.660000000001s)]
*  it would do something new with it. It kind of has. [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6650.06s)]
*  Austin has a great comedy scene right now. It really does. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6652.660000000001s)]
*  And it's really just emerged from the pandemic. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6655.900000000001s)]
*  Was that like the main thing that drew you here? [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6658.54s)]
*  Well, we all moved here to start it. We didn't even move here to start it. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6660.46s)]
*  We moved here to just keep doing what we were doing in LA, [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6663.78s)]
*  but LA had shut down and in 2020 we were all like, [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6666.900000000001s)]
*  we were all without a country, you know, [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6672.38s)]
*  we were living in LA and the comedy store was shut down for a fucking year and a [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6674.34s)]
*  half. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6677.9400000000005s)]
*  Y'all were wild, man. It was so, so shut down out there. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6678.26s)]
*  It was so shut down. And I knew I'm, I'm one of those dudes. It's just like, [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6681.22s)]
*  I've never had faith in systems and government. And I'm like, [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6685.66s)]
*  these motherfuckers are going to keep us shut down. They're going to keep, [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6689.34s)]
*  and I came to Texas and Ron White was already here. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6692.34s)]
*  So Ron White, who's a very good friend of mine and Gary, I knew, [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6694.9400000000005s)]
*  I knew Gary from LA. He used to hang out at the comedy store too. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6698.5s)]
*  And that's when I became friends with him and he moved here, [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6702.26s)]
*  I think 2017 or 2018. And I talked to him on the phone. Like, why, [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6704.78s)]
*  why'd you go back to Austin? He's like, man, [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6708.74s)]
*  I can't fuck with those people in LA. It's just like, I'm tired of it, man. [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6710.26s)]
*  He goes, I love Texas. I just, this is real. And it's like, [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6713.860000000001s)]
*  I need to go back home. And I was like, wow, that sounds right. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6717.0199999999995s)]
*  That sounds right. And then when I talked to Ron and Ron's the same way, [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6720.459999999999s)]
*  Ron's a Texas boy too. And he was like, I can't, [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6723.339999999999s)]
*  I just don't want to do this anymore. I'll stay here. It's great. He goes, [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6726.259999999999s)]
*  it's great. It's the middle of the country. I can fly anywhere. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6730.0199999999995s)]
*  Fucking food's good. People are nice. And so I knew when I came here, [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6733.259999999999s)]
*  I was like, at the very least Ron's here and Ron's a good friend. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6738.0199999999995s)]
*  And then when we came here, we could perform live. [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6742.86s)]
*  I first started doing shows outside. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6746.06s)]
*  Me and Dave Chappelle started doing shows at Stubbs and we were doing outside [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6747.54s)]
*  shows where we had to test the whole crowd. Everybody had to get tested. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6751.38s)]
*  So everybody had to show up like two hours in advance. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6754.46s)]
*  We tested everybody for COVID. They had to wear a mask outside. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6757.02s)]
*  It was so fucking stupid. The whole thing was so ridiculous, [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6759.86s)]
*  but we were hanging out in the back, getting drunk, smoking weed. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6762.14s)]
*  And it was like, it was like normal. It was like normal times. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6765.86s)]
*  And it was like this cultural thing. Like we were the only ones doing comedy. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6769.18s)]
*  And you know, everybody just started coming here, man. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6772.9s)]
*  They all just started coming here. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6775.22s)]
*  And then we started doing shows inside at the Vulcan, the Vulcan gas company, [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6776.5s)]
*  which is a music club that's on sixth street. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6780.820000000001s)]
*  So we started performing there. And you know, Nick, the guy who's the owner, [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6782.9800000000005s)]
*  is just a wild dude. He's like, fuck it. Let's just do shows. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6786.820000000001s)]
*  We started doing shows in November of 2020, [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6789.58s)]
*  and it just felt like we were baby killers. We were killing grandma. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6792.5s)]
*  You know, we were out there just spreading diseases. We were super spreaders. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6795.66s)]
*  If you spend enough time on sixth street anyway, it'll make you immune. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6799.06s)]
*  Yeah, we had developed some strong antibodies. [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6802.7s)]
*  I never got sick off of sixth street. I got sick in Florida. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6807.099999999999s)]
*  That's what I mean though. Sixth street will make you bulletproof. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6809.54s)]
*  That's what except the bullets. So yeah, except the bullets. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6811.74s)]
*  And there's a lot of that going on there too. [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6814.78s)]
*  So we we started doing shows there live and then comics started moving, man. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6816.54s)]
*  They started moving in droves. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6821.7s)]
*  They started all moving to Texas because they could do shows here. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6823.38s)]
*  We were just lost. I didn't know that without doing shows. [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6825.74s)]
*  We just all felt lost. [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6828.42s)]
*  And then by the time 2021 rolled around, [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6829.74s)]
*  there was like 15, 16 world class comics living in Austin. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6833.58s)]
*  And then I was like, fuck it. I'm buying a club. And Ron talked me into it. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6838.3s)]
*  He's like, you got to get a fucking club. We got to do this. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6841.38s)]
*  Because, you know, he knew I got a bunch of money from the Spotify deal. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6843.82s)]
*  So I was like, all right, let's fucking do it. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6846.66s)]
*  And so then in 2022 or three, I guess we opened up. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6848.54s)]
*  And it's just been gangbusters ever since. [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6853.54s)]
*  And now it's like this is the hub of comedy in the country, [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6856.0199999999995s)]

*  Well, I mean, I think I pulled it off, but I think it's. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6869.26s)]
*  But everybody pulled it off. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6871.9800000000005s)]
*  People are proud of the comedy, you know, history in this town. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6873.46s)]

*  You know, everybody likes to use that term inclusive and diversity. [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6882.9400000000005s)]
*  Well, our scene is diverse and inclusive, but everybody's great. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6886.66s)]
*  It's only diverse because they just happen to be. [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6890.58s)]
*  Everybody's fucking diverse. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6893.18s)]
*  The world, you know, you get artists, they're all different, weird people. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6894.9800000000005s)]
*  And what we didn't seek that out. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6899.06s)]
*  It was just what happened. [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6901.66s)]
*  It was just who's good, who's good, who's who's really all about this. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6904.14s)]
*  Who really wants to live this life, who really wants to just do comedy? [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6908.14s)]
*  And we set it up where we have two nights of open mic nights. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6911.58s)]
*  And, you know, we've got Kill Tony on Monday night. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6915.46s)]
*  So all the amateurs get a chance to be seen in front of the whole world [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6917.9s)]
*  and the biggest live comedy show in the world on YouTube. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6921.42s)]
*  And it just became this hub, man. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6924.26s)]
*  And now it's just fucking every night. It's sold out. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6926.1s)]
*  It's crazy. It's just it's a vibrant, wild scene. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6928.5s)]
*  And now on Sixth Street, there's five full time clubs [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6932.62s)]
*  within two blocks of my club comedy club comedy clubs. Oh, shit. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6936.9400000000005s)]

*  I mean, it's the best scene in the country. [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6943.46s)]
*  It's like there's never been a scene like this before that just emerged. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6944.94s)]
*  And in and it had all we had to hit every green light. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6948.86s)]
*  Like the comedy store had to be closed down. [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6951.5s)]
*  So I hired everybody that was working at the comedy store before we even had a club. [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6953.58s)]
*  I said, I'm going to pay you full time. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6957.94s)]

*  We'll call on you in like a year. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6964.66s)]
*  It's going to take a year to build this place. [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6966.259999999999s)]
*  But meanwhile, you'll get paid. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6968.179999999999s)]
*  You'll be able to just like live here, set, set your roots, [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6970.82s)]

*  Everybody fucking loved it. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6976.900000000001s)]
*  And then when we opened, we hit the ground running. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6978.620000000001s)]
*  We opened up one night. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6981.34s)]
*  We did a couple of test shows like let's try the venues, [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6982.620000000001s)]
*  make sure everything works good. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6985.620000000001s)]
*  And then we'll say, fuck it, let's stay open. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6987.26s)]
*  And we just stayed open before, you know, it was seven nights a week. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6989.02s)]
*  And then it was just it's been almost three years now. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6991.34s)]
*  You're going to keep it rolling. Fuck. Yeah. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6995.02s)]
*  Fuck. Yeah. We're talking about doing it in other places now. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6997.06s)]
*  It's cool. We just don't want to water it down. [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=6999.620000000001s)]
*  You know, we've talked about doing it in some other city [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7001.34s)]
*  and trying to figure out what the next one will be. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7003.3s)]
*  But it would have to be a city that has a real group of talent. [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7005.54s)]
*  You have to have talent like that's every comedy community. [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7008.54s)]
*  The only way it works is you have to have a lot of great comics [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7012.54s)]
*  that live in that town. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7015.1s)]
*  It's the only way it works. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7016.26s)]
*  And then we feed off of each other. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7017.66s)]
*  That's the only way. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7019.18s)]
*  There's no lone wolves in comedy. [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7020.22s)]
*  You know, comedy only it's only iron sharpens iron. [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7022.58s)]
*  You know, there's no like the best comic in the world living in Pittsburgh. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7026.74s)]
*  Doesn't exist like they all live where they all they're in, [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7030.42s)]
*  not in competition, but in cooperation with each other. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7034.62s)]
*  Like you're we're all inspired by each other. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7038.38s)]
*  You have to have that if you don't. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7040.22s)]
*  And so we had to have like every green light. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7041.9800000000005s)]
*  The comedy show had to be comedy story had to be shut down for a solid year [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7044.22s)]
*  and a half. All those people had to be unemployed. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7047.26s)]
*  I had to have all this money from Spotify. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7049.02s)]
*  I had to be in a place like Texas that allows you to open up [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7051.18s)]
*  and have a show indoors when everything in California was closed. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7054.78s)]
*  They wouldn't even let you do outdoor shows. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7058.22s)]
*  We weren't even allowed to do show. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7060.3s)]
*  We try to do shows in the parking lot, the comedy store, and they wouldn't allow us. [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7061.820000000001s)]
*  It was crazy. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7065.3s)]
*  No, I remember how I remember how shut down it was. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7066.14s)]
*  70% of all the restaurants went under. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7068.860000000001s)]
*  I mean, it was fucking madness. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7070.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's crazy. Yeah. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7072.34s)]

*  You know, I I'd got I'd gotten rid of a management relationship [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7162.54s)]
*  that was going nowhere. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7167.62s)]
*  And I wrote Welcome to Hard Times just kind of out of my own personal. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7170.42s)]
*  Kind of dark feelings about where I was going through and [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7175.780000000001s)]
*  just the whole like rigged. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7180.5s)]
*  Casino, you know, America is a casino, you know, [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7183.5s)]
*  and I have thought that since I was a kid because I kind of lived in them. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7187.02s)]
*  You know, you talk about being poor. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7189.74s)]
*  And then the wreck, I cut the record in Georgia, [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7193.22s)]
*  South Georgia was with Mark Neal, right? [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7196.62s)]
*  Like the whole thing, I cut it like I wrote the record in November, [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7200.0199999999995s)]
*  cut it in December, got the Masters back. [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7203.34s)]
*  And like a week or two later, I remember me and Taylor Grace, my wife, [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7207.7s)]
*  we were dating and we were at a diner in Cloudcroft, New Mexico. [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7212.46s)]
*  And my manager at the time called me and said that South by Southwest was canceled. [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7218.38s)]
*  And that for us here at that time, [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7222.86s)]
*  that's when we knew this shit was real. [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7225.9s)]
*  Nothing could stop that machine that was South by Southwest at the time. [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7227.98s)]
*  And strangely for me, I'm not. [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7232.58s)]
*  I knew a lot of people that have known a lot of people that have [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7236.3s)]
*  passed away or anything. [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7239.82s)]
*  So I'm not saying that all the stuff that happened is a good thing at all. [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7240.9s)]
*  But for me, my career trajectory totally changed early on the pandemic [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7244.42s)]
*  because no one was putting out records. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7250.62s)]
*  The whole no one had any interest in putting out records. [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7254.14s)]
*  And for that reason, David Macias, because I was riding his ass, [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7259.26s)]
*  actually, thanks to John Folk at the time, he's like, don't let him show of your record. [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7263.7s)]
*  Put that record out right now. [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7267.7s)]
*  You know, we're talking about, you know, July 20, 20. [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7269.18s)]
*  You know, and I demanded more money. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7273.0199999999995s)]
*  No one no one had ever put a dollar in the market in my records. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7277.18s)]
*  I'm talking about nothing. [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7279.94s)]
*  Before the shit hit the fan. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7281.14s)]
*  These guys were talking about spending like 10, 15 grand total [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7284.820000000001s)]
*  marketing Welcome to Hard Times. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7289.5s)]
*  Total. I mean, shit, I spent [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7291.5s)]
*  twice that or more making it. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7294.5s)]
*  And that's still a cheap record. [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7296.22s)]
*  But I mean, I remember a publicist told me once like you should spend [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7297.54s)]
*  at least double the money marketing your record that it cost you to make it [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7301.860000000001s)]
*  and at least match it. [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7306.14s)]
*  You know, and here I was like, that's what I mean. [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7307.62s)]
*  I was like caught on this like broke dick Americana scene, [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7309.42s)]
*  you know, on these two year record cycles, you know, with no money. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7312.42s)]
*  You know, I was on a I was in a broke dick deal just like Waylon was talking about. [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7316.74s)]
*  You know, just and I don't I'm not I'm not bagging on Americana or anything. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7320.9400000000005s)]
*  You know, I mean, I'm I'm glad I showed up on the map somewhere. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7325.14s)]
*  But we went ahead and put it out in July of 2020. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7329.1s)]
*  And I had been wanting to buy billboards and it just so happened, [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7333.14s)]
*  especially in California, but even in New York. [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7336.9800000000005s)]
*  I mean, everything was shut down. [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7339.02s)]
*  I mean, totally shut down. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7340.540000000001s)]
*  So I remember we bought a billboard in Silver Lake [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7342.38s)]
*  and in Times Square, right, static, traditional static billboards [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7346.22s)]
*  for like 80 percent off because nobody was buying shit, [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7350.9400000000005s)]
*  not a single other billboard over the course of like a nine months or a year. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7354.46s)]
*  And those neighborhoods changed. [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7359.1s)]
*  Right. And I bought a one all those billboards. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7360.9400000000005s)]
*  I bought like one month billboards. [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7363.34s)]
*  And some of those motherfuckers stayed up over six months. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7365.1s)]
*  You know what I mean? I like 75 percent off, you know, and. [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7367.860000000001s)]
*  You know, sometimes you write a song. [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7372.38s)]
*  That get lucky. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7376.54s)]
*  I was writing about personal experience and it spoke for me. [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7378.58s)]
*  It wasn't a big record, but it changed my trajectory [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7383.46s)]
*  because welcome to hard times, the song. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7387.860000000001s)]
*  Really spoke to what was happening in America. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7391.66s)]
*  Yeah. And that's what that's when my train really started rolling. [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7395.06s)]
*  That's when it really started rolling. [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7399.1s)]
*  You know what I mean? It's like. [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7400.900000000001s)]
*  And then I did all those records and welcome to hard times. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7402.860000000001s)]
*  Music City, USA, coming like kind of right for the right for the Nashville machine. [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7405.820000000001s)]
*  And then the man from Waco that I made down in Lockhart with Bruce Robinson, [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7411.540000000001s)]
*  which was like the first time really that I'd made a studio record [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7415.660000000001s)]
*  with my guys, you know, with more money. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7419.9400000000005s)]
*  And Bruce Robinson, a songwriting friend that was not stopping me from being me, [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7423.780000000001s)]
*  you know, and and and then that one was my first one to hit the like Billboard 200. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7428.780000000001s)]
*  And then Ten Dollar Cowboy really took off another big step from there. [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7435.58s)]
*  And then I got hooked back up with Shooter. [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7440.780000000001s)]
*  See, I used to open up for Shooter because Shooter was getting booked by John Folk, too. [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7442.7s)]
*  Right. And the two guys that took a liking to me early on, [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7446.46s)]
*  like pretty much nobody else did, was Evan Felker and Turnpike Tributeurs [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7449.9s)]
*  and Shooter Jennings. [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7453.9s)]
*  You know, Shooter would take me out and like he didn't have to be cool to me. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7455.5s)]
*  I mean, he's fucking Waylon's son. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7459.099999999999s)]
*  But he was always so cool. He's just cool and so thoughtful. [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7460.66s)]
*  You know, he's a great guy. [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7463.86s)]
*  And he would give me little things to live by, like when he saw how hard [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7465.179999999999s)]
*  I was working out there, he's like, it says you can't park behind the Nashville [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7468.179999999999s)]
*  Palace, but between me and you fucking camp there and nobody's going to say shit. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7471.339999999999s)]
*  And I lived in that fucking parking lot. [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7475.86s)]
*  That's the kind of shit you get by on. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7477.98s)]
*  You know what I mean? And we I've got this movie that I funded. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7479.7s)]
*  You know how slow the movie business is that I was going to be called $10 Cowboy. [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7484.58s)]
*  And I made it's this thing I put together. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7488.74s)]
*  Like finish my touring season at the rodeo finals in Vegas. [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7492.0599999999995s)]
*  And then I get back to Texas and all the pressure of the business is mounting on me. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7496.54s)]
*  And I'm just trying to get away from my manager and the machine [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7501.5s)]
*  and my phone and all that shit. [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7504.98s)]
*  And I decided to leave the phone at the house. [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7506.9s)]
*  And I had heard from a journalist about this [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7509.7s)]
*  secret shrine in a liquor store [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7512.9s)]
*  dedicated to Waylon Jennings in his hometown, a little field, Texas, there on 84. [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7516.22s)]
*  I'd known about it, but we in the movie, I'm playing [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7520.38s)]
*  like I've never heard of it. [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7524.0599999999995s)]
*  And I'm going on this pilgrimage, you know, to to find out if this [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7525.099999999999s)]
*  little museum really exists, which it does. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7529.179999999999s)]
*  It's run by his youngest brother, James D. [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7531.46s)]
*  Waylon's youngest brother. [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7533.74s)]
*  And so to get the movie going, I needed to get on the phone with shooter, [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7535.42s)]
*  you know, to get hooked up with James D. [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7538.98s)]
*  and them. And we got the idea to get his mama, Jesse Coulter, involved [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7540.66s)]
*  and all that. And I was and I wanted to use some of Waylon's music for the film. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7544.58s)]
*  And I was scared to death to ask for it. [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7547.94s)]
*  But but Shooter had always been good to me. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7551.82s)]
*  And so we ended up having the conversation. [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7553.86s)]
*  We caught up on a lot of stuff because, see, I'd been hearing that he was producing, [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7557.0199999999995s)]
*  right, but I couldn't make heads or tails of it where he was going with it. [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7560.58s)]
*  And truthfully, I was like avoiding producers all together [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7564.139999999999s)]
*  because a lot of these guys, it's like, you know, they're such they're such big names. [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7567.54s)]
*  It overshadows the artist. [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7572.42s)]
*  You know what I mean? And then they have the deal. [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7574.86s)]
*  Like they have the artist deal. Right. [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7577.06s)]
*  Then the artist just kind of in a lot of ways gets [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7579.5s)]
*  limited to like acting talent, you know, showing up at the fucking, [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7583.42s)]
*  you know, movie lot or whatever. Yeah. And [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7588.34s)]
*  and but I kept hearing records that he was making by people I knew. [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7592.86s)]
*  Like Jamie Wyatt. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7597.58s)]
*  I said, man, it's the best thing she's ever done. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7598.9s)]
*  Shooter Jennings, Vince and Neil Emerson. [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7600.86s)]
*  This is the best thing he's ever done. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7603.06s)]
*  Shooter Jennings, like over and over. [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7604.62s)]
*  And I had been noticing that. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7607.38s)]
*  And so we're on the phone and he's all about the movie. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7608.74s)]
*  Yeah, I'm going to help you license the songs. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7611.86s)]

*  He just was helpful with everything. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7620.74s)]
*  And I had almost made a record at Sunset [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7622.82s)]
*  Sound there in old downtown Hollywood, the old Sunset Sound Studio. [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7627.18s)]
*  I'd wanted to go in there because Mark Neil had told me about it. [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7631.22s)]
*  And I was tired of making records in Georgia [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7634.860000000001s)]
*  and didn't want to go over to the wrong side of Mississippi. [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7637.42s)]
*  I wanted to make a record in California. [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7640.700000000001s)]
*  And I told Shooter in passing on the phone that it had fallen through. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7643.46s)]
*  And, you know, did he know Sunset Sound? [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7647.06s)]

*  Wow. Just in passing, you know. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7654.62s)]
*  And I'm like, man, well, then let's make a record. [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7657.18s)]
*  And we're right in the middle of a trilogy now. [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7660.18s)]

*  which I think is a lucky number. [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7669.3s)]
*  And then I've got a third one coming after that that we're calling the Sage [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7670.9800000000005s)]
*  Brush Trilogy. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7673.780000000001s)]
*  And Shooter is the first guy I've ever been in a studio with [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7675.06s)]
*  where I truly don't feel judged. [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7678.62s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7680.9800000000005s)]

*  He said in regards to some other situation he was in, he was like, [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7711.74s)]
*  he said, I went from one shadow to another. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7715.7s)]
*  Just a beautiful line. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7719.58s)]
*  I think he was talking about like an old relationship he was in or something. [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7720.54s)]
*  But but like he's overcome that because, you know what I mean? [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7723.14s)]
*  Like he stepped into like if you listen to his records, you know, [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7727.62s)]
*  when he's starting out and you compare it to the field, [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7733.26s)]
*  you know, in country music and Nashville at the time, like he's totally [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7736.26s)]

*  He's totally going against the grain. Nobody's sounding like that. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7744.0599999999995s)]
*  They're not sounding traditional and pushing the boundaries like he just was, [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7747.94s)]
*  you know, and I can tell you, constitutionally, he's just like his daddy. [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7751.94s)]

*  It's either it's a love hate thing. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7804.5s)]
*  And I've done a lot of styles, you know, and they've called me [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7807.82s)]
*  a stylistic chameleon here in Austin, even the first time they put me [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7810.54s)]
*  on the Chronicle, you know, they call me a stylistic chameleon. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7815.42s)]
*  And I had a hard time with that, you know, because I didn't [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7818.18s)]

*  matter of fact. Right. [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7836.58s)]
*  It's surprising to me that people would question my authenticity [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7839.14s)]
*  and point to me playing in subway cars [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7842.7s)]

*  seems to somehow or another be a real thing. [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7882.74s)]
*  And sometimes the way things synchronize and the way things line up, [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7886.820000000001s)]
*  you're like, man, this seems like it's meant to be. [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7890.740000000001s)]
*  There's certain things that just seem like they're meant to be. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7894.34s)]
*  And I feel like if you're on the right frequency [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7897.46s)]

*  Yeah. You know, like Waylon, like shooter [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7960.38s)]
*  and like the Waylon Jennings thing for me, you know, is like, you know, [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7965.38s)]
*  I was out there, you know, we were I did my [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7969.3s)]
*  I debuted at the Houston Rodeo back in the spring. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7972.82s)]
*  And for me, that was like my career goal, you know, because of Selena [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7975.62s)]
*  and and George Strait and. [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7979.82s)]

*  Houston Rodeo, that's the top culturally, I think, as like a stage [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7989.3s)]
*  for an artist to perform, I think is the Houston Rodeo, you know, [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7994.14s)]
*  and it was the Astrodome and not the NRG Stadium. [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7997.14s)]
*  And I would have never known that. [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=7999.74s)]
*  It's the it's the truth. [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8001.5s)]
*  And it does it crosses, you know, everything economic, racial, everything. [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8002.82s)]
*  It's it's the Houston Rodeo, you know, and it's the biggest rodeo on on Earth, [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8007.66s)]
*  you know, which is why you got everybody from, like I said, [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8012.54s)]
*  you know, Waylon Jennings, Merle, George Strait. [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8016.94s)]
*  Nowadays, you got Post Malone and Beyonce both playing it. Wow. [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8019.82s)]
*  I mean, it doesn't it doesn't matter who it is. [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8024.02s)]
*  Like, that's the that's the platform. [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8026.58s)]
*  Anyway, I played there and we were mixed. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8028.34s)]
*  We're putting a live record out on it and me and Shooter were mixing it there [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8031.38s)]
*  at Sunset Sound. [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8034.3s)]
*  And then I stayed the extra night because he had the party at the Viper [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8035.78s)]
*  Room for the announcement of these three unreleased Waylon Jennings records. [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8038.66s)]
*  And they're legit unreleased. It's not AI bullshit. [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8042.900000000001s)]
*  It's not remixes. [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8045.900000000001s)]
*  This is truly legitimately unreleased music by arguably, [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8047.5s)]
*  you know, the king, certainly the king of all the outlaws. [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8054.22s)]
*  Yeah. But in my opinion, when it comes to like Nashville country music, [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8057.34s)]
*  whatever you want to call it, man, like [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8061.860000000001s)]
*  a buddy of mine, John Spong, a journalist here in town, the Texan, [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8064.820000000001s)]
*  he was we were at the sagebrush doing an interview a couple of years back. [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8070.14s)]
*  And he was saying that like. [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8074.9800000000005s)]
*  If Willie Nelson to country music is like Che Guevara, right? [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8077.780000000001s)]
*  Waylon Jennings was the long haired prince of darkness, right? [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8082.3s)]
*  And like he's the guy that. [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8086.58s)]
*  Like he's from West Texas, right? [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8089.9400000000005s)]
*  The guy learned he he learned how to play bass on stage. [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8091.9400000000005s)]
*  He learned how to play bass on fucking stage, backing up Buddy Holly, right? [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8096.860000000001s)]
*  Who at the time was bigger than Elvis, man. [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8102.5s)]
*  You know, I mean, that style of rock and roll, right? [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8106.02s)]
*  It's coming from everywhere. [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8109.900000000001s)]
*  I mean, nobody's just making their nowadays. [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8111.14s)]
*  They're kind of strangely making music in a vacuum in a bedroom. [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8114.18s)]
*  But like in some ways, right. [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8117.54s)]
*  But these guys, it's like whether it's Robert Johnson or BB King [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8119.3s)]
*  in the Delta or whatever, or Buddy Holly out in West Texas, [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8122.62s)]
*  you're influenced by the radio and all that. [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8126.02s)]
*  But there's something to be said for like what's out. [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8128.06s)]
*  How hard that earth is out there in West Texas. [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8131.42s)]
*  And like people talk a lot of shit about Lubbock, right? [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8134.22s)]
*  Smells like shit because cows everywhere. [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8136.780000000001s)]
*  So fucking flat, you know, the thing you can stand on a fucking tin can and like, [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8138.900000000001s)]
*  you know, see a hundred miles or whatever they say out there, right? [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8143.179999999999s)]
*  But like the best people to play a show for probably anywhere in America [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8147.379999999999s)]
*  in many ways, in my opinion, is like a show and love it. [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8151.86s)]
*  Like there's something about the people in that town where it's like [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8155.419999999999s)]
*  it's just the best place to play. [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8158.58s)]
*  And then like Willie Nelson is now in the rock and roll hall of fame. [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8159.98s)]
*  And he deserves it. Dolly Parton now, too. [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8163.379999999999s)]
*  But Waylon Jennings was always rock and roll. [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8166.219999999999s)]
*  Like he was never traditional country. [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8169.139999999999s)]
*  There's nothing about him. [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8171.3s)]
*  If you know what you're listening to, even on his very first record, [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8172.9800000000005s)]
*  like country folk folk country, right? [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8176.3s)]
*  There's nothing straight ahead. [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8178.9800000000005s)]
*  Listen to anything coming out of Nashville in like 1965. [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8180.26s)]
*  Anything next to Waylon Jennings. [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8185.02s)]
*  He's the long haired prince of darkness. [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8187.18s)]
*  You know, he is like he is going to be there. [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8189.18s)]
*  They're undoing of the because what they did is they built a [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8193.26s)]
*  they built a wall around Nashville because the coast had all the money [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8196.58s)]
*  and all the zeitgeist power. [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8200.58s)]
*  And in response, Nashville walled themselves off. [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8202.46s)]
*  Right. You know what I mean? [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8206.62s)]
*  That's really what they did. [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8207.94s)]
*  And then Waylon Waylon busted through. [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8209.46s)]
*  And I know I'm going back on that a lot, but like my path [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8213.3s)]
*  that led to making records with Shooter was that when I started figuring out, [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8216.66s)]
*  like the map is when I like cracked the code [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8221.94s)]
*  and realized why what Waylon was doing musically, like I just I finally [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8226.539999999999s)]
*  fell in love with him musically. [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8230.54s)]
*  And it was on this specific record from 1968 called Hanging On. [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8232.980000000001s)]
*  Right. And like every swing and dick in this business [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8236.94s)]
*  that I ever knew coming up in Texas, that I didn't do a Texas songwriter [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8240.660000000002s)]
*  or country, every one of them wanted to be Waylon Jennings, [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8244.460000000001s)]
*  Willie Nelson, Towns Van Zandt and Billy Joe Shaver. [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8247.900000000001s)]
*  Every single one. [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8251.820000000002s)]
*  And I naturally stepped wide of that [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8254.140000000001s)]
*  because everybody I knew was trying to do it. [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8257.300000000001s)]
*  And like imitating an artist, [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8260.1s)]
*  like for the advanced part of their movement on in and of itself, [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8263.5s)]
*  that's worthless. [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8268.060000000001s)]
*  It's it's not that it's worthless, it's that. [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8269.5s)]
*  You will never touch it if you don't go walk your own path. [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8272.820000000002s)]
*  So a lot of guys I knew when I started playing all the shows with Willie, [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8277.54s)]
*  Willie called me up and got me on with his agent and shit [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8280.1s)]
*  and put me on like 50 shows. [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8283.34s)]
*  And a lot of guys I knew were like looking at me like, man, [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8284.980000000001s)]
*  why are you going to play with Willie? [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8288.34s)]
*  You know, and at first I didn't even I didn't know. [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8290.14s)]
*  Right. Because I was realizing guys that I knew, like they knew Willie Nelson [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8293.14s)]
*  shit in and out. [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8297.380000000001s)]
*  We're literally trying to sing like him. [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8298.460000000001s)]
*  So like, fuck you, I should have that spot. [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8300.22s)]
*  And like, you know, I'm nobody at the end of the day. Right. [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8303.06s)]
*  I'm the best at being me. Right. [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8306.7s)]
*  You know, when sometimes, right. [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8309.34s)]
*  But like how I think I've landed with Shooter [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8312.58s)]
*  and his family and and playing all those shows with Willie [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8316.38s)]
*  and getting married on his ranch and all that stuff is because [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8320.619999999999s)]
*  not because I worship Willie Nelson, [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8324.82s)]
*  but because I think Willie looked at me and was like, [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8327.34s)]
*  I like I like what you're doing. [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8331.26s)]
*  I like how you got where you're at. [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8332.9s)]
*  You play with me. [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8335.18s)]
*  You know, you don't ask to take your picture with Willie. [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8336.5s)]
*  He fucking lets you know when you're going to take your picture with him. [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8338.619999999999s)]
*  You know, it's time to get your picture taken with Willie. [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8342.460000000001s)]
*  That's how that's how they did it. Wow. [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8347.78s)]
*  And we're standing there's like a hundred nitrous cans behind us and shit. [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8349.7s)]
*  It was like the greatest photo of my life. [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8353.78s)]
*  You know, yeah, it's a natural inclination that people have [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8358.5s)]
*  when they want to be authentic, to imitate authenticity. [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8361.980000000001s)]
*  That's the thing is, you got to find your own path. [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8366.34s)]
*  You got to you got to you have to put [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8369.1s)]
*  you have to put yourself out there, you know, like when I was playing [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8373.14s)]
*  on the street, people knew I was different and. [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8376.86s)]
*  Artists, the hipsters, like in the Brooklyn scene and in Bushwick and [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8380.38s)]
*  Williamsburg and. [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8385.18s)]
*  All over the boroughs and shit, like to be on the street playing, [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8387.94s)]
*  like there's credibility to that, right. [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8391.22s)]
*  But in like, I didn't want to play in subway cars. [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8394.14s)]
*  Actually, what it was is young rapper Jaydon, Jaydon Woodward is his name. [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8397.58s)]
*  And he kept seeing me at the. [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8403.54s)]
*  Metropolitan Avenue stop playing there at the platform, you know, for the [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8408.86s)]
*  for the cars coming by on the train or whatever. [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8412.82s)]
*  G train down there on Metropolitan G train sucks to ride on. [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8415.62s)]
*  It's great for subway performers because there's like [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8419.02s)]

*  For anybody [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8825.380000000001s)]
*  For anybody [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8826.26s)]
*  Yeah [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8826.98s)]
*  Yeah, it's just undeniable [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8827.22s)]
*  It's the most authentic form of performance ever [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8829.859999999999s)]
*  You know, that's not your audience, they don't know you [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8833.38s)]
*  You have to earn it [[02:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8836.74s)]
*  You have to, you have to break through [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8837.859999999999s)]
*  Yep [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8840.179999999998s)]
*  You have to break through it, it has to hit [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8840.74s)]
*  Yeah [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8843.46s)]
*  It has to be real [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8843.699999999999s)]
*  That's all I've been doing is swinging around the whole time, Joe [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8844.74s)]
*  Yeah, man, well you're killing it [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8846.98s)]
*  They used to call, sometimes they call me the Muhammad Ali of country music [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8848.34s)]
*  That's too good a compliment, but I like it [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8852.9s)]
*  But this, you know, that's the only way you make Charlie Crockett [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8855.939999999999s)]
*  You gotta, I mean, your story is important for people to hear [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8860.26s)]
*  Because it's the only way you make someone like you [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8865.06s)]
*  You know, you don't make someone like you in a mall [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8867.3s)]
*  You don't make someone like you with a bunch of executives [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8869.22s)]
*  Making these decisions based on what they think is going to be popular [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8872.66s)]
*  Man, it was crazy, they were doing that shit you'd think they would do [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8876.82s)]
*  So this woman, Nell Moldary, saw us in the R train [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8879.699999999999s)]
*  And she was in the Sony system and managing artists and like [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8883.86s)]
*  Kind of the star maker, that pop machine of like 2010, 2011 [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8888.26s)]
*  So they bring us up into the offices in Koreatown, right? [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8893.7s)]
*  And like on the edge of Hell's Kitchen there [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8898.1s)]
*  And her office was off the side of this Sony Legacy, like kind of catalog room [[02:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8900.58s)]
*  Because of the time she was married to Rob Santos, one of the guys at Sony Legacy [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8906.980000000001s)]
*  And she had this little office off the side of the library thing, whatever [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8911.939999999999s)]
*  And she brings us in there [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8916.099999999999s)]
*  And they're putting us in front of these computer screens [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8918.82s)]
*  And showing us like gym class heroes and the gorillas and Odd Future and Janelle Monae [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8923.46s)]
*  And like doing these focus group training things [[02:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8929.779999999999s)]
*  And where they're going to plug you in to the thing [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8935.699999999999s)]
*  And it was like what was so difficult about it for me [[02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8938.58s)]
*  I'm not, they didn't do anything wrong, you know [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8941.7s)]
*  We were young desperate men playing in public transit [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8944.1s)]
*  Be careful what you ask for, you know [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8949.46s)]
*  And I was mad for a long time but I've been eating off that plate forever [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8950.9s)]
*  Because I realized, man, I was like, man, if you don't know what you want [[02:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8954.58s)]
*  If you don't know where you're going [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8958.66s)]
*  If you don't know what you're selling, they're going to sell it for you [[02:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8960.18s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8964.18s)]
*  It doesn't matter who it is [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8965.14s)]
*  Yeah, it's not their fault, that's what they do [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8966.1s)]
*  That was the best thing that could have happened to me [[02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8969.14s)]
*  It's because like I believed that there was some deal [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8970.9s)]
*  I wasn't on the trains for it but I knew we'd find it [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8975.06s)]
*  I really did, it was fate [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8977.94s)]
*  It was fate and like, you know, it's that whole thing [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8980.9s)]
*  Like I got there, it fell apart quick, it wrecked me, man [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8984.02s)]
*  And that's when I got to the street [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8987.62s)]
*  And I went back to California, started working on the ganja farms [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8989.46s)]
*  Because I realized, you know, like Big L said or whatever [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8992.82s)]
*  I was going to get street struck [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8995.62s)]
*  You can't stay out there forever, you really can't [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=8997.38s)]
*  And that's when I looked at it and it's like, man, okay [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9000.26s)]
*  What am I willing to sell? [[02:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9011.779999999999s)]
*  What is Charlie Crockett willing to sell? [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9016.58s)]
*  And I think that that's stronger than playing it cool [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9019.939999999999s)]
*  Right? And letting somebody else figure it out for you [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9025.46s)]
*  You know, that's where it gets dangerous [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9028.82s)]
*  And so it's like, I know a lot of these guys in the business [[02:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9033.7s)]
*  They're like, oh man, you know, I don't pay attention to the business [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9035.86s)]
*  Shit and all that type of stuff [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9038.1s)]
*  And you're crazy for that [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9038.9s)]
*  Because I don't care if it was Willie Nelson or James Brown [[02:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9040.18s)]
*  They were poorer than you, they both picked cotton [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9043.3s)]
*  And they learned the business because they had to [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9045.78s)]
*  So someone gave me that bullshit [[02:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9048.34s)]
*  We need to understand the business if you're in the business [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9050.02s)]
*  If you don't understand it, you'll be taken over by it [[02:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9053.619999999999s)]
*  There's no doubt, even if they got you on top [[02:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9055.859999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and then you have to have autonomy [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9058.02s)]
*  You have to have this personal sense of self [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9059.939999999999s)]
*  Or you could avoid the influence [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9063.619999999999s)]
*  You have to be able to just stick to your guns [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9066.26s)]
*  And that's the hard part, right? [[02:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9069.3s)]
*  Because then they dangle that carrot in front of you [[02:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9070.98s)]
*  That carrot is juicy [[02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9073.939999999999s)]
*  Especially if you've been out in the street [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9075.779999999999s)]
*  It's right there [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9077.46s)]
*  Oh, it's right there [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9078.34s)]
*  It's right there, it's so juicy [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9079.46s)]
*  And a lot of people bite it [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9083.539999999999s)]
*  A lot of people bite it [[02:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9086.42s)]
*  And then they don't want it anymore [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9087.3s)]
*  And then they don't know how to be authentic [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9088.58s)]
*  Were you dealing with the, like on that circuit? [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9091.3s)]
*  Because I mean, I know you're a comedian [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9094.26s)]
*  And I know you also like got into the like dealing with the network [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9096.26s)]
*  TV shows and all that kind of stuff [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9099.779999999999s)]
*  Like did anybody ever fucking get you pretty good? [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9101.859999999999s)]
*  Well, I got lucky in that I got on television so early [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9104.9s)]
*  And I didn't want to be on television [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9109.939999999999s)]
*  It wasn't something that I wanted [[02:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9112.5s)]
*  But they offered me so much money to be on TV [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9115.06s)]
*  I was like, what? [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9117.14s)]
*  Okay, but I kept growing and doing my comedy at the comedy store [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9118.42s)]
*  And that was the most important thing that I just kept doing comedy [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9123.86s)]
*  And then the money was just like, fuck you money [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9126.9s)]
*  So it's like because I had the fuck you money [[02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9129.38s)]
*  I could kind of be myself [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9131.78s)]
*  And there was a lot of temptation [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9133.78s)]
*  Like I remember the producers of Fear of Hector like, what are you doing? [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9135.78s)]
*  Like because some of my comedy was just out there [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9138.42s)]
*  This gets you in trouble [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9140.98s)]
*  This is not network television comedy [[02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9143.14s)]
*  I was like, well then I won't do network television anymore [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9144.98s)]
*  Like once I had a certain amount in the bank [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9148.18s)]
*  I was like, all right, this is more money than I ever thought [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9150.26s)]
*  I'd ever have in my whole fucking life [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9152.66s)]
*  And never thought I'd ever be wealthy [[02:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9154.26s)]
*  And then all of a sudden I have money [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9156.5s)]
*  So if you have fuck you money and you don't say fuck you [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9158.18s)]
*  What's the point? [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9161.22s)]
*  No one's going to say fuck you then [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9163.38s)]
*  If you're going to be a prisoner to that money [[02:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9164.74s)]
*  Like everybody says, man, have I had all that money? [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9167.7s)]
*  Just afraid to be you [[02:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9170.66s)]
*  Afraid to be yourself [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9172.02s)]
*  That's the only time you can really do it [[02:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9173.380000000001s)]
*  Is when you have, you know, it's like the universe gives you this gift [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9175.7s)]
*  And the gift is the gift of freedom [[02:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9179.94s)]
*  And you have to choose to either accept it and take it and run with it [[02:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9182.18s)]
*  Or be captured by it [[02:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9186.34s)]
*  And then want more and more and more forever [[02:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9188.66s)]
*  Forever and there's no end [[02:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9191.78s)]
*  We were talking about my friend Brian has this friend [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9193.94s)]
*  Who's worth three billion dollars [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9196.02s)]
*  And he feels poor because his friend's worth 80 [[02:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9197.62s)]

*  And I just liked it actually I just I thought it was native [[02:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9420.900000000001s)]
*  Right I didn't realize it was like Egyptian and I've always liked this one [[02:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9424.1s)]
*  Because it felt like it was a little bit of both [[02:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9427.62s)]
*  And I I didn't know anything about it at first [[02:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9430.26s)]
*  But the reason I never take it off anymore is like when I started reading about [[02:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9434.1s)]
*  Like what it meant to the Egyptians was that it meant like safe passage [[02:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9438.1s)]
*  As you journey through this world and get ready to go on to the next one [[02:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9445.46s)]
*  You know what I mean and protect you against evil [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9452.58s)]

*  They call that initiation so it makes a lot of people tie it to stupid shit [[02:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9462.66s)]
*  Like a you know Illuminati and all that kind of stuff [[02:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9467.38s)]
*  But I mean it's just a it's just a thunderbird [[02:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9469.86s)]
*  Well you know the eye of Horus is essentially the pineal gland [[02:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9472.9s)]
*  Where the seat of the soul where the brain produces dimethyltryptamine [[02:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9477.539999999999s)]
*  That's the eye of Horus [[02:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9482.26s)]
*  Have you ever seen the image of the eye of Horus next to the pineal gland? [[02:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9483.3s)]
*  I'm not sure maybe I have but I'm I'm ignorant I didn't [[02:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9488.1s)]
*  The ancient Egyptian [[02:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9490.9s)]
*  What's pineal gland? [[02:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9491.859999999999s)]
*  The pineal gland is a it's a gland that's in the center of your brain [[02:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9492.82s)]
*  It's essentially the third eye in reptiles it actually has a retina in the lens [[02:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9497.14s)]
*  Wow [[02:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9501.46s)]
*  Or a cornea in the lens and it's it's where the now they believe that DMT [[02:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9501.94s)]
*  Is actually produced by the entire brain it's also produced by the liver and the lungs [[02:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9507.62s)]
*  But it's like the most spiritual of all the psychedelics [[02:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9511.060000000001s)]
*  And they believe that the Egyptians had some sort of they you know there's so little understood [[02:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9513.94s)]
*  About truly ancient Egypt but look at that look what it looks like [[02:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9520.5s)]
*  I mean the the eye of Horus essentially is it's a diagram of the pineal gland [[02:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9524.58s)]
*  Which is kind of crazy it's kind of crazy when you see it that way [[02:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9534.34s)]
*  Wow [[02:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9538.74s)]
*  Because they they knew things and we don't know what they knew [[02:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9539.140000000001s)]
*  We don't understand how they built the pyramids we don't understand how old they are [[02:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9542.1s)]
*  There's so much speculation about the true age of that civilization [[02:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9545.7s)]
*  Figuring out like how they harness the energy and all that stuff [[02:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9549.300000000001s)]
*  I mean there's this group of scientists that believe that there's structures under the pyramids [[02:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9553.14s)]
*  That go two kilometers deep into the earth right and and there's a lot of controversy about that [[02:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9557.460000000001s)]
*  But these guys are they've multiple readings of these things and they're pretty sure that they're [[02:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9562.42s)]
*  Accurate and they've been accurate with other things like other temples that are underground [[02:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9567.22s)]
*  That are 50 feet underground they've mapped those things out with the same technology [[02:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9572.42s)]
*  So there's a precedent to it these people knew things and we don't understand how they knew it [[02:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9576.34s)]
*  Or what they knew and we don't know if the people that lived in ancient egypt that we considered [[02:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9581.14s)]
*  Ancient egypt like you know 2000 bc we don't know if they found those structures or if those people [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9585.539999999999s)]
*  Built those structures there's so much weirdness with egypt because the construction is so beyond [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9591.539999999999s)]
*  Anything else that exists anywhere on earth and especially when you're dealing with 4,500 plus [[02:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9598.9s)]
*  Years ago 4,500 years ago is the conventional estimations but there's a lot of these heretic [[02:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9605.38s)]
*  Archaeologists that think no it's this is a lot older than that I mean there's a king's list that [[02:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9612.74s)]
*  Goes back 30,000 plus years 30,000 years yeah I mean this it sounds nuts to people that want to [[02:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9617.539999999999s)]
*  Have this conventional dating of the you know the dawn of civilization being about 6,000 years ago but [[02:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9625.14s)]
*  There's a lot of evidence that that's not accurate there's a lot and I think the most profound [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9631.46s)]

*  For science but in the end of the day you know no matter what we think we know it's still just like [[02:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9704.26s)]
*  A you know it's like a flame and a dark night you know there's there's so much out there beyond [[02:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9710.34s)]
*  Beyond what we can see yeah so always I always kind of thought that myself I mean it's a basic [[02:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9716.34s)]
*  Thing nowadays you know what I was like a kid you know a lot of people have had this thought but it's [[02:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9722.74s)]
*  Like y'all he's like looking up here in the stars and it's like if they're saying that the stars are [[02:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9727.06s)]
*  Basically infinite then it's infinite possibility for other planets with life on it which basically [[02:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9732.82s)]
*  Is a certainty right it's basically a certain it's a certainty yeah it's basically certainty and the [[02:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9739.7s)]
*  More we explore in the known universe the more we understand that it's much more likely that this is [[02:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9744.58s)]
*  Not an anomaly that there's many many planets out there who knows maybe an infinite number that have [[02:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9750.26s)]
*  Life so who knows what's going on with those Egyptians well we don't know how long ago they did this [[02:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9756.18s)]
*  You know there's there's just so much speculation well and the the version of Egypt that we're taught [[02:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9762.42s)]
*  About it was like just the latest stage of it oh yeah like I read where there was just there it went [[02:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9767.86s)]
*  On for so many thousands of years and there was this whole evolution of those kingdoms I'm talking [[02:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9773.380000000001s)]

*  Believe that Atlantis was I mean there's this thing called the reshot structure that there's again these [[02:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9784.1s)]
*  Archaeologists believe was the site of Atlantis it I mean the south Saharan the Saharan [[02:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9789.699999999999s)]

*  Bones in the Saharan desert that's crazy it's fucking madness man the history of earth is so confusing [[02:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9803.14s)]
*  Like Graham Hancock says it best we're a species with amnesia you know and that's what's wild about [[02:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9809.46s)]
*  All this ancient shit well we definitely don't remember shit from 20,000 years ago it's all just speculation [[02:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9817.46s)]
*  And you know and people have been in this form you know the form of homo sapiens now for 300 plus [[02:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9824.02s)]
*  Thousand years like who knows how long and who knows where they learn this stuff from I mean who [[02:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9830.66s)]
*  Knows if they learn this stuff from visitors we don't know we don't know I mean if we did get [[02:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9836.66s)]
*  Visited 20,000 30,000 years ago what evidence would be left you know and are we being visited [[02:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9841.54s)]
*  Now well we're about to find out because if this shit keeps popping off with Israel and Iran and [[02:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9847.7s)]
*  They start going nuclear you know that was the only the the the great hope of the people that really [[02:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9852.42s)]
*  Believe in aliens is that what they're watching over us is to make sure we don't fuck everything up [[02:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9858.18s)]
*  That we're so close to emerging as a type one civilization we're so close to getting out of this [[02:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9862.740000000002s)]
*  Barbaric you know territorial apes with thermonuclear weapons we're so close to passing [[02:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9869.46s)]
*  This stage that we're in right now as long as we don't fuck it up and who knows how many times [[02:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9878.179999999998s)]
*  People might have fucked it up in the past that I mean that might be what we're looking at when [[02:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9882.66s)]
*  We're looking at ancient Egypt there might be the remnants and there's also natural disasters yeah [[02:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9886.66s)]
*  And that's all I meant by AI yeah I mean it could be our greatest natural disaster there and [[02:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9890.74s)]
*  But I like your there's a it's a very positive outlook though you're talking about getting to the [[02:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9896.42s)]
*  Next yeah what'd you call it type what'd you type one civilization what does that mean okay there's [[02:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9901.94s)]
*  There's there's type one type two and type three civilizations and um I remember who was the one [[02:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9907.14s)]
*  Who formulated this it might have been Sagan um Jamie pull it up so I don't fuck this up [[02:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9913.62s)]
*  Come on Jamie it's essentially our here it is type one civilization known as a planetary civilization [[02:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9920.5s)]
*  Defined by our Kardashev scale as the one that's harnessed and controls all available energy on its [[02:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9928.26s)]
*  Planet this includes utilizing all forms of energy from sources like solar wind geothermal and [[02:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9935.54s)]
*  Potentially even harnessing nuclear fusion a type one civilization is also characterized by a global [[02:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9941.220000000001s)]
*  Technologically advanced society with a high degree of interconnectedness and the ability to manage [[02:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9947.06s)]
*  Planetary scale resources and weather so we're on the way to that an AI in best case scenario [[02:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9952.58s)]
*  Helps us achieve that and we're we're close we're probably a lot closer to that than we think [[02:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9960.74s)]
*  Type two civilization is stellar meaning we populate other planets type three is galactic [[02:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9967.38s)]
*  We we populate the cosmos and we we explore the cosmos wow we're on our way to that [[02:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9974.9s)]
*  And it's inevitable if we used to live in caves and now you know we fly in hypersonic jets [[02:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9982.58s)]
*  This is what's coming and it's whether or not we fuck it up along the way [[02:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9987.94s)]
*  That was beam me up man [[02:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nK4g6vgRDg&t=9994.74s)]
