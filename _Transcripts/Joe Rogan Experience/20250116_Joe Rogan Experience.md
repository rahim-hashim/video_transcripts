**Joe Rogan Experience:** [January 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by Dave, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  Steve Vanilla. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=13.32s)]
*  That was a long exhale. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=14.32s)]
*  I needed one. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=15.32s)]
*  Is this Trump's chair? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=17.32s)]
*  He sat in that chair, yeah. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=18.32s)]
*  I want to soak up some of the tenacity, man. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=21.6s)]
*  He's got a lot of that. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=24.84s)]
*  It took me a long time, man. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=26.56s)]
*  It took me a long time to see it. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=28.04s)]
*  I remember people would talk, there was this thing when he emerged on the scene, it was [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=32.04s)]
*  this thing about toughness. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=36.08s)]
*  I'd always defined, in my mind, toughness was being able to go through some alder-choked [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=37.08s)]
*  hellhole real fast or hike up a hill. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=42.4s)]
*  I was like, that's not tough. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=44.72s)]
*  Then later I was like, oh. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  That kind of tough, man. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  I mean, think about what that guy went through. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  He had the entire media, the entire justice system, he had the deep state, the central [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=56.12s)]
*  intelligence agency. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=62.76s)]
*  He had all these people conspiring to take him out. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=63.76s)]
*  Literally an assassination attempt, then another one. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=68.72s)]
*  In and out of the news in no time. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=71.48s)]
*  Nobody cared. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=72.96s)]
*  No grace period. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=73.96s)]
*  No. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=74.96s)]
*  They waited about a day and then they started talking shit about him again. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=75.96s)]
*  When I looked at it, now that I've come to understand it better, I'm like, the fact [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=80.92s)]
*  that most people would crawl into a hole. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=85.88s)]
*  I got a buddy, I don't want to say who it is, but he had sold his business and he told [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=92.11999999999999s)]
*  me, he goes, when I sell my business, I'm going to crawl into a deep dark hole. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=96.56s)]
*  Later he's kind of back out and bought another business. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=102.52s)]
*  I said, what about crawling into the deep dark hole? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=104.19999999999999s)]
*  He said, well, I did, but my wife was in there. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=106.56s)]
*  I have to get back. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=109.56s)]
*  I'm not ready yet. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=113.96s)]
*  I got to get back out. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=115.03999999999999s)]
*  I think that's like these sort of fictional depictions of the future that, you know, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=118.03999999999999s)]
*  everybody wants this future where, you know, you're just holding hands and walking off [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=124.44s)]
*  into the sunset, the golden years. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=128.68s)]
*  It's all bullshit. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=131.32s)]
*  If you're alive, you're going to want to do the same things you're doing right now. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=132.78s)]
*  You're not going to have some point in your life where you're going to want to do nothing [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=136.9s)]
*  and be happy that you don't have to do anything. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=139.92s)]
*  You're going to get depressed. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=141.95999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I think about it. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=142.95999999999998s)]
*  My wife's smart enough to worry about what would happen to us if we didn't have like, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=144.84s)]
*  you know, dragons to slay. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=148.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=150.36s)]
*  You know, she feels that it might be essential. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=151.36s)]
*  It's essential for life. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=153.96s)]
*  You need puzzle. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=155.12s)]
*  You need at least some sort of a very involving hobby. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=156.12s)]
*  You need something. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=159.68s)]
*  I mean, you can retire from if you have a lot of money, you could retire from your financial [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=161.16s)]
*  pursuits, but you need something that you enjoy doing. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=166.16s)]
*  Human beings need tasks. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=170.84s)]
*  If you don't have something, you get very dull. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=172.84s)]
*  That's how people get Alzheimer's. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=175.84s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=184.12s)]
*  I look at people like that and, you know, part of looking at, well, Biden and Trump [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=185.12s)]
*  would be at that age, like I plan on at that age to be like really kicking it. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=192.64000000000001s)]

*  I don't want to relax. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=244.28s)]
*  How long do you think, if you had to guess, how long would you do this podcast? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=245.28s)]
*  This is the easiest thing I do. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=248.68s)]
*  Really? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=250.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=251.16s)]
*  I'll do this forever. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=252.16s)]
*  So easy to do. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=253.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=254.16s)]
*  As long as I'm actually interested in talking to the people. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=255.16s)]
*  How hard is that? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=256.15999999999997s)]
*  Actually interested? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=257.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=258.28000000000003s)]
*  But that's the only reason why I do it anyway. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=259.28000000000003s)]
*  Like, I only talk to people I want to talk to. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=262.0s)]
*  So no one ever tells me, you know, have this person on your show. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=264.32000000000005s)]
*  There's literally zero input from anyone else. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=268.84000000000003s)]
*  So everybody I talk to, I look at, I go to, I want to talk to that guy. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=272.20000000000005s)]
*  That might be cool. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=275.32000000000005s)]
*  That'd be interesting. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=276.32000000000005s)]
*  I want to find out what makes him tick. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=277.32000000000005s)]
*  I want to find out what, why she writes those books like that. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=278.32000000000005s)]
*  I want to find out, you know, what keeps him going. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=280.96000000000004s)]
*  That's like the whole, the whole reason why I do it is because I enjoy it. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=284.24s)]
*  If you do picture, do you picture walking away from standup before you'd walk away from [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=288.96s)]
*  podcasts? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=293.4s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=294.4s)]
*  Why would I do that too? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=295.4s)]
*  I have my own club now. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=296.4s)]
*  I'm 50 years old, man. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=297.4s)]
*  I'm just starting to wonder. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=298.4s)]
*  I'm starting to have all these questions. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=299.4s)]
*  I think you enjoy, you just stay healthy, stay healthy and do what you enjoy doing. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=301.0s)]
*  I think live in the moment. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=305.15999999999997s)]
*  I think this idea of like planning for the future is like silly. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=306.64s)]
*  I really do. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=309.56s)]
*  I think you should have goals. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=310.8s)]
*  Like if you enjoy doing things and you're like, I would like to get to this point. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=311.92s)]
*  I would like to do this. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=315.12s)]
*  So something to strive towards. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=316.12s)]
*  That's good. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=317.76s)]
*  But this idea that like, you know, one day you're just going to like stop doing stuff. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=318.76s)]
*  Like why? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=323.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=324.56s)]

*  Are you enjoying doing it? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=326.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=327.72s)]
*  Shut the fuck up. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=328.72s)]
*  Like you could be so much worse off. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=329.72s)]
*  There's so many things to dwell on other than whether or not I want to stop doing something [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=331.28000000000003s)]
*  that I enjoy. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=335.12s)]
*  Why would I ever even think about that? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=336.12s)]
*  That's a good point, man. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=337.92s)]
*  It's a good point. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=339.24s)]
*  All questions I had never really thought about, but I became more interested after I crossed [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=340.24s)]
*  that threshold. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=344.48s)]
*  You know, but I could conceive a time where I don't want to do it anymore. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=345.48s)]
*  I don't want to be a public person anymore. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=348.40000000000003s)]
*  The public aspect of it is the weirdest part. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=350.24s)]
*  The people constantly wanting your time and everybody thinking that if I can connect with [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=352.92s)]
*  this guy, that I can make a lot of money. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=356.68s)]
*  I can set up a business with him. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=358.64s)]
*  I can do this with him. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=360.52s)]
*  I could do that with him. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=361.56s)]
*  He can introduce me to this. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=362.56s)]
*  I can, you know, work with him. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=363.92s)]
*  I could do a lot of that. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=366.04s)]
*  A lot of that. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=367.64s)]
*  That's exhausting. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=368.64s)]
*  I mean, I think there's a lot of opportunists and weirdos. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=370.03999999999996s)]
*  Those are exhausting. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=373.4s)]
*  I remember years ago, three, four years ago, you told me that you wished you were, we were [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=374.4s)]
*  eating barbecue and you told me you wish you were 10% less famous. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=380.4s)]
*  But I feel like then you got 20% more famous. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=384.91999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=388.76s)]
*  Yeah, I fucked up. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=389.76s)]
*  Well, I thought doing the Spotify deal. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=390.76s)]
*  I was like, his direction isn't going the right way. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=392.4s)]
*  That was the whole reason why I took the Spotify deal. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=395.15999999999997s)]
*  I was like, good, they're going to give me a lot of money and it'll only be on Spotify. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=397.40000000000003s)]
*  So I'll be about 10% less famous. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=400.84000000000003s)]
*  Good. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=402.64000000000004s)]
*  Let me slide off into obscurity because all I mean, as long as I'm making money, I was [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=403.64000000000004s)]
*  like, I just enjoy doing it. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=408.44s)]
*  I don't care how many people like the people that like it will still listen. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=409.96000000000004s)]
*  So maybe I'll have less casual fans like who cares? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=413.76s)]
*  Who cares? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=416.52000000000004s)]
*  You know, there's a certain level of fame though, that's a little unmanageable and I'm [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=417.52000000000004s)]
*  in that level. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=423.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=424.12s)]
*  It's very unmanageable. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=425.12s)]
*  It is. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=426.12s)]
*  Well, part, you know, if you'll allow me to tell you what it is. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=427.12s)]
*  Okay, please do. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=430.52s)]
*  And I observed this. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=431.96s)]
*  I observed this by my wife who's traveling with me right now. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=435.08s)]
*  I observed this after we had dinner with you one time and certain individuals, you included, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=438.36s)]
*  would be that it's not necessarily, it's not just people that don't like you, right? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=446.32s)]
*  It's just people that like you too much. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=454.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=456.64s)]

*  I know. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=459.32s)]
*  And so it's like, you got it. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=460.32s)]
*  Like at a certain point, you got to worry about the people that like you. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=461.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=464.08s)]

*  You know, but I hadn't already known that because I had a buddy who worked for her. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=633.64s)]
*  And he was like, she's a fucking monster. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=636.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=639.52s)]
*  I didn't have a lot of, I didn't really had a lot of awareness. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=640.52s)]
*  You probably did just from being in the business. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=645.04s)]
*  I only did because of my buddy. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=646.68s)]
*  My buddy Greg, who was one of her writers, was like, she's a piece of shit. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=648.5999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't know enough to be surprised. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=651.8399999999999s)]
*  It's just people that they get in those positions of power and if their whole life they've been [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=656.1999999999999s)]
*  fucked with and picked on or, you know, they've been marginalized and then all of a sudden [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=661.4s)]
*  they're in control, like, oh, now it's payback. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=666.1999999999999s)]
*  There's a lot of those folks. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=669.56s)]
*  That's what happened to Castro. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=670.56s)]
*  Is that it? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=671.56s)]
*  Is that what happened to Castro? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=672.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=674.56s)]
*  I mean, like, you know, I mean, it's like the, in fact, I would talk about that a little [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=675.56s)]
*  bit in some, you know, I've discussed that. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=679.8399999999999s)]
*  I've had like various conversations around when you watch like certain political fortunes [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=682.72s)]
*  rise as it becomes, things become vindictive. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=686.0s)]
*  I don't even go to Canada anymore. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=688.84s)]
*  I won't go to Canada for a UFC. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=690.04s)]
*  I don't go over there. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=692.52s)]
*  I've spent my whole life in the Northern Tier states, but I've remained somewhat oblivious [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=693.52s)]
*  to political movements in Canada. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=701.4399999999999s)]
*  Well, they don't have free speech up there. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=704.0s)]
*  They don't have a First Amendment. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=705.8s)]
*  They have different laws. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=706.8s)]
*  They have hate speech laws. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=708.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=709.3199999999999s)]
*  That's dangerous because who defines hate speech? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=710.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=712.6800000000001s)]
*  You know, like, so hate speech laws in Canada, they refer to gender pronouns now. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=713.6800000000001s)]
*  So like not just male, female, like if a guy, like if Caitlyn Jenner decides that she's [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=718.36s)]
*  a girl, like Bruce Jenner decides he's a girl, now you have to call him Caitlyn. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=722.84s)]
*  If you don't, that's hate speech. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=726.36s)]
*  Like, okay, maybe that's debatable. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=727.36s)]
*  Maybe you're being an asshole. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=729.36s)]
*  But no, they want like all 78 fake genders, like ZZer and all these fucking crazy fake [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=730.6s)]
*  ones and they thems. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=736.6400000000001s)]
*  Well, that's where like, that's, I mean, isn't that conversation what spawned kind of the [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=738.52s)]
*  ascendancy of Jordan Peterson, right? [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=743.88s)]
*  100%. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=746.24s)]
*  Coming out of Canada. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=747.24s)]
*  Well, that's how Jordan and I became friends in 2015. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=748.24s)]
*  And then Jordan did my podcast and then Jordan became a famous guy for speaking out against [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=751.56s)]
*  this. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=757.3199999999999s)]
*  He's going through some sort of bizarre re-education process in Canada and he's going to publicize [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=758.3199999999999s)]
*  it because it's so ludicrous. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=764.12s)]
*  So they want to educate him on like what he talks about on social media if he wants to [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=766.3s)]
*  keep his clinical license to practice as a psychotherapist. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=773.54s)]
*  Oh, is that right? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=777.18s)]
*  But he doesn't want to practice anyway. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=778.18s)]
*  He makes far more money doing what he, they've essentially made a monster. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=779.42s)]
*  They made him way more famous than he ever would have been before. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=782.66s)]
*  Sure, yeah. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=785.26s)]
*  They highlighted all of Canada's problems way more than would ever get highlighted without [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=786.26s)]
*  this persecution of this guy. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=790.66s)]
*  It's kind of crazy though. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=794.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=795.14s)]
*  He's going through it. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=796.98s)]
*  He's like, fuck you. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=797.98s)]
*  I'll go through it and I'll go through it publicly. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=798.98s)]
*  You guys are idiots. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=799.98s)]
*  Also, you're going to have to talk to me. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=800.98s)]
*  No one wants the outcome will be. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=801.98s)]
*  Well, knowing he's going to trounce them, like good luck debating that guy. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=802.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=806.5s)]
*  Good fucking luck. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=807.5s)]
*  Like good luck. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=808.5s)]
*  Like who do you got on your side that's going to go up against that guy? [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=809.5s)]
*  Like shut the fuck up. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=812.8199999999999s)]
*  Who on your creepy authoritarian totalitarian regime is going to stand up and make sense [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=814.74s)]
*  competing against Jordan Peterson? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=822.9s)]
*  Good fucking luck. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=824.3s)]
*  I wouldn't want the job. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=825.8599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=826.8599999999999s)]
*  Good luck. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=827.8599999999999s)]

*  It's just the whole situation up there is just like so fucked. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=829.8599999999999s)]
*  And I don't know too much about that Pierre Polovet guy, but I hope that there's some [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=834.9399999999999s)]
*  sort of meaningful change up there they could bring. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=840.26s)]
*  I used to love Canada. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=842.38s)]
*  I used to say Canada is like America with like 20% less douchebags. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=844.18s)]
*  They were so friendly. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=847.54s)]
*  They're so nice. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=849.3399999999999s)]
*  I used to love going to Montreal. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=850.3399999999999s)]
*  I used to love going to Vancouver. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=851.3399999999999s)]
*  I loved it up there. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=853.06s)]
*  The woke shit hit there so hard because they don't have freedom of speech. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=855.34s)]
*  They don't have a First Amendment. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=859.58s)]
*  So when they start clamping down on your ability to express yourself, like there's really disastrous [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=861.3000000000001s)]
*  implications. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=867.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=868.1s)]
*  But there'll probably, I mean, there will probably be a course correction now, which [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=869.1s)]
*  seems like just generally on free speech issues, there's a radical course correction right [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=872.7s)]
*  now. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=877.1800000000001s)]
*  Sure. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=878.1800000000001s)]
*  Or you become Iran. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=879.1800000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=880.1800000000001s)]
*  You know. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=881.1800000000001s)]
*  You roll that way. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=882.1800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=883.1800000000001s)]
*  It doesn't work. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=884.66s)]
*  Like, you know, we think it works because it works in America. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=885.66s)]
*  And it works in America because we have the First Amendment and we have the Second Amendment. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=887.8199999999999s)]
*  And those two things work together. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=890.8599999999999s)]
*  And if we didn't have those things, we would be genuinely fucked because every government [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=892.26s)]
*  wants to eventually completely and totally control its population because it's way easier [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=896.9399999999999s)]
*  for them to make money. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=901.5s)]
*  And that's what they like to do. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=902.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=903.9799999999999s)]
*  They like to make money. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=904.9799999999999s)]
*  They like to be in bed with the lobbyists in the military industrial complex and the [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=905.9799999999999s)]
*  pharmaceutical industrial complex. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=908.8199999999999s)]

*  And if you can't express yourself and say, hey, this is fucked up. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=914.62s)]
*  This is crazy. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=916.34s)]
*  Why am I doing this? [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=917.34s)]
*  Like these studies show that you're not correct. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=918.34s)]
*  But if you can't say all those things, which right now you can't do in Canada, it's not [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=919.34s)]
*  the same like their ability to express themselves on the Internet has been severely limited. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=923.38s)]

*  You could walk there if you wanted to. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=932.26s)]
*  You could walk there and it's fucked. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=933.8199999999999s)]
*  It's like it's on the same patch of land as us. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=936.18s)]
*  And it's fun. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=938.9s)]
*  It just shows you what can happen here if you don't have the right laws. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=939.9s)]
*  Because people like that fuckhead, Justin, they pretend that first name basis. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=943.6999999999999s)]

*  I genuinely despise people like that. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=955.5s)]

*  one of our senators from Montana. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1474.2s)]
*  And after when the flight was getting off you know it's hilarious. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1477.1399999999999s)]
*  This this this old timer comes by him and Jimmy I'm not joking legitimately brings [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1482.82s)]
*  up to him potholes on the road. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1489.58s)]
*  Really on the airplane. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1493.7s)]
*  So you got to do something about these potholes. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1495.62s)]
*  I'm outside of Belgrade and his potholes are terrible. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1498.5s)]
*  He's like OK. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1502.1s)]
*  Yeah got it. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1503.1s)]
*  Well I mean the senator can't do much about law enforcement. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1505.06s)]
*  No I know but it's almost like a cliche. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1507.02s)]
*  But you know the thing with their guys that I grew up with you know like a fish that was [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1509.9399999999998s)]
*  very central to our upbringing was a fish called smelt. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1517.6999999999998s)]
*  It was different kinds of smelt. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1521.58s)]
*  So we had a rainbow smelt and they were they live in the Great Lakes and so in the spring [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1523.26s)]
*  when the smelt run you know it was a big deal to go smelt dipping and we would smelt dip [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1526.82s)]
*  them and with drop nets and dip nets was a huge thing. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1531.58s)]
*  And when smelt numbers were really high you know it was just like it kind of brought everybody [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1535.78s)]
*  together. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1540.06s)]
*  A lot of my buddies used to do that in Massachusetts. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1541.06s)]
*  The smelt run. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1542.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1543.06s)]
*  So the other night someone had taken out a clip where someone had taken out a chunk of [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1544.06s)]
*  an article in my friend circle and it sent me a thing where Trump had called the Delta [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1548.74s)]
*  smelt like a basically useless fish. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1553.3s)]
*  And I was like man I feel like there needs to be like a like an article in the Constitution [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1557.5s)]
*  that the president cannot shit talk smelt you know. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1563.5s)]
*  But then I realized it was a different smelt. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1566.94s)]
*  So I got my I cooled off once I realized it was the Delta smelt not our beloved rainbow [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1570.42s)]
*  smelt. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1575.14s)]
*  Well you can have there's a balance right in terms of like being environmentally conscious [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1576.14s)]
*  but also recognizing the needs of the human population. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1581.46s)]
*  And I think that's been distorted in California significantly. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1585.1s)]
*  Yeah but I do get like my hackles get up when my hackles get up about disparaging disparaging [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1588.58s)]
*  fishes and birds. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1594.7s)]

*  been a little bit involved in this the last few years as I started going down to the Gulf [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1711.78s)]
*  of Mexico to spearfish on the oil rigs. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1716.22s)]
*  And so the oil rigs are there. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1720.1s)]
*  Imagine like a vertical coral reef. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1725.54s)]
*  You know you. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1728.58s)]
*  I don't want to call it but by no means I want to call the Gulf a desert. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1729.58s)]
*  But I mean you could if you're away from the rigs you could swim along the surface for [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1733.54s)]
*  miles potentially. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1737.82s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1738.82s)]
*  If you just swim with a snorkel and mask you can swim along the surface for miles and not [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1739.82s)]
*  encounter fish. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1743.6599999999999s)]
*  I mean it's kind of where you're seeing them in front of your face. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1745.9399999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1748.4599999999998s)]
*  You go up to a rig and it's it's hung in fish. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1749.5s)]
*  I mean it's it's they're draped in thousands of fish. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1753.46s)]
*  OK. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1757.54s)]
*  So you know you grow up with this idea if you just have a passive understanding of all [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1758.54s)]
*  this stuff you grow up this idea that like oil oil exploration equals a diminishing of [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1763.06s)]
*  natural life a diminishing of wildlife. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1770.94s)]
*  And then you go in and there there's this big debate where certain people want to pull [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1773.5s)]
*  the abandoned rigs out. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1779.74s)]
*  But you have fishermen who are like they're here now. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1781.9s)]
*  Leave them because that's where all the fish are. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1786.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1788.74s)]
*  You know and it's this it's this very it's this very spirited debate and different administrations [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1789.74s)]
*  will have different plans. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1794.1000000000001s)]
*  They had a program like idle iron which is to pull them out. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1795.1000000000001s)]
*  There's a program called rigs to reefs which is to tip them over so they're not navigational [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1799.58s)]
*  hazards that the shrimpers don't like them because they they are there. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1804.42s)]
*  You know they cause like navigational obstructions. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1809.1s)]
*  You can hang your gear up on them. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1810.94s)]
*  But all the rod and reel fishermen and all the spear fishermen want the rigs there. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1812.82s)]
*  So you wind up in a situation like that where it's this real complexity and you can picture [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1816.94s)]
*  you know it puts people in a situation in viewing it it puts you in a situation where [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1823.22s)]
*  it's not that clean. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1826.6599999999999s)]
*  You know you're creating I mean you they you know it's hate to say it because you're supposed [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1828.8999999999999s)]
*  to you know you know you're supposed to be you know most people from the environmental [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1834.1s)]
*  movement are anti oil exploration but then you go and look and be like they created like [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1840.6999999999998s)]
*  an accidently created an unbelievable fishery. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1845.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1849.4199999999998s)]
*  In the Gulf and there's dudes now like I got buddies that spear fish there and fish there. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1850.4199999999998s)]
*  And it's like you remember in Star Wars the original Star Wars when they go to that fucking [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1855.26s)]
*  planet and the planets gone. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1858.38s)]
*  So hey shouldn't the planet be here you know that scene. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1859.8600000000001s)]
*  I've been with buddies mine and they got they got GPS marks for rigs and you show up and [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1863.74s)]
*  it's like Star Wars. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1870.1000000000001s)]
*  It's like you show up and the rigs not there anymore because there's these ships out there [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1871.74s)]
*  called rig reapers that are out plucking the rigs and they're plucking them faster than [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1874.98s)]
*  they can put them in. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1879.5s)]
*  But it's got all the fishermen pissed off. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1880.5s)]
*  That's an interesting situation. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1882.46s)]
*  They want them there now man. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1884.0600000000002s)]
*  Lake Austin has a similar situation. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1885.5800000000002s)]
*  So Lake Austin used to be this it's still very good for bass fishing. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1887.94s)]
*  They have big bass on Lake Austin and the people that live on the lake you know the [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1891.42s)]
*  highfalutin folks didn't like all the weeds. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1898.14s)]
*  So they brought in carp. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1901.38s)]
*  And the carp ate everything. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1903.74s)]
*  So now the place looks like the bottom of a swimming pool. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1904.74s)]
*  It's like all the vegetation is fucked. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1908.28s)]
*  And so the bass don't have a lot of places to go like you know where I live people go [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1910.64s)]
*  to the docks like they cast to the docks you know and they fish near people's docks [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1914.9s)]
*  because that's like the only cover that these fish have. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1920.96s)]
*  And so there's talk of like submerging like trees or you know dropping creating structures [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1923.8400000000001s)]
*  and then there's people that are opposed to that because like you know you have your you [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1929.88s)]
*  know the wake borders and all the people that like to like recreation on the water. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1933.8400000000001s)]
*  They don't want anything that could possibly fuck up their boat. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1938.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1941.9599999999998s)]
*  You know but like if they already fucked it up by bringing in the carp like and you can't [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1942.9599999999998s)]
*  get the carp out like how are you going to kill the carp. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1947.4799999999998s)]
*  You know Tom remember the writer Tom was it Tom Robbins or Tim. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1950.1599999999999s)]
*  No Tim Robbins is the actor right. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1953.28s)]
*  Tom Robbins skinny skinny skinny legs and all. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1955.6799999999998s)]
*  Jitterbug perfume. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1959.84s)]
*  He had a line where like in Hawaii they had this famous thing where they had a rat problem. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1961.84s)]
*  And then they brought in mongooses to kill the rats and then now they got a mongoose [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1967.76s)]
*  problem. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1971.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1972.96s)]
*  He had some line that like we used to have a crime problem and we brought in cops. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1973.96s)]
*  It's like my first you're talking about political involvement. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1981.4s)]
*  My first time my first time I ever approached anything remotely political was on the lake [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1985.16s)]
*  I grew up on. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1989.8400000000001s)]
*  We had an we had an invasive seaweed an invasive aquatic plant called Eurasian milfoil. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1991.16s)]
*  And it grew in our lake but it made unbelievable fish habitat. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=1998.08s)]
*  And at the time I was not hip enough to understand the deleterious effects of non-native vegetation. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2002.9199999999998s)]
*  I just knew that when you wanted to catch a fish you went to the milfoil bed because [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2010.7199999999998s)]
*  all the fish were hiding in the milfoil and they had this proposal to come in and kill [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2013.8799999999999s)]
*  all the milfoil and all the lakes. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2017.7199999999998s)]
*  And I went down I remember I was in high school I went down I remember I was the sole person [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2020.1599999999999s)]
*  there to represent like the milfoil side of the argument. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2024.36s)]
*  And then they did it. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2030.08s)]
*  They went in and poisoned all the milfoil out of the lakes in hopes of you know bringing [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2031.08s)]
*  in like the native seaweeds would take hold. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2034.92s)]
*  But I mean it absolutely transformed the lake and from a fishery perspective from not a [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2037.72s)]
*  perspective of native habitat but from a pounds of fish perspective the pounds of fish like [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2043.56s)]
*  biomass of fish declined by pulling out the weeds. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2050.84s)]
*  Of course. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2055.88s)]
*  You know it's again like some on one hand you look like well why would you mess up with [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2056.88s)]
*  this there's fish everywhere and some people be like well it's not a native plant and we [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2060.28s)]
*  need to value native wildlife at the expense of what you know a high schooler would look [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2063.7200000000003s)]
*  at is like it's where the fish are. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2068.5200000000004s)]
*  Yeah you know they didn't do what they did to Lake Austin they didn't do it to Ladybird [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2070.28s)]
*  Lake so if you go to Ladybird Lake it's just hopping with bass. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2074.88s)]
*  Remaining a good fishery. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2078.1200000000003s)]
*  For the seaweed and all kinds of not seaweed but you know lily pads and all kinds of shit [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2079.48s)]
*  over there that you don't have on Lake Austin. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2083.96s)]
*  They didn't bring in the carp. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2086.44s)]
*  Yeah the other enormously destructive thing that they've done around the lakes where I [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2088.3599999999997s)]
*  grew up on is all that so much of that that life the lake life relies on what you call [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2095.16s)]
*  like the littoral zone. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2101.68s)]
*  So you know the shoreline zone and most of these fish species they like it to be dirty [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2103.52s)]
*  meaning weeds falling over trees like it creates all kinds of habitat right for little stuff [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2108.88s)]
*  to hide and none of these lakes where I grew up in Michigan there's been a tendency over [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2113.32s)]
*  the years to to to to round up put round up on your shoreline and then haul in beach sand. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2116.7200000000003s)]
*  And you just watch over the years I go over the course of my lifetime you just watch this [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2125.28s)]
*  like really like verdant kind of like vibrant environment become increasingly like a swimming [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2129.76s)]
*  pool in a lot in a lot of those lakes man and it's just been it's just been it's just [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2135.56s)]
*  been depressing to watch happen. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2139.84s)]
*  Yeah we were talking the other day about eating freshwater fish how how much toxic chemicals [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2141.56s)]
*  are in freshwater fish. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2149.0s)]
*  It's fucking bananas. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2150.52s)]
*  Well they have state advisories which I've always ignored. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2151.52s)]
*  I've always ignored. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2154.84s)]
*  Have you ever get your blood tested. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2156.32s)]
*  No but you want to know I might have told you this story man. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2158.12s)]
*  Did I ever tell you a story about this. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2160.4s)]
*  Which one. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2162.08s)]
*  Well I'll tell it real quick. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2163.08s)]
*  So I grew up with a guy who got him Ron Spring. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2164.52s)]
*  Yes he had. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2168.48s)]
*  I'll tell you the Ron Spring story. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2169.48s)]
*  OK. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2170.48s)]
*  Please do. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2171.48s)]
*  I'll tell the story to you. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2172.48s)]
*  I don't think you told it on here. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2173.48s)]
*  OK. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2174.92s)]
*  I grew up this guy Ron Spring and it for a living he was a commercial bait fisherman. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2175.92s)]
*  He would he would catch wigglers minnows he'd dig crawlers catch leeches and he would supply [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2180.16s)]
*  bait and tackle shops with live bait and he had spring sporting goods where he sold his [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2189.88s)]
*  own life bait. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2193.88s)]
*  And he would even hire women to sew what's called a spawn sack where you take little [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2194.88s)]
*  bits of salmon pieces of salmon roe salmon eggs and sew them into a little mesh bag for [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2198.96s)]
*  steelhead bait. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2203.8s)]
*  He was just in the bait business but also was a fish and fanatic and lived off fish [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2204.8s)]
*  his whole life. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2209.48s)]
*  So he was living off Great Lakes fish his whole life. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2210.48s)]
*  And the University of Montana started trying to track down old timers who'd eaten like [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2213.32s)]
*  enormous quantities of Great Lake fish Great Lakes fish to test them for heavy metals [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2220.04s)]
*  exposure. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2224.84s)]
*  OK. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2225.84s)]
*  And other toxic things are in the environment. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2226.84s)]
*  And he'd lived his whole life like me with like complete defiance of health advisory [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2230.12s)]
*  suggestions about fish consumption. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2234.52s)]
*  And he goes down there and he and he would go in every month or two for these little [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2237.76s)]
*  batteries of tests and one of the things they would do with them is they would tell them [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2241.84s)]
*  they'd give them a grocery list. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2245.36s)]
*  And they'd be like you got to go to the store and buy like bread, eggs, cheese, butter, [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2247.5200000000004s)]
*  whatever. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2252.5600000000004s)]
*  And then they'd wait a minute and they'd say what were you supposed to buy at the store? [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2253.5600000000004s)]
*  You know and he's telling me this story and he told me I was laughing he said Steve I [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2258.1600000000003s)]
*  wouldn't have remembered that list if I never ate a piece of fish in my life. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2263.48s)]
*  So they were trying to gauge his memory based on the amount of heavy metal in his body? [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2269.0800000000004s)]
*  Yeah they were trying to they're presumably they tested his blood and found something [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2273.2799999999997s)]
*  of interest and so they're trying to figure out like what happens to a guy. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2276.52s)]
*  But I lived in Seattle and right on Lake Washington and we would catch a lot of yellow perch because [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2280.2799999999997s)]
*  people they're full yellow perch which are non-native and everyone in that area in the [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2288.12s)]
*  Pacific Northwest is like a trout and salmon snob. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2292.3599999999997s)]
*  So I had the whole fishery to myself. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2294.8999999999996s)]
*  You could go out and catch easily you know 100 plus yellow perch out of Lake Washington [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2297.8s)]
*  but they had a health advisory on them and you weren't supposed to they would tell you [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2304.32s)]
*  that perch over 12 inches you're only supposed to eat one meal a month or some shit like [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2307.6400000000003s)]
*  that. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2311.6800000000003s)]
*  But we just wouldn't keep them over 12 inches because there weren't that many over 12 inches [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2312.6800000000003s)]
*  anyway so we just eat them all the time. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2317.32s)]
*  I would have fish fries and when you fried fish in the Great Lakes there's no person [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2319.1200000000003s)]
*  in the Great Lakes region that I was aware of like in Michigan there's no person that [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2323.5600000000004s)]
*  was even kind to give a shit about these restrictions. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2327.36s)]
*  They would be surprised to hear that there were any kind of restrictions but like the [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2332.2400000000002s)]
*  way the different sentiments and different mentalities run in Seattle you have people [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2335.56s)]
*  that like they're like you caught it where? [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2340.0s)]
*  Lake Washington? [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2342.0s)]
*  No way. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2343.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2344.0s)]
*  Just like a level of awareness from like an urban environment about those kind of toxins [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2345.0s)]
*  and growing up where I grew up it was just not a thing that people discussed even though [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2350.28s)]
*  they're right in the fishing rigs. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2355.1200000000003s)]
*  When did it start happening? [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2357.32s)]
*  Like when did freshwater fish become toxic? [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2358.88s)]
*  That would be something I'd be interested in. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2361.2400000000002s)]
*  Man I think it's like it's mercury, it's certain industrial solvents. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2363.0800000000004s)]
*  It's BPAs too. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2367.6800000000003s)]
*  It's forever chemicals. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2368.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah and I think that with Lake Washington there was a lot, correct me if I'm wrong, [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2369.6800000000003s)]
*  like as I say this I might be wrong. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2374.4s)]
*  I think there was things around Boeing plants and old solvents and stuff that went in the [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2376.44s)]
*  water. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2381.6000000000004s)]
*  But mercury, which comes from different ways, they have ways of scrubbing it now and greatly [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2384.16s)]
*  reducing the amount of mercury when you burn coal, but for a long time mercury would come [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2389.8799999999997s)]
*  from the combustion of coal and it would be distributed globally, evenly everywhere. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2396.44s)]
*  So it didn't necessarily matter if you were, it didn't matter if you're eating a pelagic [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2401.2799999999997s)]
*  fish. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2406.08s)]
*  I mean if you're eating like a paciferous pelagic fish would seem to be the worst. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2407.08s)]
*  What does pelagic mean? [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2411.24s)]
*  Fish that live their life up at the surface. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2413.0s)]
*  And then ones that eat fish, that eat fish, that eat fish are the worst. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2415.28s)]
*  So picture you got like a marlin, right? [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2420.24s)]
*  He's eating tuna. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2423.4s)]
*  Tuner are eating fish that are eating fish and so they magnify and accumulate all this [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2425.32s)]
*  stuff in their fat. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2429.24s)]
*  That's globally distributed in the oceans. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2431.88s)]
*  And they've slowed down mercury, they've slowed down how much mercury's going out because [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2434.8s)]
*  of ways they scrub when they burn coal now. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2440.24s)]
*  But it's just stagnant in the environment. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2443.8399999999997s)]
*  Did I tell you my arsenic story? [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2445.56s)]
*  No. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2447.64s)]
*  I got my blood work done. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2448.64s)]
*  You know I get my blood work done pretty regularly and I went once a few years back, quite a [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2449.64s)]
*  few years back, 15 years ago at least. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2454.3999999999996s)]
*  And my doctor said, do you have a lot of arsenic in your blood? [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2458.0s)]
*  And I go like someone's poisoning me? [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2462.9799999999996s)]
*  He's like no. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2464.52s)]
*  Do you eat a lot of fish? [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2466.22s)]
*  Oh really? [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2467.22s)]
*  And I said, I eat a lot of sardines. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2468.22s)]
*  He goes, how much? [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2470.3799999999997s)]
*  I go four or five cans a night. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2471.3799999999997s)]
*  And he was like, what? [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2473.14s)]
*  He's like, what the fuck are you doing? [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2474.8199999999997s)]
*  I go, what are you doing? [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2476.7799999999997s)]
*  Well I love sardines. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2478.4599999999996s)]
*  And if I come home from the comedy club and I'm hungry, it's easy to have what I thought [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2479.62s)]
*  was healthy food. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2484.7s)]
*  It's just sardines and olive oil. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2487.18s)]
*  What could be bad about that? [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2488.74s)]
*  And so he said, take a few months off and then come back and let's do this again. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2490.7799999999997s)]
*  And I took a few months off and I came back, no arsenic. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2494.66s)]
*  I was like, oh man. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2497.82s)]
*  He goes, it's not enough to be concerned. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2498.82s)]
*  But you're getting arsenic in your blood from these sardines. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2502.54s)]
*  I work with a guy at Seth and he kind of had this perfect storm where we had been in Hawaii. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2507.82s)]
*  So we had wahoo and yellowfin tuna. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2514.3s)]
*  And he fishes in Alaska. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2518.06s)]
*  So he had all his halibut. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2519.3s)]
*  And then he's got a bunch of walleye that he catches. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2521.14s)]
*  He's a big walleye fisherman that he catches locally. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2523.82s)]
*  And he wound up, there's kind of like a long term mercury deal and a short term mercury [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2526.2200000000003s)]
*  deal. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2533.3s)]
*  But he had mercury poisoning. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2534.3s)]
*  His hands went numb and stuff. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2535.7400000000002s)]
*  And then I got to read about it and there's various cases where, there's this other case [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2538.1s)]
*  that's kind of interesting. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2542.3s)]
*  This guy gets on a cruise ship, never doesn't eat fish. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2543.3s)]
*  This guy doesn't have fish in his diet. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2546.14s)]
*  It was a thing that was covered in the news. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2547.86s)]
*  And he gets on a cruise and they have an all you can eat sushi thing. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2549.98s)]
*  So he wants to get his money's worth. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2553.42s)]
*  And so he's gorging himself on this all you can eat sushi during the course of his cruise [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2554.82s)]
*  and generates mercury poisoning. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2559.1s)]
*  Like a short term version. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2562.94s)]
*  And dudes I hang out with in Hawaii that have access to a lot of big, paciferous fish, they'll [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2565.34s)]
*  sort of like deliberately pace themselves. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2572.38s)]
*  They could live off tuna, right? [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2575.5s)]
*  They'll deliberately pace themselves keeping in mind the amount of that stuff you're getting [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2577.2s)]
*  in. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2581.68s)]
*  And RFK Jr., I had RFK Jr. on the show on our podcast and he had had mercury poisoning. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2582.68s)]
*  From what? [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2591.0s)]

*  Was eating too much canned tuna. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2593.0s)]
*  So maybe I've had it, I don't know. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2596.64s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2598.48s)]
*  Well no, I've had my blood tested. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2599.48s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2601.48s)]
*  But I can't picture. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2602.48s)]
*  The sentiment I have about as a friend of mine who fishes flathead catfish which have, [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2603.56s)]
*  they accumulate a lot of bio, or not bio toxins, they accumulate a lot of heavy metals. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2610.7599999999998s)]
*  And he said, and we were talking about eating this stuff, and he said, if I can eat, if [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2614.92s)]
*  I can catch and eat so many big flatheads that it kills me, I win. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2620.56s)]
*  That was his attitude. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2624.52s)]
*  There's no cases of CWD getting into humans yet, right? [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2630.92s)]
*  No. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2635.88s)]
*  No. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2636.88s)]
*  That's the big fear. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2637.88s)]
*  You and I are on a text chain with Ted Nugent and he's always like trying to... [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2638.88s)]
*  I met Ted's kid last night. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2641.84s)]
*  Which one, Rocko? [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2643.28s)]
*  Rocko. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2644.28s)]
*  Yeah, good kid. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2645.28s)]
*  Ted is always trying to dismiss the concerns of CWD. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2646.28s)]
*  He doesn't believe in it. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2651.88s)]
*  He thinks it's overhyped. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2654.1600000000003s)]
*  It scares the fuck out of me. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2657.28s)]
*  Because it's a prion disease, right? [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2659.28s)]
*  So if it jumps to people, and it has jumped to certain rodent species, isn't that correct? [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2661.28s)]
*  No, right now it's cervids. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2668.28s)]
*  Oh, just cervids? [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2670.28s)]
*  There hasn't been a case of it jumping to a mole or something like that? [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2672.28s)]
*  Well, they did. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2676.28s)]
*  You know when you do, I don't want to get in over my waders here, but I'd love to talk [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2677.28s)]
*  about CWD at length, but sometimes you can do a... [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2682.28s)]
*  If someone does medical research and they'll have a finding, there's a term for it. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2689.28s)]
*  Let's say you have a finding that's alarming, but you haven't done peer review yet. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2694.28s)]
*  Right? [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2698.28s)]
*  But let's say I just all of a sudden made some discovery that had huge implications, [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2699.28s)]
*  and people would need to become immediately aware of what I might have found out, right? [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2703.28s)]
*  There's a term for it where you would release these preliminary findings, even though it [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2709.28s)]
*  hasn't been held up to academic rigor, because it's of such importance. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2716.28s)]
*  A lot of times you don't get to skip that step, but in cases of medical, you get to [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2721.28s)]
*  skip a step and say, hey, hang tight, we're not all the way there yet, but look, this [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2724.28s)]
*  is kind of alarming. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2729.28s)]
*  They had a case, and it all corroded, but these guys had a case where they were able [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2731.28s)]
*  to infect a rhesus monkey with CWD, but then it wasn't replicable, didn't hold up. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2735.28s)]
*  But when things like that happen, they tend to get a ton of media, but then down the road [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2744.28s)]
*  the media doesn't follow suit. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2749.28s)]
*  There's been cases where there was one night long where they were looking at people that [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2751.28s)]
*  had this rare form of dementia, and they found that of these people that had this rare form [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2756.28s)]
*  of dementia, a couple of them were deer hunters who lived in CWD areas. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2760.28s)]
*  So they come out with a, hey everybody, check this out. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2768.28s)]
*  But then it winds up being that when you do a statistical analysis on it, it was no different [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2771.28s)]
*  than anything else. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2776.28s)]
*  There was no reason that it wasn't like they scored higher, that deer hunters scored higher [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2777.28s)]
*  or nothing. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2782.28s)]
*  It's just a certain percentage of people get dementia. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2783.28s)]
*  Yeah, so it's like a certain number of people eat dementia, a certain number of people eat [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2785.28s)]
*  venison, and statistically you're going to have some overlap if you survey enough people. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2788.28s)]
*  So even though they gave like a big heads up, it won't be nothing there. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2793.28s)]
*  But yeah, CWD, it's a highly infectious disease. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2797.28s)]
*  It was first identified in Colorado on a research facility, not a game farm. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2803.28s)]
*  It was first identified on a Servid research facility in Colorado, I believe in the early 70s. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2808.28s)]
*  And then there's been a debate. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2813.28s)]
*  Some people feel that it was always there and wasn't detected. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2817.28s)]
*  And that it wasn't like we found it the minute it came out. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2822.28s)]
*  It was just that it perhaps had been there and then we discovered that it was always there. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2827.28s)]
*  But it does expand its range all the time. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2834.28s)]
*  Even in the last few years, we've had our first cases in Montana. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2839.28s)]
*  And we keep every year we add like without fail every year we find CWD in states where it didn't previously exist. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2842.28s)]
*  Or within states that have CWD, we find CWD in counties that didn't have it. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2851.28s)]
*  Oftentimes you can look and it makes sense because it flows. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2857.28s)]
*  But now and then you get these weird jumps, right? [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2860.28s)]
*  Where something jumps a big moat of inactivity and then all of a sudden you get like a new hotspot. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2863.28s)]
*  And you look and be like, well, how did if it's an infectious disease and deer aren't flying in airplanes, how did it jump? [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2869.28s)]
*  Some of the jumps people tie it to transporting. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2875.28s)]
*  There's a theory that is well accepted in a lot of circles would be that moving Servids, moving deer and elk to penned operations has facilitated the movement of CWD. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2879.28s)]
*  What it used to mean to be is if someone was a CWD denier before, it would be that they denied that it was a thing. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2896.28s)]
*  Like there is no disease called CWD. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2904.28s)]
*  There's generally it's generally accepted now that there's a disease called CWD. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2906.28s)]
*  But now the debate is like is sort of does it matter or not? [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2909.28s)]
*  Right. Our mutual friend Doug Dern is like heavily involved in CWD, combating CWD, trying to get more money spent to understand CWD. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2913.28s)]
*  And they look at you're looking at there's two risks with CWD. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2924.28s)]
*  One risk is it ultimately it's going to lead to like destruction of deer herds, meaning if you get like it's always fatal and if infection rates get to a certain point, we're going to lose deer. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2927.28s)]
*  Right. Like if it's always fatal and you have infection rates of 50 or 60 percent and it takes a couple of years to kill them, like you're going to run out of big bucks because nothing can live long enough. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2938.28s)]
*  The other fear is that it jumps the barrier and becomes a human pathogen. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2948.28s)]
*  You know, so people, you know, all the hunters I know, like the question we always talk about is like, do you do you would you eat CWD positive meat? [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2954.28s)]
*  You know, right. Even if it doesn't jump currently, you know, you take that risk. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2965.28s)]
*  So Yanni zero Yanni was recently with a guy and he's like he's eaten him and his family have eaten for CWD positive deer. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2969.28s)]
*  Man, I couldn't I can't I like I couldn't serve it to my kids. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2977.28s)]
*  No, I wouldn't eat it myself either. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2987.28s)]
*  I can't serve my kids. I don't I have a knowingly eat it. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2989.28s)]
*  But here's the thing. Here's the rub. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2992.28s)]
*  I've said this number before and people like that's not true. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2995.28s)]
*  But it's true. I'm telling you hundreds of thousands of people have eaten CWD positive hundreds of thousands of people have eaten CWD positive meat. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=2997.28s)]
*  I would imagine that's true. Yeah. Yeah. Over many decades. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3005.28s)]
*  Yeah. Right. So at what point do you at what point do you get comfortable? [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3009.28s)]
*  I don't know. It's a dude. It's a tough one. Yeah, it's a tough one. It's a tough one. It can jump. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3017.28s)]
*  It hasn't hasn't. But when you look at the history of these types of diseases, especially pre on diseases like mad cow, pre on disease jumped. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3024.28s)]
*  Yeah. You know the debate between pry on and pre on? No, you know, it's you're ripping off. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3034.28s)]
*  I used to say pry on but then I heard scientists say pre on it. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3039.28s)]
*  Well, the the biologist Jim Heffelfinger, you should that's gonna be a very good guy for you to have on your show someday. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3042.28s)]
*  The biologist Jim Heffelfinger sent me a thing where the guy that named it, the guy that coined the term spelled out phonetically how it's supposed to be pronounced. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3051.28s)]
*  So then I was like, OK, I'm going to stick with pre on now. It's the guy that came up with it says pre on. So that's what it is. And not pry on. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3063.28s)]
*  Yeah. He's like said, he's like, we'll call it this and we'll pronounce it this way. OK. So it's pre on. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3069.28s)]
*  It's now I'm now I'm trying to always try to remember which one it is. And it's yeah, it's pre on. It's scary, dude. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3076.28s)]
*  It's scary, dude. It's scary. And Doug, I said it's 100 times like before, like if I say, man, the main thing I'm worried about is people getting it. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3082.28s)]
*  That pisses Doug off because Doug's worried about that we're going to lose big bucks and people he just like he like he like he wants to shut like he's a he wants to he likes healthy deer. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3094.28s)]
*  Right. And he doesn't want a disease running through his deer herd. It hasn't jumped to cows or anything. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3106.28s)]
*  No. And that's the see that's one area where I'm going to get myself in trouble, Doug, in all kinds of ways, because that's the thing I think about is it's not that there I'm not saying the egg world is complacent. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3111.28s)]
*  Right. I'm not saying they're complacent. Like there's a lot of interest in the agricultural community to understand CWD better. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3123.28s)]
*  But if you look and be like, dude, a cow looks a hell of a lot more like a deer than I do. Right. I'm just going to watch the cow. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3129.28s)]
*  And all of a sudden these cows start getting sick. Then my ass is going to get nervous. Right. But I'm like, they're rubbing noses with these deer. Yeah. And it gets on the grass. It gets on the. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3136.28s)]
*  Sure. And you can't kill that shit. Yeah. I remember some politician was like, well, I'll just cook your deer meat longer. And I was like, well, I can't remember what it is. You can't cook deer meat to 1400 degrees. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3145.28s)]
*  You know, incinerate it or whatever, you know, whatever else becomes. But but yeah, cooking it isn't the thing it can survive. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3155.28s)]
*  That's why if you hunt, there's a lot of restrictions now on moving carcasses around. Right. So more and more states are implementing that when you go home, they don't want you bringing the head home. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3162.28s)]
*  They don't want you bringing the bones home. I also fear for a time and it'd just be terrible if you're for a time where you couldn't bring anything like they really restrict movement. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3172.28s)]
*  You know, right. Like it's easy to like it's very easy to comply with not moving bones. It's easy to comply with not moving brain matter. Like that's easy. Right. Yeah. But picture that this gets out of hand and all of a sudden it's like you can't move venison across county lines. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3181.28s)]
*  I don't know. Right. Like no one's thrown this out there. But as we look at as they look at like further and further restrictions, it's scary. And so from a guy like from from from I don't want to speak for Nugent. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3195.28s)]
*  But from his idea of being overblown is his idea would be like I said, I hate speaking for the guy. It would be that here we are making policy changes, making game management changes, making rule changes, adjusting what you can and can't do in the woods based off the thing that most people be like. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3208.28s)]
*  But we haven't proven there's a problem. That would be his perspective on it. My perspective is it's scary as shit. And I went and as much as our government right now is trying to find a way to stop spending so much money, I support any money that can get spent on finding out if this can be a real problem or not. Yeah. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3230.28s)]
*  Like I that's I'll find other places to get the money. But I'd like to channel taxpayer dollars, billions of them into making sure deer meat stays safe. Well, the thing is that that's my kind of pork barrel. There's no way to eradicate it. Right. Like you there's no way to identify the deer that have it that haven't exhibited symptoms. And they're spreading it. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3245.28s)]
*  Yeah, they're looking at ways to test live animals. Then there's this other cockamamie ideas that one would be that some deer seem to be some deer. Yeah. And so that you'd you'd move these resilient deer into other populations to try to breed in some kind of resiliency, which you know, it's a wild animal. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3269.28s)]
*  Is it ultimately resilient? Because like mad cow disease has there's an incubation period. Right. This is the concern. Like I remember that's the other thing is that we're all like me, everybody. I guarantee I've eaten CWD infected meat. The other concern is we all got it. We just don't know it yet because it takes 10 years. Yeah. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3293.28s)]
*  But they've been tracking these dudes that went to a fire department fundraiser. They had 100 some people that ate a bunch of CWD infected meat at a fire department fundraiser and they keep following up on those people and following up on those people. And they haven't got it. But that's the other thing is this is over a decade ago. So that's the other thing is that we all got it like all these hunters. You know, I don't think this is true. But some people are like all these hunters. They don't know it yet. But it could be that all of a sudden in 10 years, they all start dropping like flies or get developed dementia. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3308.28s)]
*  Oh, I don't it's such a I really think that um, I don't like to see any kind of wildlife disease. Right. Of course. I do believe if you look at prevalence rates and you look at the fact that it's always that it's always fatal, whether or not removing the human question to it, I do think that you will find that it'll become harder to [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3336.28s)]
*  it'll become harder to produce big deer. I worry about that. And it'd be easy to track just go and look at like go and look at boon and Crockett entries over time from all these counties. So go like Buffalo County, Wisconsin, like a famous giant whitetail producing place, right? [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3364.28s)]
*  They get high rates of CWD prevalence. If you put a line on CWD prevalence, and you put a line on boon and Crockett entries, and you're able to track this over many years, we have all this data, do you does it correlate? Does like CWD prevalence, they drive down big bucks? Right? [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3384.28s)]
*  Right? It's like it seems very I'm sure that some I'm sure some mathematician out there has started to try to look at like if it's true, but a lot of people on the ground say that that you do see popular population level impact from CWD. And I'm guessing there's no way it doesn't affect participation. Meaning that people that would like to hunt, and the whole the whole promise of wild meat is you know, you're getting like, really healthy meat, you're able to control the food chain, but then all of a sudden, you're able to control the food chain, but then all of a sudden, you're able to control the food chain, but then all of a sudden, you're able to control the food chain, but then all of a sudden, you're able to control the food chain, but then all of a sudden, you're able to control the food chain, but then all of a sudden, you're able to control the food chain, but then all of a sudden, you're able to control the food chain [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3403.28s)]
*  you throw in this question of like, well, but it could give you a pre on disease. Hypothetically, that's gonna that's gonna dampen people's enthusiasm about deer. And I'd hate to see we get to a point where when when I look at a deer, I look at a deer with like great enthusiasm and love. What happens when we look at deer and we look at them like a disease vector? Right? It doesn't become like, like, do you view it like a rat? Or you see a rat you like recoil? Like, I don't want that shit in my yard. Right? [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3433.28s)]
*  They carry disease, don't they? Your dog could get it. Yeah, like picture down the road that like deer, which are this like universally loved, praised animal, this kind of like symbol of the American outdoorsman becomes like a yeah, that shit out of my yard. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3463.28s)]
*  You know, what is when when Doug talks about, you know, they do a lot of testing in the constant word, a lot of testing. What's the percentage that come up positive, man, they have? I think that on Doug's place, I think that like last year, I don't know if they got all the results from this year, but I think last year they had close to 50% of bucks. Yeah. It's it's it's hovering. It's like very high. And this is fairly recent, like a decade ago. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3478.12s)]
*  They started appearing, right? Yeah, I think that I think that CWD goes back maybe about a decade in his area. He's in Richland County, Richland or Richland. Is he Richland County? Yeah, Richland County, Wisconsin, somewhere in that ballpark. And it's changed. Like, when you were at Doug's place, remember at Doug's place, these have this, these have this slogan, like nice buck next year, meaning, you know, let deer grow, let deer grow. And Doug has really changed. Over the years, he's changed his tune. And they and they've changed his [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3508.12s)]
*  tune. And they really want to try to the idea generally with wildlife managers is that by lowering the slow spread by lowering numbers, right? That if you have, you know, 40 deer per square mile, you're going to have increased spread. And if it was 20 deer per square mile, 30 deer per square mile, you might slow the spread. But no one's demonstrated a lot of success in slowing the spread of CWD. So other hunters will look at it and be like, yeah, you're out there lowering deer numbers. And so there's half as many deer as there is in the state. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3538.12s)]
*  There's half as many deer on the landscape. And CWD still spreads. Right. So so there's a you want to put this question of like, how do you justify trying to suppress deer numbers when you're not demonstrating a lot of success and slowing prevalence? And the whole thing you're afraid of is lowering deer numbers, but you're lowering deer numbers. Right. But it's like a controlled, it's a controlled lowering to slow the spread. But there hasn't been no one has an area to your point. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3568.12s)]
*  You can't go to a county. I don't think if I'm wrong, I'm wrong by maybe one county, but I'm pretty positive I'm not wrong. And this is generally absolutely true. You can't go to a county that had infected deer that no longer has infected deer. No one's gone into a population of deer and eradicated CWD. No one's got no one's gotten rid of it. That's crazy. Has it jumped to moose? Yeah, I think that service. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3598.12s)]
*  So primarily white tailed deer, mule deer, elk, they found it. They've had it transmit to caribou. I should know that because it's got to serve it. So there's no, there's no way it doesn't. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3628.12s)]
*  Numbers like that from not from that. Right. But I'm saying like the thing about moose is there's lower numbers and they don't they don't exist in like packs. Yeah. Yeah. But since it is a server disease, I should know this since it is, I'm assuming they've they've found it in there. I can't think of examples. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3639.92s)]
*  I can't think of mule deer, white tailed deer, elk, caribou. But I can't think of whether or not there's been a positive case of moose and moose have a whole host of problems right now in some areas, particularly in the lower 48, the northern the northern states of the lower 48 between wolf depredation and and then a tick. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3656.92s)]
*  Like a tick is really hammering those moose right now. Someone told me they went hunting and they got a moose and it was just covered in ticks. Yeah, yeah. There's a problem with in this long, [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3677.84s)]
*  long series of mild winters that that's that these extreme colds that would lower these tick numbers down hasn't been happening. So you're having animals literally dying like a lot of moose literally dying from tick infestations. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3686.92s)]
*  Yeah. And then Colorado's becoming like a great oh, here's all the found in moose in many state provinces, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Colorado and Texas. Oh, moose. What? Texas has moose. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3701.72s)]
*  No, no, no. He's relatively small areas in the panhandle in West Texas. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3718.08s)]
*  That that's maybe [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3724.48s)]
*  Yeah, that's that's cock. I have moose in Texas. No, no, I think it's mixing up two things. But it says that there's no CWD has been found in Texas. Right. But the moose in Texas. Yeah. Just Google. Are there moose in Texas? There are not. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3725.68s)]
*  I mean, everything's in Texas in some form of capacity. But no, you're way outside. You're way outside of the native range of moose. Yeah. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3744.12s)]
*  Colorado is becoming like an unexpected is blowing up for moose. Really? Yeah. Yeah. Colorado becomes better. I mean, they've always had moose, but like Colorado is becoming like a premier moose state. When did that happen? Just they just been kicking ass there, you know, up in the high country and more and more moose. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3752.52s)]
*  It's going like a great moose state. And meanwhile, like Maine is really suffering as a moose state. Really? Yeah. So you know, like Maine's whole brand promise, you know, is like around moose and then Colorado is going to steal it. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3767.92s)]
*  No, well, it's difficult to get a tag in Maine, right? That's very hard. Yeah. Yeah. For non resident, especially I supply over there about an apply anymore. Now, what's what's causing the moose decline in Maine? [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3779.8s)]
*  Ticks. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3791.88s)]
*  No ticks dirty little fucking things. So have you ever heard the conspiracy theory about Lyme disease? Yeah. That's a weird one, right? Yeah. It is. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3794.72s)]
*  Seems like there's some legitimate concern there that it might have been a bio weapon that got out of hand. Well, I think after the pandemic, we just went through. I think people are more open to that idea. Yeah, it was widely dismissed by, you know, people that are a little bit more skeptical about conspiracies. But RFJ Jr. He's he believes it. Yeah. Yeah. It's [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3804.12s)]
*  It's very scary. This idea of these fucking eggheads experimenting with diseases and making them more infectious for whatever reason without also developing a cure. Yeah, it is very strange. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3826.12s)]
*  I guess the one justification you'd have is you'd be like, well, by tinkering with it, we'll better understand it. And if it ever happens naturally, we'd be able to combat it. Yeah. How'd that work out? That didn't really work out. That's probably that has to be the story you tell to yourself. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3840.12s)]
*  I think they just make money doing research. And if you're a researcher, you know, like if you're a carpenter, you want to build houses. They say there's too many houses like, come on, fucking need houses. You know, I'm a carpenter, I make houses. If you're a researcher in your field of studies, diseases, viruses, you want to study them. And if the money is involved in some sort of bizarre engineering of these things, which is what they're doing this fucking strange, weird thing. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3855.12s)]
*  And you can't do it in America. You're like China. Okay, we'll do it over there. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3885.12s)]
*  There was a famous buffalo hide hunter. And he had talked about during the great slaughter of the buffalo, he talked about now and then he'd commit himself to to stop. But say he wake up in the morning and off in the distance. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3894.12s)]
*  And he's like, someone else is doing it. So I think that probably with the you know, I'm no pathologist. But as long as someone's tinkering with that shit, everybody wants to tinker with that shit. Yeah. Because you're like, well, I don't know what are they what are they doing over there that that I what am I missing out on? Yeah, if they're doing it, I want to do it. Yeah, I don't want to be the one that looks like a fool. And there's research money. Mm hmm. That's how you get grants. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3907.12s)]
*  Yeah. And you know, I bet you in some ways, the pandemic spawn more of that type of research. You think so? Yeah, because I mean, like, also now, you can make the case of how important it is to understand this stuff. Yeah, but you would also make the case like, hey, how about you fuckheads come up with a cure first? Yeah, start with that. Yeah, start with figuring out how to cure it. Yeah, I can see that. It's just like, there's just not a lot of trust in the medical research. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3935.12s)]
*  I mean, there's been a lot of institutions now. No, there's been there's been an erosion of that for sure. For a good reason. No, I mean, it was a real wake up call for people. They're like, oh, there's not someone with real objective oversight of all this, like doing a really good job of maintaining everything. It's not it's not a really well maintained situation. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3965.12s)]
*  I mean, I was a dude that prior to that, I was a dude that accepted a lot of, I don't know, I accepted a lot of assurances. And then there was a definite like many people. I mean, I'm speaking for most people in the country, man. I feel like, like many people, I gained a new skepticism. Yeah, me too. During the pandemic. Yeah, I joked about it in my special about government authority, a new skepticism about some types of government authority and a new skepticism about the way health information. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=3987.12s)]
*  Yes, the spread. Yeah. It's just one of those things where anything involving money, whenever there's an enormous amount of money involved, and then there's a centralized control of information, like where there's people that have a distribution of information. And then there's also the problem of exonerating people from any responsibility, which is what happened in the 1990s. Or was it the 80s? Whenever they gave them because the vacuuming system was so much more complicated than the vacuuming system. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4016.12s)]
*  And then vaccine manufacturers were saying, listen, we can't manufacture vaccines because too many people are getting injured by them. And we're going to have so much liability that we're not going to be able to make manufactured vaccines anymore unless you give us immunity to prosecute. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4046.12s)]
*  Yeah. And so they gave it to them. And then all of a sudden, you're getting 72 vaccines. And so you're getting you're giving children hepatitis V, hepatitis B for babies, which is just fucking crazy, a sexually transmitted disease for babies. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4060.12s)]
*  Like, what are you doing? Like, why are you doing that? Are you doing it because you can? And because the more vaccines you give kids, the more money you make. And you're not responsible. You don't have to pay off anything. You don't get sued. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4073.12s)]
*  Which is just you can't do that with these fucking corporations. They're just too evil. They are sociopaths. They act like sociopaths. They lie about studies. They lie about side effects. They minimize their responsibility and they profit immensely. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4084.12s)]
*  And they continue to do so as long as they're not punished. And that's that's the business that they're in. Yeah, I get the frustration. But I mean, at the same time, like I've been the recipient of. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4102.12s)]
*  I've been the recipient of like remedies offered by Western medicine, remedies offered by Western medicine for diseases caused by science. Yeah, you possibly you are. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4114.12s)]
*  Yeah, you are a lot of disease. Yeah, some things like if you will know, take a take a natural thing like Giardia. The these are, you know, I don't think anyone's arguing about that. But I mean, like you get sick of shit. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4124.12s)]
*  Oh, listen, then all of a sudden you take a pill and you're quick. No one's arguing that medicine isn't amazing. Medicine's amazing. But the problem with medicine is you got your scientists and your medical researchers and then you got your money people. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4136.12s)]
*  Right. And the money people, they don't even know how to make any of this medicine. They just know to sell it. Yeah. How do I sell it? I sell it by, you know, like that's like Remdesivir where they were selling Remdesivir during the the covid crisis. Remdesivir is fucking horrible. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4150.12s)]
*  What does that one kidney failure? They stopped prescribing. Oh, no, I remember that one. Fouchy was selling it to everybody. You need to take Remdesivir and everybody was dying. That's your impersonation. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4165.12s)]
*  Horrible kidney failure. Yeah, that fucking creep. Read that book. The Real Anthony Fauci by R.F.K. Junior. It's a crazy book. Yeah, I have, you know, I have set my body. Seth was reading that book and we got moose hunting by and read it. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4176.12s)]
*  That book will change your opinion on a lot of shit. Yeah, that's a crazy book. And if it's not true, he would be sued. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4192.12s)]
*  It's a good point. You get a cease and desist. Well, it's all documented. I mean, it's all backed up by like rock solid information. It's all like very well documented. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4199.12s)]
*  What actually happened during the AIDS crisis, what actually happened during the covid crisis. It's all, it's all legitimate. It's all easy to research. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4211.12s)]
*  It's just scary that these people that you you don't want to have to think about that stuff all the time. You want to just live your life and trust these. Oh, this is the medical institution. They're here to help us to make us feel better. Yeah. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4218.12s)]
*  But no, a lot of them are just there to make money. But I held that sentiment. Me too. No, me too. Till four years ago. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4230.12s)]
*  Four years ago. A lot changed. I'm fucking super skeptical now. I'm also super skeptical of the herd mindset that people fall into whenever there's some sort of a pandemic when there's a high level of anxiety. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4236.12s)]
*  A lot of people fall into this herd mindset. Yeah, that scares the shit out of me, too, because there's just a lot of people that are cowards and they're afraid to they're afraid of public humiliation, public, you know, public criticism. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4251.12s)]
*  They're afraid of getting ostracized from the community if they don't follow suit like everybody else is doing. And so then they start to try to enforce it on everybody else. It's like the people that we yell at everybody else. Where's your mask? [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4267.12s)]
*  Put your mask on. Like, you know, there's people I went to a restaurant the other night. The fucking guy served me had a mask on like I would fire this guy. I would not like you can't. This is nonsense. You can't be wearing a fucking mask. This is crazy. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4276.12s)]
*  I read an op ed in the free press the other day. You know, Barry Weiss's publication. And it was about when they had rolled back. They had rolled back on masking laws. I kind of forgot all about this. Like you should not be able to run around with a mask on. Yeah, because of like criminal activity. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4289.12s)]
*  Yeah. So one of these one of these dudes that pushed a pushed a person from a subway. It was must have been premeditated to some degree because hood and mask. Right. Yeah. So you can't identify them on security footage. Right. And the dude that shot that health care insurance CEO like masked. But you don't think anything of it. Right. So this this person was arguing in some capacity there. They were arguing that we need to move back to anti masking. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4308.12s)]
*  Yeah. I get the sentiment. But I also thought like if you had at a time prior to the pandemic if you had told me that there was restrictions on wearing a mask. You know, I would have thought I would have been surprised about that because it seems like how can you dictate to someone that you have a like a little stagecoach robber bandana on your face. Yeah. I mean, it's like a weird it's like a weird joke. I mean, I think it's like a weird joke. I think it's like a weird joke. I think it's like a weird joke. I think it's like a weird joke. I think it's like a weird joke. I think it's like a weird joke. I think it's like a weird joke. I think it's like a weird joke. I think it's like a weird joke. I think it's like a weird joke. I think it's like a weird joke. I think it's like a weird joke. I think it's like a weird joke. I think it's like a [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4336.12s)]
*  weird thing. Can you really can you really tell people that they can't wear a mask, but this person's saying you could. We did. And now that you know, now you've granted like criminals some level of anonymity by that. You can just kind of like you're cool to walk around. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4366.12s)]
*  Totally obscured. Well, it's also you're dealing with people that have severe anxiety if they think that that mask is actually going to protect them.

*  I could picture you as well really feeling like how could you legislate? [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4579.96s)]
*  It's a public safety thing obscuring your face. Yeah, well, we identify there's no public there's no public safety and skirts [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4583.8s)]

*  Like come on, you should be able to wear whatever you want to wear [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4613.32s)]
*  I don't care about that [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4615.72s)]
*  But I care about public safety like you you shouldn't be able to cover your face where you can't be identified if you commit a crime [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4617.0s)]
*  There's we've we've all agreed to that like that's just ridiculous [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4623.8s)]
*  It used to be a thing that you couldn't do you couldn't walk into a store with a bank robber mask on [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4626.84s)]
*  It used to be if you walked into a bank with a mask on people would freak out [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4631.56s)]
*  And now if you during the pandemic price start shooting at you [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4635.64s)]
*  You walk into a bank without a mask people get angry put your mask on [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4639.56s)]
*  It's like we lost our mind [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4643.64s)]
*  But the thing is they should have realized it very early on that there's no science to it [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4645.48s)]
*  And there was a doctor who pointed this out very early on in the pandemic and we highlighted it and people were very upset at us [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4649.959999999999s)]
*  This doctor was talking he was a virologist and he was saying do you know how ridiculous this is? [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4656.759999999999s)]
*  Let me show you yeah, and he used a vape [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4661.5599999999995s)]
*  So he took a big hit of a vape [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4664.5199999999995s)]
*  He put a mask on and he blew vape smoke through and he's like the particles in vape are so much larger [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4665.959999999999s)]
*  Than these virus particles if you're breathing through this mask if this mask allows you to take in air [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4673.88s)]
*  You're taking the virus if it allows you to blow out air you're blowing out the virus. Shut the fuck up [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4680.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, this is just stupid. This is just pretending [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4685.64s)]
*  And in the beginning I was like, okay [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4689.240000000001s)]
*  everybody just wants you to be a good person you wear the mask, but it's [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4690.84s)]
*  It's so weird because during the the crisis we all uh, we did ufc fights and the ufc fights [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4695.160000000001s)]
*  The corner men used to have to wear masks [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4702.92s)]
*  So like i'll see like highlights from like 2021 and you see like the corner with the mouth like god [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4705.48s)]

*  Cover your nose. Oh, yeah. Okay, like is it mad? [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4715.72s)]
*  This just really works and you couldn't walk into a store like this people go. That's not good enough. This is not good enough [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4718.92s)]
*  I forgot my mask. What do you want me to do? This is the same goddamn thing. Like what are we doing? Can I just [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4724.84s)]

*  Zero, there's no difference [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4737.32s)]
*  It's so stupid [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4739.56s)]
*  I went through two years like needing to yell at my kids all the time [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4741.24s)]
*  Because if you travel with your kids and they never got the stupid things on, you know [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4744.84s)]
*  you're like, but then you're not even you're not even yelling at them about that if they're going to prevent them from [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4748.12s)]
*  You're not saving them from a disease. You're saving them from being ostracized and yelled at by the flight attendant [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4753.64s)]
*  You spent two years being like put your damn mask on put your mask on [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4759.4800000000005s)]
*  I don't think it works. No one it's not about whether it works. You just got to do it to not get in trouble [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4763.4800000000005s)]

*  Yeah, you put this on they feel okay. It's not going to be forever [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4781.72s)]

*  But I would be surprised there's one hiding somewhere [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4802.76s)]
*  It was one of the things that sanjay gupta brought on brought up when I did that podcast with him [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4805.0s)]

*  And they want to lie and distort things and gaslight the whole population and then somehow or another [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4889.400000000001s)]

*  hundreds of millions and billions of dollars on advertising and [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4899.219999999999s)]
*  On on television and so now the television networks will never criticize them because they get all this fuck [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4904.44s)]
*  You know, this is like the argument about advertising for pharmaceutical drugs [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4910.5199999999995s)]
*  You know, we're the only country other than new zealand in the whole world that allows pharmaceutical drugs to advertise [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4915.24s)]
*  Was that right? Yeah, it's just us in new zealand new zealand's far more restrictive than us [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4921.56s)]
*  But our the way our system is set up all these television networks cnn nbc cbs abc [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4925.8s)]
*  They all rely on a giant percentage of their advertising budget comes from pharmaceutical drugs [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4933.240000000001s)]
*  And don't you just love those ads but it's not but here's the thing. It's not to sell more drugs [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4939.08s)]
*  It's so that those people will never criticize those drugs. Yeah, nice. Yeah, i'm familiar with the argument [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4944.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, the ads are great. Yeah, it's like something it'll always be some dude just kicking ass [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4949.0s)]

*  You're like that's something that's getting lucky, you know [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4965.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's like ask your doctor if such and such you're like shit [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4966.76s)]
*  I want to kick ass like that old guy and then they read off the side effects the side effects at the end suicidal thoughts [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4969.72s)]
*  powerful diarrhea like oh god [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4976.36s)]

*  You know whenever you involve money in things money profit and the ability to lie [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4988.28s)]
*  You know, you get a lot of real shady things it what frustrates me already is it's going to be impossible to [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=4992.92s)]
*  Explain it like now I can't it's very hard to explain the 9-eleven terror attacks to my kids [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5001.4s)]
*  You know and I want to be when they make [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5007.4s)]
*  In 10 years 20 years, whatever when they make a docu series [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5011.16s)]
*  On this on the covet 19 [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5016.599999999999s)]

*  Like I I if I I would like to go into a time machine and go forward and see how it is told later [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5032.76s)]
*  Yeah, you know like we'll watch now, you know, watch documentary now, you know, you watch something about the cuban missile crisis, right? [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5039.24s)]
*  But you just picture dudes that were active during the cuban missile crisis [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5045.48s)]
*  or like no [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5050.12s)]
*  Right, right. They're gonna be there's even a term. There's a term. It's called [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5051.8s)]
*  Um [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5055.08s)]
*  Gel uh, some gel syndrome [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5060.76s)]
*  Maybe jamie can look it up for us. What's the term about? [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5063.72s)]
*  It's the it's the alpha no, not the alpha gel syndrome [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5066.68s)]
*  Alpha gal is the no, it's not alpha gal. It's something gel. The syndrome is this [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5071.0s)]
*  There's no amnesia [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5075.88s)]
*  Something gel gel gel type in gel amnesia if you don't mind it's killing me [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5077.5599999999995s)]
*  Gel man amnesia [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5083.4s)]
*  It's that let's say you're let's say you're just seeing something you have a lot of subject matter expertise in [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5085.719999999999s)]
*  Okay, so let's say you're reading you joe are reading uh, and then someone's analysis explaining like here's what's up with with um mixed martial arts [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5091.08s)]
*  Okay, an outsider an outside journalist who is assigned to do a piece and they do a piece like what's up with mixed martial arts, right? [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5100.12s)]
*  And you read it and what's probably the main thing you're gonna be thinking the whole time [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5107.24s)]
*  Does this guy know what he's talking about? Yeah, you're gonna be like that that's totally not right. That's not the conversation [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5111.4800000000005s)]
*  Right, right. That's not what that is [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5116.4400000000005s)]
*  Right, you missed the point like do you notice that everything you read we know a lot about it [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5118.6s)]
*  Let's say let's say you read a piece of reporting and it's a reporting about the podcast industry, right where it came from how it's monetized [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5122.280000000001s)]
*  Mostly what you're going to feel [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5129.56s)]
*  Is that's not what that is right? That's incorrect. Right? Well this form of amnesia is that you forget that [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5131.72s)]
*  So then later you're reading an article about a thing you don't know well [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5138.76s)]
*  Mm, right [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5142.84s)]
*  And you're like you feel like you're getting the straight dope, right? Right, right [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5144.84s)]
*  But someone somewhere who knows the world well is reading it and they're having the same feeling you have every time you read about something [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5148.84s)]
*  You know well, which is this person has no idea what they're talking about, right? [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5155.48s)]
*  So you fall in the trap that the amnesia is you forget [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5159.16s)]
*  And you take things you're not aware of and when you get the dope on them from someone you're forgetting how [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5162.04s)]
*  Fucked up everything is the when when you do know about it [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5168.6s)]
*  Well, the hope is that with ai in these large language models is that ai will be able to distribute information [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5172.12s)]
*  Objectively without that and that is the case in a lot of situations where they haven't been they haven't been corrected yet [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5180.26s)]
*  like [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5188.12s)]
*  Ai is subject to human influence. Obviously like i'm sure if you're aware of the google gemini situation [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5189.24s)]
*  The google gemini situation is the best one because they said, you know [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5195.88s)]
*  Create images of nazis and they had multicultural nazis. Yeah, but [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5200.5199999999995s)]
*  If it has to analyze information about specific things just based on just what's actually available [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5207.08s)]
*  oftentimes it will give you a very [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5215.219999999999s)]
*  Accurate assessment that you wouldn't get from a newspaper because the newspaper would be more [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5219.08s)]
*  They would be more interested in adhering to whatever particular ideology they subscribe to [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5225.32s)]
*  Yeah, so they would flavor things through an ideology and probably gaslight you a little bit about the other side's perspective [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5229.96s)]
*  Yeah [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5236.679999999999s)]
*  The the the hope is that in the future with large language models and especially as they become more and more sophisticated [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5237.48s)]
*  You're going to be able to get an accurate objective assessment of things that doesn't have any human influence. Oh man, I don't [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5244.9400000000005s)]
*  Dude, come on. Is it impossible? [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5251.900000000001s)]
*  Oh, it's possible with some the hope or it's possible, but no, I I don't have like sure possible [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5254.38s)]
*  I don't picture that being the case [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5260.14s)]
*  well [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5262.22s)]
*  There are some large language models that aren't fucked with [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5263.660000000001s)]
*  especially open source ones [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5267.900000000001s)]
*  The problem is they're they're essentially drawing from the entire internet, right? [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5269.98s)]
*  So you you would have to assess like where these [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5275.339999999999s)]
*  Large language models are getting their information from sure and making sure that they're so this is the thing [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5278.86s)]
*  you could kind of game that system by [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5283.5s)]
*  Rigging these large language models to accentuate information that comes from more biased sources [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5286.62s)]
*  You know, you could distort the information that people and someone would be [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5293.66s)]
*  Someone would be motivated to do it. Yeah until [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5298.22s)]
*  They get so sophisticated that they would be able to discern that and they would be able to base it entirely on [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5302.14s)]
*  objective analysis of statistics and facts [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5308.76s)]
*  And understand what these statistics are [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5312.38s)]
*  I did this little this little event last night at this place here in town called arena hall [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5315.02s)]
*  and um [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5320.3s)]
*  The moderator of the event it was like a q a or you know chat [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5321.5s)]
*  And he was asking me like as a writer as an author [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5326.14s)]
*  What are your fears about ai? [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5329.98s)]
*  And like ai is like in the very short term like ai is coming for like certain types of writing [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5333.02s)]
*  like certain types of writing are going to be made obsolete by ai, yeah, but [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5339.34s)]
*  The reason I have the reason I don't worry about it [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5345.34s)]
*  as of now as a writer is like it's always going to be representative of [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5348.62s)]
*  It's always going to be representative of input [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5354.14s)]
*  Right like like the input has to come in from people who are out digesting real experience, right? [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5357.66s)]
*  Right, it'll get faster [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5363.58s)]
*  You know the point I use is if you earlier Tom [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5365.26s)]
*  alluded to like the assassination on [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5368.700000000001s)]
*  Attempt on trump the day before that had you asked ai about details about it [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5371.66s)]
*  It doesn't exist right like the whole thing gets fed in [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5375.66s)]
*  So if you if you remain on some level of cutting edge about thought or cutting edge about analysis [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5378.54s)]
*  Or cutting edge about what's going on in the world? [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5383.820000000001s)]
*  um, you'll have to start being more careful about being like that your work remains at the vanguard of feeding into [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5386.46s)]
*  the system of newness [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5394.780000000001s)]
*  Right. Yeah, and that's going to be like a big challenge. Um [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5397.34s)]
*  Like a big challenge as a writer, but I remember coming up as a writer too in the old days and being super scared of the internet [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5401.740000000001s)]
*  in general [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5406.700000000001s)]
*  Right and and I was like man this ain't gonna be good [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5408.14s)]
*  For a writer [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5412.46s)]
*  Well, you know they thought about that with the printing press. I'm sure yeah [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5413.9800000000005s)]
*  I'm sure with the early books. Do you know what most of the early books were about? [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5417.580000000001s)]
*  Those monks transcribing them, but I don't know when the printing press was produced mathematics. Maybe no how to spot witches [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5421.660000000001s)]
*  Oh, really? Yeah, that was a hot topic. It was all about witches and witchcraft. Yeah, how to spot sorcery [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5428.9400000000005s)]
*  No, I didn't know that. Yeah, it was a lot of bullshit [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5434.06s)]
*  You would think like oh it's just knowledge and information [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5436.620000000001s)]
*  Finally the world's gonna know the truth. No, no, no, no, I had no idea. It's a lot of like how to spot witches [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5440.860000000001s)]
*  They were the most popular books. Yeah, but I think that like, um creators. Yeah [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5445.580000000001s)]
*  from a like a creator perspective [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5452.22s)]
*  You got ones that that run away from new [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5455.660000000001s)]
*  Right and you got ones that run toward it. Yeah, I used to be the run away from [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5459.26s)]
*  I used to something came out and I was like this ain't good. What are you now? [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5464.78s)]
*  I [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5469.74s)]
*  I guess i've like survived through enough changes in the media landscape that I i'm not as terrified as I once was [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5471.66s)]
*  Right. Yeah, like, you know, I always said like the first time I heard the word podcast was in the context of your name, right? [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5479.66s)]

*  Yeah scared of incoming. Well, most people were in especially podcasts. It seemed so ridiculous. Most people thought it was stupid [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5505.58s)]
*  Yeah, and you even said you you were doing them and thought it was stupid [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5513.34s)]
*  Well, I did it because I thought it was fun, yeah exactly and then you know after a while I was like [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=5517.179999999999s)]

*  And they go up there to trap for the winter and their whole plan is to live off caribou [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6004.5199999999995s)]
*  But the caribou never come through and the youngest one keeps this meticulous journal [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6007.48s)]
*  Um [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6012.6s)]
*  In this book he keeps this meticulous journal and he documents with painstaking detail the two people he's with starving to death [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6014.2s)]
*  and [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6022.6s)]
*  himself [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6023.64s)]
*  eventually starving to death [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6024.76s)]
*  He lets off at a point. It's unclear when he died [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6027.240000000001s)]
*  He had the wherewithal to put the journal in the stove [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6029.320000000001s)]
*  And to make a sign that said look in the stove and when they found him a couple years later [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6032.2s)]
*  They were able to find his journal [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6035.400000000001s)]
*  but [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6037.16s)]
*  Uh, it got so bad that they're like crushing animal bone [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6037.96s)]
*  um [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6042.4400000000005s)]
*  Which is which is a thing that's on the top of this with this donner party deal [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6043.88s)]
*  I was working on is these guys are crushing [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6047.64s)]
*  animal bone [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6050.92s)]
*  and boiling it [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6052.280000000001s)]
*  To get some kind of nutritive value out of crushed animal bone and they're eating animal hide [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6054.280000000001s)]
*  Okay, like you scrape away the hair [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6059.4800000000005s)]
*  And you can boil animal skins and and eat them. I've done that and just makes like a gelony kind of tasteless [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6062.68s)]
*  Like leather noodle basically [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6070.28s)]
*  um [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6072.599999999999s)]
*  And what he's documenting as they're dying from this [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6073.48s)]
*  Is um the horrible bowel obstruction [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6077.16s)]
*  And they're trying to make like in his journal. He's describing this of trying to make these um [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6080.599999999999s)]
*  These enema devices [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6086.04s)]
*  And even for a while on each other trying to perform like an operation on each other each other [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6088.2s)]
*  Because that bone fragment that they're they're boiling that bone fragment and drinking [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6093.96s)]
*  It but that bone fragment in their bowel is like [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6099.32s)]
*  Reforming oh [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6103.54s)]
*  into bone plugs [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6105.24s)]
*  And even when they find these guys [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6107.32s)]
*  years later a guy from the [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6110.12s)]
*  Canadian mounted police is like doing this very you know [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6111.799999999999s)]
*  Like a basically a crime scene description of what went on in here and still laying there a couple years later is a plate [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6114.84s)]
*  Full of like solidified excrement. Oh god, everything else rotted away. These guys are just skeletons, but that like bone shit [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6121.16s)]
*  Oh [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6129.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6130.92s)]
*  And you look at like [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6133.08s)]
*  You and I just finished this book the other day and um [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6136.12s)]
*  So you look and be like oh they're starving death starving death [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6139.5599999999995s)]
*  But like when you starve that all this stuff is actually going on and it like that had to have been fatal [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6142.2s)]
*  And we were working on you know mo who's been on the show. We've been working on this project, which i'm you know [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6147.08s)]
*  Wanting to plug but we did an episode on the doner party [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6152.759999999999s)]
*  Um who died up in the mountains in california and the doner party, uh, in addition to the cannibals and they're famous for it [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6156.4400000000005s)]
*  It was so crazy because before I read that book [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6162.84s)]
*  We're hearing all about that the members of the doner party were eating the crushed bone [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6166.280000000001s)]
*  And eating the boiled hides on the other thing is all those hair follicles [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6170.52s)]
*  um [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6175.400000000001s)]
*  Would form into dense balls that would like plug your rectum [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6176.68s)]
*  Oh [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6180.92s)]
*  And he's just describing all this as they die it's horrible [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6181.88s)]
*  but that dude randy brown gave me that book because you could tell that in his mind man like [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6184.76s)]
*  like [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6189.5599999999995s)]
*  Starving out like it stuck with him, you know, and he's walking around handing out a book about starving to death in the arctic, you know [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6190.9s)]
*  Because he knew it well [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6198.44s)]
*  But that was like in that same thing like doner party being like known for the cannibalism and all that [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6199.5599999999995s)]
*  Is um all those people die and probably like a lot of the same thing [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6204.12s)]
*  Eating that hide and hair and crushed bone just miserable [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6207.88s)]
*  People have a very delusional [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6213.240000000001s)]
*  Perspective when it comes to like surviving living off the land. Oh how difficult it would be oh [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6215.96s)]
*  In talking to him when he talked about that guy that struck off like this is after a long time. He spent in the bush [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6223.0s)]
*  He talked about the guy that struck off and the guy struck off with a 22 pistol [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6228.84s)]
*  and uh [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6232.92s)]
*  randy's like [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6234.12s)]
*  um [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6235.400000000001s)]
*  Um, you cannot in that environment. You cannot survive with a 22 pistol [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6237.16s)]
*  Like he just knows it categorically. You cannot survive with a 22 pistol [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6242.6s)]
*  And the dude didn't [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6246.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah, how could you? [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6248.12s)]
*  Yeah, well you people would probably think that there's such a badass they would but he's like, you know [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6249.64s)]
*  Do you have I don't know? [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6253.8s)]
*  I don't know how many you had but he said you won't you won't make it and he made a point that 22 pistol [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6255.16s)]
*  When they found that body that 22 pistols hanging on a peg inside [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6259.56s)]
*  Hanging on a peg inside the cabin where he found him. I mean there's no way you'd have enough ammunition even with a pistol [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6263.4800000000005s)]
*  You're limited in your range. You're limited in your accuracy. No, they did everything with 243s [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6270.040000000001s)]
*  In those years that he did that and they would load like variable loads [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6277.56s)]
*  Why variable loads? He'd make light loads and heavy loads. Okay for different animals [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6282.68s)]
*  Yeah, they'd make little grouse loads and shit and they'd load their big game bullets, you know all the 243 [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6286.360000000001s)]
*  Hunting moose for the 243 caribou the 243 [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6293.320000000001s)]
*  Where's he getting all the gunpowder? Where's he getting they were loading their own stuff? Wow [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6297.080000000001s)]
*  So you'd have to go somewhere to get resupply [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6301.160000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they would they had a camp that one of their camps they had a reloading station [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6304.6s)]
*  The various guys that live in the bush would kind of come in there and use that reloading station [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6308.68s)]
*  And that john the baptist dude looted that reloading station [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6312.84s)]
*  Yeah, you gotta kill those guys [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6317.4800000000005s)]
*  Those guys that cause you to starve to death, you know if you're in that kind of an environment and someone's a mooch no [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6319.959999999999s)]
*  But you know what's weird is about it that someone point out to me later [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6326.5199999999995s)]
*  I think john the baptist like john the baptist from the bible. I think john the baptist starved to death [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6329.719999999999s)]
*  really so [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6334.44s)]
*  That's like a little bit of a confusion is [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6336.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, how would that be? Yeah, there's this dude. There's this kid. I probably told you about him this this french kid etienne brÃ»lÃ©e [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6340.12s)]
*  Um [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6347.56s)]
*  that the french brought over [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6348.92s)]
*  and like uh [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6350.76s)]
*  He's known as etienne brÃ»lÃ©e and the french brought him over during the colonial era and gave him to the tribes [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6351.8s)]
*  So he learned their language [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6356.6s)]
*  and eventually he gets crossways with the hieron indians and the hieron indians killed them and [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6358.360000000001s)]
*  Allegedly ate him [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6365.0s)]
*  So everybody knows him as etienne brÃ»lÃ©e, but which is burnt, right? [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6367.160000000001s)]
*  But did he get the name after or before? [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6372.04s)]
*  Like what was it a self-fulfilling prophecy? Yeah, like like so you're like well home [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6376.6s)]
*  Did he just happen like he presumably got burned to death or boiled or whatever, you know [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6380.52s)]
*  So it's like is he etienne brÃ»lÃ©e because of what happened to him or was he running around with that moniker? [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6384.92s)]
*  And then like lo and behold so the john the baptist thing is baffling to me [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6390.200000000001s)]
*  Did john the baptist in the bible i'm not familiar. Did he definitely starved? [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6394.52s)]
*  Can you find no people keep telling me that beheaded? Yeah. Oh, he's oh he didn't starve [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6398.280000000001s)]
*  That the word on the streets is beheaded in prison the word on the streets [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6403.48s)]
*  When someone was sent someone sent me this big passage talking about his emaciated state [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6407.16s)]
*  Maybe he was emaciated before they cut his head off. Yeah, don't worry about it. They were saving him from a [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6413.16s)]
*  Fate worse than death. Yeah, can I talk about my project? Sure, please do well, uh, i'm working out with moe [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6417.639999999999s)]

*  And then after bourdain's death there was this kind of uh, I don't know man [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6448.04s)]
*  Almost like this like exodus of talent like all these people that worked on that great show [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6451.96s)]

*  But it's kind of like what happened? [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6480.679999999999s)]
*  um [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6482.679999999999s)]
*  Could it have gone differently like what mistakes were made? [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6484.28s)]
*  And most of these mysteries that we do are things that I have that most people have some awareness around [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6487.879999999999s)]
*  Right, like you you've heard you've at least heard of it. I think that people think about the doner party for instance [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6493.24s)]
*  Just take an example [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6497.48s)]
*  um [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6498.92s)]
*  You make people make when they're making a joke about cannibalism [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6499.879999999999s)]
*  You'd be like oh the doner party [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6504.04s)]
*  You know, I mean like people don't realize what happened there but [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6505.96s)]
*  And and going to that place [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6509.16s)]
*  Uh, I think I never realized about it that that [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6511.639999999999s)]
*  There was 90 people that got stranded in the sierra nevada that winter 1846 to 1847 [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6515.4s)]
*  um [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6521.24s)]
*  A thing that you never ever realized and it changes everything i've ever thought about it half of those more than half of those were kids [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6522.04s)]
*  Oh my god. Yeah, you don't think about it that way, right? It's mostly children [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6529.16s)]
*  and you get into all this wild stuff about it like uh [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6534.5199999999995s)]
*  You're trying to keep your kids alive [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6537.879999999999s)]
*  Yeah, right. So there's this sort of like, uh, early I said i'll talk you know [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6540.599999999999s)]
*  Touch on cannibalism. I saw my randy brown making that cannibalism pact [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6544.5199999999995s)]
*  um [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6548.36s)]
*  You're trying to keep your kids alive [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6549.799999999999s)]
*  and the kids [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6552.2s)]
*  By and large the kids survived the kids survived at a much higher rate than adults and out of adults that survived [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6553.879999999999s)]
*  parents [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6561.4s)]
*  Did better [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6563.719999999999s)]
*  Parents were more likely to survive [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6565.719999999999s)]
*  They when they sent a little subgroup off to try to go get help [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6567.799999999999s)]
*  A lot of the people died on the way of trying to get help parents lived parents who had kids back at the main camp survived [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6571.56s)]
*  So it's this whole weird thing about like the psychology of why keep going on [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6578.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I mean and then like you think about it from that angle like if your kids were faced with starving to death [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6582.280000000001s)]
*  You would absolutely feed your kids [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6588.52s)]
*  human meat [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6591.56s)]
*  Yeah [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6593.08s)]
*  100. Yeah, right [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6593.88s)]
*  So you look at it like this american horror story, but in the end like oh those 90 people like half lived [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6596.04s)]
*  You know half of them survived and they just they did [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6602.28s)]
*  They always did just like what they needed to to live [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6607.400000000001s)]
*  You know, but then there's like the those families still carry the stigma [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6610.68s)]
*  Of course, you know, it's like it's terrible stigma. But like getting into that like getting into that story and starting to [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6615.64s)]
*  um [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6622.6s)]
*  Realize that and then following that up with reading that book about like the pain and anguish of of starving to death [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6624.28s)]
*  like [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6630.36s)]
*  You wind up like having just more. Uh, I want to have a lot more empathy [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6631.32s)]
*  and just [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6636.2s)]
*  you know, um [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6637.8s)]
*  But you almost kind of want to honor those people [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6640.04s)]
*  Rather than condemn them as like these like like I said, it's like an american horror story [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6642.04s)]
*  You can't condemn them. We would all have done the exact same thing to condemn them. It's just so [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6645.88s)]
*  So [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6650.36s)]
*  That it's it's a horrible way to look at it [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6651.5599999999995s)]
*  No, it's a survival story. I mean human beings will like it's like those uh soccer players that got [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6655.32s)]
*  Yeah in the plane crash or do you know the story of the two boats that tried to make their way across the arctic? [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6662.36s)]
*  It was like was it um, was the terror and another boat? There's a netflix [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6669.16s)]
*  Uh, yeah, but the netflix series is like a horror series [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6675.320000000001s)]
*  They bring in like a mystical monster and stuff and got it and the people all resort to cannibalism [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6680.52s)]
*  But they tried to make it across this path and they got frozen in in their boats and they were waiting in the spring for the [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6685.88s)]
*  The ice to thaw and it never thawed and they got stuck there and they tried to walk out [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6693.88s)]

*  Yeah, and in the donner party they would have times [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6706.52s)]
*  In some of these cases they had a little system where you would not where you would keep the carcasses separate [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6709.64s)]
*  So that people didn't have to eat their own kin [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6714.92s)]

*  You go look you go dive down and look at ships that are 100 years old 200 years old looks like you could refurbish things [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6967.48s)]
*  Really, you know, except the rule one is get broke up by ice [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6973.16s)]
*  Yeah, so that ship's laying around. Wow, i'd like to tell you we found it [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6976.04s)]
*  Oh god, I hung out with a bunch of dudes that are looking for it the lakes are so big [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6980.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I hung out with dudes that are looking for it [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6984.360000000001s)]
*  And now people are getting really good at it because all the sophisticated sonar that's why they're finding all this crazy shit [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6986.200000000001s)]
*  I don't think people understand how big the great lakes are. No, they're literally like oceans. No, they're so big [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6991.080000000001s)]
*  Especially when you add them all together, you know, yeah in places pretty deep [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6997.0s)]
*  But yeah, they're littered with stuff man and dudes like there's just there's just common dudes now that can buy really sophisticated sonar [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=6999.8s)]
*  And underwater cameras and people are just finding stuff like mad [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7006.679999999999s)]
*  Oh now there's more sophisticated technology. Yeah, because you just cruise around you can just cut grids on sonar [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7010.84s)]
*  So you got dudes that are out there just identifying wreck after wreck after wreck right now [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7015.639999999999s)]
*  That's why there's a lot of enthusiasm that someone's going to turn this boat up, but it has these big cannons [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7019.48s)]
*  It should have these big french-built cannons and until someone finds the cannons [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7025.08s)]
*  No one's going to buy what you're saying [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7029.719999999999s)]
*  Cannons. Yeah, they yeah lasalle brought cannons from europe mounted them on the boat [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7031.8s)]
*  So like to in case someone was using it he was braided pirates. Did they have pirates back? They did [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7036.36s)]
*  But also they just would you know, try to intimidate native american tribes and you know, they'd get them into the fur trade [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7040.84s)]
*  But also there's like rogue people and you're also at that time the french are duking it out with [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7046.28s)]
*  English had a big toe hold up in hudson bay [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7051.48s)]
*  Um, so you got the english there you got the spanish to the south just a ton of conflict and people still trying to duke it [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7054.36s)]
*  Out over who's going to control the great lakes? [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7060.28s)]
*  So there's this argument too, which is crazy like picture if we had a picture if we had a naval vessel that sank off france [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7062.84s)]
*  Right now [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7068.679999999999s)]
*  It's not france's it's not france's [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7069.88s)]
*  Boat right, right because we have all these agreements in place. It's like our boat [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7073.48s)]
*  So they would have to hand it over to this is flying under our flag. It's it remains our vessel. There's this argument that um [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7077.719999999999s)]
*  La salle ship was flying under a french flag [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7084.82s)]
*  Whoever finds that ship there's an argument that the french would be able to claim that ship [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7088.52s)]
*  So even if some dude like some freelancer was to find it and find those cannons and shit and finds this ship [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7093.0s)]
*  There's an argument that the french could say we'll take it from here son [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7098.68s)]
*  Whoa, yeah, it's flying under our flag and our international treaties mean that that's our boat [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7101.88s)]
*  Hmm, which would decentivize me i'm wanting to find yeah [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7107.88s)]
*  Fuck that imagine you go through all that work. Yeah, they do it for glory [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7111.64s)]
*  Gold wrecks like shipwrecks and people like hunting for those things. That's a fascinating it is man [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7115.72s)]
*  That's because if you get lucky and if you find one that's filled with like roman coins. Yeah, like you [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7121.56s)]
*  We're talking about [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7128.52s)]
*  Billions of dollars a lot a lot of money to be made [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7129.88s)]
*  We were we were going to do our last episode when we went and did the doner party [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7132.2s)]
*  What we were supposed to be doing is we were supposed to be hanging out with guys that are still this whole fleet of spanish vessels [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7136.68s)]
*  that went down [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7142.2s)]
*  off the east coast of florida [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7143.48s)]
*  So the the atlantic side of florida [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7146.28s)]
*  We were going to go down with these guys that are still [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7148.919999999999s)]
*  Fighting over and finding all this stuff from all these sunken ships, but then the hurricane [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7152.12s)]
*  Like I mean like passed right over it so we didn't get to go do that. We didn't go do that show [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7157.24s)]
*  um [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7162.759999999999s)]
*  We did one about uh that centered that one becoming mostly a story that centered around [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7163.719999999999s)]
*  in the 70s [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7170.2s)]
*  There's this aircraft that was carrying the speaker of the house. So do you remember um [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7172.12s)]
*  Uh, was it is it neena? No [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7177.96s)]
*  Hey, jamie. I I I hate to be treating you like a research assistant here [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7180.5199999999995s)]
*  Hail cokie roberts. That's who you know, you know the journalist cokie roberts from like npr and shit. Okay. Yes [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7184.92s)]
*  Yeah, cokie roberts father was this guy hail boggs. Okay [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7190.36s)]
*  hail boggs was a democrat and he was a speaker of the house in the 70s and [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7194.84s)]
*  Alaska had at that time only one Alaska had a sole congressman [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7198.76s)]
*  There was an airplane that had baggage their sole congressman the speaker of the house [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7202.76s)]
*  An assistant and a pilot that went down in alaska in the 70s [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7209.320000000001s)]
*  Still no one's found that plane [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7214.04s)]
*  Speaker of the house like imagine that happened now, you know what I mean? Um [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7216.92s)]
*  Yeah 1972 [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7222.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it makes sense in the last oh it it does but then you get into the huge number of all these missing aircraft and like [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7224.5199999999995s)]
*  All that search centered around this glacier [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7230.92s)]
*  Um that it would have been that it would have been swallowed by a glacier [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7234.04s)]
*  And we went to this other site where this military transport plane years ago did go down in a glacier [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7238.36s)]
*  And the glacier swallowed it and I think it was like, you know, I don't know 20 some years later [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7243.8s)]
*  That glacier started to spit that plane out [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7248.04s)]
*  At the toe of the glacier like it carried it, I don't know what is 13 miles [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7250.44s)]
*  Under the ice and then started to spit out human remains and plane parts [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7256.36s)]
*  Every spring the military goes to the foot of that glacier every spring they go there [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7260.84s)]
*  Or sorry every summer they go to the toe of that glacier and they're still identifying [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7265.88s)]
*  They're still identifying [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7272.5199999999995s)]
*  Human remains that are moving out of that thing miles away from where that plane burrowed into that glacier [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7274.28s)]
*  Yeah, we went right there [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7280.5199999999995s)]
*  1952 yeah, look at that that wheel. Yep, and on top of that glacier [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7283.22s)]
*  We had got there after that we flew over in a helicopter [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7289.88s)]
*  They don't want you landing there but on top of that glacier is all this orange paint orange paint spots [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7292.2s)]
*  They weren't working there anymore, but you can tell they were in there marking [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7297.64s)]
*  Everything that you can see coming out of that as that glacier recedes. Wow, and they're marking all those pieces. So um [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7301.8s)]
*  This this other glacier where like most of that search focused for that baggage bogs flight focused on this one glacier [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7309.72s)]
*  But if you do the math on that glacier [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7316.4400000000005s)]
*  Had it gone into that glacier where they had spent a ton of time looking like into a crevasse in that glacier [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7319.24s)]
*  Had it gone into that glacier the glacier would have spit it out by now [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7324.12s)]
*  Because you can kind of track how much a glacier moves every year [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7327.56s)]
*  So now it's kind of the idea that it was in that glacier has been kind of put to rest [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7330.84s)]
*  Oh, here's dude searching that one. Oh, I could see as you move [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7334.68s)]
*  How far it travels wow [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7339.24s)]
*  Yeah [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7342.4400000000005s)]
*  Yes, we went there we went down into some of those crevasses like that, too [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7343.24s)]
*  Do you you climb down into one of those things? Yeah, which is scary as shit. Fuck that because that stuff is alive, man [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7346.36s)]
*  It's moving. I mean not like literally alive, but it's like groaning and moving [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7353.24s)]
*  Yeah, we went down and back back down to one of those [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7358.52s)]
*  You know [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7361.88s)]
*  It was pretty quiet that day [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7362.28s)]
*  It was actually more peaceful there because you know how much that all that cold air from that ice generates so much wind [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7364.04s)]
*  We land this helicopter there [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7370.44s)]
*  And um the wind's howling and I don't know much about aviation. I mean I use it a lot but [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7372.84s)]
*  Uh, the wind's so bad. I was asking the guy at what point do you risk that your helicopter's gonna [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7377.96s)]
*  blow off the glacier [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7384.12s)]
*  And a couple minutes later, he's a very experienced pilot [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7386.76s)]
*  But a couple minutes later he winds up tethering down his helicopter because he's like he's now you're like fucking with my head [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7389.56s)]
*  So he tethers down his helicopter on these ice screws, you know to like make sure the the helicopter doesn't slide and go down [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7397.240000000001s)]
*  into a crevasse [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7404.52s)]
*  and then you you know, I just I was with a very experienced ice climber, but uh, [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7406.52s)]
*  Harness up and pick your way down. But anyways, it's like definitely it's like so loud and you hear a lot of the [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7410.92s)]
*  Cuckoo you know the noise of all that ice moving because it's moving all those rocks and everything [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7415.96s)]
*  It just it pulverizes stuff as you see with that that aircraft [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7420.84s)]
*  um, but when you drop down and that when you drop down on that crevasse and go down that sucker [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7424.68s)]
*  It gets like [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7430.04s)]
*  unbelievably calm [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7432.1s)]
*  Real calm how far did you go down? Oh shit, not that far probably 30 feet. That's far enough. Oh, it's far enough for sure [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7433.8s)]
*  It's unnerving [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7440.52s)]
*  It's unnerving. But it's like I remember you tell me about your like your [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7442.04s)]
*  You know that uh that that chamber you like to go into. Yeah. Yeah, it's not quite like that [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7446.12s)]
*  But it's like you just all of a sudden like [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7451.08s)]
*  But you're also in there just thinking like how you just how you could get um smushed. Oh just obliterated [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7454.28s)]
*  You know there's stories. I was hunting with this dude years ago and he used to he used to be um [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7460.36s)]
*  Involved with outward bound and they were doing a glacier hike [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7465.4800000000005s)]
*  A guide was doing a glacier hike and they had a kid like a student. I think it was outward bound [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7469.24s)]
*  They had a student go off to take a piss [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7474.6s)]
*  And into one of those things never found [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7478.6s)]
*  Because there's big rivers flowing underneath that stuff. Oh god [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7481.64s)]
*  Right, so picture you like you go down. So you're down there. You can hear water running everywhere. You can hear rivers underneath you [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7485.0s)]
*  Inside that but you're you're roped up, you know, but even the rope you're on you're just screwing screws into the ice [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7492.280000000001s)]
*  And then at a certain air temperature [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7499.320000000001s)]
*  Right, like the screw conducts heat [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7502.54s)]
*  You know so at a certain air temperature like if you drive that screw in and that screw is conduct is pushing heat [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7505.9s)]
*  It'll melt the ice around the threads [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7513.98s)]
*  So you'll actually like drill these big holes into the glacier like a v [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7517.26s)]
*  Picture on picture you're coming in like a v and the two upper parts of the v are like 30 inches apart [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7522.62s)]
*  And you drill at a 45 degree angle until those holes meet then you snake a rope down one hole [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7528.780000000001s)]
*  And get it snaked out the other hole [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7537.18s)]
*  An entire knot in that and that's what's holding you. Oh fuck that [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7540.46s)]
*  Because if you put that screw in there [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7544.860000000001s)]
*  At a certain temperature the the threads of the screw are moving like solar heat and atmospheric heat down the threads [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7547.820000000001s)]
*  It can melt the thread out [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7554.54s)]
*  So you're you're just you're tied in on a little like yeah, you're you're like tied hoping it holds on onto a hunk of the ice [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7556.7s)]
*  You back down into those suckers dude. It's like it's a ass pucker. That's how they found the ice man, right? [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7564.94s)]
*  He was in a crevasse [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7569.9s)]
*  Was he in a crevasse? Wasn't he? I think he fell into a glacial crevasse. I don't remember that I think as the glacier melted [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7571.34s)]
*  That's how they found his body. Oh, I know they found him on a melted glacier [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7578.62s)]
*  But I didn't know that he was I didn't know those suppose that he fell into a crevasse [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7581.58s)]
*  I'm not sure but I think that was the story that they feel like he felt like he was [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7585.0199999999995s)]
*  Involved in some sort of mortal combat with someone. You know shot with an arrow. Yeah, he was all tore up [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7591.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, well they made a movie about his last days a fictional movie [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7595.98s)]
*  I haven't watched yet. It's a european fictional movie. Did you ever see the movie? It sort of sets up the whole circumstance [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7600.379999999999s)]
*  right [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7605.9s)]

*  Yeah, Otzi they named him. I'm sure that wasn't his real name. No [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7611.9s)]
*  He had a tattoo on his shoulder [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7616.62s)]
*  That was his wife. He had tattoos. Yeah, he did have tattoos. It was really wild. That was thousands of years ago, right? [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7618.62s)]

*  I think it's called ice man. No, I remember that they they bring a guy back to life [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7629.179999999999s)]

*  Yeah, I thought it was more like an et plot. No, no, no like they were they they resuscitate him and then the scientists want to [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7645.42s)]

*  It's funny. You were talking about the beaver pelts [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7789.18s)]
*  Because uh, you were the first person to explain to me like the richest man in the world at one point in time [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7792.06s)]
*  His business was beaver pelts. Yeah, it was america's first homegrown millionaire. Uh, john jacob aster [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7797.42s)]

*  Comes to the u.s. He's trying to figure out a way to make his to to make his way in america and in new york [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7818.299999999999s)]
*  He meets a guy in the fur business like a furrier [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7823.0199999999995s)]
*  and the guy says a lot of money be made in furs and um, and that was like [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7825.66s)]
*  That was the commodity [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7831.18s)]
*  for [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7833.26s)]
*  uh north america [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7834.7s)]
*  When you look at all the english powers coming or all the european powers coming to established colonies, you know [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7837.02s)]
*  It's known like the spanish come in and they get like all that aztec gold all that ink and gold [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7843.1s)]
*  Other european powers were like jealous about the wealth spain was pulling out [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7848.22s)]
*  And mineral wealth and they always thought that in in our area up in what's now the continental u.s [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7852.62s)]
*  You know eventually gold did come out but they were sort of like primarily like we need our own gold fields [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7858.3s)]
*  But what emerged was the was fur, you know fur was our thing fur was like the thing of value [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7863.0199999999995s)]
*  So aster became a fur trader [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7868.7s)]
*  And you know helped launch these fur trapping expeditions [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7872.219999999999s)]
*  What and became involved in what we now call the mountain man area like when you hear the term mountain men [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7876.0599999999995s)]
*  um the mountain man era so [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7881.179999999999s)]
*  we uh [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7884.7s)]
*  In my sort of other job outside of doing my history channel show like we do audio originals and um [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7887.099999999999s)]
*  We did one on the deer skin trade called the long hunters. It was about daniel boone [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7893.42s)]
*  1770s in the deer skin trade and right now [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7898.84s)]
*  We're coming out with one called meat eaters american history the mountain men and it covers that like john jacob [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7901.66s)]
*  Aster era of the beaver trade and what all those dudes so when you hear about jim bridger john colter jed smith [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7907.179999999999s)]
*  What they were producing they were producing a material that would be used to make felt hats [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7915.34s)]
*  Like that's what that was all about. Wow [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7922.06s)]
*  rather than [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7925.18s)]
*  You'd think if oh and when they would trap a beaver [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7926.78s)]
*  So, you know the revenant fucking beavers were around back then a lot [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7930.38s)]
*  You know more more even though we've recovered them really successfully there were far more beavers back then than there are now [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7935.42s)]
*  But you could the estimated population of beavers back then people invaded in the tens of millions [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7941.5s)]
*  Wow, you know, what are they now? Oh, I don't know. I don't know [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7947.18s)]
*  No, I do know because I looked at it the other day, but I forgot what it is [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7951.1s)]
*  I forgot what it is. It's a they're very recovered across a big part of their range [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7954.7s)]
*  Um, but nowhere near what it was at the time, you know [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7959.58s)]
*  the the the whole [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7963.42s)]
*  continent um [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7966.2s)]
*  Was shaped by beavers like they they manipulate their landscape more than anything besides humans, right? [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7968.44s)]
*  But [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7975.24s)]
*  People had always whittled away at them [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7976.2s)]
*  You know like earlier I mentioned daniel boone like his primary job was a deer skin [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7978.36s)]
*  He was in the deer skin trade and what they were using for back then [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7982.36s)]
*  You know what you see really old pictures of like kings and shit [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7984.599999999999s)]
*  They got those kind of white pants on it's probably a buckskin pan, right? [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7986.679999999999s)]
*  So our whole term with like when we say a buck something's worth a buck, right? [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7990.92s)]
*  That's about the equivalent value of a deer skin, right? So, you know, that's where that term came from [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7994.5199999999995s)]
*  Those guys at the same time they would hunt deer skins in the summer because they wanted them real thin [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=7999.4s)]
*  And then they would switch and they would hunt beaver pelts in the winter to for wool felt to create wool felt [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8004.759999999999s)]
*  but [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8010.36s)]
*  We kind of gradually [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8011.16s)]
*  Uh extirpated like wiped out beaver numbers and then when you get to 1804 and the louis and clark expedition [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8013.4s)]
*  Louis and clark push into the interior into the northern rockies [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8021.0s)]
*  And around the headwaters of the missouri and when they come back to st. Louis like one of the things they report on [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8026.04s)]
*  Is like holy shit [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8032.5199999999995s)]
*  like we found the the the last great stronghold of the beaver [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8034.679999999999s)]
*  Is in the rockies and that's what pushed this whole [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8040.839999999999s)]
*  Mountain man era so when you watch the revenant like hue glass, you know get mauled by the grizzly [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8044.36s)]
*  Those guys were all like their thing was they were beaver trappers [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8049.4s)]
*  and [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8053.72s)]
*  Earlier, I mentioned the english up around hudson bay. So you're familiar with this thing called the hudson bay company from from history [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8054.92s)]
*  Yes, it was like a fur trading enterprise the hudson bay company in the english always had this model [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8061.8s)]
*  Of the fur trade where they would build posts and then incentivize indians to hunt fur or trap fur [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8066.4400000000005s)]
*  They didn't track like the the english [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8073.32s)]
*  Weren't themselves trappers the english were traders and it would incentivize tribes to go trap and bring them the furs [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8076.2s)]
*  In the rockies that didn't work [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8083.96s)]
*  They couldn't get these nomadic [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8086.12s)]
*  equestrian bison hunters [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8088.98s)]
*  with the program [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8091.4s)]
*  They thought it was by and large. Um, the sentiment was it's beneath us. We're not going to give up our whole life way [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8093.08s)]
*  Everything we need comes from the buffalo. We live in big family groups [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8099.4s)]
*  We follow the herds like I don't i'm not going to go trap beaver for you [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8103.0s)]
*  It's of no interest to me [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8107.0s)]
*  So then they're like well shit how we gonna get the beaver and so they start hiring dudes [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8108.68s)]
*  they start hiring orphans and people that that that [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8112.28s)]
*  Uh were under indentured servitude and ran away whatever [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8115.72s)]
*  They hired these big groups of americans out of the colonies the former colonies because at the time of the united states [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8119.8s)]
*  They hired these guys and say you're going to go out and live for years at a time [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8126.76s)]
*  In the rockies and trap beaver and here's where to meet us on such and such date every year [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8130.92s)]
*  So go to this valley [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8137.8s)]
*  Right go to jackson hole or go to daniel wyoming [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8139.56s)]
*  Or bear valley wherever and we'll meet you in june and you bring all the shit you caught and we'll give you some more equipment [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8143.320000000001s)]
*  And like that was the mountain man era all that stuff [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8149.56s)]
*  When they caught those beavers, there's no need they didn't want the meat. They could eat the meat, but there's no value in the meat [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8153.08s)]
*  The hide they don't even want the leather from the hide [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8158.36s)]
*  That was thrown away [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8162.44s)]
*  They don't want the main guard hairs like so if you look at a pelt [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8164.839999999999s)]
*  You got these silky long guard hairs and then there's an under wool [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8169.08s)]
*  underneath it [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8172.759999999999s)]
*  They don't want the silky long guard hair all they're after is the under fur [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8174.2s)]
*  On the hide to line hats but to to make felt [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8180.839999999999s)]
*  But there was so much there was so much conning and scamming [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8184.5199999999995s)]
*  Of people taking shit that wasn't beaver wool and trying to pass it off as beaver wool. You had to ship the whole hide [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8188.2s)]
*  to europe [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8194.76s)]
*  So they could confirm that it was in fact a beaver hide at which they would hire people to pick the guard hair off [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8196.28s)]
*  Shave that under wool off throw the guard hair away [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8202.76s)]
*  Uh throw the leather away take that under wool and turn it into a felt [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8206.28s)]
*  To make a hat wow like an ebenezer scrooge top hat [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8210.6s)]
*  That's what that shit was about. So when this dude when lasol [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8215.400000000001s)]
*  You know comes over and and builds the griffin like that first ship is so crazy [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8219.720000000001s)]
*  Like he was building that ship to transport beaver hides because traditionally they'd always done it with canoes [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8224.12s)]
*  And he's like I got a better idea [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8229.880000000001s)]
*  I'm gonna build a giant ship fill that sucker full of beaver hides and i'll get rich thousands of beaver hides, but but but [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8230.84s)]
*  But but but but yeah his ship vanished and that's what they were still up to in the mountain man era and that whole industry [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8236.36s)]
*  was born [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8244.12s)]
*  In this in this in this mountain men project. We're doing like that whole history was born [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8245.880000000001s)]
*  Um, you can kind of say it was born with the lewis and clark expedition and identifying this this tremendous population to beavers in the northern rockies [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8250.76s)]
*  And it kind of ended in 1840 [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8258.68s)]
*  If there's a time the market collapsed if there's a time where you could go back in history and just observe like they could put you [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8261.08s)]
*  in like a [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8267.32s)]
*  Fucking a bulletproof bubble and just like you don't no one knows you're there. You know, you can just go watch [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8268.52s)]
*  Where would you go? Would you go to that? No, I just changed my time [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8275.960000000001s)]
*  For a long time. I knew what my time was, but I just changed my time recently. What what is it? I'll be happy to [[02:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8279.960000000001s)]
*  I'll be happy to explain what it used to be [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8286.44s)]
*  Uh, there used to be an idea [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8288.68s)]
*  um [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8291.560000000001s)]
*  that's existed for much of my life is uh [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8292.68s)]
*  about the peopling of the americas and um [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8296.12s)]
*  sometime [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8300.36s)]
*  Maybe around 15 000 years ago. There's so much of the earth's water was tied up in glaciers [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8302.44s)]
*  that [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8308.68s)]
*  Asia in alaska were connected by a chunk of ground the size of texas [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8310.92s)]
*  The bearing land bridge when people hear the bearing land bridge [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8315.64s)]
*  You kind of picture this little like it's like moses like crossing the part, you know [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8318.76s)]
*  The part of the red sea but the bear you would you could have lived and died on the you know [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8322.36s)]
*  Generations were probably born and died on the bearing land bridge with no idea that it was a bridge [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8326.1s)]
*  Like I said, there's a chunk of ground the size of texas that much water was tied up in glaciers [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8330.92s)]
*  um [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8336.28s)]
*  People crossed they almost certainly weren't saying like hey bob, let's go to alaska, but they were doing their thing [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8337.72s)]
*  They were hunting and moving and they crossed and then because of all that ice once they moved into what's now alaska [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8344.119999999999s)]
*  the theory held that they were trapped there by glacial ice and eventually [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8350.839999999998s)]
*  There was this thing called the ice free corridor opened up around like it would have spilled out around edmonton, alberta [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8357.24s)]
*  And the idea was the first people [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8362.599999999999s)]
*  To lay eyes on the continental u.s [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8365.24s)]
*  When that corridor opened up when that little gap through the glaciers opened up [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8369.08s)]
*  The first americans like spilled out onto the american great plains [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8374.039999999999s)]
*  Killing mammoths with with spears [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8377.88s)]
*  As all this new information has emerged [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8380.92s)]
*  um [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8384.599999999999s)]
*  The dates don't line up anymore. So we did a hunting history episode about this very question of um [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8386.599999999999s)]
*  How and when and who? [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8394.599999999999s)]
*  Were the first people to enter the continent, right? [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8397.4s)]
*  And now um, that was called the ice free corridor [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8400.359999999999s)]
*  Hypothesis but it's been made more and more untenable by finding these super old sites for a while [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8403.939999999999s)]
*  The oldest site we knew about in the new world [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8409.56s)]
*  Was in was this site called monteverde down in chile? [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8412.679999999998s)]
*  So if people came in at the bearing land bridge [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8416.119999999999s)]
*  Why is the oldest known site of human occupation all the way down in chile? How old is it? [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8419.24s)]
*  Somewhere around 13 14 [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8424.599999999999s)]
*  But what about those new mexico footprints that are 22 000 years old again? Yeah, it's clouded in picture [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8426.92s)]
*  There's a lot of the dating. Yeah, the dating on that is clouded [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8432.76s)]
*  But anyways, it's like antiquity in america is much older than originally thought right so and then there's now currently the oldest site [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8435.960000000001s)]
*  Is on the columbia river drainage? [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8443.24s)]
*  um near a place called pittsburgh landing [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8445.56s)]
*  uh [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8448.76s)]
*  There's a really old site there and it winds up being that it doesn't line up [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8450.36s)]
*  With the idea of people entering this ice-free corridor because like when did the corridor when was it open? [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8454.68s)]
*  When was it possible to pass through but now you have all these older dates and then people are even starting to question the validity [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8459.48s)]
*  The idea of like that this corridor opened when they thought it did [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8464.68s)]
*  So now the fashionable idea [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8468.039999999999s)]
*  It's it's seems rock solid and we we [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8470.52s)]
*  Film much of the episode up at our up at our fish shack [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8473.64s)]
*  um [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8477.4s)]
*  There's this theory now called the kelp highway [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8478.359999999999s)]
*  that you had uh [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8481.0s)]
*  This pretty stable environment all along the pacific coast [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8484.039999999999s)]
*  And it was defined by kelp beds [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8487.88s)]
*  Enormous or enormously rich in fish resources enormously rich in shellfish, right? [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8490.42s)]
*  um, and that the first americans were were a seafaring people [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8496.68s)]
*  And all that shit about what glaciers are melted and not melted and when this and that corridor and land bridge is open [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8501.96s)]
*  Was a moot point because these were people that um just came down the coast [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8507.8s)]
*  and they knew how to survive in that marine that kelp marine environment and [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8512.44s)]
*  They went south and went south and went south and things remained remarkably similar and with like great speed with great speed [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8517.08s)]
*  All the way down the coast to all the people in chile [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8524.84s)]
*  And instead of this idea that people came into the great plains and then spread to the coast [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8528.28s)]
*  It's that [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8536.04s)]
*  People came down that route [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8537.16s)]
*  And you know that really old site the currently oldest the currently oldest like iron clad [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8539.24s)]
*  Absolutely accepted academic consensus accepted site is that snake river site? [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8544.44s)]
*  um [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8550.04s)]
*  Or on the columbia drainage [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8551.480000000001s)]
*  Um that they came down the coast and then the continent was populated by people who just followed these major rivers these salmon runs and stuff [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8553.560000000001s)]
*  coastal fishing people [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8561.220000000001s)]
*  migrated up these rivers following fish and then turned into [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8563.720000000001s)]
*  over time became these mammoth hunters and [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8568.36s)]
*  These interior grassland hunters, but their their genesis was in these seafaring people [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8571.8s)]
*  And as people came down they kind of filled in so you go to like, you know the the the the the clingit or the hidea [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8577.24s)]
*  Right, um that live along the alaskan coast now like that's their ancestors, right? [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8584.76s)]
*  They were the they were they were perhaps people living that way and those places were the first people to enter the continent [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8589.8s)]
*  So so my time machine would be whatever the hell day that was [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8595.88s)]
*  That's what it would be to see that man because picture [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8598.92s)]
*  Like you know [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8603.800000000001s)]
*  Picture me the first person or the first group of people to like to see a continent [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8607.08s)]
*  Yeah [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8612.52s)]
*  You can't even you know, I mean, yeah [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8614.36s)]
*  How do we even know that that's the case though? We don't there's people that were before that [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8616.92s)]
*  That's that there's an argument that the thing is like [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8620.68s)]
*  There's an argument there's arguments humans came from africa, right? [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8623.560000000001s)]
*  Well, yeah, that that's where the yeah, there's the human diaspora is like anatomically like the the sort of widely accepted [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8627.4s)]
*  Scientific explanation is that anatomically and behaviorally? [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8635.460000000001s)]
*  modern humans [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8640.76s)]
*  Um, there was many waves of hominids coming out of africa, but sometime around 70 000 years ago [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8642.44s)]
*  um [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8648.84s)]
*  Our current human ancestors came out they came into a europe that was populated by nanothals [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8650.92s)]
*  Perhaps other hominids [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8656.039999999999s)]
*  um [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8657.8s)]
*  They kind of won [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8658.68s)]
*  Right and then and then spread around the world in the last continent [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8660.119999999999s)]
*  Outside of antarctica which was never you know, the last continent to be occupied by humans outside of antarctica [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8664.119999999999s)]
*  Which arguably was never occupied by humans would have been south america was the last the last stop [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8669.48s)]
*  Wow, um, which wild is there's monkeys down there. Yeah, that's what's wild [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8674.44s)]
*  But man, there's all these there's this there's this there's this theory called the salutrean hypothesis [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8679.16s)]
*  Which is that that northern europeans? [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8684.199999999999s)]
*  Came over much much like 10, you know 10 plus thousand years ago [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8687.96s)]
*  There's always these different ideas that that someone you know, someone from somewhere else blew in on a raft [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8691.32s)]
*  there's always the same but but what i'm talking about is a sort of like [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8696.839999999998s)]
*  Again, the kind of like academically accepted idea [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8700.279999999999s)]
*  the sort of mainstream [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8704.119999999999s)]
*  Idea remains and it's supported by genetic [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8706.439999999999s)]
*  linguistic everything is that that humans came out of um [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8709.619999999999s)]
*  The americans that you know our native americans [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8714.599999999999s)]
*  Came out of syberia [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8719.4s)]
*  Through a syberian pathway probably in waves [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8722.039999999999s)]
*  You know the people we now if you refer to now like northern coastal peoples eskimo inuits [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8725.72s)]
*  They were a later wave they were different than what became the athabaskans to the south [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8732.679999999998s)]
*  It was like a later wave so there could have been repeated waves of people [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8737.16s)]
*  Coming but i've always been interested in the first wave. Yeah, whoever they were the first wave and when was that? [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8741.08s)]
*  Are you aware of the sage wall in montana? No, i'm aware of montana [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8747.48s)]
*  You live there [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8752.68s)]
*  The sage wall is a recent discovery. It was on private property and um [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8754.04s)]
*  These people it was completely covered with woods [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8760.6s)]
*  And you know dead falls and everything and they started clearing it out and they found this thing that looks remarkably [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8763.800000000001s)]
*  Like a constructed wall [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8769.34s)]
*  That's the sage wall in montana it's very wow, it's very strange [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8773.42s)]
*  It's very strange and it's a vertical wall. Yeah, it goes down 13 feet under the ground [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8777.02s)]
*  And uh, it's long and straight and it's very confusing because it very much looks like placed stones [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8782.54s)]
*  That were cut and moved somehow [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8789.18s)]
*  uh in this particular way and uh, there's a lot of [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8792.62s)]
*  Oh, yeah, that's a wild looking wall wild looking [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8796.619999999999s)]
*  Well, let's see if you could find the overhead of it jamy because when you look at the overhead you're like, Jesus christ [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8800.38s)]
*  This looks like people put this there. Yeah, the debate is is it natural or manmade? [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8805.66s)]
*  Yeah, well, there is some people that think it's manmade and there's some people that think it's natural but [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8809.099999999999s)]
*  It's leaning much more towards um manmade [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8815.26s)]
*  But it's confusing. Oh, you know, I am familiar. Yeah, i'm familiar with that area. Yeah, no, I got it. It's real weird [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8819.74s)]
*  Yeah, I mean looking yeah, there's a lot of [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8825.58s)]
*  A lot of natural formations. Yeah, because you get fissures and rocks that are filled from volcanic activity. Sure [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8829.58s)]
*  It's puzzling. It's definitely maybe we'll do an episode on that. I think we will [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8835.66s)]
*  Well this gentleman right there see that guy down there with the beard jimmy. That's that's the guy [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8839.1s)]
*  I think it's wandering wolf on um, uh, I think that's his name [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8843.42s)]
*  On uh youtube. Yeah, wandering wolf. Uh, he's been studying this for a while. Please ignore his nose ring [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8848.460000000001s)]
*  Well, is that what that was? I couldn't tell if he had a bug or if that was a nose ring but like [[02:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8854.14s)]
*  This is crazy. It's crazy because they're flat and straight and they look fairly uniform and they look like they're cut into position [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8858.3s)]
*  And there's also a bunch of these uh, you know where they would grind things [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8865.9s)]
*  There's these posts that sit out that look like they're carved outside [[02:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8870.14s)]
*  That are similar to a lot of stuff they find in south america around machu pichu and stuff like that. It's very very weird stuff [[02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8874.859999999999s)]
*  Well, because if that was made by people who and when and how um [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8883.019999999999s)]
*  Yep, yeah my god [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8891.66s)]
*  I'm going natural, but I know we'll do a future episode on that [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8893.98s)]
*  Yeah [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8897.5s)]
*  I mean I think natural too until you look at some of them like some of those images [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8898.14s)]
*  Go back to some of those images jimmy some of those images are like how the fuck [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8901.66s)]
*  Like they're so flat and straight [[02:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8905.9s)]
*  And look at that, you know that isn't from that angle it's insane from that angle [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8908.46s)]
*  You would no doubt look and be like that's a man-made wall. It looks very stacked [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8912.779999999999s)]
*  They're all cut square. What's that? Jamie? [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8917.18s)]
*  It kind of looks fake, but it does look fake. Is that a fake image or is that the real image? I can't tell [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8919.02s)]
*  You know what added to the picture? Yeah [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8924.22s)]
*  It doesn't look like the same stuff from the video. Okay [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8927.02s)]
*  Well, let's see some of the images from the video. Well that one up is the that one there is real that's legit [[02:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8930.06s)]
*  That looks real now that's something different that's not the same site look at the [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8936.38s)]
*  It looks like so yeah, that's certainly like that looks like yeah, that looks like that's not the same site [[02:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8942.78s)]
*  And that's not a vegetation that grows around there. That's something different goofing around shit [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8947.5s)]
*  Yeah, so here's here's a video this guy walking around [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8952.54s)]
*  It's really interesting stuff because there's so much evidence of humans, right? [[02:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8956.06s)]
*  The the you know with the mortal and pestle sure grinding holes [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8959.98s)]
*  In shit are all there so there was some human occupation in this area [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8964.3s)]
*  The question is like was this put there by humans or is this a natural feature that they found and just exploited? [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8967.5s)]
*  Have you followed that news that has come out about that boy that anzic one boy in montana? No [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8974.14s)]
*  Um sounds like a spielberg movie don't it anzic one it does so there is a [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8979.66s)]
*  There's a clovis child that they found years ago and near willsall, montana. Um [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8985.42s)]
*  It was from a clovis hunter culture this child had been buried with projectile points and ochre [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8992.14s)]
*  And they've recently done work on like like stable isotope work and it was like he had a he would had a diet of [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=8999.58s)]
*  Woolly mammoth. Whoa. Yeah, which people had always thought [[02:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9006.06s)]
*  Yeah, right, but that's like this thing that gets always kicked around is um, and I have a friend [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9009.98s)]
*  David melzer. I don't know if you're looking for guest suggestions, but heffelfinger melzer [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9015.98s)]
*  Okay, I can love him. But anyway melzer [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9020.06s)]
*  um, he's an anthropologist and [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9023.5s)]
*  He's always been involved in this debate about where these these clovis hunters and these ice age americans like to what degree were they really these like [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9026.22s)]
*  northern wild men [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9034.14s)]
*  Killing mammoths with spears and shit, right? [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9035.9s)]
*  um [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9038.539999999999s)]
*  And people have tried to like over the years [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9039.74s)]
*  sort of emasculate [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9043.1s)]
*  these ice age hunters [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9045.18s)]
*  Being like oh, they probably weren't really killing all these mammoths, you know, they probably found them and scavenged them [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9047.02s)]
*  You know and and and explaining away david hate me saying this but uh explaining away [[02:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9053.1s)]
*  Evidence that they were slaying mammoths and also explaining away the theory that um that they killed all the mammoths [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9060.060000000001s)]
*  right [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9066.94s)]
*  And they were eating like that. They were eating a much more varied diet using plant resources [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9068.300000000001s)]
*  And they were kind of like a kinder gentler ice age hunter [[02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9073.9s)]
*  so it's funny that out of this as this debate is always waged on it'd be like [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9077.18s)]
*  this accusation that [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9083.1s)]
*  In creating our idea of these ice age hunters you create the kind you wish was there [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9084.94s)]
*  Right. So a dude like me is gonna be like, yeah, man mammoth hunters, right? Right, you know, and it's the more dude to be like, oh no [[02:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9090.94s)]
*  Um, you know, yeah berry pickers, right like they're they were gentle [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9097.9s)]
*  Um, but they they've finally just did all this work and lo and behold, um [[02:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9102.46s)]

*  um [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9114.22s)]
*  And it was uh, they were mammoth eaters [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9115.26s)]
*  You know which backs up this idea that those big ass points [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9118.7s)]
*  um [[02:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9122.539999999999s)]
*  Those big ass points they made were like being used I participated in this study [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9123.58s)]
*  Uh me and some of the guys I work with participate in this study with melzer this guy named metin erin who runs an experimental archaeology lab [[02:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9128.939999999999s)]
*  Kent State University and they gave us all these stone tools [[02:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9136.06s)]
*  And we had a dead bison laying there [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9140.38s)]
*  And we just were supposed to just spend the day butchering the bison [[02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9143.1s)]
*  With stone flakes and also with clovus points. So we're supposed to butcher half with clovus points [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9147.26s)]
*  And butcher half with stone blades. They just want people who were like expert butchers to do it [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9152.38s)]
*  Like you don't really know how anybody did anything but just to see [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9156.86s)]
*  Because what what the problem they have and looking at the the archaeological record is the only thing left is bone and stone [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9159.66s)]
*  Everything else is gone [[02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9166.460000000001s)]
*  So when you find some mammoth, you know, you find a mammoth rib cage eroding out of a river bank and lo and behold [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9167.980000000001s)]
*  There's a projectile point laying there. We had always said oh [[02:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9173.26s)]
*  Um, someone stabbed it with that point and killed it [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9177.900000000001s)]
*  But do you really know that? [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9181.18s)]
*  Right, you'll see a mark on a rib and you're like, oh see they shot it in the rib [[02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9183.26s)]
*  And that's why it's got a scratch on its rib. Well, do you really know that? [[02:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9187.82s)]
*  We just assume right so we did this project [[02:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9192.54s)]
*  Of to butcher this whole thing a fresh dead bison all the stone points [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9196.220000000001s)]
*  And then they go then they went and cleaned all the bones [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9201.26s)]
*  Um this guy john haze from haze tax in every studio did this [[02:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9204.06s)]
*  This way to treat the bones and clean them where you're not messing up the bones at all [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9207.58s)]
*  So now you have a set of bones [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9211.26s)]
*  That you know what happened to them [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9214.140000000001s)]
*  Right and you have a set of stone tools that you know, they were used for [[02:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9216.7s)]
*  And the idea is you're creating something to be to compare [[02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9220.94s)]
*  You know, like there's this famous fulsome site where all these these uh out of new mexico [[02:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9224.7s)]
*  Where all these bison skulls these ice age bison skulls. They look different like that skull you got out in your out in your studio [[02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9230.060000000001s)]
*  in the inner, um [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9236.380000000001s)]
*  Big horn, you know longer horned animal they all got these cut marks on the bone right here [[02:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9238.619999999999s)]
*  Inside the jaw mark inside the jaw and then people have been like, oh it must have been from extracting the tongue [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9244.06s)]
*  And I even thought that I went I went to smu and looked at those skulls and held those bones in my hand [[02:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9249.099999999999s)]
*  And i'm like, oh look, they're probably getting the tongues out and made all those cut marks inside the jaw bone [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9254.38s)]
*  But what's funny? [[02:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9259.42s)]
*  Um and going and extracting the tongue with stone tools [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9260.619999999999s)]
*  I didn't do shit with a left any kind of mark like that [[02:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9264.619999999999s)]
*  You know and again, you don't know how they did what they did [[02:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9267.74s)]
*  But it just it creates an interesting data set [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9270.86s)]
*  So that when you do look at cut marks on bones, you can start put putting together [[02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9274.220000000001s)]
*  What might it cause it that what what he wants to work on next is they want to do an ostrich [[02:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9279.26s)]
*  What do you think those cut marks were if they weren't extracting the tongues? [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9284.54s)]
*  Dude, I got no idea [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9288.94s)]
*  Wow, you're looking at him right there [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9290.380000000001s)]
*  I don't know when I extracted the tongue with the stone [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9293.019999999999s)]
*  I extracted the tongue with stolen tools and I didn't have any need to go anywhere near that thing like that [[02:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9295.82s)]
*  I don't know but just goes to show like you you look at stuff [[02:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9301.98s)]
*  You find a projectile point with a rib cage and you're like they stabbed it, right? [[02:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9305.019999999999s)]
*  But then well, maybe they maybe that we're looking at clobus points all wrong [[02:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9309.98s)]
*  Maybe clobus points were knives [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9315.259999999998s)]
*  Hmm maybe that big projectile point was a clobus knife [[02:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9317.9s)]
*  Or maybe it was both things and maybe when you find a mama skeleton, it's got two or three broken clobus blades [[02:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9321.74s)]
*  It wasn't that they had been jabbed into it [[02:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9327.98s)]
*  Necessarily, maybe they were the butchering tools [[02:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9331.24s)]
*  But then what would be the killing tools? [[02:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9333.98s)]
*  It's a great question [[02:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9336.380000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I personally like me not being an academic who's invested my entire career into this question [[02:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9337.9s)]
*  Uh, I do know this like I think that when people talk about oh they were finding them [[02:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9344.22s)]
*  Like I spent a lot of time outside [[02:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9348.94s)]
*  You just don't find all this fresh dead shit laying around everywhere [[02:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9351.18s)]
*  Right, right. You could you could spend many many many many many days out wandering around the woods. You don't find like fresh dead [[02:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9355.5s)]
*  Right edible materials, right you find rotten shit [[02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9362.86s)]
*  Dried up shit you find skeletons [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9366.54s)]
*  But I don't I have a hard time swallowing the idea that that all these mammoth kill sites were just where they happened to [[02:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9369.18s)]
*  Stumble across a fresh dead mammoth. Yeah, that seems and cut it up with a projectile point [[02:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9374.54s)]
*  Yeah, they're cut it up with a blade like they were killing mammoths [[02:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9378.86s)]
*  Yeah, that's my my take on it [[02:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9381.34s)]
*  They're killing me and it probably the mammoths weren't aware that they were even going to hunt them [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9383.900000000001s)]
*  That's probably weren't being hunted by anything [[02:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9388.62s)]
*  That's this idea when we're talking about that ice-free corridor deal and you look at how fast humans filled up the the north and south america [[02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9390.78s)]
*  Like a a sort of motivational driver for that really quick spread [[02:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9398.619999999999s)]
*  Would be that let's say you were the your your you pop out in the great plains and the animals have never seen a person [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9402.779999999999s)]
*  Right a mammoth never seen a person [[02:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9410.38s)]
*  Um, you just walk up and kill it, right? [[02:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9412.939999999999s)]
*  And you do that for a couple months in some valley and then everything gets like oh shit. It's one of them things and runs away [[02:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9415.42s)]
*  well [[02:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9421.82s)]
*  Jump to the next valley [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9423.1s)]
*  Yeah [[02:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9424.7s)]
*  And find more of the ones that don't you know, find more of the ones that have never seen you yeah [[02:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9426.140000000001s)]
*  You know like i've had occasion before to see like a elk [[02:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9431.980000000001s)]
*  That would have no way to encounter a dog [[02:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9436.62s)]
*  Encounter a dog and their attitude is kind of like um, the hell's that [[02:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9439.58s)]
*  Right, you know, they're like curious about it [[02:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9444.380000000001s)]
*  They're kind of looking at it [[02:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9446.54s)]
*  So you can imagine like these these early peoples could probably just walk up on a lot of shit and just kill it [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9447.58s)]
*  Probably right. Yeah, it's like what's this thing gonna do? [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9452.539999999999s)]
*  Yeah, what's this thing gonna do fuck out of here and also like [[02:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9455.58s)]
*  Some bitch stabbed me so that was an idea that pushed like how fast people spread around and then they weren't fighting each other [[02:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9461.019999999999s)]
*  Because they were all at all this there's no competition for resource [[02:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9467.98s)]
*  They're not fighting each other and they're enjoying like very high reproductive rates because they're drowning in food [[02:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9470.38s)]
*  And there's no conflict. I wonder what the [[02:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9477.5s)]
*  Wildlife populations were like back then too before humans [[02:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9480.619999999999s)]
*  Like when humans did encounter when they first encountered north american wildlife, I wonder what the populations were staggering [[02:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9485.179999999998s)]
*  Must have been crazy staggering [[02:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9492.06s)]
*  Staggering [[02:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9494.84s)]
*  We'll never know we'll never know but if you had a time machine, that's your spot [[02:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9496.22s)]
*  Well, they're getting closer to knowing now because now they can do crazy shit like they can go into pond sediments [[02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9500.06s)]
*  Do you know what I mean like stuff's shedding, you know, you're shedding your shedding cells all the time [[02:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9505.98s)]
*  All right at some point you'll go down 10 feet into some pond [[02:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9511.5s)]
*  and pull a little bit sediment out and lay that sediment out and do some analysis and be like, you know, there's skin cells from [[02:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9515.66s)]
*  six mammoths [[02:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9523.66s)]
*  short-faced bear [[02:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9525.5s)]
*  Right, right, whatever. It's just it's getting crazy [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9527.5s)]
*  You know [[02:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9531.179999999998s)]
*  It's funny like talking about indiana jones like that style like the archaeology is becoming [[02:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9532.22s)]
*  increasingly anthropology archaeology [[02:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9537.96s)]
*  Is becoming like the realm of the scientist like the the the lab scientist, you know, I mean not not the field work like [[02:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9541.339999999998s)]
*  It's so much more. It's such a richard field of inquiry now to analyze stuff. We already have than it is to go find new stuff [[02:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9548.699999999999s)]
*  Mmm, you follow me. Yeah, and when you go on an archaeological dig, you know, they're always they just dig they just dig a fraction [[02:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9555.66s)]
*  There's a knowledge now. There's a knowledge now that that tomorrow we're going to know a bunch of shit [[02:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9562.94s)]
*  We don't know [[02:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9568.7s)]
*  So if we got a hundred squares, we'll just dig one now [[02:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9569.9s)]
*  And the impulse used to be just to come in and like destroy the whole site [[02:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9574.220000000001s)]
*  Right and wash everything away with hoses and just look for big bones and big stone points [[02:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9577.9s)]
*  And you'd come away with thinking that they use big stone points to kill big bones because you just washed into the ditch [[02:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9583.1s)]
*  all of that micro evidence [[02:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9588.86s)]
*  All of those small bones all the plant pollen [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9591.18s)]
*  You just washed everything away because you kind of knew what you were looking for [[02:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9594.94s)]
*  Right, so we probably make the same mistake now. So when you go to a dig they just go like we'll just check this little square [[02:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9598.060000000001s)]
*  and then leave [[02:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9603.58s)]
*  You know, this is protocol now [[02:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9605.5s)]
*  Knowing that in 10 years 100 years, whatever [[02:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9607.58s)]
*  Someone's gonna have a way better way [[02:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9610.859999999999s)]
*  They'll stick some little stick down there and we'll tell them everything you need to know, you know [[02:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9612.06s)]
*  Did I tell you about my friend john reeves? Did I ever tell you about the bone yard in alaska? Oh, yeah [[02:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9615.58s)]
*  He no he had him on the show. Oh, yeah, he comes on the show every year [[02:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9620.06s)]
*  He was supposed to be the last guest this year, but he got pneumonia. Okay, he's coming on in february. Oh, that's just fascinating [[02:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9623.1s)]
*  Yeah, that place is crazy. You know, it's only six acres [[02:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9628.46s)]
*  Is that right? Yeah, six acres [[02:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9632.46s)]
*  Thousands and thousands of bones [[02:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9634.699999999999s)]
*  And what he thinks is it's like some sort of a natural disaster took place and probably [[02:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9637.179999999998s)]
*  Asteroid impact [[02:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9643.419999999998s)]
*  There's a thick layer of carbon [[02:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9645.099999999999s)]
*  Thick layer of carbon and in the permafrost is all these bodies and they think that it's probably just washed [[02:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9647.099999999999s)]
*  All these bodies into a ditch. Oh, that's why there's so many of them there at the perfect spot [[02:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9653.5s)]
*  Perfect spot. They found animals that weren't even supposed to be in alaska there [[02:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9658.539999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's like it's like if you had lebrea tar pits to yourself, yes exactly [[02:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9661.82s)]
*  But it's all his property. So no one can go there [[02:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9667.1s)]
*  So, you know, you know, they've they've found them in the east river now because it turns out that which museum was it jamie? [[02:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9670.38s)]

*  So these people have actually gone down there and found them in the east river now [[02:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9680.94s)]
*  They found a bunch of bison bones and all kinds of shit in the east river, which is really crazy [[02:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9684.78s)]
*  No, it is exactly where they said that they dumped these things off. They found them now [[02:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9689.9s)]
*  It's really wild. And so yeah, that's that's that's a fact. Yeah, you should go to this guy's I would like to do that [[02:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9694.46s)]
*  That would be a great episode for your show because this this whole thing is crazy [[02:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9700.94s)]
*  Yeah, you know and they may or may not have found human remains there. Oh, they can't talk about it [[02:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9704.699999999999s)]
*  I imagine not that shit gets pretty complicated in a hurry man. It's a little yeah [[02:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9710.539999999999s)]
*  We uh, we did one on the we did one on the the lost roanoke colony and um, there's archaeologists working on what happened at the [[02:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9716.38s)]
*  lost roanoke colony and the minute you um bring up like human remain conversations people it's just like shut the fuck up. Yeah [[02:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9723.42s)]
*  Things get real weird enormously complicated. Yeah, I recently met a guy that does [[02:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9731.34s)]
*  Um, he's a he's pueblo and so he's from one of the pueblos in new mexico [[02:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9735.42s)]

*  For people not familiar with the pueblo be like basically [[02:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9745.66s)]
*  You know, it's akin to a tribe, right? He works on repatriation for his tribe. Mostly focuses on remains [[02:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9748.220000000001s)]
*  getting back [[02:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9755.9s)]
*  um [[02:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9757.5s)]
*  Getting back the remains of his ancestors [[02:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9759.34s)]
*  From all these museums and stuff [[02:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9761.9s)]
*  You know, they want them back. Yeah, and I once and I i'd said to him in this conversation. I'd said hey [[02:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9764.380000000001s)]
*  why can't there be like a deal to be struck where [[02:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9769.5s)]
*  You just say to the museum like okay you keep one gram [[02:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9771.98s)]
*  of that bone [[02:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9775.66s)]
*  For your work keep a gram of the bone and give the rest back to us [[02:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9776.94s)]
*  He said that would never be acceptable to us [[02:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9781.18s)]
*  Mm-hmm be like the same way if someone went and dug your uh, you know, yeah someone dug your grandpa's bones out of a graveyard [[02:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9784.38s)]
*  And later you're like, hey, let me borrow his foot. Give me my grandpa back. I'm like no we're keeping it [[02:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9791.66s)]
*  Yeah, we're gonna do studies on them [[02:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9796.14s)]
*  You know [[02:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9799.58s)]
*  You know god, it's so complicated. Yeah. So yeah, I think that it would be um [[02:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9801.34s)]
*  finding that and then [[02:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9806.300000000001s)]
*  What complicates a lot of human remains stuff too? [[02:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9808.060000000001s)]
*  Especially with stuff that he's talking about that stuff he has is as old as it did [[02:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9809.980000000001s)]
*  is you there's a little bit of a [[02:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9814.300000000001s)]
*  A little bit of question like the groups that are there now [[02:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9818.86s)]
*  Peoples that are there now were the the peoples that were there before right, you know [[02:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9822.060000000001s)]
*  Because people move all the time, right? [[02:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9825.58s)]
*  You just look at like like how the Comanche moved look how the the sewer in the upper midwest and in areas of minnesota and [[02:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9827.1s)]
*  One up, you know coming westward and all this movement [[02:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9832.62s)]
*  So when you have bones, there's always a question of well who you know currently typically it goes like this [[02:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9837.42s)]
*  It's like who was currently on the land [[02:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9842.54s)]
*  But when you're talking about bones that are 10 11 12 000 years old [[02:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9845.74s)]
*  There's like a little bit of a in my mind. There's a little bit of a question of like well, who do you? [[02:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9849.34s)]
*  Um, how do you know that that that that that person's direct descendants aren't in new mexico, right? [[02:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9854.06s)]
*  You know think about how much time passed like are you giving them like is it the wrong? [[02:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9860.86s)]
*  Are you giving them to the wrong people? [[02:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9864.22s)]
*  You know, right? That's a very good point. Yeah, because people moved all over damn place [[02:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9866.539999999999s)]
*  God [[02:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9870.14s)]
*  It's fast, but with the pueblos with the pueblos [[02:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9871.18s)]
*  It is not that like with the pueblos it is like people that have had occupation on these places for hundreds of years [[02:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9873.66s)]
*  And people just came in and hauled their ancestors out [[02:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9878.78s)]
*  Out [[02:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9881.82s)]
*  Wow stick them in museums. I was at a museum with my kids over christmas break. I was at a museum in chicago [[02:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9883.02s)]
*  And we go into this exhibit and all the walls are all the displays are papered [[02:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9889.34s)]
*  So you can't see [[02:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9894.300000000001s)]
*  And there was a sign just said like we're in a there's a repatriation issue [[02:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9896.14s)]
*  So they blocked it all [[02:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9902.54s)]
*  Wow, you know, whatever I don't even know what was behind the paper whatever the display was [[02:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9905.1s)]
*  They're in a they're in a custody battle over their display and blocked it for view [[02:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9908.86s)]
*  And years ago, I went to salta. Um salta and to look at those children of the corn, you know [[02:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9912.86s)]
*  You ever hear about those children those inking children they left on that mountaintop and they kind of freeze dried [[02:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9918.060000000001s)]
*  They have three of these children they found but whatever the deal they made with the ink and the contemporary inking peoples [[02:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9923.74s)]
*  The deal they made is they'll only display one at a time [[02:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9930.54s)]
*  And um when I went it was the it was the child that had been struck by lightning after the fact [[02:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc5oIzZpyLs&t=9933.9s)]
