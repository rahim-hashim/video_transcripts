# JRE MMA Show #91 with Radio Rahim
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [February 13, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Ff4I6qsfU)
*  Doo doo doo.
*  Yeah, that is a guy named Ross Baines.
*  He painted that.
*  He's also painted this.
*  There's a picture in the green room of me and Daniel Cormier.
*  And there's another one.
*  He said, I think he sent me the one of Mazvodal.
*  He did an amazing one of Jorge Mazvodal when he landed this knee on Ben Askren.
*  He's a great artist, but that's Richard Pryor.
*  He painted that for me.
*  Well, clearly my screen saver used to be a collection of mug shots.
*  Really?
*  Jim Morrison.
*  I have Morrison out there.
*  Frank Sinatra.
*  I saw.
*  Frank Sinatra in the green room.
*  OK, so then the thing is, I'm not a criminal, right?
*  Me neither.
*  I don't aspire to be a criminal.
*  I don't either.
*  These mug shots are so iconic.
*  Yeah.
*  What does it mean to you to see your heroes essentially charged with crimes
*  and maybe one of the worst nights there are a lot?
*  Well, it didn't start off that way.
*  This is what happened.
*  I was in Hawaii, and I'm a giant Jimi Hendrix fan.
*  That's why I named the podcast Joe Rogan Experience.
*  I ripped off the Jimi Hendrix Experience.
*  And I was in Hawaii, and I went to this art gallery,
*  and they had all this rock and roll art.
*  And they had this really dope collaboration of Hendrix, his mug shot.
*  It was like six, nine, nine images, nine square images of Hendrix's mug shot.
*  I go, that looks cool as fuck.
*  And so I bought it.
*  And I also bought the Rosa Parks one, and I also bought the Elvis one.
*  They had three different collabs, like just nine squares on one piece of artwork.
*  Right.
*  And I thought it looked cool.
*  So I said, oh, that'd be a good backdrop for the podcast.
*  So the old podcast studio, I had those behind me.
*  And then I started picking up other ones.
*  Like I got Janis Joplin in the bathroom.
*  I got Johnny Cash.
*  I got James Brown.
*  I got Pryor on the wall here.
*  I got Jim Morrison.
*  I got Steven Tyler on the wall over there.
*  I just started collecting them.
*  And there's no real rhyme or reason to it.
*  I just got Lenny Bruce.
*  I got everybody.
*  But I just found mug shots, and I just started collecting them.
*  Like I said, my screen server was that for like a year.
*  And I even had Sinatra in my room, a big one on the wall and whatnot.
*  And I'm like, what is this shit about?
*  But it occurred to me, everybody that became an icon, became a legend,
*  you have to break the rules.
*  There's nobody who just followed every rule,
*  and that's what they're famous for.
*  Like, hey, this guy never stepped out of line.
*  He did everything that everyone said he was supposed to do.
*  He did it all the ways that you're within the rules.
*  And that's the fucking legend that you love.
*  No.
*  It's almost like it's illegal to be exceptional.
*  You have to fucking break the law to make the imprint on the society
*  that you want to make.
*  Well, particularly in a time where these guys were doing their art.
*  I mean, we're talking about Morrison and Hendrix.
*  This is the 70s, the 60s.
*  It was wild times.
*  There's this transitionary period between the 50s,
*  where everything was like mom and pop and diners
*  and fucking drive-through movies and shit, or drive-in movies.
*  And then all of a sudden, you have drugs and wild rock and roll
*  and James Brown and chaos and Hendrix and his guitar.
*  Whatever you're not supposed to do, that's
*  the thing you should be doing.
*  I mean, we're not talking about harming other people or whatnot,
*  but the society's restrictions, that's the boundary
*  to keep you as a normal person.
*  I wish I had a better answer.
*  But if I had to really put my finger on it,
*  I would say that those images represent these moments where
*  society tried to contain these wild people.
*  Exactly.
*  These people that were breaking the rules,
*  these people that were trying to change culture,
*  these people that were just doing their thing.
*  And it wasn't like they weren't popular.
*  I mean, I think Jim Morrison pulled his dick out, right?
*  Didn't he pull his dick out?
*  I mean, he was insanely popular when he pulled his dick out.
*  And they're like, enough!
*  That way he was insanely popular when he got arrested
*  finally for pulling his dick out.
*  But when you get arrested for pulling your dick out,
*  it's never the first time.
*  No, he's pulled his dick out.
*  I know a lot of people who pulled their dick out.
*  Yeah, it's a weird thing, like that moment where
*  the society that's trying to contain these artists
*  lashes out and captures them briefly.
*  But they don't even realize they're just making them bigger.
*  Yeah.
*  And they're making them more accessible.
*  Hey, I got a mugshot.
*  I mean, my crew, but you know what?
*  Well, it turned out the one from Hendrix
*  was a bullshit mugshot.
*  It wasn't a real mugshot.
*  He never got arrested?
*  He did get arrested.
*  But the image that I had, some fucking artist took liberties
*  and they decided, well, this is a cooler picture.
*  Let's put his mugshot logo under that.
*  So it was the actual words from Toronto
*  where he got arrested for heroin underneath his image.
*  But the image was incorrect.
*  So then I went out and got the real image.
*  So now that big, and I used to have them in the squares,
*  but then I changed the squares to these big metal ones.
*  See, the one I had is the upper right hand side.
*  That's the wrong one.
*  That's not the real image.
*  That is a cooler one.
*  Because if that one down there is, yeah, OK.
*  OK, well, no, that's a cooler one, too.
*  That's the real mugshot.
*  But don't do the one with the words behind it.
*  The one next to it, Jamie.
*  No, next to it.
*  Right above, above, right above, right there.
*  That's it.
*  That's the actual one.
*  See that one on the right hand side?
*  That's the actual image of Hendrix.
*  Oh, I didn't know there's a Mick Jagger.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Yeah, that was in my collection.
*  Well, the Yonkers one is Steven Tyler.
*  I have that one on the wall.
*  That's the side shot.
*  But I didn't know, Steven.
*  Did you know that Mick Jagger got arrested, Jamie?
*  Everybody's been arrested.
*  Ordered that shit.
*  Hold onto those and start ordering.
*  We're going to get some new ones.
*  Oh, David Bowie?
*  We got the Janis Joplin in the bathroom.
*  Fuck, I didn't know David Bowie got arrested.
*  Axl Rose.
*  That's Axl Rose right here.
*  Axl Rose was a little cutie pie when he was younger.
*  Look at him.
*  The David Bowie one is pretty dope.
*  That actually looks like it could be the cover of an album.
*  Scroll back down again to that, please.
*  Yeah, look at that.
*  And Jim Morrison looks like Chris Stapleton.
*  Look how odd he looks there.
*  1976.
*  He's guilty.
*  Whatever you got arrested for that night,
*  you're definitely dead.
*  Arrested for being beautiful.
*  Look at him.
*  So dude, let's just get into this, man.
*  We had this conversation at the comic store.
*  I'm like, you got to come on the podcast.
*  We got to talk about this.
*  Because you are a part of probably the most
*  iconic boxing interview of our day.
*  You with Deontay Wilder.
*  When Deontay Wilder freaked out on you,
*  it became this huge, huge fucking thing.
*  To this day.
*  To this day.
*  To this day.
*  He puts it on his Instagram.
*  He puts it in hashtags.
*  Till this day.
*  He sells sweatshirts with till this day on them.
*  There's a store that's adjacent to the Barclay Center.
*  It's connected to the Barclay Center.
*  And it's full of shit.
*  It says, to this day on it.
*  He had a grand opening there.
*  I was invited to it.
*  So that is an iconic meme.
*  This is now a major part of my identity.
*  Do people associate you with it, though?
*  Do they automatically?
*  Or do they just associate?
*  Because you see the side of your face,
*  but you see him angry as fuck.
*  Arguably the scariest heavyweight of all time.
*  I mean, Mike Tyson's right up there.
*  See, off ring, outside the ring, Deontay is a sweetheart.
*  He's a really nice guy.
*  So to see him angry outside the ring is kind of weird.
*  Because I had him on the podcast.
*  He couldn't be a nicer guy.
*  He's true.
*  He's a really nice guy.
*  And so to see him angry at you, to this day,
*  and giving you crazy eyes that was like, oh.
*  And when you explained it, it's like, yeah,
*  that's what you do in an interview.
*  You want someone to expand and say,
*  what do you mean by that?
*  Yeah, and listen, man.
*  This is not like the first day we met.
*  It's not like I just happened upon this heavyweight champion
*  of the world screaming and decided to piss him off.
*  We've had multiple conversations,
*  sat down for hours at a time.
*  In fact, in Belfast, in Germany, Ireland, we sat down
*  for an hour.
*  And so I'm going to give you the context of what
*  I was thinking in the moment.
*  He's on stage.
*  Tell him, because some people might not
*  be aware of exactly what happened.
*  So just try to.
*  So there it is right there.
*  In a couple weeks, we're going to see it again.
*  I don't know if we're going to see the exact same thing
*  happen.
*  It comes up.
*  It's going to come up.
*  It's seasonal.
*  Deontay Wilder is facing Tyson Fury.
*  Tyson Fury is a British gypsy.
*  He is a boisterous, very animated showman in boxing.
*  Heavyweights, mind you, these guys are giants.
*  First time they met.
*  This is December 18.
*  So I travel the world covering boxing.
*  Everywhere, like I said, I sat down with this guy in Ireland.
*  I've covered Tyson Fury in England.
*  I've covered him in America.
*  I've covered boxing literally everywhere.
*  So I'm familiar with what you also know that fighting,
*  even combat sports, boxing, MMA, there
*  is a regional aspect to it.
*  Everybody's culture brings something to it.
*  The Irish fighter feels like he's got a certain style.
*  He's got a certain history.
*  He's got a claim to the warrior legacy.
*  Same for the British fighter, of course, the American fighter.
*  But both of these guys come from what's
*  like an underclass of their society.
*  Travelers, gypsies in England are looked down upon.
*  These people are cultural fighters.
*  And I don't mean necessarily just the oppression
*  of being an underclass, but fighting
*  is part of their tradition, almost
*  like it is to Mexicans in Mexico.
*  It's something that they do that bonds the clan.
*  They believe in the history of it.
*  Obviously, Deontay Waters from Alabama,
*  he's his darkest midnight.
*  He is a descendant of slaves for sure.
*  He's got a history coming to any fight,
*  bringing what he experiences in this country
*  to this element of the face off one man, one man versus one man.
*  So when Tyson Fury is on stage during the press conference,
*  it's something that possessed him to say,
*  I'm coming from a fighting people.
*  My people have been fighting for 200 years.
*  Well, in context, he means that the culture of travelers,
*  of gypsies, is one of we're fighting men.
*  I'm a fighting man.
*  That's something that they say about themselves and each other.
*  So that's what he's bringing to this argument.
*  That's how he's challenging Wilder.
*  But Wilder takes that and says, 200 years of fight?
*  My people have been fighting for 400 years.
*  Of course, he's talking about the black experience in America,
*  slavery, all alike.
*  But mind you, he's talking to a British fighter.
*  He's talking to a world audience.
*  It's not like he's fighting Dominic Brazil.
*  You understand, where it's two Americans,
*  probably not going to get that much international attention.
*  The world's watching, particularly communities
*  that don't necessarily know, when a black man says 400 years,
*  you know, I know, you know, because we grew up in America,
*  you know what we're talking about.
*  The world doesn't know that.
*  I travel the world.
*  They're not just, they're not steeped
*  in black American history.
*  I've had conversations with him.
*  He loves to talk about the plight of the black man in America
*  and how it relates to his career,
*  how he feels disadvantaged in certain ways,
*  and he carries the mantle in other ways.
*  He's a champion of black America in certain ways,
*  and he's a victim of white America in other ways.
*  So when I see this argument happening, I'm like, oh, OK,
*  well, this is definitely a moment.
*  But I'm not a pool reporter, right?
*  So in this particular instance, it's unusual for me to be part
*  of the scrum, is what they call it.
*  Collection of reporters, everybody's kind of shouting
*  questions out, just trying to evoke responses.
*  Usually I'm a one-on-one guy.
*  I'll wait my turn, right?
*  But on this particular day, I don't know the other way.
*  I didn't have a haircut.
*  I wasn't really.
*  I just got back from Dubai.
*  I went to Dubai with, like, Dave Chappelle.
*  I'm hanging out.
*  It's after Thanksgiving.
*  I was like, you know what?
*  I'm going to kind of mail this one in, to be honest.
*  I'm thinking, let me throw something out,
*  because I know what he's talking about,
*  and I also know that the audience around us,
*  in the world especially, may not have caught that reference.
*  But he is, he's a high watermark right now.
*  It's Thursday and the fight's Saturday.
*  So he's amped up.
*  Yeah, that's the other thing.
*  Fight week, fighters are not them.
*  So it's not the guy you were sitting across from
*  doing the experience.
*  You know what I mean?
*  That guy was having a good day.
*  This guy's been waiting to fight for at least three months,
*  if not, you know, 10 weeks.
*  Ramped up.
*  Ramped, right?
*  He comes off stage.
*  He answers a couple of other questions.
*  And then, just to be sure, because I've
*  been doing this a long time, I'm not an idiot.
*  I know he's amped.
*  And I want him to get the question clearly.
*  Deontay, Radio Rahim.
*  I say my name so he knows who it's coming from.
*  Not because he doesn't know me, but because he does.
*  So, Radio Rahim, you just said your people
*  have been fighting for 400 years.
*  OK, first of all, I'm in the midst of my question.
*  I don't do these things haphazardly.
*  I word my questions very carefully.
*  Yes.
*  But in the ears of Black America, later in this story
*  you'll find out that your people, that part of the question,
*  became incredibly important.
*  And people were very sensitive about that.
*  Because you said your people instead of our people.
*  Because I said your people instead of our people.
*  But I'm fucking quoting the guy.
*  Right.
*  OK?
*  I'm not speaking for him.
*  I'm quoting what he said.
*  He said, my people have been fighting for 400 years.
*  So if he had said our people, I would have said our people.
*  But I can't take possession of your quote.
*  It's not me saying it.
*  Right.
*  It's you saying it.
*  Right.
*  Your people have been fighting for 400 years.
*  What did you mean by that?
*  So, I mean, laser focus turns to me, he's already at 10.
*  Like, there's no ramp up at this time.
*  And he started shouting in my face, like, your people too.
*  Like, you know what I'm talking about.
*  He says, don't try to bait.
*  You know what I'm talking about when I say these things.
*  When I'm like, oh yeah, I do.
*  Can you tell them what you're talking about?
*  You're trying to get them to expand.
*  I'm trying to get them to explain to the world what
*  he said to me on numerous occasions
*  in different interviews and off camera.
*  I know exactly what he's talking about.
*  And I know that this is the moment that he finally
*  gets to talk about it to people who have never
*  been listening to him before.
*  Right.
*  But.
*  When he heard your, it was a trigger for him too.
*  I'm so oblivious.
*  And even looking back, I'm like, man, how did you miss that?
*  I swear to God, I didn't know what the fuck was the problem.
*  He starts saying, shouting your people.
*  And I'm like, well, it took me him.
*  He needed to keep saying it because I
*  didn't know why he was saying that.
*  Yeah, my people too.
*  My people too.
*  Oh.
*  There's a moment I'm like, oh, uh-oh.
*  Oh, no.
*  Oh, no.
*  I thought he was shouting at them.
*  He's shouting at me.
*  Oh, my goodness.
*  Oh, no.
*  You know, our people have been fighting for 400 years
*  to this day, to this day.
*  And so what I wanted, what I wanted,
*  what I thought was happening was that, OK, this moment now
*  has become about him attacking me because he
*  thinks I'm attacking him.
*  He thinks because I do know what he's talking about.
*  He knows we've spoken about it numerous times.
*  He thinks I'm pretending not to know, like some air quotes,
*  Uncle Tom, or whatever, the numerous names
*  I've been called on the internet since,
*  as though I'm trying to pretend like, oh, 400 years?
*  What does that mean?
*  You know what I mean?
*  I'm like, OK.
*  OK.
*  OK, fine.
*  So when he's screaming at you, what
*  is going through your mind when he's hitting you with,
*  is it to this day or till this day?
*  Because there is a debate on that.
*  First of all.
*  Let's see.
*  Let's play it.
*  Play it.
*  Yo, what you mean by that?
*  You know what I'm talking about.
*  Y'all all know what I'm talking about, man.
*  Don't sit up here and try to bait.
*  And not know what I'm talking about.
*  Y'all know what the fuck I talk about when I say these things.
*  You're people too.
*  Explain it.
*  I ain't got to explain what you're talking about.
*  Radio Raheem, I don't have to explain what's understood, man.
*  You know what I mean by that.
*  You know what I said by that.
*  I ain't got to go farther.
*  And if anybody don't understand that, then God be with them.
*  Go look up the history.
*  Go look up the history.
*  Shit, ain't don't everybody believe in Google?
*  Go Google that shit.
*  See what I'm talking about.
*  You know what I'm talking about, man.
*  You know what I'm talking about.
*  I dare you to sit up there and say this.
*  Lane, you know what I'm talking about, man.
*  He's fighting people.
*  You know we've been fighting 400 and still fighting to this day.
*  To this day.
*  To this day.
*  You just sit here and you don't know what I'm talking about?
*  I mean, I'm out of here, bro.
*  Let's go.
*  Let's go, man.
*  Fuck.
*  OK, see, you don't have to keep playing it.
*  But just so you know, there's more to this video.
*  In fact, the last thing I said is, oh, we know what he's talking about.
*  That's what I just said at the end.
*  But that clip everyone in the world has seen,
*  it's very neatly on Instagram in a minute.
*  Oh, no.
*  Right?
*  So you missed the beginning and the end, but the drama.
*  Welcome to 2020 or 19 or welcome to the new age of clips
*  and things being taken out of context.
*  So listen, this is not the first time I've had an interview that has,
*  you know, gotten a major attention.
*  Not the first time a fighter has been pissed off at me.
*  I knew that this was going to be a big thing.
*  I knew people were going to talk about it.
*  Bro, I had no fucking concept of what was about to happen to my night.
*  Like, I'm like, basically when you're a reporter like this, you're like, OK,
*  well, that was dramatic.
*  I've got a hot one.
*  Now I might get me a few hundred thousand, if not a million views, maybe.
*  Like, this is yeah, we got the champ.
*  But also I'm thinking, you know, it's something of a success.
*  Like, OK, we got him to express, at least it is in that moment,
*  something that we don't usually see.
*  It's fight week. We talked to this guy a million times.
*  Everyone's had their interviews.
*  He's been on every show.
*  And that was like the realest moment in the whole buildup.
*  So for me, that in and of itself is something of a victory.
*  Like you've created a moment here where you got to see inside the champ's heart.
*  You got to see, like, his passion.
*  When I get home, though, I got to take a nap.
*  Like, it's a little long day. It's good.
*  So as as these stories tend to go, I'm woken up by chimes on my phone.
*  Chaching, chaching, chaching, chaching, chaching, chaching.
*  What the fuck's going on?
*  What's going on in the interim?
*  He's posted on Instagram just a minute of what is really like a two and a half
*  minute interview where it looks so bad.
*  And then he's written like a paragraph, essentially, about having to, like,
*  you know, teach people, like basically not to be Uncle Tom's and how you got to
*  like straighten it out.
*  And like, there's a whole civil rights diatribe.
*  And I'm the pincushion.
*  Right. Like, I'm the straw man.
*  I'm the guy. Oh, my God.
*  I start to, of course, read the comments.
*  Like, well, maybe is there any possible way this is good, bro?
*  Everybody's like, fuck that guy.
*  Uncle Tom, Uncle Rugged Cellow.
*  You know, I always hated this motherfucker.
*  Like, oh, no, oh, no.
*  I'm also not like a stranger to criticism, not a stranger.
*  YouTube comes. I live on YouTube.
*  It's one of the most vicious places on Earth.
*  If you ever want to like just get like humbled, if you ever feeling too big
*  about yourself, post a YouTube video, let it sit there for about an hour
*  and then start reading the comments.
*  OK, here we are.
*  It'll bring it down a notch.
*  But this is another element.
*  Bro, Rihanna was like upset, like at me.
*  I don't want Rihanna mad at me.
*  I don't even know Rihanna.
*  Like, why? I don't want to start our relationship this way.
*  What is going on?
*  Snoop Dogg, who we all now know,
*  can be incredibly vicious when he's upset at somebody over something.
*  You know, nobody.
*  You know, you teach that cello like, yeah, you know, put it
*  inward in his place like, bro, Snoop Dogg's mad at me.
*  Oh, no.
*  What are you feeling when this is going on?
*  How many knots are in your stomach?
*  I'm panicking. I'm panicking.
*  I'm way more comfortable with him shouting in my face
*  and having no idea whether or not like this can go any kind of way.
*  But at least I understand the moment.
*  Like, at least I'm in control of half of it. Right.
*  This is a this is a train on fire off the rails.
*  You know what I mean?
*  And of course, the more people respond to it, celebrities and,
*  you know, other fighters and alike,
*  the more emboldened he is to double down on it.
*  Like, hell, this is a moment.
*  The fight's not selling well.
*  You know what I mean?
*  They've been giving him stick overseas for not being known anywhere.
*  They're saying you can walk down the street and, you know, Eddie Hernd
*  to this video where he's asking people in New York, like,
*  do they know Deontay Wilder is?
*  And he made a whole video of them saying no.
*  So at this moment, you also have to give context of what's happening in his career.
*  At this moment, he's knocking everybody out.
*  It's WBC heavyweight champion.
*  He can't get the fight to unify like with Joshua.
*  They're saying he's a nobody, essentially.
*  He's not worth the money because nobody knows who he is.
*  He's fighting, arguably, the toughest fight he could have possibly picked.
*  Tyson Fury is an incredibly technical fighter.
*  No one thinks of Deontay Wilder as a technical technician.
*  Like they're thinking this guy's going to get outclassed.
*  He can lose his belts this way and not be making it.
*  It's not like he made a shit ton of money for that fight.
*  So now that all his attention is on him.
*  And like I said, it's a subject he loves to talk about.
*  He's a hero.
*  He's like a champion of black America in this moment.
*  I'm just like, you know, collateral damage.
*  Boost the fuck out of that fight, though.
*  Take it sales through the roof.
*  The the moments viral, it's everywhere.
*  People didn't even know the fight was happening until this meme
*  just is in their inboxes.
*  People, people are like, look at this.
*  The to this day meme is taking over the Internet and it'll speak to your soul.
*  Yeah. Oh, my goodness.
*  This became like the flagship moment
*  for black woke people to tell, like, you know, the black
*  meme to its Kermit with a fucking oxygen mask on.
*  And it says, you still on your parents phone.
*  Me dot with.
*  To this day. Right.
*  The fucking Internet.
*  The Internet is so goddamn funny.
*  It's unbeatable.
*  Oh, my God. At this point, it's kicking my ass.
*  Oh, my God.
*  Damn, dude.
*  Yeah. So as this thing gets bigger and bigger,
*  I start to realize that it's well out of my control.
*  And then I have to start to think about what my role really is.
*  It's not about me.
*  It's not what I do isn't so that people can feel one way or another about me.
*  It's really, again, taking myself back to that initial moment
*  of showing them something about the fighter that they haven't seen.
*  Let's get a look inside this guy and get him to share something.
*  Usually just verbally that they didn't know or that he was.
*  He didn't come to the room expecting to share. Right.
*  And I support people understanding
*  the culture from which he we come as black Americans.
*  I wanted to give him the stage to do exactly that.
*  Didn't turn out like I expected.
*  In a kind of like civil rights, I guess, type of moment.
*  It became one of those things that people identify with black power,
*  black information being like, yo, this is this is what we're experiencing.
*  And this is how deep it still runs at that time in 2018.
*  Did you think about it in retrospect?
*  How could I phrase that better?
*  I mean, sure, you did. Right.
*  What could you have said?
*  Because you wanted to get that out of there.
*  You wanted to get him to expand on it.
*  I think that it was exactly the right thing at the right time.
*  I couldn't have predicted in a million years it would have went that way.
*  But that's the way it was supposed to go.
*  If I had phrased it so-called better and he had given a more reasoned,
*  thoughtful answer, we wouldn't be sitting here.
*  He would have made less money to the fight,
*  would have sold less tickets, less pay per views.
*  No, that wouldn't have went viral.
*  You wouldn't have gave a shit about my side of the story.
*  The moment doesn't exist. Right. Right.
*  And that's the beauty of it.
*  You were telling me in the back of the comedy star, I'm like, oh, shit, that's you.
*  Right. Oh, my God.
*  So the blessing and the angle on the camera work
*  in some regard is some people don't know it's me.
*  And I'm so happy for that.
*  Oh, my God.
*  And the but the ones who do, there's enough who do.
*  So I'm telling you, Joe, every day since then, it's been over a year now.
*  Someone somewhere every time I've left my home and sometimes while I'm still in it,
*  has shouted in my face to this day.
*  That's how they say hello.
*  Some people don't even know my name.
*  To this day, to this day.
*  Oh, my God.
*  Oh, my God.
*  Yeah. Oh, my God.
*  But, you know, hey, man, it's a godsend, really.
*  It's something that captured everybody's attention in a moment.
*  And if it had been anything else, I can't imagine how it would have done that.
*  It wouldn't have. No, it had to be that crazy in his eyes
*  because he's so ramped up getting ready for that fight.
*  And he's so angry.
*  He takes the glasses off.
*  I'm like, I remember watching. I was nervous. I was nowhere near him.
*  Yeah. You must have been shit in your pants. OK.
*  But you know him. Right.
*  So you probably weren't shit in your pants, but you're probably like very uncomfortable.
*  I absolutely was not shit in my pants.
*  I wasn't. In fact, in the in the exchange, I'm quite calm.
*  I'm just trying on the one hand, I'm trying to figure out
*  what's happening in the beginning, because I didn't understand, like,
*  the rage being directed at me for I'm telling you, for a minute.
*  I thought he was just talking white America.
*  I was like, yeah, get him. You know what I mean?
*  I'm half way through this thing.
*  Oh, my goodness. This is this is my bad.
*  According to him. Oh, my goodness.
*  Oh, yeah, I get him.
*  So once he's like, you know, I'm dumb.
*  You know, man, like he walks off in disgust.
*  I then fight him 20 minutes later and I interview him again.
*  This time, in much more calm than reasoned fashion,
*  I let him lay out what it was about, what I expected happened the first time.
*  A lot of people have seen it.
*  Not a fraction of the people who've seen that.
*  I do know the guy, but as you know, these people are warriors, man.
*  And their blood's running high.
*  And they and he saw red like at that time.
*  We weren't friends. We weren't homies.
*  He didn't remember Belfast.
*  He didn't. He thought I was coming for him.
*  So even though I know him, I don't know him.
*  No, I mean, I don't know what's really going to happen in this moment.
*  Right. I'm just doing my job.
*  I can't be afraid to do that.
*  So whatever happens in this moment, this is what's going to be.
*  You've got a great perspective on it, though.
*  You're so right that without that moment blowing up like that,
*  the fight doesn't become as big as it is.
*  The meme doesn't exist. You don't become more popular. Right.
*  And he even did like a segment
*  before a fight on Showtime, where he like, you know, went through
*  black, like a black history segment
*  on Showtime because of this.
*  Like it actually created a moment that put him in position
*  to be the kind of representative of that issue that he wanted to be.
*  And it gave me an opportunity to be seen, even though
*  in a lot of quarters, initially negatively, I was also seen
*  as the journalist who pulled that out.
*  Like I'm the other guy.
*  I'm the guy on the other side of that camera that, yes, created that moment.
*  And I've been doing this long enough to where my fan base,
*  people who know my work, who understand me, they know that.
*  I think they know I'm not an idiot.
*  And I like to think they know I'm not a sellout,
*  but they don't really know me because I don't ever make it about me.
*  I don't like this interview we're having is a is a unicorn.
*  Like I've maybe done three or four or five of these in my entire life,
*  where I'm talking about my perspective on anything.
*  I'm entirely showing up at every press conference, every fight,
*  every way in every media workout, trying to get something out of the fighter
*  to be consumed by the audience in a way that maybe they hadn't seen it before.
*  Not just for the audience's sake, but I want the fighter to get in touch
*  with something like there's so many of these platitude questions
*  in the same old shit and nobody's really like digging deep.
*  These aren't one dimensional characters.
*  These aren't actual bulls.
*  These aren't just gladiators or fathers, their sons.
*  They're like they have civil rights issues.
*  They have cultural things are bringing to this thing.
*  They have all like depression.
*  We know all the things that fighters go through,
*  but they only want to show you one side because they don't want to show any
*  vulnerability and their fans aren't interested in like anything other than
*  who's up and who's down. If that's all you're feeding them.
*  Yeah. So I try to get out of the way.
*  I don't want to get in front of the work.
*  So when people see me in this line, a lot of people are just like, oh,
*  this guy must be a fucking Uncle Tom then.
*  Wilder, Rihanna and Snoop Dogg think so.
*  Clearly that's who this guy is.
*  Have you talked to Snoop since?
*  No, I didn't talk to Snoop then.
*  He just like he just put it on Instagram.
*  That's what I'm saying. Oh, no.
*  But I have talked to Wilder many times since then.
*  And to this guy's credit, never even even the even the 20 minutes after.
*  You're right. We did know each other.
*  We do have a history and he is now knowing the moment they created and knowing
*  what he did to me in that moment has always been especially gracious.
*  He's always been especially helpful. I can always get access to him.
*  We have a bond now.
*  Like we share this thing that's inextricable no matter what happens.
*  Oh my goodness. That's amazing.
*  So I don't think there's another boxing interview like that ever,
*  ever. There's nothing like it. There's nothing like it.
*  There's one where like remember when Larry Merchant was talking to Floyd Mayweather,
*  he's like, you were 20 years younger.
*  Or if I was 20 years younger, I'd kick your ass. Right.
*  Remember that? To me, with all due respect to Larry Merchant, a legend and an icon on that
*  microphone shouldn't have said that.
*  Of course not. Yeah, that's ridiculous.
*  It's not only is it ridiculous.
*  It's preposterous.
*  You're talking to the best boxer ever.
*  He would have kicked his ass when you were younger.
*  Oh, really, Larry?
*  Yeah. How old was he going to be at the time?
*  Because when you were 50, he's probably still an embryo.
*  At that time, you probably could have kicked his ass.
*  Yeah. When he was four.
*  Anything after 10, I'm rooting on Floyd.
*  Larry, in the moment, made it about him.
*  Like, you know what I mean?
*  Yeah. Well, he did that a lot.
*  You know, which is, yeah.
*  Well, it if not made it about him, he insulted fighters a lot.
*  There was there was a lot of that.
*  Yeah, I feel like what Merchant did that people objected to was he had his own
*  standard by which you had to win the fight and by which you had to get his respect,
*  even if you won, that everybody doesn't share.
*  And it's like there's no.
*  So he existed in a vacuum.
*  This is before the Internet.
*  And one of the things I think about Internet commentary in the age of the Internet
*  is you're accountable, you're accountable in a different way.
*  Back then, if you were Howard Cosell or if you were anyone who was commenting on
*  sports, you really could kind of get away with it other than what radio guys would
*  say about you or journalists would say about you.
*  But the regular person didn't have a say.
*  They now know the regular person is off.
*  Fuck load to say.
*  Trust me as a commentator, you know, I mean, I know when I've made mistakes, you
*  know, I don't have to read the comments.
*  I know if I fuck something up and but don't let me know.
*  I don't mind.
*  In fact, I encourage a regular person to have something to say.
*  It's these strange motherfuckers that are like really should probably pipe down.
*  Like if you and you do because you're on YouTube and you're on the Internet, the
*  the amount of comments that are useful or thoughtful or like, OK, interesting.
*  Ninety percent, maybe 92.
*  But there's like eight percent that eight percent of really just like vitriolic,
*  racist, sexist, like violent trolls.
*  Yeah.
*  Shit posters.
*  It's a good way to put it.
*  Yeah, that's the expression.
*  Shit posting.
*  I heard it, but it's wildly accurate.
*  It's like a Reddit thing.
*  Right.
*  4chan Reddit.
*  Yeah.
*  That's they call it shit posting.
*  Guys do it on purpose.
*  All they're trying to do is get a rise out of you.
*  They're trying to say the most fucked up thing to you to make other people laugh.
*  And to get a rise out of you.
*  And if you met them in real life, they'd be like, I'm sorry, I'm just bored at work.
*  Like a lot of them or they're 12.
*  You know, Deontay went and like beat a guy up that was.
*  Oh, well, that guy that he beat up, that guy is fucking crazy.
*  That guy would fight every, you know, Floyd Mayweather, senior beat his ass.
*  Did you ever see that?
*  I didn't see that.
*  Yeah.
*  What is it?
*  What the fuck's his name?
*  Charlie's Zelnoff.
*  That is his name?
*  Ah, yeah, that is his name.
*  That rings a bell.
*  When I was watching him box Deontay, I'm like, is this guy out of his fucking mind?
*  And then Deontay was beating his ass outside the ring.
*  He wouldn't let him go.
*  I support that.
*  I support that too.
*  That guy's a troll and he sucker punches people.
*  Like he tried to sucker punch Floyd senior.
*  He was beating Floyd senior was beating his ass and he got tired and he quit.
*  Floyd senior moved away and he jumped through the ropes and took a wild haymaker swing on him.
*  But I think he's legitimately mentally deranged.
*  Like there's something wrong with him.
*  I did see that.
*  Yeah.
*  So Deontay beat the fuck out of him.
*  Those are the people that are like the loudest in the room.
*  A normal person will post a comment for or against criticism or congratulations and kind
*  of leave it at that.
*  Maybe like a couple other posts, but that kind of guy, a shit poster, it's going to
*  be every couple of hours.
*  He's going to be engaging people.
*  He's going to be all over your threat.
*  Right.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Hey, look at this.
*  Imagine he ate that left hook and just sat down.
*  I mean, he's fortunate he's still alive, but then he still went after him.
*  Like that was his thing.
*  He would like go, no, no, no, I'm done.
*  I'm done.
*  I'm done.
*  And then he would like run after him.
*  He basically fights like he comments.
*  Well, he's just a crazy person.
*  There's something wrong with him.
*  But what do you think?
*  I think that the internet now is to a place where you can drag people, you can change
*  their lives.
*  You can like actually put them in harm's way by stirring up a fervor around being
*  violent towards them that everybody should have to be identified on the internet.
*  I don't believe in this, like anonymous posting shit posters, all this shit.
*  The problem with that is there's a lot of people that have things to say that are
*  important and they don't want to suffer consequences at work or their job.
*  They want to be able to whistle blow and say, Hey, there's like some safety problems
*  here or there's some sexual harassment here or there's this or that there's
*  benefits to being anonymous.
*  And then there's negative aspects of it.
*  I see both things.
*  Well, I mean, that person is that in a comment section though?
*  This is what I feel like.
*  I feel like if someone is saying some horrible shit, then yes.
*  But if someone is just explaining something that's going down, like there's
*  people that have talked about like unfair labor practices or things that are going
*  down at work and they, they literally have to be anonymous in order to leak this
*  information, particularly if they're talking about someone from another country
*  and they're doing it through a VPN, like they have to do it this way.
*  They have to do it anonymously.
*  Otherwise their life is in danger and they need to get the word out.
*  Like there's like real crimes taking place.
*  There's a real issue.
*  I see, I see your perspective that there's a lot of cunts online and they,
*  they think it's cute and those, those fuckers should be outed.
*  Yeah.
*  And I think, I know, I'm not sure that you should be, all right.
*  I'm not, there are times in which people are, uh, unjustly
*  punished for having reasonable opinions or going against the grain or something
*  like that, but generally if you say something publicly for public consumption,
*  you should be willing to accept the consequences of that.
*  There's no, again, if it's not something where you are putting
*  yourself in danger to expose a crime.
*  Right.
*  But who's doing that?
*  And like YouTube comment sections are on my Instagram, Facebook.
*  But here's the thing.
*  You shouldn't be reading that shit anyway.
*  Everyone says that.
*  I don't read it.
*  I don't read shit.
*  I don't read a goddamn thing.
*  When you poke it, when the show goes up, whatever show it is, the next experience
*  for the first hour or two, you're not scanning it a little bit.
*  No fucking chance.
*  No fucking chance.
*  No, I have discipline.
*  I mean, I have in the past, like way long ago, but within the last couple of years,
*  Hmm.
*  I don't.
*  It's a waste of time.
*  It's not good for you.
*  And what are you going to learn?
*  You're awesome.
*  What are you going to learn?
*  What are you going to learn?
*  People love you.
*  If people don't love me by now, like some people don't love me by now, what am I doing wrong?
*  I've been doing this fucking show for 10 years.
*  I'm assuming people, some people enjoy it.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I enjoy talking to regular folks.
*  Like if you said, Hey man, I got a lot out of that episode where that doctor talked
*  about this or something, Oh, okay, cool.
*  That's awesome.
*  I like that.
*  Those are fun conversations, but just throwing yourself into the wolves of the
*  comments, covering yourself up with fucking blood and just leaping into the pan of wolves.
*  I am willing to throw myself on the fire just to pick out the few little pieces of
*  charcoal that I can use to like warm my next interview.
*  Sometimes people, I mean, like my, I don't consider myself, uh, one of these people
*  who come to an interview with an agenda and I've got a point of view in the end,
*  the fighter has to answer to me more.
*  So I'm gleaning from the audience what it is that they want to know or perspectives
*  that they've, I mean, disagree with personally, but I want to present their
*  perspective to people they can't get at or talk to.
*  So I have to like be listening to what they're saying and understand how they're
*  consuming information.
*  What they're saying about you, say if you're talking about, you know, you're going to
*  interview, uh, Kenello or someone through an interpreter, you would, you know, you
*  there's plenty of people with perspectives on Kenello.
*  You don't have to listen to anything they have to say about you.
*  Yeah, it's dangerous.
*  It's not good.
*  See, see this, this, this wrestling match that you're doing inside your head.
*  Everybody does this.
*  Everybody does this.
*  The solution is don't read the comments.
*  When people say mean, horrible things about you, just don't read it.
*  Don't read it.
*  Look, if people are talking about you right now in a barbershop somewhere, you
*  don't know, right?
*  Should you go there so you feel bad?
*  Listen to every word.
*  That's basically what you're doing.
*  If you get it into the comments, like it's at a certain point in time, it becomes
*  untenable.
*  And in my life, it's untenable.
*  This is just, the volume is insane.
*  It's not possible and it's not healthy.
*  And most of it's positive, right?
*  If I, if I go on my Instagram, like if I looked at comments, I'm sure most of it's
*  positive, but I just post and go post and go.
*  Do people stop you in the streets to give you their opinion?
*  Because you, you call fights and everybody's got an opinion.
*  You know what?
*  Political comments more than anything, man.
*  I had a fucking guy where I was playing pool and he wanted to talk to me about an
*  Abby Martin interview that I had.
*  Yeah, you let her off the hook.
*  And I go, I'm here to play pool.
*  I'm not here to talk fucking Venezuela with you.
*  I don't know jack shit about Palestine.
*  Like just leave me alone.
*  I'm here to play pool, bro.
*  This is work.
*  I don't come to your job, right?
*  And then fucking talk to you about some shit like don't come on or come to you in
*  the street and talk to you about your job.
*  This is, you know, it's, I I'm happy to talk to people.
*  But I'm not going to debate whether or not they're right or I'm wrong.
*  Or you put so much more yourself out there.
*  I'm out there plenty.
*  I don't need to be out there anymore.
*  Yeah.
*  So yeah, they don't know.
*  Like I don't put anything.
*  Well, you put it out now.
*  Now people get you.
*  So here we are.
*  Well, people get that, you know, the way you explained it backstage when we were
*  at the comic store, I was laughing so hard because it was, it was so funny.
*  Like you, like the emotions of it all.
*  Like you explaining what it was like.
*  Like, of course I fucking know what he's saying.
*  I was trying to get him to explain it to people who might not understand his
*  personal perspective.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's, it was, it's still such a big part now of my identity.
*  Yes.
*  That, uh, it can't be understated how big one minute.
*  Yeah.
*  The thing was one minute on Instagram and it's the way that a lot of people
*  identify me, like I say more, they say tennis day more than they say my name.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's also his most famous clip on, including the knockouts.
*  Yeah.
*  40 knockouts.
*  Still, they care more about that than those.
*  But you have to look at it this way.
*  I think, I mean, you don't have to, but this is my perspective.
*  This thing that can abuse us, the internet with comments and 15 year old
*  assholes saying mean shit to you.
*  What it also is, is an avenue for you to put your stuff out there that would not
*  have existed before, before you would have had to been hired by CBS or ABC or
*  whoever name it.
*  You don't have to be hired by anybody anymore.
*  But the other side of that is the comment section.
*  Now you can be one of those guys that turns the comment section off, but man,
*  I don't think that's a good idea.
*  I don't think that's a good idea either.
*  We accidentally had the comment section turned off back when we used to stream
*  because we were streaming live and it wasn't that we turned it off, but we had
*  it off. We had the chat off on the streaming because people would just like
*  say a bunch of rude shit just so that other people had to read it while the
*  podcast was going on.
*  I'm like, look at these people are just taking advantage of this.
*  So, but something happened when we flipped it over to live, there was a bug.
*  And for how long was it that it did that, Jamie, where the comments were turned
*  off? It wasn't that long, but it was long enough for people to freak the fuck out.
*  And I'm like, Hey, hey, hey, I'm not turning any comments off.
*  Like you fucking say whatever you want to say.
*  I'm not reading it, but you say whatever the fuck you want to say.
*  Go have fun.
*  So this this medium, this avenue for putting out content never existed before.
*  It exists now, but also people's ability to comment exists.
*  And I think most people are rational.
*  Most people, the vast majority, are just commenting on it.
*  They might disagree with you.
*  They might think you suck.
*  They might tell you why you suck, but they're pretty rational.
*  They're like, man, he just talks about himself or he does this or he has to bring it back to that or he blah, blah, blah.
*  You know, there's going to be people having their perspectives and then they debate those perspectives with other people in the thread.
*  There's nothing wrong with that, but there's going to be a certain percentage that are out of their fucking mind or they're 15 and they're angry.
*  And, you know, like I was just talking about this in the last podcast with my friend, Justin Martindale.
*  I was like, when I was 15, man, thank God Twitter wasn't a thing.
*  I would have said the dumbest shit.
*  I would have found celebrities.
*  I would have said mean shit to them.
*  I mean, I would have been, I was a fucked up kid.
*  And they'd be digging those tweets up now and like canceling you today.
*  Well, they're doing that to kids now that get gigs and then they find in their tweets when they were 17, 18 years old and now they're 24.
*  Like, hey, it's a different fucking human being, man.
*  Like we need a path to redemption for people and Twitter and Facebook and all these comments that are permanently on the record.
*  They make it really difficult for kids.
*  I would not want to be in high school today with a Twitter account saying the dumbest fucking shit in the world and then having that come back to haunt me when I want a job someday.
*  Right.
*  You don't know what the world's going to be like in 15 years.
*  And hopefully you're not the same as you were 15 years ago.
*  If anything, let's commend the person that doesn't look anything like they'd look when they were 15.
*  But we don't want that.
*  Nobody wants that.
*  You know, there's a thing with comedy, right?
*  Where you have to leave your town because they won't appreciate you.
*  They only they remember you when you sucked.
*  Like when I lived in Boston, when I started out as an open mic, I was fucking terrible.
*  Everybody's terrible when they start.
*  I was terrible.
*  And so they thought I was terrible.
*  And then I had to leave.
*  I had to leave.
*  Even though I'd gotten better, they still thought I was terrible.
*  I had to leave and I had to get TV shows and then come back.
*  And then they're like, oh, yeah, you got better.
*  He's OK.
*  Yeah.
*  But the people that you would go to Pittsburgh, they never saw you before.
*  They're like, you're hilarious.
*  Mike, thank you.
*  Tell the people in Boston, would you?
*  But what about the Internet for comedians?
*  Like the kind of thing that you do, developing bits and having to have an opportunity to
*  put them on stage before everybody sees them.
*  And like you say, they see the joke at all different stages.
*  How can you create a bit on the road with as much Internet, as many people like posting
*  your jokes?
*  Most people don't believe it or not.
*  Most people cool about it.
*  Sometimes sets get leaked like Louis CK set.
*  Like that was a big deal.
*  Right.
*  Then that was he hadn't done stand up in 10 months.
*  And then they put it most comedy fans don't want to ruin it for everybody else.
*  Most, most.
*  If you're a real comedy fan, like if you go see Dave and he's working some shit out of
*  the store, you're not going to film it and put it online.
*  Most people are not going to do that.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, there's no better example for me than Dave Chappelle on like how to do it.
*  I mean, that's how he's met at the comedy store.
*  You and I, you know, obviously Dave's my best friend.
*  And I've watched him like, like walk through these minefields of all this shit.
*  And the main thing you like to say is like, you know, live right now, like live in the
*  moment, put your phones away and just like be present and all that.
*  And I've never seen a guy other than him be able to convince an entire room of people.
*  I don't even mean at his own show, like he'll pop up somewhere where everybody's already
*  got their phones out there, like filming mayor or the roots or whatever it is.
*  They came to see Dave, put those damn phones away.
*  Let's have a minute. Let's make a memory and put an entire room of people can stuff
*  those phones in their pocket.
*  Even Dave, like when we do, when Dave and I do gigs on the road, we use those Vero bags.
*  What is it?
*  No, it's what it's called.
*  Yonder.
*  Yonder.
*  Yonder bags.
*  What is Vero?
*  But I mean, he even started that.
*  Yeah.
*  Yonder bags.
*  No, we've been doing, I've been doing yonder bags for years and they, the first time I
*  ever used them, the Denver Comedy Works actually started using them independently.
*  And the first time I had heard about them was like, it's been a few years, but comics
*  like Ali Wong, she uses them at all her shows.
*  I used them a lot up until my last Netflix special.
*  Then I got tired of using them.
*  It's just like, I'm like, I don't want to tell people to put their fucking phone away.
*  You know, the most hilarious thing was Miami because Miami is such a party town, right?
*  And half the audience is probably coked up and is the only audience when they had the
*  yonder bags where they just kept getting up and going outside because they wanted to use
*  their phone.
*  They didn't just sit down and enjoy the show.
*  Most places that 99.99999% everybody just sits down and they go, all right, my phone's
*  in the bag now.
*  Let me just enjoy the show.
*  And it makes the show better.
*  In Miami, the whole audience is people getting up and going out and coming back, getting
*  up, going out and coming back.
*  They go to the bathroom, either to do coke or to fucking get their phone out of their
*  bag because they're trying to get pussy or whatever the fuck they're trying to do.
*  They're just wild people.
*  If they're coming back, you're doing your job.
*  Miami, you keep coming back.
*  Well, they were they were definitely keep coming back.
*  But it was just like, it's hilarious how what the culture of Miami is so different than
*  anywhere else.
*  They're such wild people that that is like you.
*  You should have to have a passport to go to Miami.
*  And I don't mean because like people there are from other countries and some of them
*  are. But it's because the culture is different.
*  The white people there, the Latinos, everyone's different there.
*  Miami is like visiting another country.
*  It really is.
*  It's a wild ass place.
*  I was in Miami for the first time over Super Bowl.
*  It's like the first time to a place.
*  I actually spent any time in South Beach.
*  I went to South Beach.
*  I went downtown.
*  It's a wild fucking place, man.
*  But it's so cool.
*  I feel like everybody I didn't do like the party party scene, even though it was Super
*  Bowl. I like what the other way with it.
*  I was so like kind of drained already.
*  I was like, you know what?
*  I'm just going to relax in Miami while everybody else is turnt to like 12.
*  It's one of the coolest places I've ever been.
*  Great food, man.
*  The most fantastic Cuban food you'll ever find.
*  A lot of Caribbean food and just like the women are so beautiful, too.
*  It's like it's a crazy place.
*  It's a crazy place.
*  Well, it really does feel like another country.
*  I do love about this phone thing and like people sharing so much as like when I talk
*  about the different cultures in combat sports, like that gives me access
*  to everybody, everybody being on their phones.
*  And like the one thing that's everywhere is YouTube.
*  So I don't know if you know this, but like you said, there was a time when the
*  only way you could have a voice or certainly comment on boxing or MMA or sports is if
*  you got hired by a major network that had a reach where people could see you.
*  Somebody has to die for you get that job.
*  Right.
*  But Larry March has to retire.
*  Exactly.
*  But I came up in an age and the at the very beginning of YouTube, I was training at
*  Wild Card Boxing Gym.
*  I'm a teenager training there.
*  The gym is fairly, fairly new.
*  And I had it was still like mini DV days and I had a camera that I would use to shoot
*  sparring sessions.
*  And because Freddie has a gym where there are world championship fighters preparing
*  for title fights on television, the class of fighter that's in there on any given day
*  sparring are like main event ticket selling marquee guys.
*  And I'm in there shooting their sparring session, any name, anybody versus anybody.
*  And I'm using the money I'm making selling the sparring footage back to the fighters
*  to pay my gym dues.
*  Wow.
*  That's how I started.
*  And it's like in journalism.
*  Yeah.
*  But OK, it's an interesting story because I was doing broadcasting since 10th grade.
*  I was like at a performing arts high school.
*  We had a radio station in the basement.
*  It's like a coming of age like 80s movie or some shit like, you know, exactly.
*  Blow the dust off the equipment like ask the faculty, can I do a show?
*  And so I'm covering like headline news and whatever a fucking 10th grader thinks is
*  important and who won the football game and you know, this kind of shit.
*  But I always thought that, you know, I'm going to be a talk radio guy.
*  Never sports.
*  So I've been training boxers in fifth grade, but never did I like, did I think the two
*  shall meet except that I'm now I've moved to L.A. right after high school.
*  I'm in Freddie Roach's boxing gym.
*  I'm training.
*  Can't barely afford dues.
*  I got to come up with a way to do that.
*  I started shooting sparring sessions and this is like James Tony is still fighting.
*  We're on the sunset of his career, but he's still the man.
*  And there's a guy named Danny Green, who is a Australian fighter, wildly famous there,
*  but doesn't have like global audience.
*  He wants to fight James.
*  There's no real money in it for James.
*  But if you know James Tony, this is no shrinking violet.
*  This man is like insane.
*  He was like wilder, turned up to like, to this day was every day.
*  That was James Tony at wildcard boxing gym.
*  Right.
*  So this guy flies from Australia, walks into the gym.
*  And you know what a sacred place those are like the main fighter at any gym.
*  The guy who like is the the representation of the toughest dude in that dog.
*  Yeah.
*  The top dog.
*  You don't just walk into that guy's gym and start talking shit, especially with
*  James Tony, especially with James.
*  No one talked more shit than James Tony.
*  Right.
*  You talk shit in the middle of a round.
*  Right.
*  Exactly.
*  All throughout rounds.
*  This guy comes to the James gym, starts talking shit.
*  James, like get in the ring right now.
*  The last 10 rounds, I'll fight you anywhere.
*  You can get the fight.
*  He takes, takes the challenge, gets in there, gets the shit beat out of him for
*  like eight rounds.
*  Just, ah, it's pummeled.
*  I'm shooting the thing.
*  I'm like, oh, oh, okay.
*  First of all, I'm wildly impressed that you came up with this.
*  I don't even know where to find this.
*  Look how good he looks too.
*  James looks good.
*  I'm shooting this.
*  Oh my goodness.
*  And this is James in his prime.
*  He looked like he was a fucking heavyweight.
*  Look at the size of them.
*  Yeah.
*  Was James heavyweight at this point?
*  I think it was cruiserweight.
*  He was still cruiserweight.
*  God damn, he's huge.
*  Right.
*  He's on all the Mexican supplements.
*  Look at the size of them.
*  Man, that's so funny.
*  I haven't seen this footage in, I don't even know how many years.
*  Dude, James is fucking him up.
*  Okay.
*  But the point being that at this time there really wasn't any boxing press to
*  speak of.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like this is great.
*  ESPN might give you a highlight of De La Hoya.
*  You might get a Mike Tyson knockout clip, but there's nobody sitting around
*  talking boxing.
*  There's no place to see fighters training.
*  There's no websites for fights.
*  And after this thing got done, I'm like, Hey, you know, Danny Green doesn't want
*  it.
*  He's got the shipping of him.
*  James Tony doesn't care about it at all.
*  So I'm just going to go home and record over it.
*  And yeah, because this is my side hustle.
*  I need, listen, man, I'm a very young man this time.
*  I need every VHS tape I can use.
*  I need every mini DV I can use to keep the money in my pocket.
*  I can't just be stockpiling footage nobody wants.
*  But before I get a chance to tape over it, I get a call from a site called
*  Max Boxing.
*  And at that time, they're like, pretty much the only boxing website.
*  Huh?
*  What year is this?
*  I want to say this is probably close to 2000.
*  Wow.
*  Um, yeah, 2000.
*  And they say, Hey, we heard Danny Green came down a wild card and they had like
*  this brutal sparring session.
*  Like, you know, how much bigger James is.
*  Yeah.
*  He'll be so much bigger.
*  They don't even look like they're nearly in the same weight class.
*  James looks like he's 20 pounds heavier than him.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, of course it is.
*  But, you know, I mean, by weigh in day, he'll get down, but this is how, this is
*  how James is like rocked every day.
*  Like he'd be just banging guys, talking shit, beating them up, talking shit.
*  And, uh, so this, even though now looking back, of course, it's like amazing
*  footage, but at the time this could be any given Wednesday, you know what I mean?
*  Yeah.
*  It happened there all the time.
*  You know, um, he used to spar with Mickey Rourke.
*  Yeah.
*  And that's one of the reasons why Mickey Rourke had to get his face worked on.
*  Apparently.
*  Yeah.
*  Mickey Rourke used to come in a wild card and he used to spar James, which is like
*  someone needed to talk to him.
*  He's like, what are you thinking?
*  Come here.
*  Come here.
*  Look at me.
*  Look at me.
*  Look at me.
*  Oh, there's Maccafolie.
*  Jeez, man.
*  Wow.
*  I always pick the rest of the room.
*  Um, so what ultimately ended up happening was I got a little bidding war going for
*  this video, because it was such like a hot piece.
*  And I got it up to like,
*  it's like Danny's in pretty fucking good shape and James is getting tired.
*  Was there moments in this where James looked really tired?
*  The thing about James Tony at this time, he always looked really tired.
*  He always seemed like he was being lazy.
*  He's always leaning on fighters, but what you can't hear is the thud of those shots.
*  Like he's just turning shit over.
*  Can we hear some volume, Jamie?
*  And it's, duh, duh.
*  Come on, paper champ.
*  Is that James?
*  Can you hear Freddy in the background talking to him?
*  So they went eight rounds like this?
*  Yeah.
*  And then what happened at the end of it?
*  Still, he's Danny Green still seems like he's kind of in it.
*  No, I mean, in the beginning, it looked like James was fucking him up.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, like Danny had spots where he's connecting, but at no point during that,
*  and mind you, his face is getting bloodier.
*  Like the shots that James are throwing are consistently heavier.
*  And James is just having an easy time with him.
*  It's not like anything that Danny's doing is making an impression.
*  So how did they end it?
*  It was just over.
*  Like Danny had enough.
*  Oh, you know what I mean?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And this became Jim Wars.
*  What I did with this footage ultimately was I took it and went to an editor named
*  Brian Hardy, who was the editor for Max Boxing at the time.
*  And he got Doug Fisher, who's now the editor in chief of Ring Magazine.
*  And I to commentate that footage as though you're watching it on HBO.
*  Oh, wow.
*  Right.
*  So Doug's doing the color.
*  I'm calling the fight like, and I got him the Lampley and he's the Kellerman.
*  And we showed the whole thing.
*  I talked about the context of what had happened.
*  Like I told you, and we're calling the fight in this show.
*  Jim Wars blew up.
*  It was like the first big boxing thing on the internet at all.
*  And so I would go to around the different gyms and get fighters and they all started
*  at wild card.
*  And then I would branch out and get fighters to agree.
*  Let me shoot the sessions and turn it into a show called Jim Wars.
*  And so this foot, like the way these guys now get their phones and their cameras and
*  they go interview fighters and all this shit.
*  I started that.
*  That wasn't a thing before I started doing it.
*  I'm the one who created this like medium by which you now receive boxing news.
*  Wow.
*  So my entire career and trajectory in life was changed at a boxing gym and never
*  to look back.
*  Were you a fighter at one point in time?
*  Never.
*  Never.
*  Never.
*  You just used to train?
*  Always trained since fifth grade.
*  Always training.
*  It's taken incredibly seriously.
*  I've heard you talk about this too.
*  And it's, it couldn't be more true.
*  This was a way for me to release like all of those young man angst, all that
*  frustration.
*  It's really my therapy.
*  I could barely afford gym dudes.
*  You know, I can't afford therapy.
*  Boxing was that it was like an integral part of my life.
*  I spent hours in the gym to where I had to figure out a way to make some money
*  there so I could continue to eat and pay for it.
*  And that was my way of doing it.
*  And so interviewing fighters is now like my claim to fame because everybody's
*  thinks that reinventing the wheel now.
*  You can't shoot anybody sparring or anything like that.
*  So that show had to go away.
*  But the way that I relate to and understand fighters and what it is like
*  that's inside them, that's that they're experiencing, that's driving them, I
*  think is unique because although I would never ever classify myself as a fighter,
*  that's such a, a unique and cherished like banner that you can really hold if
*  that's really what you do.
*  I'm a warrior too.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like I've, I, in my own way, I forged a career.
*  I created something that didn't exist and I had to fight every step along the way
*  to make it a thing.
*  So is this something while you were doing it, you were realizing like I'm making a
*  career out of talking about boxing.
*  Were you doing that?
*  Or do you thinking, well, I'm doing this for now and I'm going to do something else?
*  I, I kept doing what was working.
*  You know what I mean?
*  And I, at times I thought about doing something else, but never did I spend as
*  much time thinking about or applying myself to anything else.
*  So yeah, other things would come up, but everybody, it all would bring, it all
*  would come back to this.
*  I would always go back to the gym.
*  Cause Dave is a crazy boxing fan too.
*  And I remember Dave talked to me at one point in time about the three of us doing
*  something.
*  This is a while back, right?
*  Strap season.
*  Dave and I have a show called strap season.
*  And the best way I could describe it is it's like the Anthony Bourdain of boxing,
*  if you will.
*  As I've said, I go all over the world covering fights.
*  Every community of combat sports has its own culture.
*  Every fighter's got his own story.
*  Every fights got its own narrative that's connected to another fight.
*  That's connected to another fight.
*  That's got a historical point of view.
*  And that's how I see the world of combat sports.
*  Like that's how I see boxing.
*  That's through that lens that this show exists.
*  And you're right.
*  Dave's a phenomenal boxing fan.
*  He knows his shit.
*  He goes to the fights.
*  He takes his whole crew to the fights, buys everybody ringside tickets.
*  Like we talked for hours on the phone about any and every fight that's upcoming.
*  And we met in Macau at Pacquiao Rios.
*  Wow.
*  Brandon Rios.
*  Yeah.
*  The first, that was in Macau.
*  Yeah, that was in Macau.
*  It was Rios and then Algeria.
*  He fought Algeria as well.
*  That was a mismatch.
*  Yeah.
*  The Brandon Rios just like, he was a good fighter, like a tough guy.
*  But man, that's a fight where you really saw how great Pacquiao is.
*  Seven knockdowns.
*  Dude.
*  And that's when they let him out of the cage.
*  He just lit him up.
*  He just lit him up.
*  That was crazy.
*  And you know, Pacquiao's been doing, he just did it recently to Keith Thurman.
*  He keeps wanting to write this guy off.
*  He keeps like, oh, that's gotta be it.
*  Like you can't do that again.
*  When he did that step in right hook over the shoulder and drop Thurman, I was like,
*  holy shit, bro.
*  And mind you, that guy is why wild card boxing gym with a course, including
*  Freddie Roach is the most famous gym, I would say in the world.
*  Yeah.
*  Even I would say more famous in this day than even Gleeson's.
*  I think you're right.
*  But the first time I interviewed Manny Pacquiao was at the Vagabond Hotel, which
*  is now torn down and was condemned next door to the gym on a radio, on an air
*  conditioner, one of those protruding air conditioners from the wall with seven
*  other guys in his hotel room, all living in the hotel room.
*  It's me and Manny Pacquiao, like on an air conditioner doing a one-on-one.
*  He doesn't, he have that thing where like, if he does, he has a house out here,
*  he'll have like 20 dudes living with him.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And this is the most generous, like guy I've ever known in my life.
*  Like Manny Pacquiao does things that just defy reason.
*  Like you, as nice as it is, you want to like shake him like, yo, not,
*  a hundred people on the private plane, like, you know, buy them normal tickets.
*  Like he has to keep fighting probably just to keep up that payroll.
*  I, yeah, I guess he's got to keep fighting.
*  He's got to be a Senator.
*  Yeah.
*  He's got to, you know, endorse a cash, pistachio nuts.
*  He's got to do everything.
*  Yeah.
*  Because he, he, it's like water.
*  Like he wants to feed the people.
*  He wants to be that guy and it's genuine.
*  And he is, he really is an outlet.
*  Like he, the money will flow through him if he keeps going.
*  That's right.
*  That's right.
*  So you just got to imagine me meeting of all people, Dave Chappelle,
*  of all places in China and Macau, cause he's there for a fight.
*  So Dave flew in for the fight.
*  Flew in, flew his family in, like, you know, the Chappells were there for the fight.
*  And that, and now that I know him well, that's not unusual at all.
*  Like he does that for box.
*  He loves boxing to that degree.
*  So we spent, like I said, hours just talking about boxing on the phone.
*  And when we get together, we have these dinners for on fight night.
*  And we're like, you know what?
*  This is something that could be something.
*  And we ended up shooting for like two years of following me around.
*  Um, the dinners we had countless people at these dinners, uh, Michael buffer.
*  Uh, we wanted you, we still want you like these things that you know.
*  And I know about combat sports, about this community of fighters is something
*  that I don't think anybody else could do.
*  Like you have to be a part of that conversation because you're really the
*  only one who can talk about it from the perspective that you do.
*  I know a lot of people.
*  Okay.
*  So I know a lot of people that comment on MMA as I'm sure you do.
*  I know a lot of people that comment on boxing.
*  I don't know people who dedicate themselves to the community, to the sport,
*  to the spirit of it.
*  Like you do like I do.
*  And that's what makes it unique.
*  There's a, there's a, there's a lens through which you can see this shit that
*  really a very, very few people can show you you're that guy.
*  Well, those people, like particularly the MMA people, they demand it.
*  You can't, you can't be a casual observer of MMA.
*  You can't, they won't allow it.
*  If you don't know what the fuck you're telling you, so what happened with
*  Stephen A Smith recently?
*  I did.
*  Yeah, that's, that's what happens, man.
*  You know, and part of it is like, you know, Luke Thomas has an interesting,
*  he's a really good MMA journalist.
*  He had a really interesting take on it where he's saying that part of it is
*  that there's a thing in this sport where they don't want outsiders, like people
*  that cover other sports, like, no, no, no, you don't know this sport, but if you
*  do jump in, God damn, you got to know what the fuck you're talking about.
*  You got to really know what the fuck you're talking about.
*  And Stephen's thing is being entertaining and being dismissive of people and, you
*  know, kind of in an arrogant way and, and, you know, insulting, you know, that's his
*  thing.
*  I mean, he creates controversy, that controversy creates a lot of people
*  watching and paying attention.
*  That shit does not fly in MMA.
*  There's these guys are literally fighting for their life.
*  I mean, they literally are moments from death at several times in certain fights.
*  There's moments where guys are out cold and you see a guy dropping an elbow on
*  their face and smashing their orbital bone before the referee can get to them.
*  You can't make fun of those guys in that way.
*  You can't, you can't talk shit about them.
*  They're not going to allow it.
*  That's correct.
*  Nor should they.
*  There's five fighters that we know about that has succumbed to injuries in the
*  ring and died and died just last year.
*  Yeah.
*  And you can't bring your shtick to this shit.
*  Right.
*  And I don't think it's, um, save that for sports with balls.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  Save that for countdown shows.
*  And sports where people hit each other are different, man.
*  They're just different, you know, right?
*  They're just, it's a different thing.
*  Like boxing, like the reason why Deontay was so amped up and wild before that
*  fight, you're not going to see a basketball player like that four days before the
*  NBA finals, they'll be tuned up and ready to go, but they'll be, they're
*  not ready to go to war, right?
*  They're literally putting their fucking health on the line.
*  It's a different thing.
*  Yeah.
*  And you know, of course we respect all sports, but
*  yes, for sure.
*  This kind of, uh, risk that you're taking and then the individuality of it, even
*  though you've got a guy in the ring, got a cut man, you got, you know, somebody
*  who worked in your corner, it really is just you out there when that bell rings.
*  And you're not just fighting the guy you're looking at.
*  You're fighting the guy inside you that wants to quit.
*  You're fighting the guy inside you that thinks that last punch really hurt.
*  Yeah.
*  You're fighting the guy inside you that's like, you know, I probably made enough
*  money, I don't probably need to do this shit anymore.
*  Like your own demons, everything that goes into not just being a successful
*  fighter, but being a respected fighter, a fighter at all.
*  Like everyone's seen that clip of the guy climbed through the ropes, the bell
*  rang, he climbed out of the ropes and walked back into the locker room.
*  There's a little bit of that in everybody and you're fighting him too.
*  Yeah.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  What was that about?
*  Wasn't there like some contract dispute or something though?
*  Uh, they felt like they were fucking them over.
*  Oh, I did that from what I understand.
*  He went back there and asked for his money.
*  So you thought that because he got in the ring, the bell rang and he got out,
*  he could still get his money.
*  Yeah.
*  That's what I heard.
*  Oh my God.
*  That's hilarious.
*  But that guy could never fight again.
*  Not, you know what I mean?
*  Right.
*  Nobody would ever trust him again.
*  Go through a full camp preparing for that guy.
*  No.
*  I mean, imagine being his opponent, seeing him walk out.
*  You're like, what?
*  Right.
*  What's happening here?
*  You don't even get paid now.
*  You can't criticize somebody as though they are just doing what you're doing
*  because, Oh, I'm talking, I got a job.
*  I'm a, I'm an important guy.
*  I'm at this level of shit.
*  So no, yeah, we're doing the same thing.
*  Essentially.
*  Yeah.
*  We're both on TV.
*  It's not.
*  Um, and so the, the kind of love that you have a combat sports kind of love that
*  you have for what it is that you comment on, it comes through because you do it.
*  But I've been doing it almost half my life now in terms of commenting on it.
*  I've been doing martial arts since I was a fucking baby basically.
*  And that's it.
*  Yeah.
*  But when you see combat sports today and you see like the landscape of boxing, I
*  feel personally that this is an amazing time.
*  I mean, I feel like the heavyweight division has never been more exciting and
*  more turbulent because there's so many great fighters now to have Andrew
*  Ruiz jump out of nowhere and knock out Anthony Joshua, I think was a godsend for
*  the sport because all of a sudden you see like, look at this chubby Mexican just
*  fucked up.
*  This dude looks like a God.
*  Like this is crazy.
*  Like, and this is for the Mexican community.
*  It's huge having their first Mexican heavyweight champion, but it's also like,
*  wow, this is a crazy division.
*  Look, you got the Deontay just knocks the fuck out of Louis Ortiz with that one
*  punch, the forehead.
*  You're like, what the fuck?
*  You got the rematch with Tyson Furies coming up in two weeks.
*  Right?
*  Not even right?
*  Less than 20 seconds.
*  Oh my goodness.
*  Now what you're talking about earlier is, uh, exemplified in what happened after
*  the Ruiz fight, where you see, like you say, a chubby guy, that's very, very
*  chubby.
*  Yeah.
*  But he's a fucking fighter.
*  Oh my God.
*  He's a heavyweight for real.
*  His hand speed is tremendous.
*  And if you think just cause he's chubby, you can take a knock at the guy,
*  especially after he won the title, as though he won the lottery or he won a
*  scratch off and this shit just happens.
*  It doesn't.
*  It reminded people of what the heavyweight division is.
*  One punch can change the fight is a real thing.
*  It is a real thing.
*  He fucked up though.
*  And that rematch, that rematch was a disaster.
*  So it was so clearly unprepared when he weighed two 80, I was like, oh my God.
*  And what was the rumors like?
*  And I fell into him too.
*  Like everybody's talking about how he's getting thinner and we're debating.
*  Instagram picture.
*  He did what chubby girls do.
*  He held that camera up and he did one of these things.
*  He catfished us.
*  He catfished us.
*  Well, you know, he lost, he wasn't training with his trainer and he was
*  partying a lot, you know, and I knew he was partying a lot.
*  I heard from people that knew him.
*  They're like, man, I don't know.
*  I heard whispers of that and didn't believe it.
*  I was like, no fucking way.
*  Not that guy.
*  I believed it.
*  You know why I believed it?
*  Cause it's so hard not to all of a sudden you're the fucking man out of nowhere.
*  And maybe he was convinced that he could do it again.
*  You know, he's hitting the pads and look pretty good.
*  Hitting the bag looked pretty good.
*  It's like, I'll fuck that guy up again.
*  But Anthony Joshua had a totally different game plan this time.
*  And to see Anthony Joshua stick and move like that was interesting.
*  I was like, wow.
*  Yeah, that's interesting.
*  It's a cliche, but again, losing might've been the best thing that ever happened to him.
*  I don't know about that.
*  I don't know about that.
*  You know, I mean, I think it's great that he got his title back, but I felt like, um,
*  one thing that happened in that fight that disturbed me was even though Ruiz came in
*  out of shape and clearly didn't look like he was prepared correctly.
*  Joshua didn't, did never really enforce his will on him.
*  He never really had a moment where he was beating the fuck out of him.
*  Where he was like, you know, I trained hard for this fight.
*  I'm going to dominate you now.
*  Now I'm going to take you out the way you took me out.
*  There was none of that.
*  It was boxing, just stick and move.
*  Make sure you get the decision.
*  Make sure you get the decision.
*  That is in stark contrast to where Deontay finishes fights.
*  Which is why that matchup is so intriguing, which is why no matter what happens between
*  the two of them, hopefully they remain undefeated for their own sakes and can make
*  that unification fight.
*  I saw his commitment to discipline, Joshua I'm talking about, as a good thing.
*  Oh, it's definitely a good thing because he won the title back.
*  But when you make the argument, who's the best heavyweight in the world, if you have
*  to look at it on paper, I don't think it's him right now.
*  I think it's Tyson Fury or Deontay Wilder, depending on what happens on the 22nd.
*  I lean towards Deontay because he can close the show at any moment.
*  That 12th round, I was in bed and I was watching the fight and I went, oh shit, I
*  popped up, oh shit, he knocked him out.
*  He knocked and then Tyson Fury rises.
*  I'm like, what the fuck?
*  He rises, he gets through the barrage and then he wins the remainder of the round.
*  I'm like, this is insane.
*  And he even rocked Deontay at one point in time.
*  Like this is an insane fight.
*  And then it was a draw.
*  And I don't think on paper it's really a draw.
*  I think that's horseshit.
*  I think on paper Tyson Fury won more rounds, but I'm not upset with the draw because the
*  way Deontay knocked him down and then knocked him down, the way he knocked him down the
*  third and then 12th round should almost count for like three points.
*  I mean, it's so crazy.
*  Just about any.
*  And I get it.
*  I mean, this is not a criticism of Jack Reese.
*  Like the guy did get up.
*  So you can't say, you know, did something wrong.
*  But most referees of that would have just waved it off.
*  Most referees.
*  Like there's no way, there's no way this guy's going to get up.
*  His arms were flat.
*  He was laying on his back.
*  It looked like he was in another dimension.
*  Can you think of any other fight in the countless fights that you've covered where the
*  the main highlight of the fight is just the guy getting up?
*  Crazy.
*  Crazy.
*  Yeah, crazy.
*  Well, that punch to the right hand and the left hook behind it and then him walking off
*  like this, he thought he had him.
*  He thought it was over.
*  Crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  Tyson Fury is something special, man.
*  But so is Deontay.
*  And so is Joshua.
*  I think all three of those guys, they're so uniquely different that I can't say, I mean,
*  the argument about who's best can rage for days.
*  But I don't know that for sure this guy beats that guy or that guy beats the other guy.
*  Or if this guy beats that guy, then that guy.
*  You don't.
*  You won't know until they face each other.
*  And what I'm saying is even if Deontay were to lose to Tyson Fury, I still want to see
*  Joshua Wilder more than.
*  100%.
*  That is the fight I want to see.
*  That is the fight I want to see.
*  Well, I definitely the rematch is the first fight I want to see.
*  The next fight I want to see, regardless of the outcome, is I want to see.
*  Well, unless Tyson Fury K.O.'s Wilder.
*  If Tyson Fury K.O.'s Wilder is like, Antoine Joshua, Anthony Joshua, you dozer.
*  If he gets on the mic and starts talking that kind of shit, then I want to see that fight.
*  But if my dream matchup right now is the rematch, that's the dream matchup.
*  The dream matchup is the 22nd.
*  Yeah, I am so fucking pumped for that rematch.
*  I'm not doing jack shit.
*  I'm taking the night off.
*  I'm sitting right in front of the fucking TV, sweaty palms.
*  Now, see, for you to say that about a boxing match, that's a huge thing.
*  I love boxing, though. I do.
*  I mean, I call combat sports, you know, I call MMA, but I do love boxing.
*  You know, I love the Canelo Kovalev fight.
*  I thought that was fascinating to watch Canelo K.O.
*  Kovalev fight that I was like, God damn.
*  What do you have? Six minutes?
*  So he says, I thought Kovalev was winning that fight.
*  He was winning.
*  If he could have stayed on his feet for six more minutes, he beats Canelo.
*  Canelo looked like he had a plan to do that.
*  Like, it looks like he planned for Kovalev to fade, you know, because Kovalev,
*  he's not the same guy used to be.
*  You know, he's slow.
*  After Andre Ward knocked him out in the second fight, he just seems like a different guy.
*  It just seems like he doesn't.
*  And he's also had a lot of legal troubles outside the ring.
*  Rumors of booze and abuse and all kinds of other shit.
*  You know, sometimes fighters, they they hit this point in their career
*  where they don't have the same level of commitment that they did
*  when they first started fighting.
*  And when Kovalev in the early days, man, when he was the crusher,
*  you know, he was fucking everybody up, man.
*  He was a terrifying force, fantastic amateur record,
*  you know, amazing technical boxing skills, vicious right hand.
*  I mean, he was something special.
*  But, you know, but to your point, like it's those kind of experience
*  getting stopped by Ward, I think was more of a mental thing for him.
*  I think that it's a hurdle that he couldn't get over mentally
*  and the physical followed suit, which is why I say, you know,
*  it would have been easy for Joshua to get bogged down
*  in the disappointment of that moment. Right.
*  And not ever really recover from the lack of invincibility
*  that he found himself in on a fight.
*  Like everybody thought he was going to win going away.
*  Now you're deep in boxing circles.
*  Had you heard the rumor that Joshua had been knocked out in training?
*  I've heard all the rumors. Yeah.
*  But that was apparently from enough people that I was taking it seriously.
*  The two weeks before the fight, he had got KO'd really bad in training.
*  I heard it. I don't know.
*  Supposedly KO'd him.
*  I have no idea. Nor do I know that it's true.
*  I don't know. It's true either.
*  And even though that kind of thing is salacious
*  and I would love to know for sure,
*  I feel like if you turn up on the night and you get to that first bell ringing,
*  we're in a fight. Everybody's struggling with something.
*  You know, my hand hurts and pull the hamstring.
*  I'm not telling you about.
*  I think they said, and this is even more widely reported,
*  that Joshua had a bit of a panic attack in the in the dressing room before the fight.
*  That I find harder to believe.
*  The sparring thing, I think, could happen to anybody.
*  And then it's a question like, do we go on?
*  But here's the thing, if he was suffering from the residual effects of being KO'd
*  and then he's like, I really shouldn't be fighting right now.
*  Fuck, I can't believe I have to fight right now.
*  And then he's starting to freak out because I know that's happened in MMA
*  and MMA that's definitely happened where guys have been KO'd badly
*  in the training before the fight.
*  And then they get to the fight and they really shouldn't be fighting.
*  And they know it. And they kind of they kind of freak out.
*  What do you do, though? Like, I mean, what do you blame?
*  Let's say that let's say that all that's true.
*  And this is just hypothetical.
*  Let's say that these are true stories.
*  Then it comes down to like the date set.
*  You have an opponent that should be easy to beat.
*  Everybody thinks this guy is like, I don't think so.
*  An easy replacement.
*  This is don't forget, this is an American debut.
*  This wasn't just some fight.
*  You know, I mean, another one at the O2 since the Garden, his first fight in America.
*  That Wilder fight still like looming.
*  Joshua's supposed to take over the world.
*  And how many big baby Miller tested positive when?
*  Well, what do we had?
*  I think we were like three weeks, three weeks out, three weeks, three weeks out.
*  And then it was like officially, OK.
*  Yeah, like two weeks is what Ruiz had.
*  So he tests positive for steroids and then Ruiz comes in somewhere.
*  Two and a half, three weeks in. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*  And yeah, man, it's just like crazy can of worms.
*  What do you do? What do you do?
*  You can't solve that day. Right.
*  But here's the thing.
*  I mean, I bet he wished he canceled it after it was over.
*  I bet he wished he canceled it.
*  Sure. If that was the case.
*  But we don't even know if that was the case.
*  So we're just talking shit.
*  Yeah.
*  To that point, what does that what does that experience with Joshua
*  do for him against Wilder, the biggest knockout puncher in heavyweight boxing?
*  He's to be sure.
*  If not history, history, certainly.
*  OK, 40 wins by knockout, one decision, one draw.
*  What the fuck?
*  Who the hell does that?
*  And even that decision ever nobody ever.
*  He avenged the guy he got.
*  He got a decision. He ultimately knocked him out.
*  Yeah. It's Tavern.
*  Yeah. But that that record is unchallenged.
*  There's no one like that.
*  I don't think in any fucking division, even you go back to the KO punches
*  like Julian Jackson, right, the old school one punch destroyers.
*  He he beat people by decision.
*  But Deontay knocks everybody out and heavyweight.
*  It's crazy.
*  And he knocks him out with like forehead punches.
*  That forehead punch to Ruiz just block.
*  Yeah. He just walks away.
*  He's Ruiz is laying on the ropes like what in the fuck just hit me.
*  He's flouting convention.
*  Like it's like crazy.
*  You're not supposed to be able to do that.
*  And everybody talks so much shit about his skills. Right.
*  That's what the science is built on.
*  Yeah, but it's nonsense because the way he's built
*  first of all, six foot nine, 209 pounds.
*  That's what he weighed in. He fought Tyson Fury 209.
*  I mean, he'd probably like to 18 when he fought Ruiz, gained nine pounds or so.
*  Like not that much. Right.
*  Still very light.
*  But also because of that doesn't get tired like those bigger guys.
*  He doesn't have as much body mass where his blood is flowing through.
*  But he also has fucking ridiculous power.
*  And he keeps that power later than any of them.
*  And to your point, now I think he'll keep that power longer.
*  And I've seen he does get tired when he chases the knockout.
*  Yes, he can get he can get but he recovers.
*  But his patience, like he'll tell me skills don't pay to build.
*  I got my own style.
*  I got to stop saying that shit.
*  But what we saw in the Ruiz for the the Luis Ortiz fight
*  was that he started to use the discipline of patience.
*  He wasn't chasing the knockout anymore.
*  He was relying on it, which is a taboo.
*  But he knew when that moment came, he'd be in position to fire.
*  And he believed when he fired, he'd win.
*  Yeah, get it.
*  And the patients are not chasing the knockout.
*  Yeah, that's science, too.
*  It is science technique, too, because he knows that he has this preposterous power.
*  And he knows he's a hunt and he's and he's right.
*  He's been right 40 fucking times.
*  I'm getting right one more time. Yeah, he's right.
*  He's right. But the thing is, man,
*  the Tyson Fury fight showed that some people can survive.
*  And that was that was what was so fascinating about that fight
*  because Tyson was the only guy that could survive and he survived it twice.
*  He got dropped earlier in the fight.
*  Was it like the fifth round or something like that?
*  I don't know.
*  I was like, was it the night?
*  He got dropped.
*  So we got dropped earlier in the fight and then the big one in the 12th
*  and still survived.
*  I mean, just crazy.
*  I don't think Wilder thinks he survived.
*  I think Wilder thinks he got job.
*  Well, we talked about it.
*  He said, look, if you look at the clock, it's like the fucking dude
*  was down for 10 seconds.
*  The fucking guy was like, if you count to 10 and that is
*  that always drive me crazy about boxing.
*  Why don't they have a goddamn digital clock?
*  Why are they relying on this guy to go one to that shit?
*  It's crazy because they're just counting.
*  They're just counting.
*  Were we in the dark ages?
*  Throw a fucking digital clock up when the guy goes down at 10 seconds.
*  The fight is over.
*  If that's the case, that fight is over.
*  Tyson Fury is down for like 12 seconds.
*  I don't know why so many things in sports aren't automated at this point.
*  I don't get this like nostalgic, like human error bullshit.
*  I don't believe in any of it, including the judging.
*  What do we do about MMA too?
*  What do we do about the judging?
*  Yeah, MMA is the worst.
*  What's the solution to that?
*  I don't know, man.
*  Well, look, boxing is experienced
*  in some fucking significant levels of bribery and corruption.
*  And there's been people that have actually been forced out of boxing, right?
*  They don't judge fights anymore.
*  Like Manny Pacquiao, Tim Bradley.
*  Remember that one?
*  Of course.
*  That one was like, what in the fuck did you people watch?
*  Like, what is this?
*  Triple G Canelo, the first fighter.
*  Adelaide Byrd.
*  What in the...
*  She's a nice lady.
*  She does MMA too.
*  And DC, Daniel Cormier, one of the fights he looked at, he goes, Oh no, Adelaide Byrd's here.
*  And I'm like, she's a nice lady.
*  She's a wonderful lady.
*  But to be fair, most of the fights I watch are ringside, right?
*  And I'll be on my phone texting my friends, hey, you know, this fight.
*  I got it this way.
*  People watching it at home will have it in an entirely different way.
*  I'll go home and see what they're talking about.
*  I don't think sitting ringside from one angle all night gives you a perspective enough to judge the fight properly.
*  Agreed.
*  And then like comparing it to the other guy, like...
*  Do boxing guys have monitors?
*  Because UFC people have monitors.
*  No, the judges don't.
*  Yeah, they should.
*  They didn't have it for a long time.
*  We asked for it.
*  We eventually got it.
*  We complained forever.
*  And in most commissions, the judges have ringside monitors.
*  Yeah, man.
*  They should have more judges, too.
*  Three judges is ridiculous.
*  Why are we leaving on three people?
*  There's four sides of the ring, by the way.
*  Well, there's eight sides of the octagon.
*  Right.
*  And by the way, there's a fucking million people that would love to judge.
*  It doesn't make any sense.
*  It's not like we're short of people that understand it.
*  And in MMA, we have an additional problem.
*  So we go to places like we were in Texas this past weekend and we had terrible judging.
*  And those people weren't even...
*  Some of them weren't even MMA judges.
*  They had backgrounds in boxing and they had transitioned over to MMA.
*  And some of them really didn't understand what was going on.
*  And there was really, really bad decisions.
*  And that's the other thing.
*  Like people, you know, the raging debate, boxing versus UFC and all this shit.
*  It is the silliest debate I've ever heard as far as combat sports goes.
*  It's just not the same thing.
*  No, it's not.
*  The idea that you can judge boxing and MMA and think that, well, you know,
*  everybody's hitting everybody.
*  Yeah.
*  I've got the same skill set here as I do in the other one.
*  Doesn't make any sense.
*  There's a lot of legit MMA judges now.
*  It's much less of a problem that it used to be.
*  But when we travel to places like Texas, where we were this past weekend,
*  and you run into problems where they just don't get world title fights very often.
*  You know, and then the main event was a very controversial decision.
*  But close enough that it wasn't I don't think it was a robbery.
*  Close enough, close enough.
*  And, you know, I think you give it to the champion.
*  He dominated the last two rounds clearly in my eyes.
*  And could have won the third.
*  You know, I watched it again today, actually.
*  But some of the earlier fights were fucking preposterous.
*  Just watch it.
*  I don't even need judges ringside.
*  Just watch the shit on TV.
*  Like, give me give me an extra two, three minutes.
*  We have to wait for the decision to figure it out properly.
*  Right. Let's wait.
*  Better than like two or three decades of arguing about the shit.
*  Well, I really think they need more people choosing.
*  I think there should be a large group of people, you know, maybe even 10 people,
*  maybe even people at home and there in person.
*  And then you add you tally up the scorecards like people that are respected,
*  like respected world class trainers, respected fighters, respected experts
*  in martial arts that watch these fights or boxing matches and then tally it up.
*  Then you would never have a triple G versus Canelo first fight because 90%
*  of the people thought that triple G won that first fight, which is interesting.
*  The Canelo won the second fight because Canelo fought very differently in the second fight.
*  And he did better fighter.
*  He was a better fighter in the second fight.
*  Yeah. And I think the criticism he took in the first fight
*  like enraged him.
*  Yeah. You played it cool.
*  Yeah. I think that really pissed him off.
*  He's like, OK, yeah, let me show you what I can do.
*  Yeah, he came back better.
*  He came back better.
*  The fact that he went all the way up to fucking light heavyweight
*  and knocked out Sergey Kovalev is amazing.
*  I mean, what does he do now?
*  Does he stay at light heavyweight?
*  Does he go back to super?
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know that he makes middleweight again.
*  I mean, he's not how we could if he gave enough time, you know,
*  but then he might be drained, right?
*  Right. But he's too small for light heavyweight.
*  I mean, yeah, I mean, obviously, 60, 60.
*  It's probably the sweet spot for him.
*  But how? I mean, he's not a kid anymore.
*  There's not like he's 22, like fluctuating in weight like that.
*  But didn't he fight Floyd at 52?
*  Yeah. That's nuts.
*  Yeah. That's nuts.
*  Yeah. Seventy five.
*  Now it's crazy.
*  That's so much weight.
*  Yeah. So much fucking 23.
*  Goddamn pounds. That's crazy.
*  And then probably weighed a lot more than that before he cut weight
*  to make the weights.
*  And given a given a guy 24 hours between the weigh in,
*  sometimes more than 24 hours, in fact, most times more than 24 hours.
*  So like they blow up.
*  What kind of what kind of testing are they doing?
*  That dude's gone through so many weight classes and he's just jacked as fuck.
*  Yeah. I mean, suspicious as fuck.
*  I'm not a doctor. I don't.
*  You're not a doctor. I'm not a doctor.
*  I know. I'm not a doctor either.
*  At this point, it probably seems like I am.
*  But I'm suspicious.
*  There's so many things about both of our sports that could be easily corrected
*  if the motivation was there to like even the playing field.
*  Well, the USADA program in the UFC is even the playing field considerably.
*  A lot of people fell off.
*  A lot of physiques changed.
*  A lot of people just lost all their muscle mass.
*  But only one entity has to make a decision in MMA, essentially, like for UFC,
*  like particularly.
*  Yeah. Right.
*  The decision comes down and then everybody's got to do it.
*  Yeah. Period. Exactly.
*  Boxing does not enjoy that kind of, you know, dictatorship.
*  Right. And there's also been instances in boxing where guys have said,
*  no, I don't want VATA testing. I don't want it.
*  They got to pay for it themselves. Right. Right. Why should they?
*  Why should they?
*  And then imagine if you're the guy who like this is his big fight.
*  This is the first time even making any money. Right.
*  Now I got to spend all this dough on VATA and whatnot. No.
*  What is the status of Adonis Stevenson?
*  Did he recover? Yeah, he's recovered.
*  Is he OK now? I mean, he's not his former self,
*  but he is certainly like, I think, living a good life.
*  He's because I know that was like that was one of the more recent
*  like superstar guys that wound up having a significant brain injury.
*  Survived it. It didn't come to those injuries, but it's life changing.
*  Like this guy will never be the Adonis Stevenson.
*  He was before the fight.
*  He's always going to now for the rest of his life, deal with those injuries
*  and have challenges in a way that is a result of boxing.
*  Is there videos of him? I've seen about it or anything.
*  Yeah. I mean, I haven't seen him talk about it in depth,
*  but we've seen him like his motor skills are coming back.
*  He's smiling. He's able to like speak.
*  So it's not like Jerome McClellan. No.
*  No. That the Jerome McClellan fight, it's interesting.
*  It's kind of in many ways changed
*  Roy Jones Jr.'s thoughts on the sport, you know,
*  and that he never wanted to turn out like that.
*  But then Roy gets older and he's still fighting,
*  fighting, fighting people like deep into his 40s. Right.
*  And you're like, this is crazy.
*  Like, this is the same guy that after Jerome McClellan got hurt,
*  said he would never want to go out like that.
*  And he's fighting like young badasses in Russia and shit.
*  But if you still think you can do it, it's hard to stop doing it.
*  Like, it's easy for me to say, hey, man, that was your last fight.
*  Like, let's let's take it easy.
*  I look at Bernard, right? He's the best example.
*  Right. Into his 50s. Right.
*  But he had a style that was crafty enough to have some longevity in it
*  without taking that kind of damage like Roy embarrassed you.
*  And but he's still there in front of you, which is what's the embarrassing part.
*  So if your motor skills slow down, if your reflexes slow down,
*  you're going to get hit. Yeah. You're not dying fucked up. Yeah.
*  But what he told me in an interview, it might be one of them.
*  One of those moments when I was talking to a guy and he said something that was
*  like, I thought I should have known until I heard it. And I was like, oh,
*  I can't believe I didn't realize that. He said, it's not the fights that destroy you.
*  It's the gym that destroys you. It's the sparring. Oh, yeah.
*  Those are the rounds that destroy fighters. Oh, yeah.
*  And it's like the hundreds and hundreds of rounds to thousands of rounds that
*  you're fighting that nobody sees that you're not getting paid for.
*  You're taking that punishment. Head gear or not.
*  That's what you're seeing at the end of a fighter's career.
*  Do you remember it? Was it Danny Jacobs, Jr.? Who was it that someone?
*  No. So no, it wasn't him.
*  No, it wasn't Danny Jacobs. It was someone else.
*  Someone that said that they stopped sparring.
*  Oh, yeah. Who the fuck?
*  Well, he was fighting Kovalet and that was Anthony Yard. That's right.
*  That's right. Right. And that's when he stopped sparring. He said he never sparring.
*  Yeah. Yeah. And no one believes it. But yeah. And then anyone who does is like,
*  well, you probably should have been sparring. Yeah.
*  He looked great in moments in that fight.
*  Like it was like the eighth round where he had Kovalet and deep shit. Yeah, man.
*  That was a crazy thing. Like his philosophy, if I remember correctly,
*  was Yard's philosophy was if you don't get hit at all in training,
*  you will be so much fresher when you get to the ring.
*  So he was doing just ridiculous mitt work and bag work and drills.
*  And he already knew how to box.
*  So his idea was that he will have some sort of an advantage.
*  And he was a really fairly green guy, right?
*  In terms of like world class competition.
*  I mean, this is the very first really big fight.
*  Yeah. But really physically talented and just built like a brick shithouse.
*  And still is all those things. Yes.
*  But I think the rub is that you do have to spar.
*  You know, you have to feel shots that no trainer
*  that I've ever had this discussion with.
*  And right after the fight, plenty of people wanted to talk about it.
*  I didn't hear anybody be like, yeah, that made sense.
*  No, it's just part of it.
*  You find that a little bit in MMA now.
*  Donald Cerrone was doing that for a while. He wasn't sparring at all.
*  I was just doing pad work and just doing wrestling drills and stuff like that.
*  Kickboxing drills.
*  Yeah. Listen, if pad work and like a really good workout
*  could make you world champion, I'd be like three time world champion by now.
*  That's not it. Sparring is a reality check.
*  Like, you know what I mean? You need it.
*  Otherwise, you're just like doing aerobics.
*  Yeah. You need to be tuned in to movement to people and also to danger,
*  to be able to exist and to be able to fire under pressure.
*  You have to you have to take shots.
*  You have to absorb those.
*  Keep your eyes open like this, like all of these things.
*  You can't you can't download them.
*  Yeah. You can't simulate them.
*  But you can only do that so many times.
*  That's the other thing.
*  It's like there's only so many times you can survive it, you know.
*  And gym wars are real.
*  They take a toll on people.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*  And I wish that we could shoot that show still because you wouldn't let you.
*  They won't let you know everybody.
*  They hide things now.
*  Yeah. Everybody thinks that they got stories, right?
*  The secret. Yeah.
*  I guess a story that Klitschko knocked out Deontay in training,
*  like someone Dylan Wilde was talking about that recently.
*  Mm hmm. You know, and I don't make much of that because I think it's unfair.
*  I am one of these guys like, yeah, what happens in the gym?
*  Stays there. I'm in there with a camera and it's a setup thing.
*  Well, then, OK, we know what's going on. Right.
*  But the point is, you're working on shit. Right.
*  You're trying things. You're like, you know, you have weaknesses.
*  And you're going to like lean on trying to, you know, you're opening up your game.
*  You're opening up and you're trusting the guy that you're sparring with
*  to help you work on those things and like catch you if you're slipping.
*  Yeah. So then if the guy catches you when you're slipping,
*  then a month later, like, yeah, I caught that motherfucker slipping.
*  So like, yeah, so I was paying you to do me.
*  Like, what are you talking about?
*  I flew you in. Yeah.
*  So I try not to make much of that.
*  You know, it's the craziest story in boxing in the years.
*  Errol Spence Jr. Surviving that fucking Ferrari crash.
*  That's the craziest story of the year.
*  When you see that car flip like that and the fact that he got out of that
*  with like a chipped tooth.
*  Oh, I mean, that's bonkers.
*  Thank God he didn't have a seatbelt on. I never say that.
*  Thank God he didn't have a fucking seatbelt on, because if he did,
*  there's no way he would be dead.
*  Probably or fucking severely injured.
*  You know? Yeah.
*  Yeah. And, you know, I was in Chicago and it was the USIC fight
*  that that week when that happened.
*  And it was one of those things where it reminded me when I first heard the news
*  of Paul Williams. Yes.
*  And you realize like, yo, yeah, these guys are warriors.
*  They put their life on the line, like people die in the ring and all that shit.
*  But there's also real life, too.
*  Like there's a whole other life with all its dangers
*  and all the other ways that people can meet tragedy and hurdles you have to overcome.
*  And that's the point to put to you almost want to
*  keep them sheltered in a box between fights so that nothing happens.
*  Nothing can taint what's going to happen in the ring.
*  But these guys are just like everybody else to that degree.
*  Like, you know what I mean?
*  Like he's young, he's rich, he's, you know, in this town where he grew up.
*  And one night you make a bad decision, changes everything.
*  Yeah. And so now until we see him in the ring again,
*  we don't know how that affects him.
*  You just can't.
*  You can't know if we'll ever see the aerospace that we saw before.
*  Hopefully we do and better.
*  How badly was he injured?
*  From what I understood, and I follow this very closely, not badly at all.
*  Like, you're not wrong.
*  Like he from what I understand, he had issues like teeth being knocked out,
*  lacerations on his face, no broken bones, no, no concussion, no concussion.
*  I don't know.
*  No, I don't know if he had no concussion, but he had no serious brain injury.
*  He had no permanent injury whatsoever.
*  That's crazy.
*  But the mental side of it is that to each individual to handle,
*  to be faced with death like that, right at that age, like
*  whatever the moment was when you were flying through the air,
*  not knowing if you're going to live. Right.
*  You don't know how people you don't know how people adjust to that.
*  It's so bad because him and Crawford.
*  God damn what a fight that would be.
*  Yeah. God damn. That is the fight.
*  It's almost like I wish Lomachenko was taller.
*  You know, I wish he was a bigger fighter, you know, like because Lomachenko
*  versus Crawford was really the fight that I would want to see.
*  Because those I mean, I believe Aerospence Junior is right there with them.
*  He's a phenomenal fighter, particularly what he did with Garcia.
*  But Lomachenko and Terrence Crawford are two masters.
*  When I look at them in terms of what they do to their opponents,
*  they're the two Lomachenko with that crazy movement and footwork.
*  But Terrence Crawford just figures people out.
*  He finds a way. He switches stances.
*  He'll start out Southpaw or start out orthodox, then they'll switch up on you,
*  start boxing you up.
*  He puts all the data into that computer and then starts finding your weaknesses.
*  And then he gets nasty with you.
*  And I love the I mean, one of the things I like about him is how fucking mean he is.
*  You know, there's another guy who's like a sweetheart.
*  The nicest guy. I've had him in here.
*  I've had him in here. He was great. He was a great podcast guest.
*  But once he starts putting it on dudes, man, this is like a meanness to him.
*  You know, it's like you see he relishes in it when the dudes go down.
*  He gets a kick out of it.
*  You know? Yeah. Yeah.
*  There's that killer instinct. Oh, but these fights, there's no replacement for them.
*  You can see Terrence in a great fight.
*  You can see Lomachenko in a great fight, Spence in a great fight.
*  But if they're not fighting each other, we just won't know.
*  Because once you get to an elite level, everybody's so good.
*  You can't say you know how this is going to turn out. Right. Right. Right.
*  So Lomachenko is too small.
*  I mean, I don't think he's ever going to fight Terrence.
*  I mean, there was a time when the Mikey Garcia fight could have happened with Lomachenko at 35.
*  I don't think he should ever fight at 40 or above.
*  I think he'd say that same.
*  But when you see what Mikey Garcia would happen to him when he went up against Errol Spence,
*  you see Errol's just way bigger and stronger and better.
*  Yeah. I mean, it's a 147 pound division.
*  Yeah. And he's jacked.
*  Errol Spence is just jacked at 47, like ripped and shredded.
*  And at the weigh in, when I looked at two of them, I was like, wow, that's a difference.
*  Right. Well, again, by the time fight night is,
*  fight night's on, fight in the middleweight.
*  Errol's yeah. Errol's even bigger.
*  I think him and hopefully he's OK.
*  Hopefully he's OK.
*  And he said he's getting back to the gym and getting back after it.
*  Him and Terrence is the fight.
*  That is the fight. It's the fight.
*  It's got to happen. It's got to happen.
*  And no, neither one of them fighting anybody else will tell us more about what's
*  going to happen when they fight each other.
*  Errol Spence is back in training, right?
*  He's training. Yeah. Yeah.
*  And has been for a while.
*  That's what the reports say.
*  So are they trying to make something happen soon?
*  Is there an idea of like I believe?
*  I think he's thinking like May.
*  Like, really? That's again, these are, you know, this is the talk.
*  Yeah, I know. I know.
*  I'm very excited.
*  And he's the kind of guy that's going to want to jump right back into the deep water.
*  I don't think he's a fight type of dude.
*  No, not after Garcia fight.
*  I'd like to see that one live.
*  That's when I might I might go to see that one live.
*  Yeah.
*  I hope it's a T-Mobile or something or MGM.
*  I might fly in to see that one.
*  That's a very, very, very interesting fight to me.
*  Oh, oh.
*  OK, so this morning, oh.
*  I went and floated.
*  Ah, I have a tank here.
*  Shit. Yeah.
*  OK, first of all, I only did it because you suggested it.
*  And I was like, OK, well,
*  you're so adamant about how dope it is.
*  Yeah, that I was like,
*  let me see if this guy's on to something.
*  A phenomenal experience.
*  It's amazing, right?
*  It's amazing.
*  It's therapeutic.
*  I'm I felt like I was meditating and then somehow like having a muscle
*  relaxing, relaxing massage at the same time.
*  Yeah, I couldn't tell at some point whether like my eyes were open or closed.
*  I try to keep my eyes open instead of like closing them and falling asleep.
*  But I couldn't tell between daydreaming and like sleep dreaming.
*  Yeah, it's such a crazy experience.
*  Yeah, just be like in the pitch black, like just like floating.
*  Bro. Yeah, I love it.
*  Everybody should do this, like because I'm I'm a guy's guy.
*  Like, you know, even massages sometimes like
*  I don't know.
*  Especially because you're in such a macho business, right?
*  Exactly. Exactly.
*  And this is perfect for guys like, you know, meditating seems a little too late.
*  Yeah, it's great for your muscles, too, man.
*  All that Epson salts really good.
*  It loosens everything up.
*  My bones got to crack.
*  I felt like I had a massage when I got out.
*  This is up. Yeah.
*  So kudos to you for finding that.
*  That's awesome. I'm glad.
*  I'm really excited.
*  I try to tell more people about it.
*  You know, there's did you go to the float lab?
*  Which place did you go to?
*  I went to just float.
*  Where's that?
*  Pasadena.
*  That's the biggest place in the world, apparently.
*  Is it? Yes.
*  Because people were talking about how they get claustrophobic and it's like a
*  constricted tube, but this place is like a spa.
*  It's like a big room.
*  Like the tub's big.
*  You're not closed at all.
*  You got your own show, your own room.
*  And they use the lab stuff.
*  They use all the float lab stuff.
*  I'm pretty sure. Don't think?
*  Pretty sure.
*  Float lab.
*  My friend Crash, who runs the started and runs the float lab, he built my tank.
*  And I met him actually when I had an old tank, a different tank.
*  And the guy there was a friend of mine who was a tank repair guy.
*  He was doing repair on my tank.
*  And I said, you know, these tanks are good.
*  But there's a guy in Venice that makes the best tanks ever.
*  He's like a mad scientist.
*  He should talk to him like, you know, you have some money.
*  Get a better tank. Really?
*  So, yeah, get a better tank.
*  And I'm like, wow.
*  So I contacted this dude.
*  I went to see his shit.
*  And I was like, I mean, he makes them.
*  They look like built in.
*  They look like walk in freezers like minus seven feet tall.
*  It's nine feet long. It's huge.
*  They're giant.
*  I mean, it's a big fucking heavy door and shit.
*  Fully insulated.
*  Yeah, he's got like commercial water filtration system filters.
*  So like you use that to like for a town's water supply.
*  That's ridiculous.
*  They see the equipment back there.
*  It's fucking bonkers. How often do you do it?
*  I have been slacking.
*  I haven't been in it lately.
*  I haven't been in over a month, but that's just because the last month I've
*  been so fucking busy, but I'm actually planning on getting in there tomorrow.
*  I'm excited.
*  See. All right.
*  So you are a man of many hats, right?
*  Obviously you do so many things.
*  But
*  is there an overriding passion?
*  I only have like the one thing like you asked me, like I do other stuff, whatever.
*  Yeah.
*  On the margins.
*  But this boxing, this world is my world.
*  Everything else is just should I do in between?
*  Is there one is one of the things you do like really who you are?
*  If you had to get rid of everything else, what's the one thing you got to keep?
*  I don't think I'd get rid of stand up.
*  If I had to choose one thing, I would
*  keep doing stand up because it's probably the most challenging podcasts are probably
*  the easiest, but they're challenging to depending upon the guest,
*  especially if it's like a really intricate subject or this.
*  You know, it's about physics or history or something where I have to do some
*  reading and really try to keep up with it.
*  But podcasts are fun because I like talking to people.
*  So it's to me, it's like the easiest job
*  because I've always loved conversations.
*  I've always loved like, tell me how you do that.
*  What are you thinking when you're doing that?
*  Like, what's going on?
*  Like, I'm always trying to figure out my own mind.
*  Like, what are my own motivations and how do I get better at things?
*  How do I get better at being a person?
*  And one of the best ways is to talk to people that are exceptional and try to
*  figure out, like, how are you doing that?
*  Like, what is your approach?
*  How do you prepare?
*  What's your thought process?
*  You know, what are you eating?
*  How do you sleep?
*  And that kind of stuff.
*  So to me, it comes I've always been curious.
*  So it almost becomes natural.
*  And then I've been doing it so long.
*  It's even though it doesn't seem like it should be.
*  Conversation does become a skill.
*  It's something you get better at not being annoying.
*  You get better at not talking over people.
*  You get better at, you know, formulating sentences and being inquisitive.
*  The UFC is just a massive passion of mine from, you know, the time I've been a
*  martial artist for as long as I can remember.
*  So for me and like dedicated from the time I was 15 on, like dedicated,
*  like my whole life, I didn't do any partying in high school.
*  All I did was fight.
*  All I did was compete, travel all over the country and compete in Taekwondo
*  tournaments. That was my whole life.
*  So my my life has been deeply enriched by martial arts.
*  So then when the UFC came around and I realized, like, oh, this is the future.
*  This is what martial arts really should be.
*  They should. This is the stuff that really works.
*  We didn't really know before that.
*  Before the UFC came along, there was all a speculation.
*  What's better? Is judo better?
*  Is boxing better? Is wrestling better?
*  And then when you see them go after you, like, oh, it's a combination of things.
*  And everybody has their own unique way of implementing this combination of things.
*  You know, and then you get to the highest levels of the game and you find some
*  constant variables, but some things change and the sports ever evolving and
*  shifting and the the new guys now in 2020 are so much better than the guys in 2010
*  and way better than the guys in 2000 and way better than the guys in 1993 when the
*  first UFC was held.
*  So for me, that is like a hobby.
*  I would I would have to say or just a thing that is a constant part of my life.
*  But that's one of the easiest jobs because all I have to do is be interested in it.
*  And I'm already interested in it.
*  So I'm already watching fights.
*  And then before the fights, I'll rewatch,
*  like certain important championship fights and I'll rewatch fights where fighters
*  had difficulty and stuff like that.
*  But I do that because I love it.
*  You know, I might do that anyway, even if it wasn't my job.
*  So by the time I get to like a John
*  Jones, Dominic Reyes fight like this past weekend, I've watched hours of footage
*  of those guys just that week just because I'm interested.
*  I just keep watching stuff and I keep watching difficult fights and easy fights
*  and dominant fights and I watch training footage.
*  But that's like I probably do that anyway.
*  If I had the time, like if I'm sitting in my computer and, you know,
*  I don't have shit to do, I'll watch the training footage.
*  I watch a countdown show.
*  I'll watch. I want to see what's going on.
*  I'm excited for the fight.
*  So I'll get pumped.
*  I'll do that for this Wilder Fury fight.
*  I'm going to I'm going to watch all kinds of shit.
*  I want to hear them talk. I want to see the training.
*  I want to see him running and hitting the bag.
*  I want to see all that stuff.
*  Yeah. See, I'm the same in that everything
*  I do somehow informs that single passion I have, like talking to fighters,
*  looking into a fight and figuring out what the narrative really is,
*  how many things hang in the balance, not just a championship belt or somebody's
*  bragging rights, but all the things that they bring to it personally.
*  And the thing there are communities that they represent in all the things that
*  are on the line down the line, I get like caught up in that shit.
*  But when I'm working out my mind, I'm in the gym.
*  Like when I'm hitting the bag, when I'm sparring other guys, even
*  conversations can be sparring sessions.
*  I got to be prepared for that kind of back and forth.
*  And I use that information I collect about myself.
*  And how to react and respond to other people in a boxing gym.
*  Yeah. So I asked this because my other thing as a hobby or like a fascination,
*  something I would never do, is I'm a huge stand up fan, a huge stand up fan.
*  I will watch like stand up comedy like guys I've never heard of.
*  I go to the clubs, all this stuff.
*  How much does the judo, the martial arts,
*  the discipline inform the craft on the stage for you?
*  I think all three things work.
*  Together in some strange way, they all work together like they all like doing
*  live stand up makes doing podcasts easier because live stand up is you need a reaction.
*  There's so much preparation involved.
*  There's writing, there's thinking about subjects, there's listening to recordings,
*  there's just going over them, there's multiple reps.
*  You have to do like I'm doing two sets tonight.
*  I'll do two sets tomorrow.
*  I got one on Thursday, two Friday, two Saturday.
*  And this is a normal week. That's normal.
*  You have to do those reps.
*  If you don't do those reps, you won't be sharp.
*  You have to be sharp if you want to do shows, especially now I'm doing arenas.
*  Like a lot of these arenas, it's a lot of fucking people, man.
*  You have to you got to be ready.
*  You can't be I'm pretty ready.
*  You got to be ready. Right.
*  So that is like there's a lot of discipline involved in that.
*  And then the podcast expands my my perspective.
*  I just being able to talk to people and see the way people think.
*  Just talking to you about your experience with Deontay Wilder,
*  the way that you framed that in an incredibly positive way, that it helped you and helped everybody.
*  There's a lot of people that would have been tortured by that moment and it would
*  have fucked them up, but you became empowered by it.
*  And you looked at it as a growing learning opportunity, but also an opportunity for
*  the growth of like you as a broadcaster, for the fight, for everything.
*  And then it becomes this crazy meme.
*  It was ultimately only positive.
*  Although in the moment, you're tied up and not reading the comments like fucking Beyonce is mad at me.
*  All these people are mad at me. Snoop's mad at me.
*  This this whole thing, they all work together.
*  And then the UFC being able to have the honor of calling these fights live with
*  the greatest fighters in the world and being able to put words to their performance
*  and give a description of the heart and the courage and the skill that these guys
*  exhibit and the discipline involved in getting to this state as a mixed martial artist.
*  Like how what an epic commitment you have
*  to have to excellence to become a John Jones, right?
*  To become a Henry Sahuta or fill in the blank.
*  You have to use it's a special type of human.
*  So I think when you're around those special
*  types of humans, you have a higher appreciation for excellence.
*  You have a higher appreciation for discipline.
*  And I think just seeing what they do and
*  watching it manifest itself in real life, a Conor McGregor or, you know, or Max Holloway
*  or Alex Volkonovsky, all these different killers that have had this opportunity to
*  call their fights, it makes me appreciate excellence.
*  And that's why you get pissed off when
*  someone dismisses that kind of excellence with a schtick.
*  Yes, yes, yes.
*  Oh, well, I also think, you know, it has to be your thing.
*  You know, you can't you can't bullshit.
*  You can't just go buy some stats that you've read online or that a producer gives you.
*  You have to understand the complexities because if you don't, people will know.
*  It's like you try to talk shit to someone in French and you only know 20 words.
*  You can say those 20 words good, but then someone goes, oh, we we and then
*  they start busting out other words you don't know.
*  Oh, no, I got myself in a quagmire.
*  That's it. That's what it's like if you're
*  talking shit about MMA, if you don't really understand the sport.
*  You know, I've been involved in the sport in one way or another professionally since
*  1997, you know, that's when I first started working for the UFC.
*  So it's been it's a long fucking time, man.
*  You know, that's a long fucking time.
*  I keep hearing rumors that Dana White is going to become a boxing promoter.
*  I've heard for like five years.
*  Yes. Yeah, they are.
*  Yeah, they're working on some shit.
*  I can't really tell you much, but they're definitely working on some shit.
*  Yeah, they they put together the Conor McGregor and Floyd Mayweather Junior
*  fight, of course, with TME, with Floyd's company, TBE rather.
*  What is it called?
*  The Money Team.
*  Yeah, TMT.
*  That's what his promotion team is called, right?
*  TMT. Mayweather Promotions.
*  His crew, I guess.
*  So he and they did this sort of co-promotion for that big fight.
*  And then they're working on some other
*  thing with Floyd where Floyd wants to get involved with them to promote something
*  else that might involve MMA fighters, might involve boxers.
*  And they've actively talked to a bunch
*  of other boxers and they're trying to put some stuff together.
*  But yeah, they Zufa boxing is a real thing.
*  They want to UFC wants to put together
*  some boxing matches and maybe even some crossover fights.
*  I just wonder how that works, because the UFC model just won't exist in the boxing
*  world that you can't you won't have enough control.
*  You don't have to.
*  You just have to schedule a couple big fights.
*  I mean, they're not going to do it like they do the UFC where they do a fight.
*  The UFC literally is a fight every week.
*  Yeah. Right now.
*  For the next five weeks, there's a fight every weekend.
*  And people are hitting pay per view dollars.
*  Well, it's ESPN Plus or ESPN and sometimes pay per view dollars.
*  I thought the ESPN because I have ESPN Plus and I was like, oh, great.
*  Should I get to watch these UFC fights for like $5.99 a month?
*  Nope. Yeah.
*  No.
*  Still, it's still like $65.
*  Yeah. I bought it on my TV this morning.
*  I watched it again when I was lifting this morning and I had to pay $65.
*  You know, but it's
*  it's a weird thing, right?
*  Like you can't really do it where it's just $5.99 and don't have pay per view
*  because then the big fights won't be big fights.
*  You know, they want.
*  How does the zone have it?
*  Do you have to pay?
*  No, you don't.
*  That's their whole thing.
*  Oh, so the Tyson Fury and Deontay, that's going to be on the zone.
*  No, no, no. Tyson Fury and Deontay, I think, is a simulcast between Fox.
*  If simulcast is the right word and ESPN in other words, they're going to have
*  their own separate pay per views and you can watch whichever production you like,
*  which is going to be something like, yeah, yeah.
*  So who's the commentators?
*  Then it becomes the commentators.
*  It depends on where you tune in.
*  If you go to ESPN, you'll hear their people.
*  They got their own.
*  I think they have their own broadcast.
*  I think why don't they use Max Kellerman?
*  I am so confused.
*  I loved his boxing commentary and he doesn't comment on live fights anymore.
*  I think that's got to be his own choice.
*  I mean, I can't imagine that they don't want to fuck.
*  He not want to do that.
*  He was so good at it.
*  I don't know.
*  He's got his own show.
*  Andre Ward is also one of my favorite guys.
*  He's I love Andre Ward for a bunch of reasons, but one for the fact that that
*  guy undefeated gold medalist to division world champion because you know what?
*  We're good.
*  Walked away. Just walked away.
*  And I sense that he will stay away.
*  Oh, yeah, he's going to stay away.
*  You know, they talked to him about Canelo after Canelo knocked out Kovalev.
*  And he made a long statement about that.
*  He's better off for boxing, even for boxing outside of fighting.
*  You know, he knows like he's so smart, man.
*  He's so smart and so disciplined.
*  He's just so disciplined.
*  He knows like there's no reason.
*  There's no reason to come back.
*  This is the right way to do it.
*  There's big money and coming back, but there's also big brain damage.
*  The ego after you retire is the biggest fight of your life.
*  Like you're exactly right.
*  This guy's undefeated.
*  I'm sure if you're a talk to him off camera,
*  I could beat Canelo, you know, of course, he must think that just because of who he
*  is, you've got to think that sort of thing to stop yourself from the money,
*  the glory one more time, the possibility of you imagine coming out of retirement
*  and beating like Canelo Alvarez
*  and to be able to be like, you know what?
*  It's better for me and it's better for boxing.
*  If I stay retired and keep sitting ringside and talk about these fights and
*  the way I do, that's a special kind of character.
*  He's a special person.
*  But it also he also has this issue with his right shoulder.
*  You know, his right shoulder was basically broken most of his career and he got it
*  fixed before the second Kovalev fight and he actually wound up hurting Kovalev
*  real bad with a right hand, which if you watch his career,
*  he was like a left handed fighter from the majority of his super spinatus.
*  It was like ripped off like it was really fucked up.
*  And he tried to rehab it with bands instead of going through surgery when he was young.
*  And so most of his career, he beat the best fighters in the world.
*  Carl Frosch, all those guys one handed, which is even more insane, even more insane.
*  And then, you know, had the surgery rehabbed it.
*  But he said it's still not 100 percent.
*  It's never going to be 100 percent.
*  Right. Which is why people are afraid of surgery.
*  It's like, you know, I'd rather do the bands, everything than take the chance.
*  It's better than it was before.
*  I think before you had like 40 percent use of his shoulder, which is crazy.
*  Yeah. Beat in the.
*  He said he never felt like you could throw a good punch.
*  He always felt like it was going to blow out on him.
*  Geez.
*  That nuts. Yeah.
*  Fucked everybody up with one hand.
*  That's how you make yourself a legend.
*  He's definitely a legend.
*  But I mean, maybe an underappreciated, underappreciated legend, you know,
*  in terms of mainstream boxing viewpoint, I don't think the mainstream
*  public really appreciates how great he was.
*  No. And the way it is time or after it will take like people reflecting on history,
*  I think, unfortunately for him, his kids and their kids might get the benefit
*  of who their dad or grandfather was more so than he's getting it now.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, there's certain great fighters that for whatever reason, they never really
*  captured the public's imagination, even though they were great.
*  You know, like Marlon Starling, who was a fantastic welterweight,
*  knocked out Mark Breland, who was actually now Deontay Wilder's trainer.
*  Yeah. But I remember when Mark Breland was
*  coming from the Olympics and he was this really long, tall welterweight.
*  And he fought Starling and Starling wasn't really appreciated enough.
*  And Starling, you know, Starling put it on him.
*  And you realize that there's there's guys out there that for whatever reason,
*  people don't appreciate them as much as they should.
*  Yeah. Timings, everything.
*  Also, you got to catch.
*  It's unfortunate.
*  But as much as we hate just guys putting on an act or like hyping themselves up
*  with these characters they create, that is bankable.
*  I mean, we all know guys who don't deserve the shots that they continue to get.
*  But because they bring an audience with their shit talking or with their antics
*  and all the the show that they put on, it's better than the fight.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, who's the most confusing to me is Julio Cesar Chavez Jr.
*  He's confusing to me like that last fight.
*  I'm like, what are you doing?
*  Like you're saying like the guy headbutted me, my nose broken.
*  I'm quitting. Right.
*  Like, what are you doing?
*  Do you not understand?
*  You're Mexican.
*  Like those are the hardest motherfuckers on earth when it comes to boxing.
*  You're not just Mexican.
*  You are the son of the man.
*  You're the son of a guy like he he won something like 31 world title fights.
*  Some insane number.
*  He has the record of world title wins, which is also like an unattainable goal.
*  Like if you decide to go into boxing and your father is Julio Cesar Chavez,
*  dude, one of the goats.
*  What do you hope to how far can you hope to get in legacy?
*  Like I almost feel bad for the guy,
*  like because there's got to be so much going on in his head to put him
*  in a place where he's at, but yet he's talented.
*  He's fucking he's a good fighter.
*  He like his skills, his ability to put hands on people are very good.
*  But I think also there's something about growing up wealthy.
*  Yeah, it's just almost impossible.
*  Like you kind of have to have some part of your life that was fucked up
*  and you didn't think it was going to work out where where you didn't think there
*  was there was a future and there's a burn that never goes out.
*  There's like a little fire that never goes out.
*  Ease is a greater challenge than adversity.
*  Yes, it is, man.
*  There's something about comfort that just makes bitches out of people.
*  It just does.
*  It's so hard to overcome that you can't even forcibly remove yourself from that
*  comfort. It's very few human beings are able to really achieve greatness
*  when they grow up with with great wealth and privilege.
*  There's something about that, that life of leisure and knowing that everything's
*  going to be OK, you know, like your dad made 50 million dollars.
*  You're going to be fine.
*  There's something about that that just for whatever reason, it just haunts haunts people.
*  Yeah, I mean, he would almost have to have there be something burning brightly
*  inside him, almost like a resentment for his father.
*  Unfortunately, I don't think love could propel you to like even come anywhere near
*  his legacy. You'd actually have to hate the guy just to be like fire
*  burning bright enough to attain anything close to what he did.
*  And I feel bad for his dad, too.
*  You know, his dad watching him quit.
*  I'm like, oh, no.
*  But you know, he's a loving father, man.
*  It's not the first time he's been embarrassed.
*  Like he keeps coming back like, all right, this is the one.
*  This is the time. One more.
*  The Canelo fight was a rough one, too.
*  Canelo outclassed him.
*  You know, Canelo is just a better fighter.
*  And Shub is not a quitter.
*  Like we like this last time he may have had a point.
*  Maybe he was like headbutt, maybe the elbows.
*  But quitting and boxing, obviously, is the cardinal sin.
*  Wasn't that fucked up.
*  It wasn't like his nose is pouring blood and he couldn't breathe out of it anymore.
*  And it was from a blatant foul.
*  Like he looked OK. Right.
*  Yeah. Maybe there's something going on that we couldn't see.
*  But he looked and then he took videos
*  from the hospital the next day with tape on his nose and like
*  he was not helping.
*  Lay low for a while, bro.
*  Yeah.
*  What is it? What else is exciting for you on the horizon?
*  Boxing wise, what are you looking at?
*  I'm just saying I'm anticipating and eagerly awaiting the return of Manny Pacquiao.
*  Listen, we can't not talk about Pacquiao when we talk about the Walter White
*  division because I mean, because he's 40 and he's not in the news all the time.
*  He's not at press conference.
*  We don't we only talk about him when he's got a fight sign that sometimes in these
*  conversations we forget, yo, he's a world title holder.
*  He just dominated a guy that there's no way at his age he should have been able
*  to dominate considering who Keith Thurman was two years prior before his surgery.
*  Pacquiao could ruin everybody's shit.
*  Like,
*  but what do you think about do you think
*  that he would ever step up and fight Terrence Crawford at the stage of his
*  career? I don't think that fight happens for multiple reasons.
*  I wouldn't suggest it if I was in his camp.
*  Also,
*  I don't think that any more than they want to make the Spence Crawford fight.
*  Do they want to put Pacquiao in that kind
*  of harm's way and give top rank and ESPN an opportunity to dethrone him?
*  Like, you know, he's with the Hayman camp now.
*  It's the same with Spence.
*  So that is going to protect him.
*  He's not going to have to say whether or not he really wants to fight.
*  I don't think he can get it.
*  Manny Pacquiao, inks deal with paradigm sports management who represent Conor
*  McGregor. Oh, Jesus.
*  That's what they're going to do.
*  Manny Pacquiao,
*  no, thanks. That's probably what the UFC wants to try to do.
*  Is that the thing?
*  Maybe they heard you talking about.
*  Well, just got posted a half hour ago.
*  Oh, shit.
*  While we're talking.
*  Oh, shit.
*  I got to tell you, if that's the thing,
*  all that anticipation and eagerly awaiting shit just flew out the window.
*  Well, here it is an opportunity for Manny Pacquiao to make a fuckload of money.
*  I mean, that's how I look at it.
*  I look at it for Manny to make 100 million bucks.
*  But you'd have to sell the public.
*  I mean, they already watched Floyd Mayweather box circles around them.
*  They're going to sell it. Of course,
*  that's why it's going to be 100 million bucks.
*  But I'm going to be irritated by every single,
*  every single brown penny that's spent on that fight is going to be my nemesis.
*  You know what? You're really going to be irritated by the people that think that
*  Conor has a chance.
*  It's easy.
*  What are you doing?
*  Come on, guys.
*  See, what if they give him six months?
*  What if he has some?
*  What if he fights Pauli Malanagi first?
*  I
*  tell you what I would pay for
*  Manny Pacquiao versus either Aerospence or Crawford.
*  I would pay for either one of those fights.
*  I would like that.
*  I would like that's what I would like to see.
*  I think while Manny's 40, I mean, after the Keith Thurman fight,
*  he has shown that he's still like a legit world beater, you know,
*  and Terrence Crawford is the cream of the crop, in my opinion.
*  I want to see that.
*  You know what would be more exciting, exciting than both of those fights?
*  Sean Porter.
*  Oh, that's a good fight, too.
*  Manny Pacquiao versus Sean Porter would be a hell of a night of box.
*  Very good fight, too. Very good fight, too.
*  Yeah. Yeah. I don't believe it.
*  Listen, I believe in world champions.
*  Oh, there's way too many of them in every weight division.
*  This fucking like, oh,
*  undefeated fighters are the only ones that are worth talking about.
*  That's the if there's one thing I love about the UFC and MMA culture period is
*  that losing a fight doesn't mean losing your whole fucking brand.
*  Like, if you go out there, comport yourself well, leave it all in the octagon.
*  You live to fight another day,
*  and people still respect the effort you put forward.
*  Like, they recognize that if you're fighting guys at your level,
*  you'll win some and you'll lose some.
*  And hopefully you win more than you lose.
*  And that's how you become the man.
*  But not but losing some doesn't make you a bitch.
*  Doesn't make you like a bum.
*  Well, I think Manny's kind of proven that.
*  I mean, remember when Mon-Manuel Marquez put him in orbit?
*  Yeah. Just put him in orbit around Jupiter.
*  Took him four times to do it.
*  But I'll tell you what, I said it on the night, too.
*  By the way, that is the most electric
*  boxing atmosphere I've ever been a part of.
*  I've been cover fights my entire adult life.
*  They knew when they were singing that anthem,
*  the Mexicans were singing the Mexican anthem before the fight.
*  And I was sitting there with a friend of mine, also a fellow journalist,
*  Sean Zatel.
*  And we were sitting up in the rafters, we weren't even sitting in the press row.
*  We were sitting like we I didn't want to be bothered with all the yammering that
*  goes on the press row. So I found seats like up above the ring.
*  And when they were singing that anthem, we looked at each other like,
*  something is about to happen here tonight.
*  This is we knew it was a special night.
*  And, bro, when he knocked out Manny Pacquiao, he should have crowd surfed
*  to Mexico and never, ever laced up a pair of boxing gloves again.
*  Right. Yeah.
*  And he never fought him again.
*  That's what's really interesting.
*  I thought they would have had another one.
*  He should never fought anybody again.
*  It's never going to get ever better than that night in that moment.
*  Yeah, but he still always have that forever.
*  And there's something about especially Latino fighters.
*  It's like they almost kind of have to keep going.
*  Like all the greats kept going.
*  All the greats, Chavez kept going way past.
*  He should have, you know, and then, you know, I mean, so so many of them just keep
*  going. They Roberto Duran, you know, kept going forever.
*  You know, it's I mean, it's an addiction.
*  It's a lifestyle.
*  And if you still believe you can do it,
*  I'm still better than most of those guys.
*  Why not keep doing it?
*  One more W. Who doesn't want one more W?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah. So I decided to pick a career a little bit more longevity.
*  And no physical downside.
*  Exactly.
*  We're going to talk right everybody right into the grave.
*  That's the thing about what you're doing.
*  You get to see the real consequences that some of these guys face.
*  Yeah.
*  And it is not it's it is a dark thing to see a fight where you see a guy get
*  beaten down and the referee stops to fight and they see him slump into the corner
*  and collapse, you know, and I've seen that only on television.
*  I haven't seen that live when the stretcher comes out.
*  Yeah. You know what I mean?
*  Because sometimes the knockout doesn't look that vicious.
*  It's a knockout.
*  But you're not as soon as a guy goes down, you're not gasping.
*  Yeah. Then the guy's not moving.
*  Right. That's not responding.
*  Well, you remember the Gerald McClellan fight.
*  He took a knee and then people were questioning him, you know,
*  and then he slumped and collapsed in his corner.
*  Yeah. It's I mean, it's the most combat sports are the most brutal of all contests.
*  I mean, there's a football is probably next, you know, but out of the the
*  difference is with combat sports is a guy doing it to you and you're trying to do it
*  to him. I mean, it's the only thing that's happening there.
*  There's not a ball going across a line.
*  Right. There's only a guy trying to fuck you up and you're trying to fuck him up.
*  Right. And the lack of protective equipment is part of the fight.
*  You're in your underwear.
*  Yeah. You're basically in your underwear with shoes on.
*  And in MMA, you don't even have shoes on.
*  Correct. Yeah.
*  And your fingertips are showing.
*  I mean, it's fucking you're about as naked as you can get legally and compete in
*  something. I mean, thank God, obviously.
*  But I am surprised that there hasn't been more serious injury in MMA.
*  I don't know if that's just because of how long we've been paying attention or I
*  don't know. What do you know?
*  I think it's good refereeing.
*  You know, MMA has some pretty exceptional referees that are very aware of the
*  dangers of guys taking extra shots.
*  There's also a thing where they don't get a chance to recover like they do in boxing
*  where a guy gets knocked down and then they give him an eight count.
*  There's none of that shit.
*  When you get knocked down in MMA, if the referee thinks it's over, they just wave
*  it off because there's too many weapons, right?
*  You're elbowing people in the face.
*  You're kicking them.
*  There's like if they think you're done, you're done.
*  You know, they don't give you that chance.
*  The standing eight counts.
*  You know, they don't they don't that ten count.
*  There's something about that ten count.
*  It's great because it makes for moments like Tyson Fury rising off the deck to
*  win the rest of the round with Deontay Wilder in that 12th.
*  But it also it gives your brain a false sense of recovery.
*  Like you're fucked up, man.
*  You really probably shouldn't be going on in MMA.
*  You really don't get a chance to go on when they stop it.
*  They stop it.
*  If the referee is in front of you, the fight's over.
*  When I first started watching MMA, there was no UFC.
*  Right. I had like the bootleg box in my room and we get the fuzzy channel and
*  people are getting their fucking arms broken and shit and like headbutted and blood all over.
*  Between you and I, just between you and I.
*  Which one did you like better?
*  Do you like like the first iteration of knowing pretty much everything?
*  No, I like skills better now.
*  The guys are way more skillful.
*  And that's what's interesting to me.
*  What's what's interesting to me more than anything is the growth of the
*  understanding of what works and what doesn't work, like of skill, of technique.
*  That's the most important thing to me.
*  Guys like Mighty Mouse.
*  He was one of my favorite fighters to watch because he would fuck people up and not even get hit.
*  He'd be moving on people in ways they didn't even know what was happening until he was doing it.
*  It was too late. He'd already hit you.
*  He was moving these different angles.
*  He'd catch people with arm bars.
*  He'd fuck you up with knees in the clinch.
*  He was like, in my opinion, the greatest expression of mixed martial arts talent.
*  And because he was like so next level in terms of like his ability to implement
*  his strategy on you and you couldn't do shit to him.
*  But he didn't get a chance to fight the level of talent as a guy like John Jones.
*  John Jones is fascinating to me because he's been able to stay on top for almost a fucking decade,
*  only fighting world class top of the food chain, world championship caliber fighters,
*  which is just amazing. Like no one's been able to do that.
*  John's undefeated. His one loss by disqualification.
*  It's a bullshit loss that was from a bullshit rule where you're not supposed to elbow like this elbow from 12 to 6.
*  It's supposed to come down at an angle, which makes no sense.
*  And I've described it too many times to go into details.
*  It's an ignorant rule.
*  It shouldn't exist.
*  But he beat the fuck out of Matt Hamill winning that fight.
*  There was no way Matt Hamill was winning that fight.
*  John dominated him.
*  So John's undefeated and he's been undefeated
*  youngest ever world champion, 23 years old, won the world championship in the UFC and has dominated ever since.
*  I mean, that's that's insane.
*  That to me is one of the most impressive things in all of sports.
*  Watching that guy achieve a record that might never be achieved again.
*  It
*  the thing about boxing that has my imagination and my fascination continually
*  spark is the the finite nature of the tools and the weapons that you have to use.
*  Yeah. Right.
*  I respect and appreciate MMA, but it's almost like the antithesis of that.
*  And that they have so many things they can use and whatnot.
*  It's an entirely different discipline.
*  Yeah. But you're coming from a martial arts background.
*  So I grew up on kung fu movies.
*  Right.
*  And so when I started watching this shit, these guys were in geese.
*  They were like, you know, I said, like the Gracie's breaking arms,
*  what not that made sense to me.
*  And I understood why a boxer wouldn't fight a karate man or a judo guy or whatever,
*  because that's what the science is for me.
*  Like what you can do with these two hands and two feet are the only way you can
*  evade and all of that.
*  But why can't the karate man?
*  Why isn't there like a Bruce Lee of MMA as a martial art,
*  as a martial artist, can you still believe in like one discipline?
*  After all, it's MMA is proven it doesn't work.
*  There's no real one discipline that will work best in MMA.
*  You have to know everything.
*  But if I was going to say what discipline is the most important, I would say
*  wrestling, because if you can't keep a guy from taking you down,
*  he's going to be on top of you, he's going to hold you down.
*  And then the guy's going to punch you in the face.
*  It's a giant advantage to be able to hold a guy down,
*  be able to punch his face in.
*  And you can't really do much when the guy's on top of you.
*  That said, from there, you have to understand jiu jitsu, because if you don't,
*  you could hold the guy down.
*  Then all of a sudden he wraps his legs around your neck and you cut a triangle
*  and you go to sleep and every fight starts standing.
*  So you have to have some understanding
*  of striking because you have to be able to close the distance.
*  But
*  there's no one way to do it.
*  That's what's interesting to me.
*  It's like there's Anderson Silva's way to do it.
*  It was the greatest middleweight of all time and his way to do it was through
*  striking. He would just stay up with guys and just fuck them up with timing
*  and precision and Muay Thai.
*  But then there's guys like Daniel Cormier who take guys down and beat the fuck out
*  of them, choke them, you know, and there's a bunch of different people
*  that with a bunch of different styles in between.
*  But if you look at the majority of world
*  champions, the majority, except maybe a couple weight classes,
*  they're dominated by wrestlers.
*  Yeah.
*  There's a lot of pictures on the Internet, by the way, of me with Anderson Silva's
*  tag. You think you're Anderson Silva?
*  You don't look anything like Anderson Silva.
*  You wouldn't believe how many people stop me, especially if I'm in like Vegas
*  when there's a UFC event.
*  You think you're Anderson Silva?
*  Anderson Silva.
*  That's ridiculous.
*  You don't look like Anderson Silva, man.
*  I'm telling you, I don't think so either.
*  But I'm telling you, I get it a lot.
*  Well, people, yeah, people are weird.
*  I mean, I've even dressed up for him,
*  like as him on Halloween and it went over like gangbusters.
*  That's funny.
*  Did you wear the Bruce Lee outfit?
*  Would you do? Yeah, of course.
*  Bruce Lee outfit.
*  I had a beanie, but it was Wu Tang.
*  I will find that picture and show it to you afterwards.
*  Well, listen, man, I'm glad we had this conversation.
*  It was a lot of fun.
*  It was brilliant.
*  By the way, I hope at some point every
*  single 30 million people that watch your shit get a chance to stop by the studio
*  personally. This is the dopest studio I've ever been in.
*  You must live here.
*  I would just live here.
*  I don't know what is going on, but like everything in here feels like the dude
*  I'm talking to.
*  And so kudos to you.
*  Like, thanks for having me.
*  Thanks, brother. My pleasure.
*  I really appreciate it.
*  It's a lot of fun talking to you.
*  I'm glad we got a chance to air that story out to you.
*  To this day.
*  Tell people your Instagram and all you jazz.
*  Oh, yeah, my Instagram, Radio Raheem Boxing.
*  R-A-H-I-M, Radio Raheem on Facebook and on YouTube.
*  You can find my content at SecondsOutTV.
*  Beautiful. Thank you, brother. Bye, everybody.
*  See you.
