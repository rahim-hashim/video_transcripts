# Joe Rogan Experience #2176 - Chad Daniels
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [July 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbsUw05I5_Y)
*  Hello Chad.
*  Hi.
*  What's happening man?
*  Nothing much.
*  Nice to meet you in person.
*  Yeah, likewise.
*  We were already chatting about how Google is totally listening to me.
*  Confirmed, 100%.
*  Because your Google News Feed is always like stuff that you're interested in, pretty much.
*  But I was having a conversation with my wife about purses, and she was explaining to me
*  that certain purses, like, you can't just buy the purse.
*  You have to develop a relationship with the store owner.
*  Like, what?
*  I don't get that.
*  You think if you're trying to sell stuff, you'd want to sell it right when they came
*  in.
*  Exactly.
*  I don't get it.
*  But like, there's a thing that certain posh people really love, and it's exclusivity.
*  They love it.
*  I'm the only one that can get this watch.
*  I'm the only one that can get this fucking purse or whatever it is.
*  So anyway, all of a sudden, Google starts showing me purse things.
*  They start showing me all this stuff about purses.
*  I didn't look anything up about purses.
*  I just had a conversation with the phone set at the dinner table.
*  That's crazy.
*  Yeah, it happens all the time.
*  It's weird.
*  It's up in your feed, you're like, oh, my forearms are too small.
*  Next thing you know, you got these flexy deals and the gorilla grip deal thingy that spins
*  around.
*  There's no doubt it happens.
*  There's 100% no doubt it happens, because that is the only explanation for that showing
*  up.
*  Because generally, it's always the same stuff, same kind of things that I'm interested in.
*  Stuff that I click on, UFOs, MMA, some new car, something.
*  It makes sense.
*  It shows up in my new...
*  And I'm like, why are they showing me three different articles about purses?
*  The fuck is going on?
*  Are you fucking creeps?
*  Ew.
*  Ew.
*  Is that legal?
*  How does that work?
*  Do you have to sign off on that, on the app?
*  Like, if you use the Google News app, are you signing off on that?
*  There are multiple ways that you may have opted into something that's allowing that
*  to happen, yeah.
*  Jesus.
*  I haven't read any of those things.
*  Not a single thing.
*  I scroll to the bottom, hit the thing.
*  If you read them, you're a psycho.
*  If you're sitting there reading those things...
*  How long would it take you?
*  Forever.
*  Yeah.
*  Like, how big is the Apple one?
*  It's three full scrolls.
*  Yeah.
*  Apple's pretty good about stuff.
*  I think they're probably the best about that because they're the first company that actually
*  stepped in and said, we're going to stop companies from being able to share your information.
*  They're the first that did.
*  What exactly did they do, Jamie?
*  They made some sort of a big deal.
*  It was an advertising move and a lot of people got pissed off with them for it.
*  It might have been the ability to opt out.
*  I think they might have given you the option to opt out on the settings of the iOS for
*  the first time.
*  I'll check.
*  Something like that.
*  I think you're right.
*  Something like that.
*  But a bunch of people like this, because it's going to affect our advertising.
*  But yeah, you guys are stealing money.
*  Stop doing that.
*  I spend my mornings going through my emails unsubscribing to stuff.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Is this too much?
*  There's companies.
*  Like, there's one of our ads.
*  Which one is that?
*  They'll go out and find the subscriptions.
*  Which one is that?
*  Jamie will find it.
*  Oh, like they go find it and let you know what you're subscribed to?
*  National Geographic?
*  Still?
*  Whatever it is.
*  Oh, God.
*  I am leaking money.
*  I'm sure.
*  Apparently, everybody is.
*  It's just you get so accustomed to subscribing.
*  Like, oh, yeah, that'll be easy.
*  I'll get the cereal every month.
*  Yeah.
*  No shit.
*  I'm five years into a lot of week-long subscriptions, free subscriptions.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, that was how they used to get you.
*  How old are you?
*  49.
*  Okay.
*  You might be old enough to remember.
*  I'm 56.
*  Do you remember those Columbia record house deals?
*  Oh, hell yeah.
*  Nobody paid for that.
*  How did they make any money?
*  I still have collection coming in.
*  Everybody does.
*  I feel like that was a way that they made artists seem more popular than they were.
*  I think that was part of their deals.
*  They could say they sold millions and millions of records.
*  I also think it was probably a way that they could rip artists off because they could say,
*  we lost all this money on Columbia.
*  They could factor it in.
*  I know it seems like you sold a million copies, but actually 400,000 of them are Columbia
*  and nobody's paid for them.
*  The MC Hammer clause.
*  Is that what it was?
*  I don't know, but he's that guy.
*  Did that happen to him?
*  I know that his record deal screwed him overhead at Faw for Bankruptcy, all that stuff.
*  Oh, yeah, that's right.
*  He went full MC Hammer too.
*  He went crazy.
*  He was getting some house built.
*  I remember it was the most extravagant house.
*  He had this super expensive marble that was being brought in.
*  Then I guess they pulled the rug out from under him.
*  Those dirty bastards.
*  I don't know the whole story behind the MC Hammer thing, but they for sure don't want
*  to pay you all that money.
*  Oh, no way.
*  If you look at royalties for comics, it's .00, like 15 zeros and then one cent.
*  Oh, yeah, you get nothing.
*  For audio, for comedy audio, you get nothing.
*  You get nothing.
*  It's always been like that, though.
*  Especially comedy albums.
*  After 1980, who fucking bought comedy albums?
*  I don't know, but it's like, plus the lawsuit, you know about the lawsuit?
*  Which one?
*  They had to take a bunch of people off of Pandora and Spotify and everything because
*  of the lawsuit that they were trying to get writer and performance credits.
*  Who was trying to get it?
*  Just a company.
*  It was...
*  I can't remember what it's called.
*  Jamie can find it.
*  Okay.
*  So what else were you finding?
*  Experian was the company that does the subscription.
*  Okay, Experian.
*  Yeah, so they'll find your subscriptions and they'll yank them.
*  So what is the company that's doing this?
*  So you had all these royalties coming in and then all of a sudden this company, there was
*  like a bunch of estates, like the Robin Williams estate, I think maybe George Carlin.
*  They were like, hey, we should be getting more money for this because it's 50-50 split,
*  but songwriters are getting a writer credit and a performance credit.
*  And so they wanted comics to do that, but that doesn't really make sense because comedians
*  are like, I'm not using your bits, and so you wouldn't get a writing credit for my performance.
*  So it was strange.
*  And so then Pandora was like, fuck this, we're pulling everything down and pulled a bunch
*  of guys off, including myself.
*  I still don't totally understand.
*  So who wanted the credit, like when you say writer and then performer credit, was that
*  to the comics, so the comics would get paid twice?
*  Yeah.
*  Okay, so instead of like an artist that didn't write their song, the comics are like, no,
*  we deserve to get paid twice because we created the entire content.
*  Exactly.
*  And Pandora was like, no, we can't do that.
*  Right, because the writers, I mean, like when you're singing a song and someone else wrote
*  it, that makes sense.
*  Right, right, right.
*  But no one's doing anybody's bits.
*  Right.
*  So like I can't sit up here and do a Hedberg bit.
*  And if you are, you probably bought them from them.
*  Yeah, so there was some sort of agreement.
*  Yeah.
*  I bought a heckle line once from a buddy of mine back in Boston.
*  It's such a dumb line.
*  Brian Fraser, the comedian.
*  The joke was, this is like to someone in the audience that's heckling you, like this is
*  my impression of God when he made you.
*  Okay, just a dash of cunt.
*  Oh no, the cap fell off.
*  Too much cunt.
*  How much did you pay for it?
*  I don't remember.
*  I think it was $500.
*  I don't remember.
*  But it was such a great line.
*  I was like, dude, that's a hilarious line.
*  He's like, I'll never use it.
*  I go sell it to me.
*  I'll fucking use it.
*  But, you know, I was like a year into comedy.
*  I was like, you know, when you're a year into comedy, anything that works, it's like you
*  have tools.
*  You have just like a toolbox and anything that works.
*  They're so precious.
*  You're so scared to write new ones.
*  Yeah, you're like start to freak out and then you're like, oh, this come and go gas station
*  bit always works.
*  Right.
*  You know, so you fall back on that.
*  Right.
*  And even that sucks.
*  You know, it's kind of like the problem is like when you're starting out, you say things
*  in a very specific way.
*  And that might not be the best way to say that bit.
*  But that's the way you're kind of stuck saying it.
*  That is a problem with bits.
*  Like sometimes when you create, even today, like I'll create a, I'm working on a new one
*  and I'm like, I don't know about this.
*  I feel like there's another way to say this.
*  And I'm just banking on the way that I've been saying it over and over and over again.
*  And maybe I should just abandon it and let it sit there for a bit and come back to it.
*  So I didn't work summers for a long time.
*  I have two kids.
*  And when I was, you know, when they were in high school, I'd always be home during the
*  summer.
*  And I found that in September, I would always be able to fix bits a little bit better because
*  I let them sit.
*  I almost forgot about them.
*  You know how it starts.
*  And then your brain is like, I have to get to this point, but I can't remember how I
*  got there.
*  Right.
*  And so then you start to put it together a little differently.
*  And they're probably working in the back of your head subconsciously too, because even
*  though you're not doing comedy for three months, you're still probably thinking in three months,
*  I'm going to do comedy.
*  Yeah, I think so.
*  Because yeah, so it's probably like working in the background.
*  Most likely.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  That I mean, that's what they say sleeping on it is all about.
*  Yeah, like if you're the piano piece, if you can't figure it out, you play it before you
*  go to bed a bunch of times.
*  And then all of a sudden, the next morning you wake up and you're like, fiddle-a-dee.
*  This has been a few times where I woke up in the middle of the night to pee and I realized
*  how to fix a joke.
*  Yeah, it's just like all of a sudden you're like, oh, that's it.
*  That's it.
*  It just needed one more little ingredient.
*  It is a fun eureka moment when you fix a bit.
*  Dude, what is it?
*  Where is it coming from?
*  Like where is it?
*  Where is the joy coming from?
*  No, where's the where's the ideas coming from?
*  Where the fuck are they coming from?
*  I think they do sit.
*  I think there's a part back there that's just constantly going and we don't hear about it.
*  And then when it's done, they're like, get it to the fucking front.
*  Yeah, but even the creation of an idea is so mysterious.
*  I mean, that's why people invoke the concept of the muse.
*  You know, that's the Stephen Pressfield.
*  He like swears by it.
*  The War of Art book is all about the muse, about summoning the muse when you write.
*  There's something weird going on, I'll tell you that, because it seems like they just
*  like enter into your head like a photon, like some shit from space just all of a sudden
*  it's in there and like, oh, that was an idea.
*  And even though it's your idea, like I take credit for writing, like I'll take credit
*  for fixing jokes.
*  I'll take credit for like going up.
*  I always feel like I can't really take credit for the original idea.
*  The original idea is almost like this little gift.
*  Absolutely.
*  You know, like you see something or somebody's doing something and you go, oh shit, and that
*  sparks something and you just, yeah, all right, I got to write this down.
*  Sometimes you just say it out of nowhere.
*  You just say it like you don't even know why you're saying it.
*  You're just saying it.
*  And it's like you didn't even think that much.
*  It just came out.
*  Yeah, there's times where you're on stage where you're just all of a sudden riffing
*  a bit and you hit them with something and they start clapping.
*  You're like, oh, God damn, thank God I'm recording this.
*  Oh, yeah, sometimes.
*  Sometimes that's the best part of the bit.
*  And you're like, what the fuck is going on?
*  Like, how is that the best part of the bit?
*  It feels it's almost like you're playing chess in your head and you are seven steps ahead,
*  but you don't even know it.
*  Right.
*  It's a weird fucking art form, weird art form.
*  It's one of the only art forms where almost everybody writes their own stuff.
*  Like, if you think about musicians, there's a lot of musicians who write their own music
*  and they're kind of revered.
*  Right.
*  Musicians, when you go to see a musician, like a singer, songwriter, and they write
*  their own stuff, and you sit there and you're like, wow, this person crafted this in their
*  mind and practiced it alone.
*  And, you know, there's something like magical about that.
*  But you can go see like a really talented singer that has writers that write for them.
*  And they're great, too.
*  But you don't feel the same, you know?
*  No, because you feel like you're good at playing the guitar.
*  You have a great voice.
*  You're good at making someone else's work.
*  Like, I used to audition for stuff.
*  I am fucking toilet at auditioning.
*  It's the truth.
*  I go in there and it's somebody else's words and I'm just every you can hear the people
*  in front of you.
*  They're getting huge laughs.
*  I go in there and nothing.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't think I'd be a good singer of someone else's song.
*  I think I'd have to write it.
*  I never wanted to be an actor.
*  I had zero acting, no wishes, no dreams, no aspirations, zero.
*  Just wanted to be a comic.
*  And then I got a development deal from doing MTV.
*  And then because of this development deal, I wound up being on a sitcom.
*  So I went.
*  My point is I did two auditions ever.
*  One was for a show called Hardball.
*  I got that show and that show got canceled.
*  And another one was for a show called News Radio.
*  And I got that show.
*  That was the only two that I had ever done.
*  Good for you.
*  It was the nuttiest thing of all time.
*  People would get so mad at me.
*  I'm like, look, I just stepped in shit.
*  I got super lucky.
*  Like they were looking for a cocky baseball player for this show on Fox.
*  And I went in and they met me and they're like, oh, this is the guy.
*  And then I did this show where I played a mentally challenged conspiracy theorist,
*  maintenance guy at a radio station.
*  That was perfect, too.
*  Yeah, I was like, I got these.
*  They always sent me in for these auditions where it was like I was 30 something years old
*  and it would be 22 good looking.
*  And you're like, what the fuck am I doing here?
*  I went in one time and it was like an Abercrombie and Fitch shoot.
*  Oh, God.
*  And so I go in and I'm looking around.
*  Everyone's a foot taller than me.
*  Chiseled jawline.
*  I'm like, there's just agents will throw anything at the wall.
*  I went in and I definitely did a bunch of auditions after those shows that I didn't wind up getting,
*  like for movies and stuff like that.
*  They're so weird.
*  You're in a room with someone and then you have to improvise.
*  Sometimes they ask you to improvise.
*  Like, look, this is neat.
*  One time I went in for the reading and the PA was this kid.
*  It's not the kid's fault.
*  But he's reading the script.
*  He's terrible.
*  And you're supposed to be reacting and he's barely getting the sentence right.
*  And then you're supposed to have this realistic reaction to this.
*  You know?
*  And then they were like, you know, I want you.
*  This is what the guy said.
*  He goes, I want you to get you very excited.
*  Your friend is getting married.
*  You're very excited.
*  I want you to write down a piece of paper, you know, get married.
*  You're trying to talk him into getting married.
*  And I'm go, you see, you want me to do this with this guy?
*  I go, look, if you want to bring in an actor and me and an actor can fuck around.
*  I'll go.
*  I go, he's barely getting through these conversations.
*  This is silly.
*  Then I was like, I don't want to be an actor.
*  I'm like, I've realized, like, why am I even here?
*  I don't want to do this.
*  Let me get the fuck out of here.
*  Nowhere in real life.
*  Yeah.
*  Nowhere in real life would somebody go, I'm thinking about getting married.
*  And your response is, you got to get married.
*  I mean, it's crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  It was a dumb script.
*  The movie was terrible.
*  But a friend of mine was in it.
*  And I was like, yeah, it'll be fun to do a movie with him.
*  But going on the audition, I'm like, what am I doing?
*  It was just one of those movies was just, it was written for fake people.
*  It was written in some weird way for people that don't exist.
*  I was like, you're trying so hard to make people talk and think this way.
*  These aren't real people.
*  This is bizarre.
*  Like, every person in this movie is totally disingenuous.
*  Like, every word that you wrote for them is not like anything people ever say.
*  This movie sucks.
*  It fucking sucks.
*  And it looks like you wrote it on Adderall.
*  And you're just trying to make some money.
*  And why am I here?
*  Yeah.
*  Have you seen the show Suits?
*  I have not.
*  OK.
*  They have this really weird cadence where they'll say,
*  and I'm not going to goddamn do it.
*  They use goddamn in front of stuff.
*  But it's every character.
*  And so you're like, how did all these people meet that use goddamn?
*  Is it from the 20s or something?
*  No.
*  It's current?
*  Yeah.
*  I think it's still on.
*  I think it just had a thing come on.
*  Oh, that's bad writing.
*  Or a bunch of people that are really easily influenced.
*  Yeah.
*  That's where accents come from.
*  Like, one fucking dude probably talked a certain way.
*  And everybody's like, that guy sounds cool.
*  Last two.
*  I was reading that some people have a thing in their head
*  where when they're talking to someone with an accent,
*  to make that person feel more comfortable,
*  they start to speak in the accent without even knowing.
*  Oh, yeah, for sure.
*  Yeah, definitely.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, when I was a kid, I would switch accents
*  like when I moved to new places.
*  I realized I only lived in Boston for like six years.
*  And I was 19.
*  And I was on television for this thing that I did.
*  And I heard myself on TV.
*  And I was like, ew.
*  Ew.
*  I had no idea my accent was so strong.
*  It's like, yuck.
*  A Boston accent?
*  Yeah, it was terrible.
*  Oh, interesting.
*  So I killed it for the most part until I
*  get a couple of drinks in me.
*  Yeah, that's the same with me.
*  You put whiskey in me, and I get a little Canadian.
*  Yeah, especially if I'm around my friends
*  from Boston, where I'll talk shit to each other.
*  Those guys talk shit.
*  Yeah, you fucking quack sack.
*  Yeah.
*  The best place to do stand up.
*  Because to develop there, like, you are,
*  that treadmill is going.
*  You got to hop on.
*  You got to move.
*  Get moving.
*  Everybody's moving.
*  Nobody in the audience has any attention span.
*  They don't want to hear you dilly dally and pontificate
*  up there.
*  They want fucking jokes.
*  Yeah, hammer me.
*  I got to go to work tomorrow.
*  They're all tired.
*  I love doing comedy in Boston.
*  Blue collar.
*  It's a great, it's not even necessarily blue collar.
*  Because there's a lot of white collar people
*  that come to the shows, too.
*  It's just like work ethic.
*  When you have to shovel your car out of snow every fucking year,
*  you have work ethic.
*  You can't get up at 8 o'clock to be at work at 9.
*  You have to get up at 7 because you've got an hour of shoveling
*  to do.
*  Defrost the windshield.
*  Yeah, you got to do all that shit.
*  You got to start the car up, let it run,
*  heat the inside to defrost the windshield,
*  get the fucking scraper.
*  And then you're out there on a fucking skating rink.
*  Your street's a skating rink.
*  So you have to drive five miles an hour.
*  And you have to make sure that you hit the brakes before,
*  way before the car in front of you,
*  or you're going to cause a pileup.
*  I saw so many pileups, man.
*  Yeah.
*  God damn.
*  I grew up in Minnesota.
*  I lived in Minnesota my whole life.
*  So you've seen it.
*  It's just nonstop.
*  I think Minnesota is the number one state where
*  people die in deer accidents.
*  Is that the number one?
*  Getting shot, you mean?
*  No, no, no.
*  Deer on the road.
*  Oh, yeah, I would think that.
*  I would think that.
*  It's either Michigan or Minnesota.
*  I forget which one.
*  But those places, you'd grow up in a place like that, man.
*  You develop some resilience.
*  Those are different human beings.
*  You grow up in fucking Florida.
*  The only thing you have to worry about,
*  the sky becomes an angry god every couple of years.
*  Yeah.
*  I remember I got it.
*  Pennsylvania.
*  Oh, wow.
*  Interesting.
*  Damn.
*  1 in 38 chance of hitting an animal.
*  So you drive for two months, you're
*  going to hit one in West Virginia.
*  West Virginia.
*  Pennsylvania is 1 in 59.
*  That's still high.
*  But 1 in 38 is crazy.
*  1 in 38 means every month you're hit a fucking deer.
*  That is so crazy.
*  That is so crazy.
*  It doesn't mean that.
*  It means overall the time of your life.
*  Holy shit.
*  1 in 38.
*  But that's a lot.
*  I've never hit a deer.
*  It's probably stupid to put out into the universe.
*  Yeah.
*  But I've never hit one.
*  I've never hit one either.
*  I did hit a squirrel once.
*  I felt so bad.
*  Little guy was moving left and juking left and right,
*  not sure.
*  And I'm like, come on, fuck it.
*  I'm going to hit a deer.
*  And I'm like, come on, fucker.
*  Don't do this.
*  Don't do this.
*  And he did it.
*  And I felt the thump.
*  I'm like, oh, no.
*  And I look back and I see his little legs kicking.
*  But you know what?
*  Vultures have to eat too.
*  That's what that's all about.
*  Absolutely.
*  That's a weird thing too when you see a dead animal
*  and you're like, aw.
*  And then you come back like 20 minutes later
*  and you see these monsters hovering over it, devouring.
*  Just gone.
*  They're so gross.
*  Pulling everything out.
*  Oh, have you ever seen a Tibetan sky funeral?
*  Bro.
*  In Tibet, I don't know which religion.
*  I don't know what they're practicing.
*  But they have this ritual called the Tibetan sky funeral.
*  And instead of burying people, what they do
*  is they chop them up and they feed them to vultures.
*  Yeah, and this graphic video of this online.
*  Because this is like this big ritual.
*  So this graphic video of these dudes
*  with these giant cutting boards and fucking cleavers
*  hacking up people.
*  And there's a swarm of vultures all around them.
*  So they're hacking up body parts.
*  And then these vultures are just devouring
*  these human beings.
*  And we think it's gross, right?
*  But isn't it grosser that you waste the body?
*  Dump it, yeah.
*  What is this, Jamie?
*  It's a video of it.
*  Oh, it's a video of it.
*  That guy looked a little too cute to be there.
*  I was like, what are you doing there, fella?
*  I thought it was a movie.
*  So look at these.
*  Look at all these vultures.
*  Jesus, this is like when pelicans follow a fishing boat.
*  Oh, they 100% know what's going on,
*  because they've been doing it all the time.
*  This is a tourist attraction in some part of China.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  Tourist attraction.
*  Oh, there they go.
*  So they're not going to show you hacking the guy up.
*  Forget it.
*  But there's plenty of other videos
*  that are more documentary style that show very graphic images
*  of this person just hacking apart this body.
*  How big?
*  How big do they cut the pieces?
*  Just like chunks.
*  And the vultures, they're all, you saw how they are.
*  They're like piranha.
*  They're all just on it.
*  And they just devour everything.
*  They devour the bones.
*  They devour everything.
*  Isn't that better?
*  Though, I mean, look, nobody wants their loved one
*  to be reduced to meat.
*  But is it better that you're taking your loved one
*  and you're pumping them filled with some toxic chemical
*  that makes it so that they'll never, never rot?
*  You can exhume them years later and find
*  fentanyl traces and shit.
*  If you believe in something else,
*  something's going on afterlife-wise,
*  I mean, the soul's gone anyways.
*  It's the vessel that you're putting in the ground
*  or letting vultures eat.
*  And if you believe that this person was murdered,
*  do a better job now.
*  How much time do you need?
*  Do it and film it and get all your, I guess maybe,
*  remember that HBO show, Autopsy?
*  Did you ever remember that show?
*  There was a great show by this guy, Dr. Michael Baden.
*  And Dr. Michael Baden would always catch husbands
*  that poisoned their wives secretly
*  or wives that had poisoned all their husbands
*  and people that had killed people in secret sneaky ways
*  and gotten away with it.
*  And then he gets on the case and he finds
*  really crazy, crazy examples.
*  One of them was this one guy.
*  And after his wife had died,
*  I don't even know if it was his wife.
*  It was maybe his girlfriend.
*  But he kept buying cases of perfume
*  and no one could figure out why this guy was doing this.
*  But he left his wife in the bed
*  and never reported that she was dead
*  and kept fucking her and put like a mask on her.
*  And then eventually put like some artificial vagina
*  down there and the perfume,
*  he was pouring perfume on her to mask the decay.
*  And so eventually finally they caught him.
*  But they got these images of what used to be his wife
*  with like a mask on the face.
*  And there was clothes on what's left of this body.
*  And then there's this like tube where the vagina is.
*  And this fucking psycho was banging her corpse
*  and like passing out from the smell
*  and just cases of perfume.
*  This dude was just pouring perfume all over her corpse.
*  I feel like I could solve that crime.
*  You have to be in the room.
*  I mean, you have to be like in the neighborhood or something.
*  Have you ever smelled a body?
*  Uh-uh.
*  When I was a kid,
*  the apartment that we lived in in New Jersey,
*  this guy died on one of the floors
*  and the smell is insane.
*  It's so specific.
*  It's so different.
*  A rotting human body apparently has a very unique odor
*  in like the corners and the guys they called in,
*  that like when there's a smell,
*  they know what it is right away.
*  They go, that's a person.
*  This is different than a dog.
*  Yeah.
*  I was gonna say mice die in my garage
*  and I can't go in there for two days.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, it sucks.
*  So a person's gotta be.
*  Oh my God.
*  It was horrible.
*  It's the whole hallway.
*  You couldn't specify like where it was coming from.
*  It was like a skunk.
*  You know, it was everywhere.
*  The whole hallway just reeked this.
*  Like it was just like the universe letting you know,
*  get out of there.
*  Get out of New Jersey, man.
*  It's given you this smell, not just New Jersey,
*  I mean that hallway.
*  Sure.
*  It's given you the smell of death.
*  It's a very specific smell.
*  You know how the guy died?
*  I don't remember.
*  I was a little kid.
*  I think I was five at the time,
*  but I'll never forget that smell.
*  It was like, whoa.
*  Cause he was in there for a while.
*  You know, he was some loner.
*  And he just fucking one day kicked the bucket
*  and took a while for anybody to figure it out
*  and they figured it out because of the smell.
*  And then how long did it take them to get him out of there?
*  I don't remember.
*  I was too little.
*  I don't remember, but it was a very, very specific smell.
*  It was gross.
*  But it is weird what we do.
*  It's weird that Joey Diaz was trying to lay this out to me.
*  He's like, Joe Rogan, that's a fucking scam.
*  This is the scam.
*  Even if you want to get cremated,
*  they got to embalm you first.
*  They got to embalm you first.
*  And you're going to buy a urn.
*  They got you.
*  They got you for 10, 14, 15 grand every time.
*  They're going to tell you your grandfather
*  wants a beautiful coffin.
*  He's fucking dead.
*  What are we doing?
*  It's like this weird thing that everybody does
*  where you have to get your person embalmed
*  and then you get them made up, which is the creepiest.
*  My daughter has a friend who her boyfriend's sister died
*  and she's getting into makeup and hair for a living.
*  And they asked her to do the makeup and hair
*  of the dead sister.
*  Oh my God.
*  Why the fuck would you,
*  like someone has to sign up for that.
*  Yeah, that has to be your very specific job.
*  That's not regular makeup.
*  Yeah, it's not like you go into a great clips or something
*  and ask somebody like, hey, my grandpa died.
*  Can you come help?
*  Bro, I might haunt you for the rest of your life,
*  especially if you know the person.
*  Absolutely.
*  I'd like a Viking funeral.
*  Viking funeral's dope.
*  But a Viking funeral, again,
*  you're kind of wasting the body.
*  If you just put it in the ground,
*  that's what's supposed to happen.
*  You're supposed to go back to nature.
*  I guess a Viking funeral,
*  eventually you get back into the system.
*  You just take it in the long run.
*  You turn back into carbon again.
*  This is going to take so much time.
*  But you're going right into microbes.
*  And essentially what's inside of you starts eating you first,
*  if I'm not mistaken.
*  I think all the bacteria in your body,
*  you start breaking down from that stuff.
*  I think a lot of weird things happen,
*  but then the stuff on the outside figures out you're dead.
*  And then the soil starts devouring you.
*  Going for it.
*  Have you seen the people that get put into trees?
*  Yeah.
*  That's wild.
*  That makes sense.
*  Makes sense.
*  Or like a diamond, they get pressed down.
*  But trees definitely live well off of fertilizer
*  and it comes from dead animals.
*  Yeah, they eat what's there.
*  They take it in, suck it up,
*  which is what fertilizer is,
*  which is why our food sucks,
*  because we give them fake food.
*  We basically feed our processed food processed food.
*  Because nitrogen is what we,
*  we take nitrogen and a bunch of other bullshit chemicals
*  and we pour it on this dead topsoil
*  so that these poor corn can survive.
*  And then we eat the corn and there's like no nourishment.
*  And they're like, what are we doing?
*  Yeah.
*  I remember like in third grade,
*  they taught us about crop rotation.
*  And you're driving by these fields and you're like,
*  this has been fucking corn since I was in third grade.
*  There's no way you can rotate.
*  Yeah.
*  That's what they're all doing in the regenerative farms.
*  In regenerative farms, they move everything around.
*  That's how you're supposed to do it.
*  That's how everyone's done it from the beginning of time.
*  What is that?
*  Mushrooms that eat your body?
*  Suit you where to get buried and you turn into mushrooms.
*  But they're gonna embalm you, man.
*  Unless you live in a place that lets you opt out of that.
*  Unless this is for another country.
*  What are the laws in America?
*  Let's find out what the laws are.
*  When you die, do they have to embalm you?
*  Because this is what Joey was saying.
*  But that might've been very specific.
*  It might be regional, you know?
*  It might be like certain cities.
*  They embalm you before you go into a cooker?
*  Yeah, that's what he was saying.
*  Oh, I didn't know that.
*  It's not required by law.
*  Not required, but they probably talk to you anyway then.
*  That's probably what it is.
*  It says, in fact, the FTC funeral law forbids
*  any funeral home from stating the contrary.
*  Interesting, that's because they've done it.
*  Oh, absolutely.
*  All they're trying to do is shame you, make you feel bad.
*  Listen, you have to embalm them before you cremate them.
*  Your grandfather came in here earlier
*  and told us he wanted to be embalmed.
*  Is it necessary?
*  According to federal law, it's forbidden to declare
*  that embalming can entirely stop the process
*  of decomposition.
*  Oh, but that's different.
*  But that's probably why, I guess, though.
*  Right, it's entirely forbidden to declare that a bomb,
*  but is it mandatory?
*  Is embalming mandatory?
*  I was giving more context.
*  It's not required by federal law in the United States.
*  And no funeral homes can claim that it is.
*  That's interesting.
*  However, there are some circumstances
*  where embalming may be required.
*  State law, okay, some states require embalming
*  if the body's not refrigerated or is held in transit
*  for one to 24 hours.
*  Other states require embalming if the death was caused
*  by a contagious disease or if the remains
*  are being transported between states.
*  So funeral homes require embalming.
*  If the family chooses a service with, okay,
*  that's probably visitation, open casket, that makes sense.
*  Cemeteries may require embalming if the remains
*  are being entombed in a mausoleum.
*  Ew.
*  Yeah, that's a lot.
*  Embalming can help their loved ones
*  see their loved ones for the last time.
*  You know what?
*  I have only been to one funeral where I saw
*  one of my loved ones was my grandfather.
*  And I was like, he is not there.
*  Like, whatever they left there, that is just not,
*  that's not my grandpa.
*  He's gone.
*  Yeah, when they say, oh, he looks so natural.
*  Well, he wasn't fucking orange when I knew him.
*  Fuck no.
*  No, he does not look natural.
*  He looks weird.
*  There's like a part of you that knows
*  that whatever a person is in their soul,
*  whatever a soul is, it's off.
*  Yeah, that's gone.
*  It's off, yeah, it's gone.
*  And it's weird.
*  It's a weird feeling that you get
*  when you're on a dead body.
*  It's like, mm.
*  Especially one that you knew so well.
*  Oh yeah.
*  It's a wake up call, you know,
*  because you just realize like, oh my God,
*  like this comes for everyone.
*  One day, everyone in your life is gonna go like that.
*  And if you're lucky, you're gonna see it.
*  Is that what the luck is?
*  You know, if you live long enough.
*  I was switching phone numbers the other day
*  and I was going over my phone, my contact list,
*  and there's so many people in there that are dead.
*  I kept pulling up people that were dead.
*  I was like, oh, he's gone.
*  Oh, he's gone.
*  It was crazy.
*  How long has it been since you switched last time?
*  Well, it's just, I got a bunch of old numbers,
*  you know, from dudes that I haven't talked to in forever.
*  You know, you just, when you have an iPhone,
*  you just keep getting a new number.
*  And you just, somehow or another,
*  all the numbers come with you.
*  There were so many of my friends that are dead.
*  It's so, so sobering, you know,
*  when you just start counting the numbers.
*  Like, oh, fuck, Norm MacDonald, oh, fuck.
*  You know, and you just go through all of it
*  and you're like, fuck, fuck, he's gone too, you know?
*  Yeah, I'm getting to the age
*  where that's about to start happening, I think.
*  It happens, you know, and sometimes it happens
*  and you do not see it coming and it hits you like a train,
*  especially when they take their own life.
*  You're like, what?
*  Yeah.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  And then there's always that guilt of like, fuck,
*  maybe if I talk to him, maybe if I had one conversation,
*  or maybe that's just your ego.
*  Yeah, because I think once you're over that line,
*  I don't think there's a lot of pulling it back.
*  Perhaps, but I think every circumstance is different.
*  Yeah, I guess there's that one dude
*  that used to live by a bridge,
*  and he would go out and talk guys off the ledge.
*  So, I mean, I guess maybe that is.
*  It was one guy that jumped and he lived.
*  He's one of the rare guys that lived.
*  And he said, as he jumped,
*  he'd realized what a horrible mistake he made
*  and he wanted to take it back, but he couldn't.
*  And he lived, but he was all fucked up,
*  but lived a happier life,
*  like was thankful that he was alive,
*  which is kind of crazy.
*  Yeah, I used to bartend and this dude would come in
*  and he was missing his jaw.
*  He's talking one of the 200 people off the ledge.
*  Yeah, that's amazing.
*  Highway Patrol officer.
*  I bet that guy's a smooth talker.
*  I have a buddy who jumped off that bridge.
*  No shit? Yeah.
*  Tony Anagoni, who's a professional pool player.
*  Good dude.
*  I hadn't talked to him in a while.
*  I hadn't talked to him in a couple of years.
*  And then I saw it in the news.
*  I was like, fuck.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, it's one of those things, man,
*  where it's just like, when it happens,
*  you just get jolted, especially the suicide ones.
*  It's like, what?
*  Yeah, when you had no clue.
*  Cause like you think about that person
*  when you're all having fun together.
*  You think about that person when you're sitting around
*  laughing, cracking jokes.
*  Especially if it's the life of the party that does it.
*  Right. You go, what the fuck?
*  I could have picked 10 other guys besides you.
*  Well, imagine Robin Williams.
*  Imagine watching Robin Williams on any,
*  did you ever see that commercial
*  where he's doing a commercial
*  and he won't stop fucking around?
*  I don't think so.
*  And the director's trying to get him
*  to stop fucking around.
*  He's like, we'll not stop fucking around.
*  I love that.
*  He's doing the different characters and shit.
*  And it's like, okay, Robin, can we focus now?
*  And Robin's just fucking going off.
*  Yeah.
*  That guy you would never imagine could ever be sad.
*  I was an extra in a movie with him,
*  Billy Crystal and Julie's Louise Dreyfuss.
*  And he, two people were sick.
*  They went back to their trailers and I was interviewing him
*  and he did it as Mrs. Doubtfire.
*  And it was fucking awesome, man.
*  Everybody was losing it.
*  Play it, Jamie.
*  Let me see it.
*  I said to him, I said,
*  Frank, cut it.
*  No, no, no, would you mind please?
*  Pardon me.
*  It's already great.
*  Look his back into the camera.
*  Look, he's a different guy now.
*  Robin, just do the lines so we can get out.
*  Out everything.
*  For me, this place is fabulous.
*  I want to do the line for you.
*  The line, the introduction,
*  just the one line that you've got to do, okay?
*  Sure, I will.
*  Yes, sir.
*  Okay.
*  Foul ball, a male hygiene spray.
*  You know, sometimes below the water line, you could reek.
*  That's why I need new foul ball.
*  Something part of everything, I had it upside down.
*  Sorry, this is fabulous.
*  I couldn't believe, probably this can's too cold.
*  Would you do the line now?
*  Just the introduction, one line, okay?
*  Yes.
*  All right.
*  Hello, I'm Sultan Huston.
*  No, I have very few Jewish friends, if any.
*  But I'd like to say,
*  won't you please help support
*  the United Goyim College Fund?
*  Help learn a child to eat hot dogs this year,
*  mayonnaise and corned beef.
*  Can we get another actor in please?
*  How, give me a chance, please, I need this.
*  All I have to do is say.
*  You want to say, I did it in a...
*  Can you just...
*  I can't believe it.
*  You know, even though I'm...
*  You're not gonna do it, I'm gonna cut camera.
*  You gotta do the line now, just, all right?
*  Can we hear it, please?
*  Okay.
*  You're watching how the beat of America.
*  She just went to Moscow.
*  Or should I put it like that?
*  Something you wouldn't tell you,
*  but you're learning it.
*  You know, what I would have loved to have seen actually,
*  is if they could have combined and drop off funeral
*  and the Olympics and had him in the bobsled run.
*  All right, I'm ready, Hogue.
*  All right, can we get it now?
*  Yes, sir, I think we can.
*  You know what the line is?
*  You want me to hold the cue card?
*  No.
*  Yeah, I can, okay.
*  The one that says,
*  and now we're doing commercial, okay?
*  Here we go.
*  Storm, Storm, that's a German name, isn't it?
*  Storm.
*  Sound like a dog.
*  I love that old Storm.
*  Come here, boy.
*  Hey, off the leg.
*  We're ready now, here we go.
*  Okay.
*  That my dad.
*  I'm ready to say that line, Hogue,
*  because I love you.
*  I love you for the man that you are.
*  An incredible man, more than just one night.
*  A man who can, I don't know, make you realize,
*  ouch, who are you?
*  I'm ready now.
*  Okay.
*  Okay, we're ready.
*  Thank you, Mr. Williams.
*  Thank you, Howard.
*  Yes, Howard Storm is now directing commercials.
*  Again, I can get it this time.
*  Yeah, once more.
*  Hi.
*  I'm Jack Nicholson, and you know,
*  Howard Storm is directing goddamn commercials.
*  It's incredible that he can find a camera
*  small enough to work with,
*  but God bless him for trying.
*  His first commercial was Billy Bardi on a footstool.
*  God, I love the fact that the man takes chances.
*  Thank you.
*  And cut.
*  Yeah.
*  He just wasn't gonna do it.
*  He's a maniac.
*  That's incredible.
*  He's an odd dude, for sure.
*  People get mad when you bring up
*  joke-thieving allegations with that guy,
*  but that's just what it was.
*  That went on for over 13 minutes.
*  That's hilarious.
*  Two and a half minutes of it.
*  Yeah, people think that you're not supposed
*  to talk about that part, but that was part of him.
*  Yeah, you have to talk about everything.
*  The guy still was great.
*  He was still great.
*  He was very odd.
*  I wonder if his brain worked so quickly
*  that sometimes it was out before he knew it.
*  Perhaps.
*  You know, you could excuse someone for a lot of things.
*  You don't, I don't know how his brain worked.
*  Obviously, he had like mental problems, which wound up,
*  there was a lot of physical problems
*  that wound up contributing to a suicide,
*  but depression was part of that too.
*  But it's like, you have to also put it in context.
*  There wasn't anybody like him back then.
*  There was Jonathan Winters, who he took inspiration from,
*  who a lot of people forgot about.
*  Jonathan Winters was like really weird like that.
*  He would do really weird, crazy stuff
*  and act like just like different characters
*  and just wouldn't be there and just would hold onto it
*  and people would like panic and they wouldn't know what to do.
*  So I think he took a lot of inspiration
*  from Jonathan Winters, who was an amazing talent too,
*  but Robin was like very unique.
*  It was really nobody like him.
*  And he could act his ass off, man.
*  He was like, good morning Vietnam.
*  Like he was good in movies too.
*  Yeah, I like good new haunting when he's in that.
*  Yeah, man.
*  Yeah, and serious roles.
*  How about that 24 hour photo?
*  Did you ever see that?
*  Yes.
*  Bro.
*  Creepy.
*  Creepy.
*  Yeah, he played a good psycho.
*  It was very, very good.
*  But like, you would never imagine a guy like that
*  would hit the rocks where he'd wound up killing himself.
*  You're like, no way.
*  Then you start to wonder like,
*  was the comedian part of him, the show, and the 24 hour photo
*  was the real deal?
*  I doubt the 24 hour photo was the real deal.
*  I think the real deal was like a deeply depressed person.
*  The reason why they were so good at getting people entertained
*  is because they needed so much more than the average person
*  just to hit like a baseline.
*  I think when people are super depressed
*  and then they use comedy as like a way to just,
*  like a drug to just get them.
*  Like Richard Jenney apparently was only
*  happy when he's killing.
*  And then when he got off stage, he was depressed.
*  And he's another guy that wound up killing himself.
*  That's like an hour a day that you're happy.
*  Yep, and he was like the most miserable guy guaranteed.
*  Like when I would do morning radio,
*  I would always ask the guy, the driver's like,
*  who's the worst guy you have to drive around?
*  And they always would say Richard Jenney.
*  Say he hated it.
*  He didn't want to be there.
*  Didn't want to talk to anybody.
*  He was miserable.
*  He was so fucking funny.
*  Dude is weird.
*  He wanted to be a movie star, apparently.
*  So back then in the 1980s and 90s,
*  like what the thing was, was you would graduate
*  into movies like a Jim Carrey or into TV like a Seinfeld
*  and you have your own show.
*  But everybody really wanted movies.
*  That was the thing.
*  And he never got any of those.
*  He was only in like one movie.
*  He was in The Mask with Jim Carrey.
*  And he had a show on the UPN called Platypus Man.
*  I remember that.
*  It was terrible.
*  But his standup was brilliant.
*  His standup was incredible.
*  He was so good.
*  We all would just be in awe of him.
*  I remember him doing a bit at the Comedy Works in Montreal.
*  This little tiny room in Montreal.
*  This great room run by this amazing guy named Jimbo.
*  Jimbo was the best.
*  And this room was only like a 90 seat room.
*  And it was during the Just For Laughs Comedy Festival.
*  And Richard Jenney went up and he did a bit
*  about buying a Corvette.
*  Like what an unrelatable premise.
*  What a premise where you're like,
*  how do you get anything out of this?
*  And was murdering.
*  Just murdering.
*  I can't remember what he said, but I was crying laughing.
*  We were crying laughing.
*  It was so funny.
*  And there were so many punch lines in there.
*  It was so, his sense of irony, his sense of sarcasm,
*  the way he would hit the punch lines, the writing.
*  It's like all day he prepared for these sets
*  and then he would just go into a darkness
*  and just get ready to do it again.
*  God, that's brutal.
*  Horrible.
*  I knew his girlfriend.
*  His girlfriend was a comic too.
*  One of his girlfriends at the time.
*  I don't think she was the girl that was his girlfriend
*  at the time that he killed himself.
*  But she was a comic at the store
*  and she would just tell me, it's just like,
*  the guy's so brilliant, but he's like so eaten up.
*  Yeah, some people can't find balance.
*  Sucks man, when they're that good,
*  you just like wanna hug them.
*  Just like, come on man, keep it together dude.
*  I just wanna go, just enjoy the rest of it.
*  I've told this story before,
*  so I apologize to anybody that's heard it.
*  But he went to the Eastside Comedy Club in,
*  it wasn't Huntington Beach, it was on Long Island.
*  East Huntington, I forget where it was.
*  But Eastside Comedy Club was a great comedy club
*  on Long Island.
*  And I went there on a Sunday and I talked to the guy
*  that was the MC all weekend and he was depressed.
*  And I said, why are you depressed?
*  He goes, Richard Jennings did a different hour every show.
*  He did four different hours and killed.
*  He goes, I'm up there.
*  He goes, I have 20 minutes that I'm opening with
*  and I can barely get through them.
*  And they suck.
*  And then I'm bringing on this genius
*  who does a different hour every fucking show.
*  And he goes, it makes you wanna quit comedy.
*  I think he might have quit comedy.
*  Cause I never heard from him.
*  I really think that might've done him in.
*  Like I think he was around for like a year or two
*  after that, but I think that was it.
*  That is tough to watch though.
*  When you're working with a master
*  and you're not even close to it yet.
*  It's like those dudes who fought Mike Tyson
*  in the early days.
*  Like you never saw them again.
*  Yeah.
*  I've been late for a show twice in my life
*  and both times it was from watching
*  Mike Tyson's greatest hits.
*  Oh wow.
*  They will drive you crazy.
*  There was a time like in like 1986
*  to like whatever it was when he lost to Buster Douglas.
*  When there's never been a heavyweight like him.
*  I think he was the greatest of all time.
*  I think he was the greatest of all time
*  for a short period of time.
*  But I think you have to look at a fighter in particular.
*  They can't keep it up forever.
*  It's too crazy.
*  They only have a few years in this like high revolution,
*  high rev, red line prime.
*  And that's what I try to judge them on.
*  People judge fighters on longevity.
*  Like Sugar Ray Robinson or the best example of all time
*  is Bernard Hopkins.
*  Bernard Hopkins was a world champion
*  when he was 49 years old.
*  Crazy.
*  Crazy.
*  That's my age.
*  Crazy, crazy.
*  And fucking up guys that were 20 years younger than him
*  with ease, you know?
*  That's wild.
*  I mean he was a master.
*  Just a masterful boxer who had incredible discipline
*  and never lost focus.
*  And never got out of shape.
*  And never ate bad food.
*  Never processed anything.
*  He always ate like clean organic food, drank water,
*  no booze, fuck you.
*  You know, up in the morning, always running,
*  always calisthenics, always was shredded,
*  never gained weight in between fights.
*  Even today.
*  I had him on the podcast today, like a couple months ago.
*  How many months ago?
*  Six months ago?
*  Maybe a little longer.
*  Something like that.
*  Even now.
*  Guys like in his 50s, fucking shredded.
*  Ready to go.
*  You don't have to.
*  You're a comedian.
*  I need the processed food sometimes.
*  Sometimes you need a little comfort, you know?
*  What do you think it was about Tyson?
*  Do you think it was his,
*  I always equated it to his legs and his coil.
*  There was a lot of factors.
*  A lot of factors.
*  First of all, there was his upbringing, right?
*  So he had a horrible, horrible upbringing.
*  Okay.
*  Just crime and violence
*  in the worst neighborhood in Brooklyn.
*  He lived in Bed-Stuy, right?
*  So Brownsville, I think, originally, in Bed-Stuy.
*  Terrible neighborhoods.
*  Real bad.
*  You know, a lot of crime, a lot of violence.
*  And then at 13 years of age,
*  he gets adopted by this guy, Custa Mato,
*  who's one of the greatest boxing minds of all time.
*  And he's also a hypnotist.
*  So from age 13 on, he's hypnotizing Mike
*  and telling Mike he's the greatest of all time.
*  He's the greatest of all time.
*  He's gonna be the greatest heavyweight
*  the world has ever seen.
*  And then on top of it, you have crazy genetics.
*  Mike, I had Teddy Atluson.
*  He told me that when Mike was 13,
*  he was knocking out grown men.
*  And they wouldn't believe he was 13.
*  He'd bring them to boxing tournaments.
*  They're like, how old's that kid?
*  He goes, 13.
*  He goes, he's fucking 16.
*  He goes, okay, he's 16.
*  He put him in with the 16-year-olds.
*  He'd knock the 16-year-olds out.
*  Yeah, he was a freak.
*  So you have that sometimes.
*  You know, you have kids that just have extraordinary genes.
*  And then you have this perfect storm
*  of a very intelligent person
*  who was deeply neglected as a child
*  and then adopted by a genius.
*  Not just a boxing genius,
*  but a genius in terms of psychology and life and philosophy.
*  And he understood war.
*  And he was a war historian.
*  And he was a boxing historian.
*  And he was also managed by this guy, Jim Jacobs.
*  Or Jim Jacobs, rather, excuse me.
*  And Jim Jacobs had Jim Jeffries tapes.
*  Or James Jeffries.
*  He had like Jack Johnson and Jack Dempsey.
*  He had all the film footage of like fighters
*  that are some of the greatest boxers of all time.
*  Willie Pepp, Floyd Patterson.
*  He had all this old footage on Reels.
*  And he was like the biggest collector of old boxing footage.
*  And Mike was being managed by him.
*  So Mike would sit there all day and watch Jack Dempsey fight,
*  watch Jack Johnson fight,
*  watch Stanley Greb, watch these old, old killers.
*  You know, these guys that existed decades ago
*  and no one gets a chance to see them.
*  Because we're talking about 1980.
*  You don't even have VHS tapes, right?
*  When did they come along?
*  They were like 82 or something like that, right?
*  So he's getting like,
*  this is happening to him in the 70s, like late 70s.
*  Like, let's make sense of this.
*  So he's 58, he's a year older than me.
*  So how old was he when he was 13?
*  What year was it when he was 13 rather?
*  So he was born in 60s.
*  Born in 66, I've been 79.
*  79, okay, no VHS.
*  So the only way you can see these things
*  is that they put them on television, which they might,
*  but then you have to watch it while it's on TV.
*  You can't rewatch it again.
*  There's no way to record anything.
*  Or you know, Jim Jacobs.
*  You know Jim Jacobs.
*  Jim Jacobs who also did the commentary in a lot of those.
*  If you watch a lot of those old films,
*  they're black and white and there's no sound.
*  And they like put in sound later.
*  And Jim Jacobs does the commentary.
*  I know his voice.
*  And he was a genius too.
*  And they had this incredible convergence
*  of all these things that created Mike Tyson in like 1986
*  when people were like, holy shit.
*  When he would walk out there with no bathrobe
*  and just fucking.
*  He was a perfect creation of the universe.
*  Like the universe, all the factors that would come
*  into play that make something super special
*  all came in in his, to be a boxing champion.
*  It could not have had a better convergence
*  of mind, talent, background,
*  and then the people that were influencing him.
*  Yeah, he was wild.
*  Yeah, he's being trained by Teddy Atlas
*  when he's a little kid.
*  Isn't it illegal to hypnotize a child?
*  That's a good question.
*  I would think there's gotta be something.
*  That's a good question.
*  Depends on like one of your kid thinks they're possessed.
*  That might be a good thing to hypnotize him.
*  You think kid is like,
*  would you like, yeah, this you Chad.
*  I have words for you.
*  Like, oh, Billy, what the fuck is wrong with you, man?
*  I'm sorry I left you alone.
*  I had to work.
*  I had two jobs.
*  I had to pay the bills.
*  Billy's bouncing off the walls at home
*  and he thinks he's possessed.
*  You're like, watch the spoon.
*  Yeah, it might be good to hypnotize that kid.
*  But yeah, I would think hypnotizing anybody
*  before they were aware of what the fuck that means.
*  But I don't think hypnotizing
*  is what people think it is either.
*  I don't necessarily, I've only been hypnotized once.
*  So I can't speak to like what the total potential
*  of what someone can do with hypnosis is.
*  But you're aware of what's going on.
*  It's not like you're gonna like take your clothes off
*  and blow this guy.
*  Like it doesn't make any sense.
*  Like you're just in a different state of consciousness.
*  And it's almost like you're allowed to look at things
*  for what they really are versus all this noise
*  that's around most of the ideas in your head
*  where you're blaming other people
*  when you should probably blame yourself,
*  when you were lazy and that's why it went bad
*  and it wasn't like someone else's fault
*  and all that stuff that keeps people on the wrong track,
*  that keeps people drinking too much and gambling too much,
*  all those weird things that are going on in your head,
*  you'll get past that and you'll see you.
*  And you see you for a brief amount of time
*  and you kind of analyze what it is that's fucking with you.
*  And then someone who's like a good performance psychologist
*  can implant ideas, like help you implant ideas
*  in your mind of how you're gonna approach things
*  from now on, how you're gonna look at things from now on.
*  I know a lot of fighters use them.
*  A lot of fighters use hypnotists and performance coaches.
*  The guy who did it to me is my friend Vinny Shortman
*  and he does it to a lot of fighters.
*  He hypnotized a lot of fighters.
*  And what does he put in there then?
*  I think it depends.
*  I think it's different for each fighter.
*  What they need. Yeah.
*  What they're missing.
*  I mean, some fighters, there's a thing that happens
*  with some fighters in the midst of a chaotic fight,
*  they will forget about the game plan
*  and they will just go on instinct and start throwing down
*  and they wind up getting knocked out or something goes bad.
*  They panic.
*  And I wanna say panic, but they don't think straight.
*  That's the best way to say it.
*  Cause they're still fighting, it's chaos.
*  But you're letting that lizard brain take over
*  and you're not sticking to the game plan.
*  The really good fighters know how,
*  even in these chaotic scrambles to keep things technical.
*  Don't do anything that's gonna get you caught.
*  There's various, it looks nutty
*  when you're watching it on television,
*  but if you're watching a tactician like a Max Holloway
*  or Sanhagen or Sean O'Malley,
*  like these fighters are very tactical.
*  Everything they're doing is to elicit a reaction from you
*  and then they have counters based on how you do things.
*  And then they start downloading how you're moving
*  and reacting to things.
*  And then they'll start plotting and moving.
*  Anderson Silva was the very best at that.
*  He would take the first round
*  and he would just be kind of like moving with you
*  and moving with you.
*  And then towards the end of the round,
*  he started fucking you up.
*  But for the first, he was just downloading
*  Anderson in his prime.
*  I had never seen anything like him.
*  In his prime, he was just downloading people's movements.
*  And do you think those other fighters
*  could see it in his eyes and they're like,
*  oh fuck, now he knows.
*  Yeah, when he was at the top for sure,
*  everyone was terrified of him.
*  The one thing that they did find out though,
*  he had a flaw.
*  And the flaw was if you didn't attack him,
*  he didn't attack you.
*  Like he wasn't willing to take stupid chances,
*  especially with like big punchers.
*  Like there's this guy Patrick Cote
*  and Patrick Cote was a big puncher,
*  like one punch KO guy.
*  And they had the worst fight.
*  It was a boring ass fight.
*  And then Patrick unfortunately threw a kick
*  and blew out his knee.
*  It was like the worst ending of a fight ever.
*  Just his knee exploded.
*  Just not getting hit, just kind of twisted?
*  Yeah, not getting hit at all.
*  He just went to throw a kick
*  and his knee was in a weird position
*  and it just blew apart.
*  And he's like, God, falls down.
*  That's happened before.
*  It happened to Tom Aspinall recently, threw a kick,
*  knee fell apart.
*  Didn't even happen.
*  It wasn't happening like where someone did something to him.
*  He just threw a kick and his knee fell apart.
*  I'd rather watch a guy get knocked unconscious
*  than have that huge response
*  to a part of their body blowing up.
*  The knee's a bad one, but the worst is the shin break.
*  That's the very, very worst.
*  Or an arm break, a forearm break or a shin break.
*  Those are very hard to watch.
*  Those are the hardest I've ever,
*  I've seen four leg breaks in person
*  and they're fucking horrific, man.
*  They are fucking horrific.
*  They hurt your soul.
*  Oh, you got one?
*  Oh, that's Patrick right there.
*  So watch how he does this.
*  Look, it's so crazy.
*  They're moving around and he goes like he's gonna throw a kick
*  and he just fucking moved weird.
*  That's it. Out of nowhere.
*  Out of nowhere.
*  His knee just exploded, blew out his ACL,
*  torus meniscus, crazy.
*  And that's a tough dude.
*  So for him to have that reaction, come on.
*  He was an animal.
*  Patrick Cote was a fucking animal.
*  But the fight was kind of boring
*  because he was so dangerous.
*  So Anderson couldn't lead, right?
*  Because if you lead, you worry about being countered.
*  So Anderson was not just really fucking good
*  but also really smart.
*  He just knew when he could hit you
*  and he knew when you could hit him
*  and he would take his time.
*  But again, once he got you figured out,
*  as the fight went on, he would,
*  like if he made the fight boring, it was also a strategy.
*  Because then you would be anxious
*  and you would maybe do something to try to pick up the pace
*  and he would crack you.
*  So he's an old veteran.
*  So he's just standing around going,
*  I don't give a fuck about booze.
*  Let's just move around here.
*  He did that with another guy, a Brazilian guy,
*  in Thales Laetius, kind of the same thing.
*  Boring ass fight but a dangerous fighter
*  and a really dangerous guy on the ground.
*  Thales Laetius was a nasty jujitsu black belt.
*  And so he was like, we ain't going on the ground.
*  Like I was fucking staying on the outside,
*  just kind of barely win every round.
*  But if you do something stupid, I'll fuck you up.
*  Nobody did anything stupid.
*  That's wild to know all that shit.
*  Well, he was just so smart
*  that he didn't care if people were booing.
*  And then the UFC would get mad at him.
*  They'd get mad at him because those performances,
*  even though he's the greatest of all time,
*  at the time he was for sure, in my eyes,
*  he's still in the conversation.
*  During his time period when he was running shit,
*  still in my book, if not the greatest,
*  one of the greatest of all time, for sure.
*  He's in the conversation, whatever that.
*  The conversation's so subjective
*  and I change my opinion on it all the time.
*  But during that time period,
*  he didn't give a fuck if people were booing.
*  He didn't care.
*  It's like, and so the UFC would get mad at him.
*  But I was always of the mind
*  that he's doing the 100% correct thing.
*  He's the best fighter.
*  And to fight the best, you gotta know when to attack
*  and when not to attack.
*  And sometimes you don't attack at all.
*  Sometimes if he does something out of character
*  and forces it, that was not his style.
*  So for him to engage in a style that's not his style,
*  then that's stupid.
*  The smart thing is to fight to the best of your abilities.
*  And unfortunately, some of those fights were not fun.
*  But you also get the Vitor Belfort fight from the same guy.
*  You get the Okami fight.
*  You get the Forrest Griffin fight.
*  You get all those insane knockouts,
*  those highlight reel knockouts.
*  He was a monster, man.
*  In his prime, he was a monster.
*  But if you can take the booze and the other guy can't.
*  Yeah, well, it was also like he wasn't gonna do anything
*  stupid until he did.
*  And then he did and he got knocked out by Chris Wideman
*  because he was doing something stupid.
*  That's literally what his demise was,
*  was a thing that kept him so invincible his whole career.
*  He would stay composed no matter what happened.
*  He just stayed composed.
*  He always knew when to attack, when not to attack,
*  when to attack, when not to attack.
*  He was just a genius.
*  There's guys that like for a while,
*  whatever those years are, where you can't beat them.
*  No one's gonna beat him for these years.
*  And that's just because of his strategy watching you move.
*  Wow, he was also so good at being the champion.
*  There's a thing about performing in front of so many people
*  with such high stakes.
*  And if you've never experienced that before,
*  the first time you ever fight for a championship fight,
*  it's so crazy.
*  You see it in guys' faces sometimes.
*  You see the weight of it on them.
*  They're like, fuck, this is so heavy.
*  There's so much anxiety.
*  You just can't wait to get in there and get it.
*  And once it gets going, then you're fine.
*  Then you're just going on instincts.
*  Then you're going on training.
*  And then you're just, you're fighting.
*  But it's the buildup and the thinking
*  and the anticipation and the anxiety.
*  He's used to that.
*  He's done that 13 times.
*  He defended the middleweight title,
*  I believe, more than anyone ever.
*  Is that true?
*  I believe he did.
*  That's why Gene Hackman measured the hoop in Hoosiers.
*  Let him know, like, you've been here.
*  This is it.
*  It's 10 feet.
*  Yeah, it's the same thing everywhere.
*  Yeah.
*  But the thing is, it's like that anxiety
*  of performing in the moment.
*  And that's what a sports psychologist does.
*  That's where a sports psychiatrist comes in.
*  That's where a sports hypnotist, rather, comes in.
*  Psychiatrist, too, but they give you drugs.
*  You can't take those when you're fighting.
*  Some guys have tried.
*  I knew a guy who got kicked off a card
*  because he was on Adderall.
*  And they were like, you can't take Adderall in fights.
*  I need it for my ADD.
*  Like, fuck, shut up.
*  Shut up, bro, you're on speed.
*  It's tough, though, man.
*  Sports can mess you up.
*  Oh, 100%.
*  Like, I come home from golf for the last three years,
*  miserable, right?
*  Calling myself a dumb fuck.
*  Calling myself a piece of shit loser.
*  And then my girlfriend goes, hey, why don't you just,
*  just pretend you're talking to eight-year-old you.
*  And I tried that shit for a round.
*  I had the greatest round of my life.
*  Yeah, you could do it.
*  You just have to, that part of being a man in particular,
*  like, fucking idiot.
*  You know, like, you make a mistake.
*  You gotta avoid that.
*  Does you zero good.
*  There's a gym teacher with real short shorts in my head.
*  That is the voice in my head, dude.
*  Just like, you fucking idiot.
*  I'm guilty of that sometimes when I play pool.
*  I'll talk shit to myself.
*  This is great.
*  Charles Barkley's one of us.
*  What does he do, what does he do?
*  God damn it, you fat fuck.
*  Did you hear how fast that was?
*  I mean, he almost not even hit the ball before he said it.
*  That's amazing.
*  Oh my God, that's hilarious.
*  And then the girl's taking the video laugh at the end.
*  That's so good.
*  That's hilarious.
*  Yeah, that does not help you.
*  But also, there's a thing about a guy like Charles Barkley,
*  or a guy like you, it's like, you don't really have the time
*  to dedicate to a thing like golf to really get great at it.
*  It's the same thing as playing pool.
*  The great pool players, they play eight hours a day.
*  Eight hours a day.
*  If you wanna play like a Shane Van Boney level,
*  you wanna play like a Fedor Gorst level,
*  you have to play eight hours a day.
*  They play eight hours a day.
*  They don't fuck around.
*  They're so in the groove all the time
*  that if you're like a casual player,
*  you just can't find that groove.
*  And they don't wanna ever let that groove go.
*  They're in that groove all day long.
*  All day long.
*  They wake up in the morning
*  and they start thinking about running balls.
*  They start thinking about putting English on balls.
*  Like if you wanna play golf like a really great golfer,
*  those fucking guys play every day.
*  They have coaches.
*  There's just no way.
*  They analyze footage.
*  Like look at Tiger Woods.
*  Tiger Woods started playing when he was how old?
*  Three maybe?
*  Two?
*  Arguably, I don't know.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, and was coached by his father
*  from the time he was a child, played constantly.
*  I mean, you can get in the groove for a little bit.
*  Yeah.
*  And that's what keeps you going back.
*  But you're not gonna stay in the groove.
*  You're not gonna stay in the groove.
*  No.
*  To me, it's maddening for me with pool.
*  Cause I can play pool, like if I have a night off
*  and I can play for like five, six hours,
*  like around four hours in,
*  I start really getting the groove.
*  I start feeling it.
*  But it's like inconsistent.
*  It comes and goes.
*  But if you play with a great player
*  and you watch them do it,
*  they just never get out of the groove.
*  They're always there.
*  They very rarely miss.
*  They very rarely misposition.
*  Their cue ball's perfect.
*  It's always moving exactly where they want it to go.
*  And if it's not, they play safe.
*  And you watch it and you're just like, what?
*  It's like, this is a feel of the movement of the balls
*  that's only possible if you're so finely tuned to it
*  that you're playing every day.
*  Like this guy, Fedor, he just won the world championships.
*  He's a friend of mine.
*  He's been on the podcast before.
*  We were having a conversation on the phone about cues
*  cause he had switched.
*  He was with this company, Q-Tech,
*  and then he switched to this company, White Carbon.
*  And it was months ago.
*  And I was saying, we were talking about
*  different approaches he uses and different equipment.
*  He's like, I'm still adjusting to this cue.
*  I go, really?
*  I go, have you had it for like, how long now?
*  He's like, four months.
*  He goes, I'm pretty much there.
*  He goes, but I'm about three or 4% off.
*  Three or 4% off.
*  Three or 4% off.
*  Like this guy's a fucking robot.
*  Like his understanding of where he should be
*  versus where he is, and he wants to know
*  exactly how much pressure to apply on that cue
*  to make that ball dance exactly the way.
*  He's like, it's a little off.
*  It's a little, like he knows it's a little off.
*  I did it just right, but it went there instead of there.
*  Hmm, 3%.
*  Yeah.
*  What the fuck, man?
*  You ever left the stage and just screamed
*  100 fucking percent into the green room?
*  I'm off 100%.
*  Every now and then you catch a groove
*  when you are in 100%.
*  And those moments are the weirdest.
*  You're like, why can't I do this all the time?
*  Why can't I just have so much fun
*  with the jokes all the time?
*  Sometimes you're having so much fun saying the material
*  that makes everything so much better.
*  And you're like, why don't I do this all the time?
*  And it just feels like every single thing you say
*  is gonna be awesome.
*  And the more you do it, the more you're there.
*  So if you have a Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,
*  like if you're doing a real week in a place,
*  by the time Saturday rolls around, you're a wizard.
*  You're a wizard.
*  You got those bits tied up in a fucking basement.
*  You're in control of the situation.
*  Just thinking about what you're gonna eat
*  after the show and still killing.
*  You're in the flow.
*  You're in that flow state.
*  And that's when you come up with new stuff.
*  That's the best way to come up with new stuff.
*  Because you just feel funny.
*  You feel where the funny is.
*  It's like, I know that vibe.
*  I caught that vibe.
*  I know where that vibe is.
*  I can ride that vibe.
*  And that's those golf guys.
*  So if you're not doing that every day,
*  you're gonna get out there and fucking, fucking loser.
*  Fucking idiot.
*  You fat fuck.
*  You talk to yourself just like Charles Franklin.
*  It's unavoidable.
*  Yeah.
*  Do you ever play snooker?
*  I know.
*  I have not played it.
*  I've seen people play it.
*  I've fucked around on a snooker table.
*  I've never played a game of snooker,
*  but it's very difficult.
*  That's hard.
*  A lot of snooker players are super successful in pool.
*  No pool players.
*  Maybe Alex Pagulion, he can play everything.
*  He's like a world champion in every discipline.
*  He's a world champion in eight ball, nine ball,
*  10 ball, back.
*  He's one of the greats of all times.
*  One of the Filipinos too, which for whatever reason,
*  Filipinos are the best pool players on earth.
*  There's more, there's guys driving taxi cabs in Filipino,
*  in the Philippines rather,
*  that can win pool tournaments in America.
*  They come over here.
*  Like every, you can't even, everywhere you go
*  is pool tables.
*  Like it's like one of the most popular games
*  in the entire, in the whole island chain.
*  It's huge over there.
*  But that guy's a world,
*  he's like an elite professional snooker player
*  as well as an elite professional pool player.
*  But he's super rare.
*  He's like John Moore.
*  There's a couple other guys that can play
*  like really good snooker.
*  We came up playing snooker, Northern Minnesota.
*  That's a tough game.
*  Yeah, you'd go in and these guys are just like,
*  they take it so fucking seriously.
*  If you lose them a dollar, I mean, these were old, old men.
*  And if you lose them a dollar, forget it, you're out.
*  I remember one of the, they always used to say,
*  so a two ball was worth money.
*  So you'd have to make a cherry, it's called,
*  a red ball first, and then you had to make a number ball.
*  And then he would always go, if he'd missed the two ball,
*  he'd go, they never do.
*  Or he'd go, yeah, you bet, if he'd made it.
*  And so we went to this guy's funeral
*  and we had a buddy with me and he had a flask with him.
*  And they were talking and he stands up and raises the flask
*  and he goes, they never do.
*  And then all his old buddies had flasks with them
*  and they raise and go, yeah, you bet.
*  It was the fucking greatest funeral I've ever been to.
*  That's awesome.
*  Well, I bet Snooker pool, Snooker halls,
*  what would he call them?
*  What do they call Snooker halls?
*  Where people play Snooker?
*  We just played at the spot, I don't know.
*  It was like a little restaurant that had tables in back.
*  Oh, okay.
*  And they were all Snooker tables?
*  We had two pool tables and then two Snooker tables.
*  Oh, okay.
*  Cause like places where they just play Snooker,
*  do they call them a Snooker hall?
*  Is that what they're called?
*  Yeah.
*  Snooker club.
*  The term pool actually comes from gambling.
*  Pool is not the game.
*  The game is pocket billiards.
*  Pool is what's called, they pool their money together
*  and gamble.
*  Oh.
*  That's the name that's attributed to it.
*  Yeah, it was really a gambling game, 100%.
*  But Snooker players come over to America,
*  Snooker players come over to America
*  and rob people in pool.
*  They play really good.
*  Cause they're used to those little holes.
*  And also these big ass holes.
*  It's just getting used to the ball moving different.
*  Cause their balls are so small,
*  they don't put a lot of side English on them
*  and they don't do like weird stuff with them.
*  American cue balls are larger.
*  So the billiard balls are larger.
*  So they do a lot of shit with them.
*  They throw balls into the side pocket with English
*  and do weird things.
*  So they have to learn all that stuff
*  and then they learn how to break hard.
*  Once they do that, their technique is so flawless.
*  Yeah, it's spot on cause they're going just straight shots.
*  And they have academies that teach people how to play.
*  There's not like a lot of like,
*  there's a few really good teachers in this country,
*  but there's no like national system
*  where you have like a university
*  that you go to learn how to play snooker.
*  Like, you know, they have that.
*  They have like real, like there's,
*  at one point in time, there was real money in snooker
*  in the UK, like real money.
*  Like those guys were millionaires.
*  What?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  The guys I was playing with were not millionaires.
*  Well, you were playing with the guys in Canada
*  or Michigan, right?
*  Minnesota.
*  Minnesota.
*  All that cold stuff's the same to me.
*  But in the UK, yeah, there was,
*  snooker was huge on television.
*  I remember going over there for a gig long time ago
*  and turn on the TV and like, whoa,
*  they got snooker on like regular TV.
*  This is nuts.
*  Oh wow.
*  Yeah, watching these matches.
*  Cause you, you know, you're stuck in a hotel room
*  before your show.
*  Yeah.
*  So you're just watching, what do you guys watch?
*  And they're all watching snooker.
*  But for whatever reason, I think it died off.
*  I don't think it's that popular anymore.
*  I don't think you could find a snooker table
*  in the town I grew up in anymore.
*  Hmm.
*  Yeah.
*  Places close, they get rid of them
*  cause all the old guys that played died off.
*  Well, the real died, the game that really died off
*  was three cushion billiards.
*  Three cushion billiards was the real game back in the day.
*  What's that?
*  It's a game with no pockets.
*  And the game, it was also a very big gambling game
*  where people would gamble a lot of money.
*  Like gentlemen would gamble a lot of money
*  playing three cushion.
*  And three cushion, you can't find that anywhere anymore.
*  It's still in some countries.
*  I think Korea has a big three cushion scene.
*  And Belgium, this guy from Belgium
*  that does really well three cushion,
*  some European countries still use it.
*  Is that the one that has like the score up on a wire
*  above the table where you move it with your cue?
*  They do that with pool too.
*  Okay.
*  That's just a score line.
*  But what three cushion billiards is,
*  is this giant ass table that has no pockets
*  and you have three balls.
*  And it's usually two white balls and a red ball
*  or two red balls and a white ball.
*  And see, right here they do yellow sometimes too now.
*  So this guy has to hit a ball
*  and then it has to go three cushions
*  and then hit the second ball.
*  So it's all about understanding angles.
*  See if you can find a video of someone doing it.
*  It's fucking boring.
*  See, this is the game.
*  So he's got to hit a ball
*  and then it's got to go three cushions and hit another ball.
*  But what it really does is if you learn this game,
*  it teaches you how billiard balls move around a table.
*  So it really helps you play better position
*  for pocket billiards and it helps you learn
*  how to play safe better and how to kick at balls better.
*  So like this guy is-
*  That's pretty wild that he's hitting that ball though.
*  This guy's obviously a wizard.
*  This is really hard to do.
*  So it is really a thinking person's game.
*  The problem that I have with it is
*  I want to see balls go away.
*  I don't want to see him sticking around.
*  If I make a point, I want you to go bye bye.
*  I don't want to see you.
*  My, the fun with me is that guy,
*  Bloomedall is one of the greatest of all time,
*  world champion.
*  I don't know, I think I said his name wrong.
*  But, cause I only watched like a few matches ever.
*  I can't, I'm ADD to the max.
*  I watch like 10 minutes.
*  I'm like, where, why is the ball still there?
*  This game sucks.
*  Yeah, the elimination process is the best part of pool,
*  I think. Exactly.
*  I like watching someone run out
*  and then making a ball is so, like the last ball,
*  like if it's a hard shot, like, oh my God,
*  is he gonna make it?
*  Is he gonna make it?
*  You know, there's a lot, and then when it goes away,
*  like yay, it's satisfying.
*  I don't want to see it bounce around and stick around.
*  But I've seen people play snooker at a very high level
*  and it's wild to watch.
*  You know, you watch someone just run out and snooker
*  and you're just like, Jesus Christ,
*  like you have to be so precise.
*  The table's huge.
*  Yeah, tiny pockets, little balls.
*  Yeah, it's crazy.
*  It's a super difficult game.
*  But that's, you know, for whatever reason,
*  that never caught on over here.
*  It's like soccer.
*  For whatever reason, never caught on over here.
*  Just in pockets, yeah.
*  Yeah, I don't know why, like some things never caught,
*  I have a friend of mine, my friend Eddie,
*  owns the local soccer professional team out here.
*  And he gave me some insight on that.
*  He goes, they never take a break.
*  He's like football, baseball, you get commercial breaks.
*  So commercials get stuffed in.
*  Soccer never stops.
*  It's like they play on the clock
*  and the clock keeps going
*  and every match is gonna be X amount of minutes long
*  and that's that.
*  There's no room for commercials.
*  I was like, oh, well that makes sense.
*  Because if you go watch professional soccer live,
*  it's fucking exciting as shit.
*  Yeah, everybody's freaking out.
*  And you appreciate the athleticism that you have to have,
*  the cardio that you have to have
*  to be running back and forth and back and forth
*  and sprinting and sideways and ducking and dodging
*  and fucking kicking balls at crazy angles.
*  It's a wild ass sport.
*  Yeah, they're very good.
*  I mean, you look at those guys and you go,
*  well, there's not a 10% body fat person on this field.
*  Not one, no excess fat.
*  They all have fairly small upper bodies
*  and just jacked legs.
*  And these guys are sprinting constantly.
*  They have no wasted motion.
*  At the elite levels, like the Lionel Messi level,
*  there's no wasted motion.
*  Those guys are just freak athletes.
*  My kids both played soccer junior and senior year
*  and it was great because I don't know anything about it
*  and it's the only sport I wouldn't yell at.
*  Ah!
*  Because I didn't want people to go,
*  that's fucking wrong, dude.
*  Ah!
*  So I just sit there and keep my mouth shut.
*  Bro, some parents are brutal.
*  Oh, it's so tough.
*  I watched a guy after a hockey game.
*  This kid just, I mean, he scored probably,
*  I don't know, six goals or something.
*  This little tiny kid, this is 14U.
*  And this dad, he's yelling at this kid.
*  I'm walking out and he's right by the locker room
*  and I go, hey man, I pulled the guy aside
*  and I go, come on, kid, what's going on here?
*  I thought he was a dad.
*  It wasn't the dad.
*  It was the goalie's dad yelling at the kid
*  that scored on him, calling him a fucking fancy pants
*  and all this other shit.
*  And I was like, bro, he's a kid, what are you doing?
*  Oh no.
*  Yeah, but parents go way too over the top.
*  Oh no.
*  Ugh.
*  Like yelling at an ump is one thing,
*  but yelling at a kid because he scored on your kid,
*  that's ridiculous.
*  Ugh.
*  Ugh.
*  Yeah, I've seen guys get knocked out
*  in front of their screaming moms.
*  Their moms are screaming, kick his ass, kick his ass.
*  This guy fucking sucks, this guy's a pussy.
*  Whack.
*  Lights out?
*  Yeah, in front of their mom.
*  While their mom's screaming obscenities.
*  Go to sleep.
*  Hard to swallow.
*  Hard to swallow.
*  Mom, you probably distracted the fuck out of your son,
*  first of all.
*  Imagine hearing your mom screaming all that shit,
*  when you're like, shut the fuck up.
*  Shut the fuck up.
*  I didn't like my mom yelling, you got him honey,
*  when I was pitching.
*  Oh God.
*  That kind of shit, where you're like, I am working on it.
*  Don't do this lady.
*  I know this is not for you, this is for me.
*  Okay, you're supposed to clap when things go well.
*  Yeah.
*  And that's it.
*  Don't be fucking yelling out instructions.
*  You got him honey.
*  Like you weren't, you didn't think you had him
*  until your mom yelled it out.
*  Like oh, I got him?
*  Okay.
*  Thank you mother.
*  No, I got it.
*  Thank you so much.
*  Especially people that have never competed
*  in a sport before, you don't know how fucking distracting
*  that is.
*  Yeah.
*  Like shut your whole lady.
*  And she had competed in sports, that's a problem.
*  So she loved it.
*  Yeah, that'd be like her being on the beam,
*  and I'm like, jump higher.
*  It's also, I think people back then, in those days,
*  like when she grew up, they didn't know any better.
*  Like people didn't know what you're supposed to do
*  and not supposed to do.
*  People hit their kids.
*  Oh yeah.
*  They all hit their kids.
*  They all yelled at their kids,
*  called them fucking idiots.
*  Everybody did that.
*  We were animals.
*  Like if you grew up, and your parents grew up
*  in the 1940s and 50s, you were an animal.
*  Yeah.
*  They were animals, because they were raised
*  by people who grew up in the Depression.
*  Okay, and those people were animals.
*  And those people, their parents fought in World War I.
*  Okay, like these are barbarians.
*  And so it's like so many generations of softness
*  have led us to where we are now.
*  But if you, you know, if you're our parents,
*  you're exposed to all that shit.
*  Well my dad, his dad took off,
*  and his mom went into like a mental institution
*  because of it.
*  So he got raised by his grandparents.
*  So that's like a generation back.
*  Oh God.
*  And so when my mom and dad would discipline me,
*  I was like, why are you doing this,
*  and you're fucking doing, you're terrifying me.
*  Oh boy.
*  Yeah, it was interesting.
*  Oh, Jesus Christ.
*  That's a lot.
*  That's a lot to manage.
*  Imagine being the grandparents, like fuck.
*  I know, we thought we were done.
*  We thought we were done.
*  Exactly.
*  Guy wanted to go play golf.
*  Fuck.
*  Now I gotta take care of another kid,
*  and this one's mad.
*  Yeah.
*  Because they got abandoned.
*  They have all these issues now, they're confused.
*  I gave my dad a lot of leeway.
*  A lot, just because of that.
*  He stole my identity when I was in high school
*  and ruined my credit.
*  No!
*  Yeah, and I was like,
*  man, I got raised by his fucking grandparents.
*  I don't know.
*  Oh no.
*  Yeah.
*  Imagine dad being just like a straight up criminal.
*  I'm like, dad.
*  Oh, I don't have to imagine.
*  My dad stole the car.
*  Straight up criminal?
*  Oh god, yeah.
*  Wow.
*  Absolutely, he helped me.
*  He had me help him steal a car.
*  I guess he has to have stolen your identity.
*  What am I thinking?
*  He's only gonna do it once, only to his kid?
*  I, yeah, I got a rental car once,
*  because my car was in the shop.
*  He took the keys, made a copy of the keys,
*  and then when I brought that rental car back,
*  had me drive him there, and I didn't know it.
*  He stole the car and then drove to Las Vegas
*  because the cops were looking for him
*  for writing bad checks.
*  I mean, what the fuck, man?
*  Holy shit.
*  How do you not become a comedian?
*  Yeah, I know.
*  Totally makes sense.
*  You can't be ticking away at a,
*  an office job, you're typing like,
*  you'll go crazy.
*  You'll go crazy.
*  You will go crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, you'll barely keep it together.
*  Yeah.
*  Fuck, man.
*  Yeah, pretty wild.
*  I called, when I went to college,
*  I called to get a phone line,
*  and they were like, I don't think so.
*  You owe us thousands of dollars.
*  Because he had stolen your identity?
*  Oh my God.
*  Did you try explaining to them?
*  My mom had to write a letter to everybody
*  that said that I lived with her the whole time.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  Holy shit, dude.
*  You couldn't get a phone line.
*  I mean.
*  My dad, listen to what, he fucking stole another identity.
*  It was a kid that he graduated high school with
*  who died in a motorcycle accident.
*  Oh my God.
*  My dad called his parents and said,
*  hey, you guys have some benefits coming.
*  I just need his social security number.
*  Oh my God.
*  And then became that dude.
*  And then signed up Columbia Record Club.
*  Golly, Jimi Hendrix, greatest hits.
*  Yeah, it was wild living with him.
*  Fuck, man, that's crazy.
*  Holy shit.
*  Wow.
*  When you were in high school,
*  what did you think you were gonna be?
*  I don't know, maybe a teacher or a lawyer or something.
*  And when did the comedy bug get you?
*  Way early.
*  I mean, I wanted to do comedy forever.
*  I just lived in a town where there wasn't comedy.
*  Oh, so it was like a thing in the back of your head?
*  Yeah, I mean, way, way back in the day,
*  I watched my grandpa watch, like listen to records
*  and just start laughing.
*  I'm like, I wanna do that.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah, I remember my first exposure to comedy
*  was probably, the actual stand-up comedy
*  was probably Bill Cosby or Bill Cosby Record.
*  Because my parents had a Bill Cosby record
*  and they had Cheech and Chong.
*  And I think they might have had a George Carlin one too
*  because everyone had records back then
*  because there's nothing on TV.
*  And so you'd sit around, you'd listen to records.
*  So we listened to Cheech and Chong.
*  When I was a little kid,
*  I was probably like eight or nine or something like that.
*  I was like, this is so funny.
*  And then when I was in high school,
*  I got a hold of some Richard Pryor cassettes.
*  And me and my girlfriend were in my bedroom
*  just howling laughing at Richard Pryor.
*  Like, this is so crazy.
*  What are you saying?
*  It's so crazy.
*  Because this is like, at the time we're talking,
*  I was in high school in 81.
*  So this was probably like 83, something like that.
*  And so in 1983, like Richard Pryor was the king.
*  This was like when he was doing Live at the Sunset Strip.
*  Oh wow.
*  My parents took me to see that.
*  I think I was 15 years old.
*  And we were in the movie theater
*  and I'll never forget this
*  because this was the first time
*  I'd ever experienced anything like this.
*  I'd never seen someone do standup comedy for a long time.
*  I had only seen like a guy do some jokes
*  on the Tonight Show.
*  You know, like a real like cut and dry,
*  set up punchline, five minute.
*  All right, that was terrific.
*  Come sit on the couch.
*  And the comic would sit there.
*  And I would tell you about the zoo.
*  You know, and so that was my exposure to comedy.
*  But in the theater, I remember, I'll never forget this.
*  Sitting in the theater,
*  watching Live at the Sunset Strip
*  and looking at the audience
*  and people were moving around.
*  I remember this guy was holding his stomach
*  and he was slapping the chair
*  and his wife was slapping him.
*  They were just going, oh my God, oh my God.
*  It was so funny.
*  And I remember thinking,
*  I've never seen anything this funny.
*  Like all the funny movies that I love,
*  they were never this funny.
*  All this guy's doing is talking.
*  And to get humans to react like that.
*  It was crazy.
*  It was so wild.
*  It was like, oh, he's doing his talking.
*  How is he doing this?
*  I remember the first comedy I ever saw
*  was this guy, Wild Bill Bauer, out of Minnesota.
*  And I'll never forget this joke.
*  He goes, I called my boss the other day
*  and I told him I can't come in because I'm sick.
*  And he says, how sick are you?
*  And I said, well, I'm fucking my sister.
*  And I still laugh about it.
*  I mean, it's like the funniest shit in the world.
*  That's a great joke.
*  It's such a great joke.
*  That's a great joke.
*  And that was my introduction.
*  So people, same thing.
*  People are freaking out.
*  Oh, it was great.
*  Kidding that guy string a bunch together?
*  Yeah.
*  How good was he?
*  Yeah, he was real good.
*  I mean, it's a great joke like that.
*  Unless you're a one-hit wonder.
*  No, he wasn't.
*  That seems like a crazy hit to be that good of a joke,
*  to be a one-hit wonder.
*  So that guy's got a bunch in the.
*  Some of those guys that are real good like that,
*  for whatever reason, people never find out about him.
*  Now he just stayed in Minnesota.
*  He ended up booking tours for other guys
*  and stuff like that.
*  There was a guy named Bob Woods
*  who was a legend on Long Island.
*  He was this big guy, this big, jolly guy.
*  And he was hilarious.
*  And he was a legend in Long Island.
*  And to this day, I'm upset that I never got a chance
*  to see him live.
*  Because all the comics from that day,
*  they always tell me, Bob Woods, Bob Woods.
*  This is like the early 80s.
*  So I think when I came along,
*  I don't think I got to New York until 90, 90 or 91.
*  And I think he'd already stopped.
*  This is Bob Woods.
*  He was a character, man.
*  Give me some volume.
*  Let me introduce myself.
*  Here I am, Mr. Cholesterol.
*  The Incredible Bulk.
*  Hungry Jack.
*  A man called Horse.
*  Sir Lunchalot.
*  Chef Boy, are you fat?
*  Pizza on Earth, goodwill towards Manicotti.
*  Rebel without a waistline.
*  Strawberry Fields for breakfast.
*  Lord of the Ringdings.
*  The Earl of Sandwich.
*  The Prince of Wales.
*  And a little house on the prairie.
*  All rolled into one.
*  What can I tell you, folks?
*  What can I tell you?
*  I'm a fat fucking guy.
*  Boom, boom, bring some food to my room
*  so we can eat it all night.
*  Keep the briaski in sight.
*  And I woke up this morning.
*  I got myself a ham hock.
*  Let me clear some things up for you right away.
*  Can we keep going?
*  Yeah, because I hope it's gonna get better.
*  No, I wasn't the Riptale of Balloon
*  in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.
*  No, I'm not one of the Moon Dogs from WrestleMania.
*  No, I'm not Dusty Rhodes.
*  No, I'm not gonna pay a lot for that muffler.
*  No, I'm not Boog Powell as a Rastafarian.
*  No, I wasn't making a list
*  and checking it twice last December.
*  No, I haven't buttoned this jacket since I bought it.
*  No, I'm not Baby Heel's Star Trek episode.
*  No, I'm not Tip O'Neill as the Michelin Man.
*  No, I'm not Norm from Cheers if it was set in California.
*  No, it's not a fucking wig, okay?
*  This is my real hair.
*  Really, it's all in the shampoo.
*  Some people shampoo with Prel.
*  Some people use head and shoulders.
*  I just get out the Dippity Doo and the Mop and Glow.
*  But look, I read minds, all right?
*  Call me Kreskin for this shit.
*  I'm getting a reading for this girl.
*  She's thinking if I fall, she's fucking dead.
*  A lot of fat jokes.
*  Yeah, lots.
*  It's better than this.
*  This is like some things he did on TV.
*  This is like him recording a set for television.
*  It looks like...
*  Was it 88?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  That wasn't the best set.
*  He had an insane Jackie Gleason impression, insane.
*  And a lot of things, you know, he had a lot of
*  And a lot of things, you know, he inspired a lot of comedians.
*  A lot of comedians in Long Island.
*  That just wasn't the best set of his.
*  Yeah, but I mean, the guy's a writer, holy shit.
*  Oh, you bang him out, man.
*  But again, it's like the world was different then.
*  You gotta also think stand-up comedy,
*  let's just put it into perspective.
*  1988 was 36 years ago.
*  36 years before that, there was no stand-up comedy.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  So you have to think about it, right?
*  So if you went back to 19...
*  You know, 1950, let's go to 50.
*  What the fuck is there?
*  What's the stand-up comedy?
*  It's nonsense.
*  It's guys and the cat skills that are telling
*  two Jews walking to a bar jokes.
*  It's not real comedy.
*  And then Lenny Bruce comes along in the 60s
*  and then everything changes.
*  Then you get Mortsal, you get...
*  Joan Rivers.
*  Yeah, eventually.
*  They come later.
*  They all come later and Carlin comes later.
*  And Pryor comes later.
*  They're all inspired by Lenny Bruce.
*  Lenny Bruce is really like the germ.
*  He was really like the center of it all.
*  From him, all things come.
*  That guy's the real godfather of comedy.
*  The kind of comedy that we do,
*  we talk about stuff.
*  Right.
*  Everybody was just telling jokes back then.
*  They were just being jokey joke guy.
*  And then there's Don Rickles,
*  who was like the insult guys, insulting people.
*  That was always very funny.
*  But nobody was doing social commentary.
*  Nobody was making funny points
*  about things that go on in society
*  until Lenny came around.
*  Yeah, working against the machine a little bit.
*  Getting arrested left and right, dude.
*  That's pretty sweet.
*  Pretty wild.
*  You really think about it?
*  In my office, I have a photograph of him getting arrested.
*  I mean, I don't think you can get arrested
*  for comedy anymore, right?
*  Oh, you definitely could try.
*  Yeah.
*  You can in Canada.
*  That's a challenge, I expect.
*  In Canada, you can get sued.
*  I know, I had a guy on the podcast that got sued and lost.
*  He got fined, because there was a few different things.
*  This guy had made a joke about a kid who was Mike, what?
*  Mike Ward, thank you.
*  He had made a joke about a kid
*  that they had done some benefit for,
*  a really sick kid, and the kid was still alive
*  a few years later.
*  And the joke, some kind of a joke about like,
*  can I get my money back?
*  Is this kid really sick?
*  Something along those lines.
*  I might have fucked it up.
*  I think I butchered it.
*  But anyway, the point is it was just a joke
*  and they sued him and they won.
*  Like he got charged and he lost.
*  Who sued him?
*  The parents?
*  I think they fined him.
*  I think it was one of those things where,
*  see, let's find out what the specifics of it are.
*  Because there was another one in, I believe, Vancouver,
*  where a comedian was getting heckled by these lesbians.
*  And they just started making fun of them
*  for being lesbians, saying a bunch of really rude things.
*  And that guy got fined too, like a large number.
*  Interesting. Yeah.
*  Canada does not have freedom of speech.
*  It's not the same as the United States.
*  It doesn't have a First Amendment.
*  They have hate crime laws.
*  So they have weird stuff.
*  This is why Jordan Peterson, way back in 2016,
*  was telling them like you cannot have compelled speech laws.
*  Canadian who mocked disabled child singer
*  did not breach limits of free speech.
*  That's not Mike Ward though.
*  Case pitted Quebec comedian Mike Ward
*  against former child,
*  oh, that must be the child singer that's sick,
*  did not breach limits of free speech.
*  So it went to the Supreme Court.
*  So this is 2021.
*  When did we have him on?
*  It was definitely way before that
*  because it wasn't in Texas.
*  So he must have finally won under the five-four
*  split decision.
*  Wow. Four people said fuck him.
*  Fuck your joke.
*  The top court ruled Friday, while comedian Mike Ward's act
*  ridiculed Jeremy Gabriel,
*  a young man with Treacher-Collin syndrome.
*  He was chosen as a target, not because of a disability,
*  but because of his fame, which is true.
*  In its ruling, the court found that Ward's jokes
*  did not seek to incite others to mock Gabriel
*  and he cannot be blamed for the actions
*  of Gabriel's classmates and others who parroted the jokes.
*  See folks, this is what happens when you try to be too nice.
*  You can't be too nice.
*  You can't go that far.
*  You gotta let people say things that are offensive.
*  If you don't, then the only way to enforce that
*  is totalitarianism.
*  You start locking people in jail.
*  I know you want people to be a better person.
*  They should be encouraged to be better people,
*  but you can't do that.
*  You can't fucking force people to say things
*  or not say things.
*  I think he came on after this happened in 2016.
*  Right.
*  He was on- 35,000?
*  Yeah, he got paid, he was ordered to pay 35,000
*  in moral and punitive damages.
*  But that's not as much as the guy in Vancouver.
*  The guy in Vancouver, I think, if memory serves me,
*  I think it was a lot more money.
*  The guy in Vancouver, there was two lesbians
*  heckling him at a show.
*  This is 22,500 for that one.
*  Okay, I might have thought it was 225,000 or something.
*  Either way, fuck you.
*  Yeah. Fuck you.
*  I was in Calgary one time.
*  I was talking about the queen.
*  Oh.
*  And then the MC came up and he goes,
*  ah, fuck these Americans.
*  They come here, they think we have a queen.
*  Learn about the country you're coming to.
*  And I was like, oh shit, I thought you had a queen.
*  So I went to the public library, did all this research,
*  and there is a queen because there was a treaty
*  and so she acts as the queen.
*  So the next day I went up and he came up
*  to bring me off stage and I go, hey man,
*  just stay here for a sec.
*  And I read the treaty and I go, just so you know,
*  I'm an American, but you do have a queen.
*  And then I took a $20 bill out and licked it
*  and stuck it to his forehead.
*  And I go, she's on your fucking money, man.
*  I just like, ugh, what a dick.
*  That's hilarious.
*  Well, some comedians are dicks.
*  And no lawsuit.
*  That's awesome.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, you were right.
*  How are they gonna sue you for being right?
*  Fucking idiots.
*  But it's like that thing of like,
*  you try to set up society where you prevent people
*  from being mean.
*  But the problem is people are gonna be mean.
*  And the only way to prevent people from being mean
*  is to really ostracize people who are mean
*  and then have everybody else learn from that
*  and learn from the way you talk about these people
*  that are mean.
*  And then we all kind of grow together.
*  You can't have laws that enforce your opinion
*  of what someone can or cannot be allowed to say.
*  Because then you never get that guy's joke.
*  Your friend, sick, because I'm fucking my sister,
*  you don't get that.
*  Yeah, right.
*  You don't get that joke, because that's illegal.
*  So then you don't get funsies,
*  because that's just funsies.
*  You didn't really fuck anybody.
*  It's a joke.
*  Bob Marley didn't shoot any sheriffs.
*  It's just fun.
*  It's a fun thing to say.
*  Yeah.
*  When I was in seventh grade,
*  if you talked in the history class,
*  they made you take a pacifier
*  and sit there like you were a baby.
*  Oh, that's hilarious.
*  Because they were like, I told you to shut up,
*  now you have to suck on this pacifier.
*  Oh my God.
*  And there's no fucking way you'd be able to do that now.
*  But guess what?
*  Everybody shut up that had the pacifier.
*  I got paddled.
*  I got paddled in Florida.
*  I got in a fight with this kid, Preston Banks.
*  Me and this kid, we got in a scrap,
*  and we both got brought to the principal's office
*  and we got paddled.
*  Well, they whacked me in the ass
*  with a fucking cricket racket.
*  They had this fucking thing.
*  They slap you one shot in the ass,
*  and then they send you home,
*  and you're like, whoa, I got hit.
*  You can't do that today.
*  Oh, there's no chance.
*  By the way, we never fought again.
*  Yeah, and we became friends after that.
*  That's what I'm saying.
*  It's like these kids now can take a chair
*  from the back of the room,
*  throw it at the teacher when he's not looking,
*  and that teacher just has to sit there and take it.
*  Can't do anything.
*  Well, yeah, especially when you get into high school.
*  Things get very, very dangerous.
*  Very, very, very dangerous
*  because people are starting to get strong
*  and they're aggressive,
*  and these men, these young men,
*  have testosterone for the first time in their life.
*  So all of a sudden, you're 13,
*  and then boom, the factory opens.
*  And you're like, Yahoo!
*  And you start growing.
*  You got a mustache now.
*  Now you're 14 and 15,
*  and then you got this fucking loser teacher.
*  This teacher's talking shit,
*  and you want to fuck this teacher up.
*  And you know if you do,
*  you'll be a hero for the rest of the class.
*  You'll be a legend for all your boys.
*  This teacher's talking shit,
*  and you just grab his tie and box him in the face.
*  Guys hit teachers.
*  There's so many videos of people.
*  Oh, all the time.
*  So many online videos of poor teachers
*  getting beaten up by their students.
*  And it's always the guys that fucked first
*  that would take the lead on that.
*  I always felt it was those guys.
*  It was like, the rest of us waiting to have sex,
*  we were just sitting in our chairs still listening.
*  You're not ready to fight, especially the teacher.
*  Or women that beat the teachers up.
*  Those are horrible.
*  Horrible because those are slow beatings.
*  Not much gets done.
*  It's like a lot of hair pulling.
*  It's like watching a tall guy fall.
*  Oh, shitty punches to the face.
*  And you're just trapped there.
*  And nobody's helping you,
*  and everyone's screaming and cheering.
*  That's great.
*  They're all filming it, and then we wonder,
*  why does nobody want to be a teacher?
*  Why does the education system sucks?
*  Why, why, why, why?
*  Well, because you fucking, the whole thing sucks.
*  Like, you can't even,
*  you couldn't even just fix the schools.
*  You got to start from a foundational level
*  in the bad neighborhood.
*  It's like you have to somehow or another help people
*  get the fuck out of this place of total complete despair.
*  And the fact that these places of total complete despair
*  have existed in the same location
*  for decade after decade after decade.
*  And you want these kids to do better?
*  Like how?
*  How?
*  All they've done is see it repeated over and over.
*  Think about your dad.
*  Like how did that happen?
*  That didn't happen.
*  I choose not to think about my dad, Joe.
*  Thank you.
*  But if you were your dad's dad,
*  that would have never happened.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Yeah.
*  You know, we have the good fortune
*  of understanding the mistakes of those who came before us.
*  And even like, I mean, even thinking about,
*  we can't even put our mind in what it must be like
*  to be a kid that grows up in the South Side of Chicago
*  in 2024.
*  Oh, no way.
*  Where you're seeing people shot every weekend.
*  You can't put yourself into that.
*  So to expect that child to come out of that environment
*  and then go to Yale and be fine with everything.
*  Be fine.
*  When he's heard bullets whizz by his head.
*  He's seen his friends get shot in the street.
*  He's seen drive-bys.
*  He's seen all that.
*  He's seen drug dealers wrapping in the streets,
*  holding guns and smoking weed in front of everybody
*  and street takeovers.
*  You seen that from the time you were a child?
*  How?
*  How are you gonna escape that?
*  Right, because even if you do escape it,
*  sometimes some part of you misses it
*  and thinks now you're not being normal.
*  It's like when guys come back from the Middle East
*  and they're like, I wanna go back there.
*  It's like, why the fuck would you wanna go back there?
*  But it's because that's their new normal.
*  That's what they miss it.
*  It's not just that.
*  It's also alive.
*  It's alive.
*  Like if you're gang banging like that, you're alive.
*  There's a lot going on.
*  You go from that to working in and out.
*  What is this?
*  I'd rather be in jail.
*  Guys would rather get shot.
*  They really would.
*  In some places and some people,
*  they would rather be living the life
*  because at least that life,
*  one of the things that comes out of gangs
*  and bad neighborhoods is a brotherhood and a comradery
*  that doesn't exist in their home.
*  So they don't have any real love in the home,
*  but the love they have with the people
*  that they would literally kill people for.
*  And they're all together and they're making money together
*  and they're partying together.
*  They're having a good time together,
*  driving cars together.
*  This is way better than whatever they grew up with.
*  It's like band of brother shit.
*  Yeah, it's exciting.
*  They're literally in a war,
*  but they're in a war in an American city, which is crazy.
*  But if you look at the death toll of people killed
*  in Afghanistan during the height of the war,
*  it's comparable to the people killed in South Side of Chicago.
*  I would imagine the people in the South Side of Chicago,
*  more people get killed.
*  I think what happens in war, of course,
*  is depending upon the war, of course,
*  but sometimes there's large amounts of debt,
*  like in Gaza, if you can call it a war.
*  There's large amounts of deaths
*  and large amounts in one day, right?
*  Which in gang violence, you get it over the weekend.
*  This guy got shot, that guy got shot, it's cumulative.
*  But I bet it's close.
*  And I believe it's higher.
*  I believe the death toll for the South Side of Chicago
*  is as high or higher than Afghanistan
*  at the height of the war.
*  That's wild. Wild.
*  And then if somebody dies in Mexico,
*  there's a tourism alert. Oh yeah.
*  Where you're not supposed to go.
*  Well, that's the way they die in Mexico.
*  The old Sicilian necktie.
*  I've seen some videos.
*  There was a dude who used to be a doorman at the improv,
*  and one day I was just walking in the club,
*  I'm like, what's up?
*  He goes, you want to see this cartel video?
*  I go, what is it?
*  And it was a dude who was tied up,
*  tied up in his arms and his legs in all positions,
*  and a pit bull was eating his dick.
*  And I was like, yo, I do not need to see this
*  before I go on stage.
*  This is horrific.
*  This huge pit bull was just clamped down this guy's dick,
*  and he's just writhing back and forth in agony
*  while this dog eats him alive.
*  It's a great peanut butter commercial.
*  I don't think they use peanut butter.
*  I don't think they have to.
*  These dogs are literally trained to eat people,
*  which is fucking terrifying.
*  Is there a place that shows statistics about gang violence?
*  I need to know more about what deaths are you
*  talking about in Afghanistan?
*  OK, let's say this.
*  Because it's like everyone is a lot.
*  They way outnumber the Chicago deaths.
*  The weekends are all told total.
*  2023, there was 621 deaths in Chicago.
*  And 2021, I see for Afghanistan, 5,200 civilians were killed.
*  But is that when we pulled out?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, that's different.
*  8,800 were killed the year before.
*  8,600 the year before that.
*  Oh, OK.
*  So it's always more.
*  It's always more for Afghanistan.
*  The year we pulled out was horrific.
*  Soldiers, though, if you just do Western soldiers,
*  it's a very similar number.
*  But I think that's what it was.
*  Not civilians.
*  OK, so it's people in Afghanistan that are killed.
*  Western soldiers.
*  So Western soldiers, it's comparable.
*  That must be what I read.
*  But still, even thinking about an American city,
*  not even an American city, the south side of an American city.
*  A major metropolitan city.
*  Versus a fucking war-torn country.
*  Right.
*  It's a country that, I mean, it's a city, rather,
*  that Frank Sinatra wrote a song about.
*  It was his kind of town.
*  Right?
*  My kind of town.
*  Have you heard AI convert Frank Sinatra into Eminem?
*  So Frank Sinatra is singing Lose Yourself.
*  Oh, my god.
*  It's perfect.
*  Does it sound amazing?
*  It's amazing.
*  It's amazing.
*  Have you heard it, Jamie?
*  Yeah.
*  You don't think it's amazing?
*  Look at this face.
*  I'm super cynical all day.
*  Look at his face.
*  Yeah, he rolled his eyes.
*  It sounds cool, but when would you ever want to...
*  Are you going to choose to listen to that any day?
*  I just do it on a loop in my house all day long today.
*  It's a cool experiment often, but it's never really good.
*  No, you're right.
*  It's interesting, though.
*  To me, it's fascinating how competent it is.
*  Here it is.
*  Listen.
*  Listen how good this is.
*  I hope this is the right one.
*  This is actually not what we thought that was.
*  What do you mean?
*  That was a cover by someone singing...
*  Who is that?
*  It says the guy's name right here.
*  Oh, it's not AI?
*  No, that was like a lounge singer.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, he's great.
*  Keep him going.
*  Who is this guy?
*  Well, is that that guy that covers all of the songs?
*  Well, so that's Richard Cheese.
*  Yeah, so do we have a problem here with sound stuff?
*  YouTube shit?
*  Is that what this is?
*  We can't play that?
*  I don't know if anyone's got the rights to that.
*  Let's cut that out just so we don't get in trouble and just say who the guy is.
*  We'll cut that out.
*  We'll edit that out so we don't get in trouble.
*  Who's the guy?
*  I don't know that we would.
*  That's a cut.
*  I don't think even though the rules are...
*  They always fuck us, man.
*  They fuck us.
*  From playing a song and then come after?
*  Oh, yeah.
*  You could play like two...
*  What is his name?
*  Ben Dunhill is the lounge singer's name.
*  Damn, that's good.
*  I thought...
*  Yeah, it was really good.
*  I saw a YouTube reel or an Instagram reel.
*  So there is, but as I said, I just chose the wrong one.
*  Oh, well that one was really good.
*  Okay, this is the thing that I saw.
*  See, that's the same thing.
*  Same guy.
*  Okay, so it's not.
*  They got tricked.
*  Damn, Ben.
*  He's doing a gangster paradise.
*  You're so good.
*  Let me hear this.
*  So what Chad brought up though is this guy from early Napster days, Richard Cheese in
*  the Lounge Against the Machine.
*  That guy rules.
*  That went super viral.
*  Yeah, I remember that guy.
*  He was doing these lounge versions of Rage Against the Machine.
*  Right, right, right.
*  Prodigy and all sorts of fun.
*  The thing about that guy is though he sounded exactly like Sinatra.
*  Yeah.
*  This Ben, downhill guy.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean that sounded like an AI Sinatra.
*  That's why it tricked that guy on the video that I saw.
*  Wow.
*  How good is that dude?
*  Thank you for catching that.
*  There's a lot of people online that are willing to repost anything and just say this is what
*  this is.
*  They get so much money for engagement farming is what it's called.
*  Yeah, I was reading something about that.
*  I was reading something about someone was talking about how they make money on Instagram
*  and that they're making thousands of dollars a month on Instagram and with engagement.
*  And that's why they post so much.
*  Someone said, why are you posting so much?
*  Well, he's like, I make money.
*  This is like a business for me.
*  Like this isn't and I'm like, what?
*  How much money can you make on Instagram?
*  Also if you'd be doing TikTok and YouTube too, you'd be making thousands of dollars
*  for about an hour of work a day.
*  Yeah.
*  Why would you rather regular work?
*  Yeah, no shit.
*  I have people that do like we'll go through one of my albums and then they'll actually
*  make it into a sketch where they play all of the parts.
*  Me, my children, whatever it is.
*  Wow.
*  Talking about.
*  And then they put that out and tag me in it.
*  And it's like, I don't know, they make money off of it.
*  That's wild.
*  And then I try to post something and they say there's a copyright infringement.
*  It's like, that's fucking mine.
*  Yeah, the legalese shit.
*  It all gets real weird.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like, I get it.
*  There's a lot of people make it, but there's a lot of people making money off of other
*  people's stuff too.
*  So I get that.
*  Why that would piss you off that someone's taking your stuff.
*  I saw a discussion today.
*  I think Marques Brownlee was bringing it up that he pays a company to transcribe his videos
*  for YouTube, upload as a transcription so people can look at it in closed captioning
*  and whatnot.
*  There are now companies that exist that can rip that transcription off of YouTube.
*  I'm not sure exactly how.
*  And then they're uploading that as blog posts.
*  Ooh.
*  And then they make ad revenue off of a blog post that they did no work to.
*  Well there's so many blog posts that are clearly either made by AI or by foreign people that
*  don't totally understand English because the way they phrase things is goofy and they do
*  like celebrity news.
*  Sometimes you get suckered into clicking on a link.
*  Like you read like a legitimate story and then underneath there's a sponsored link.
*  Why is John Travolta homeless?
*  Like what?
*  John Travolta's homeless.
*  You got me.
*  You got me.
*  And then you get sucked in.
*  Like the 10 people that have aged the worst over the last 20 years.
*  Like oh no, what's going on here?
*  What is happening here?
*  People who lie about plastic surgery and you go and look at that.
*  Oh my goodness.
*  You fucking liar.
*  And then you get sucked in and it's like next, next, next, next.
*  So it's each one you click, they get a new click.
*  You know they get a new.
*  It's not like it's not all on one page.
*  It's in multiple pages.
*  There's multiple hits and then they're getting the ad revenue off of that.
*  We had a guy back in the day that went to jail because he rigged something so that every
*  time you went to his website, if you afterwards bought something from Amazon, it would credit
*  his account.
*  Like you went through his website, his website link to get Amazon.
*  So he'd get like a percentage?
*  Yeah.
*  So he like put like a cookie in someone in your computer or something.
*  I don't know exactly how.
*  I don't want to say how it went, but this guy got went to jail because he was making
*  money that really wasn't his money.
*  So instead of someone saying, Hey, like, I don't know if they still do this, but the
*  way it used to do is they would say, Hey, if you want to support this podcast, use our
*  Amazon link on our website and we get a cut back from Amazon every time you use it.
*  And so they would do it as a way to support.
*  And then it would also, it would probably facilitate some impulse purchases that maybe
*  you would never make before.
*  Like you, Oh, this guy's got a great podcast.
*  I'm going to help them out by going to Amazon.
*  Oh, I could use socks.
*  And then you start buying things off Amazon.
*  It's so easy.
*  And then, you know, so this guy would do that.
*  If you would go to that Amazon, even if you didn't buy anything, it would pull a cookie
*  in your computer.
*  So next time you went to Amazon, she is saying like, Oh, he went through my website.
*  Well, they do that now with like, uh, if they go to my website or they go to your videos,
*  stuff like that, and then they can, they can send ads out to people that have similar click
*  patterns, like all that shit.
*  Wow.
*  That just blows my mind.
*  Yeah.
*  I was reading a thing today that was saying don't have an Amazon Alexa in your bedroom.
*  Whoa.
*  We're talking dirty to each other.
*  Amazon Alexa is listening.
*  You're trying to watch porn.
*  You're just listening to yourself.
*  It's the only way it works.
*  It has to listen.
*  Yeah.
*  Do you use one of those?
*  No.
*  Yeah.
*  No.
*  No way.
*  Dude.
*  I always assume my phone's listening to me too.
*  Always.
*  And now I know it is.
*  For sure.
*  At least with the fucked up person.
*  We don't know that when you buy that, like you've already agreed to like having a microphone
*  around you all the time.
*  Yeah.
*  And you don't think about it.
*  You just think, oh, what a convenience.
*  I just ask Alexa and she'll play a music for me and Alexa will turn the lights down.
*  Alexa will do all these things.
*  What a great thing to have.
*  Sometimes I'll just yell, Alexa, make my daughter stop talking to me.
*  And she's like, we have an Alexa now?
*  It's like, no, just please take the hint.
*  Well, if you talk shit to Siri, Siri gets upset.
*  Like if you ask, like you get rude with Siri, Siri will go, there's no reason to talk like
*  that.
*  Siri has like, we're maybe a month away from that being implemented completely on your
*  iPhone, right?
*  Isn't the new iPhone 18, iOS 18, doesn't that have like a much more advanced Siri that'll
*  have conversations with you?
*  We'll find out when we get to use it.
*  That's for sure.
*  Well, you could use it right now, right?
*  Can't use the beta if you want it to.
*  You want to get crazy?
*  I would not assume that it works perfectly, but it might.
*  I bet by the time they're letting people try the beta, it's probably pretty good.
*  I think Marcus Brownlee just released a video where he was examining iOS 18, the pros and
*  cons of it, the things that it can do.
*  It can make text messages with a satellite now.
*  So if you're in a place that has no service, you can send out a text message via satellite,
*  not just an SOS, but like you could send a specific text to people.
*  It can also make people very lonely because you're going to be talking to this robot.
*  Yeah, that's kind of weird.
*  It's like the movie Her.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Yeah, that's 100% going to happen.
*  By the way, Scarlett Johansson, she sued, which one was it?
*  ChatGPD?
*  Yeah, or was it Gemini?
*  I don't know if she actually went through with it, but yeah, she was OpenAI, the company.
*  So they were asking her if they could use her voice and she said no.
*  And they used a voice that's exactly like her voice.
*  Not exactly.
*  Pretty close.
*  Close enough.
*  Close enough where she decided she was going to sue.
*  Is it her shit from other clips?
*  What's her from?
*  No, it's another person.
*  But her contention is they got a person to sound like her, which people have sued for
*  before, right?
*  Like didn't Kim Kardashian sue because they had a Kim Kardashian lookalike did a commercial
*  when Kim wouldn't do it?
*  Oh, interesting.
*  Yeah.
*  So if like you won't do something, they can get someone that looks super similar to you
*  to do it and then they'll go fuck you, I'm suing you.
*  People were sending me a car commercial for a while that I had to listen to it twice because
*  I thought it was me.
*  Oh, wow.
*  They didn't even ask me the first time.
*  Oh, wow.
*  They just like, no, no, no.
*  I mean, they weren't trying to use my voice at all.
*  But they used someone who sounded so much like you.
*  It was crazy.
*  A lot of people thought like, hey, man, congrats on that commercial.
*  And I was like, what's that now?
*  Yeah, the Scarlett Johansson thing, we played it.
*  Now that I'm thinking about it, when we played it here, it was different because she was
*  the voice of her, right?
*  So she was the voice that Joaquin Phoenix falls in love with.
*  But the clip that we played was her bedtime talking, like he was laying in bed and I
*  think she had more of a raspy time to go to sleep voice.
*  Whereas in the regular chat GPT implementation is like Scarlett at the office.
*  OK.
*  Did you ever see that movie where she becomes a god?
*  What's it called?
*  Do you remember?
*  Lucy.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Yeah, I've seen that.
*  Wild fucking movie, man.
*  That's a fun movie, man.
*  She is one of those one of those actresses where if I see her on the picture of the movie,
*  I'll watch it.
*  She's compelling.
*  Yeah.
*  She was great in this movie under the skin.
*  It was an indie sci fi film and she played an alien.
*  OK.
*  She played this alien that seduced men and like drowned them in another dimension.
*  It's very hard to describe exactly how it did.
*  She was naked walking to them and they were just slowly drowning.
*  It was a crazy movie, like a really weird movie, but she's an alien.
*  She comes from another planet and she's really hot and she like seduces these men under the
*  skin.
*  Yeah, I will be.
*  This is it's a crazy, crazy, crazy.
*  So I don't know if the alien did that to her and then she and then it became her.
*  I don't remember how it worked, but she just assumed that it was really good, though.
*  Very original, like original movie.
*  Like you watch like, but again, hot.
*  Like ruin your life hot.
*  Yeah, like change your plans, move to another state hot.
*  You know, there's there's certain women that they lock eyes with you.
*  You're in real trouble.
*  Oh, man, that happened to me.
*  I got her to move to Minnesota.
*  Oh, that was pretty sick.
*  That is pretty sad.
*  And she's still there.
*  Congratulations.
*  Thank you.
*  Yeah, sometimes it works.
*  You never know.
*  But the thing is, like if she's an alien and she really just wants to drown you in another
*  dimension, I fucking let her.
*  You might have to.
*  Yeah, you might.
*  I mean, what are you going to live forever?
*  No, you're not.
*  You're sure not.
*  At least you go out in a very unconventional and pretty amazing way.
*  You're talking about that forever.
*  If they know if they ever find out about vultures can't find me.
*  I'm way under an interdimensional water system.
*  What do you think is going on with all this UFO talk?
*  I think it's all nonsense.
*  I don't even know about it.
*  You don't pay attention at all.
*  Not really.
*  Wow.
*  Because if they want to come get me, let's go.
*  But like when you see all this like disclosure talk on television, they're talking to Congress
*  and you don't pay attention.
*  Not really.
*  Good for you.
*  I wait until the end.
*  Right.
*  It's like I tell my kids all the time, don't borrow worry from around the bend.
*  It's like if you're going to have to worry about it, you're going to have to fucking
*  worry about it.
*  Yeah, I'm not necessarily worried about the alien thing.
*  I'm more interested.
*  Sure.
*  Like what is this?
*  What the fuck is going on?
*  You know, what?
*  How much of this is nonsense?
*  It's not zero percent.
*  So OK, what?
*  How much of it is real?
*  So you do think that people are coming down or other?
*  I think it's highly likely that the universe is way stranger than we think it is.
*  Way stranger.
*  And I don't even know if it's as conventional as a thing gets in a ship and flies here from
*  another place.
*  Sure.
*  I think it might be interdimensional traveling.
*  It might be something that's always been here.
*  There's that thought because there's so many instances of things like what we think of
*  that are in like the Bhagavad Gita and these ancient texts.
*  There are thousands and thousands of years old and they're talking about things that
*  fly in the sky, flying chariots, flying things that have gods in them.
*  What is that?
*  What's that all about?
*  Comets shooting stars?
*  Could be for sure.
*  Some of them probably.
*  Right.
*  And then these things that people see streaking across the sky, they see something extraordinary.
*  It lights up the sky and then mythology gets attached to that.
*  And then people 10 years from now tell that story.
*  Then other people tell the story that's told to them by the people that were there.
*  And then that gets a little twisted up like a game of telephone.
*  There's some of that too.
*  But then there's also uniformity.
*  There's uniformity to the descriptions of the movements of the ships and what these
*  things do and why they're interested in us and what they say.
*  It gets very weird.
*  It gets very weird to the point it's like, okay, if this is a mass illusion, if this
*  is a creation of the mind, like Carl Jung thought it was a creation of the mind, thought
*  it was some sort of an illusion that people conjure up in their mind, but it's just like
*  a common illusion.
*  It's just like it's there in the human psyche.
*  But then there's also like physical evidence of these things.
*  The physical evidence is when things get real weird because then like if you're telling
*  the truth, then this isn't totally an illusion.
*  Or maybe it's all those things.
*  Maybe it's total bullshit, lies, people with myths that make up myths about comets and
*  natural disasters and all kinds of other stuff.
*  And also interdimensional beings occasionally.
*  And then also things that have always been here occasionally.
*  And then also things for another planet occasionally.
*  I mean, all things are, it's not binary, right?
*  It's not either UFOs or bullshit or, you know, they're real.
*  100%.
*  It's like, it might be all those things, everything combined.
*  That's what I think a lot of people struggle with is it can be yes and yes.
*  Yeah.
*  It doesn't have to be yes and no.
*  Yeah, there could be a lot of things going on simultaneously and we can't be, we're
*  concentrating on one.
*  Some of them, I 100% am convinced are government drones that work on some incredibly sophisticated
*  propulsion system that probably doesn't have a person in it, but they probably can move
*  at fantastic speeds using some new novel propulsion system that they don't want to release to
*  the public.
*  And they probably don't know how to weaponize it yet.
*  So they're probably flying these things around at insane rates of speed.
*  They just can't put guns on them yet.
*  They can't figure out how to shoot people with them.
*  So they just fucking with them.
*  And then I think that's the reason why they keep getting sighted over these military spaces.
*  I think they try them out on the troops, just like they try out vaccines in the troops,
*  just like they try out burn pits.
*  They didn't test burn pits to make sure that people weren't going to get sick if they're
*  just breathing in toxic fumes from all the garbage from thousands of troops.
*  And they just did it.
*  I think they probably do the same thing with everything.
*  They just try shit out.
*  Yeah.
*  You hear something if it makes you think it.
*  Like when I watched Blair Witch Project.
*  Oh yeah.
*  I went into, it was dark when I got home.
*  It was light when I left and dark when I got home and I sprinted.
*  And all of a sudden you think you're seeing fucking people in the corner turned around
*  and you go, well, that can't be right.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  So once it's in your head, maybe you keep seeing it.
*  Definitely.
*  Sure.
*  Yeah.
*  Things in the woods, things you see in the woods.
*  That's probably what Bigfoot is.
*  Gets in your head.
*  I would think, yeah.
*  I'm looking for that fucking giant hairy man.
*  You see a tree kind of bend with the wind and you're like, what the fuck was that?
*  The thing about Bigfoot that's really interesting though is that Native Americans have a bunch
*  of different names for them.
*  There's a lot of names for them and they don't really have a lot of fake animals.
*  It's not a common trait in North American culture to, in any Native American culture
*  rather, to worship a bunch of different things or to talk about a bunch of different things
*  that aren't real.
*  Mostly they were talking about real things and then spirits.
*  Right?
*  They would talk about the different spirits of the sky and spirits of the sun and nature.
*  They're essentially talking about Mother Earth and God and Gaia and nature.
*  But they didn't have fake animals.
*  They did have Bigfoot.
*  Yeah.
*  There's a lot of Bigfoot that makes you go, I think at one point in time it was real.
*  I think at one point in time.
*  You think there were a bunch of them?
*  Yeah.
*  Well, they know there was a real thing.
*  Right?
*  There was a thing called Gigantopithecus and Gigantopithecus existed alongside human beings,
*  for sure, 100%.
*  And it was a bipedal hominid that was between 8 and 10 feet tall.
*  And it was like in the orangutan genus.
*  And this thing was discovered in the 19...
*  I want to say 1920s or 1930s in an apothecary shop in China.
*  An anthropologist was there and he found these massive primate teeth.
*  He instantly knew that they didn't belong to a gorilla.
*  They didn't belong to any known primate.
*  He's like, where did you get these?
*  And so they took them to the site and they started digging.
*  They found jaw bones that indicated that it was bipedal, something about the position
*  of the jaw that indicated this thing stood up on two legs, but by the size of it.
*  And then they found some other bones.
*  I think they have a very incomplete skeleton of these things, but they know that it was
*  a real animal and they know that it existed as recently as I believe it was 100,000 years
*  ago for sure.
*  But it could be way more current.
*  There's just no bones available.
*  So then you think that thing was real, stories got passed on and then people started seeing
*  it.
*  Okay.
*  Yeah, probably.
*  I could get behind that.
*  Yeah.
*  Also where it existed makes sense because if you think about the sightings, the sightings
*  are all in the Pacific Northwest, right?
*  The Pacific Northwest, if you follow that up past Alaska, which also has a lot of sightings,
*  then you go across the Bering Land Bridge, right?
*  In Asia was where this thing existed.
*  It kind of makes sense.
*  And then the more they find out about people in North America, they used to think that
*  all people came across the Bering Land Bridge.
*  They don't think that anymore.
*  There's so much evidence of people that were here 25,000 years ago.
*  There's footprints in the ground, like in mud that they've now carbon dated to more
*  than 20 plus thousand years old.
*  And so that's just what we have, right?
*  That's just the footprint that we got lucky and got from 20.
*  Who's to say that there's not people that were here 50,000 years ago, 100,000 years
*  ago?
*  So now you've got Bigfoot's real, right?
*  Because if those people really were alive and while those people were alive, so if you
*  go back, just go back 20,000, right?
*  If you go back 20,000 years ago, you're dealing with North American lions, which were the
*  biggest lions on earth, bigger than African lions.
*  You have saber-tooth tigers, you have giant sloths, you have all these enormous animals
*  that don't exist here anymore.
*  And this was all in North America alongside people.
*  It just kind of makes sense that you would have a Bigfoot.
*  You'd have a Gigantopithecus at the same, at least a few of them, especially up there.
*  Up there, where it's thickly dense forest.
*  Seems like if you're a big fucking plant-eating shithead, that's where you would live.
*  You would live there.
*  It just totally makes sense that they probably existed just like all these other things.
*  They don't find a whole lot, unless they're in the tar pits, they don't find a whole
*  lot of saber-tooth tigers.
*  They don't find a whole lot of things that existed before 25,000, 35,000 years ago, except
*  dinosaurs of course.
*  So who knows?
*  Oh man, I would love if the afterlife, you were just there for an hour, hooked you up
*  to a fucking cord, put everything that happened in there so you know, and then that's out,
*  lights out.
*  What would you do, if you had a chance to get that cord hooked in and see an hour of
*  any point in the history of the earth, what would you go to?
*  Oh well, I was saying, all of it, within an hour, it just like shoots you in the...
*  Like when Keanu Reeves knows kung fu and shit.
*  Yeah, that would be fun.
*  But if you could go and see one point in history, in the history of earth, where would you go?
*  I think I'd probably...
*  Oh, that's a great question.
*  I mean, this is gonna be lame, but I'd like to...
*  World War II.
*  That's not lame at all.
*  I'd like to see the genesis of it all and then throughout, and all the hidden conversations
*  that were taking place.
*  You remember the opening scene in Saving Private Ryan?
*  Oh my God, yeah.
*  That was the first opening scene, that was the first scene of a war that made me think
*  this is probably what it was like back then for those guys.
*  Yeah, I didn't say one word.
*  I went to a matinee and I didn't say another word until I woke up the next day.
*  Bro, it was so heavy.
*  Brutal.
*  It was so brutal and so graphic and so intense.
*  When that fucking guy doesn't kill the German at the end...
*  I mean, furious.
*  Like breathing with my shoulders.
*  It's a crazy fucking movie, man.
*  And only a tiny fraction of how crazy it really was.
*  I'm sure.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  The existence of being there and seeing it happen and being a part of it, fuck man.
*  And then they had to come back and they had to actually live lives.
*  And no coaching, right?
*  And you just come back with what they call shell shock back then.
*  I don't even want to see this, dude.
*  This is wild.
*  I don't want to see this.
*  Speaking of which, how about that president?
*  How about that Trump fella?
*  How crazy is this?
*  If there's ever been a real indication that we're in a simulation, it's like this season
*  of USA is the craziest season that's ever existed.
*  There's so many twists and turns, so many plots, so many villains, so many incompetent
*  bumbling fools that you're like, there's no way that lady's a heartbeat away from the
*  president.
*  There's no way.
*  There's no way someone is not telling her to stop saying that same thing over and over
*  again.
*  What can be unburdened by what has been?
*  Like she says it over and over and over again.
*  This isn't real.
*  This is writing.
*  Someone wrote this.
*  It seems like a script.
*  When a president that is giving a speech gets shot in the ear and then stands up and goes
*  full John Bender at the end of Breakfast Club.
*  Bro, he pumps his fist in the air.
*  That was a crazy issue.
*  And says fight, fight, fight.
*  And when the fucking guy who's the photographer is a wizard, that guy who got that photograph,
*  find out his name because this guy's a award-winning photographer.
*  With the flag above it?
*  Yes.
*  And the angle that he got it, like where he was standing when he took the photo, it's
*  one of the most iconic photos of all time.
*  He had a GoPro on while he was doing it.
*  Wow.
*  So you can watch the moving position of take it.
*  Wow.
*  That's nuts, man.
*  That's nuts.
*  So you can see as the bullets start flying, this fucking dude doesn't even duck.
*  He's still got his camera out.
*  He's right behind Trump and he's just got his camera out.
*  That is so gangster.
*  I mean, you want to talk about getting a shot no matter what?
*  He's running around.
*  There could be bullets flying his way.
*  I would think you're holding up something black in your hand that's pointed at the president.
*  You fucking should get shot.
*  I mean, the Trump story is right out of a movie and I'm hoping it's not a Stephen King
*  movie.
*  It came out while we've been recording.
*  Secret Service ramped up security after receiving intel of Iranian plot to assassinate Trump.
*  No known connection to shooting.
*  Oh, they ramped that up and so they ignored the roof 150 yards away.
*  Yeah.
*  There's so many things where you just go, what the fuck?
*  What the fuck, dude?
*  All of it.
*  All of it.
*  And there's so much of it that seems fake, like the female Secret Service agent that
*  can't holster her weapon.
*  Have you seen this?
*  She's like moving around all erratically and she tries to holster her weapon.
*  She can't get it in there and she can't figure out how to put it in there.
*  And she stops for a minute and she tries back to do it again.
*  It looks so fake.
*  Is she an actress?
*  No, it looks like an actress.
*  It looks like if you were going to have a bumbling person in a movie, like almost like
*  a comedy of errors or a Coen Brothers movie about an assassination attempt on the president.
*  You have this lady, like here, watch, watch what her gun.
*  Look, look, she gets her gun out.
*  She tried to put it in there.
*  She couldn't do it.
*  And she's thinking about putting it back in there.
*  She finally gets it in there.
*  Look at her fumbling around.
*  The whole thing is crazy.
*  There are erratic movements.
*  No one knows exactly what to do.
*  It seems fake.
*  That's an audition I could nail.
*  It seems like, okay, now you're panicking.
*  You don't know what the fuck is going on.
*  You really shouldn't be here.
*  Go.
*  You're like, where did I put my gun?
*  You want Secret Service cool, calm, collected, high ready with the gun, scanning the area,
*  looking left and right.
*  You want them, like, swift, decisive movements.
*  You don't want to see any of this fucking squirrely trying to put the gun back in.
*  It seems fake.
*  When you see the Reagan shot, it is just a bunch of people moving as one.
*  They dive on them.
*  Yeah, bang, dive on them.
*  This seemed, it almost seems like as this simulation gets further and further along,
*  it gets more and more insane.
*  Yeah, look at this.
*  Yeah, they dive.
*  Immediately, they got them.
*  Immediately.
*  They get his gun immediately.
*  And Reagan survives.
*  Yeah.
*  Which is also crazy.
*  The Trump one is just so nuts too.
*  Like, if he turns his head at the last second and the bullet grazes his ears, if he didn't,
*  it hits the back of his head and he's dead.
*  And then we fall into chaos and who knows what the fuck happens.
*  Big chaos.
*  And then people think that the Biden administration had Trump killed.
*  And then there's these questions.
*  How the fuck does this 20-year-old kid climb on that roof 150 yards away and no one sees him?
*  Well, that one guy was pointing at him the whole time.
*  He's like pointing to, he's like, he's right there.
*  And they're yelling, he's got a gun.
*  There's a guy in the prone position on a roof 150 yards away from the former president.
*  The whole thing's nuts.
*  The whole thing stinks of either incompetence or design or we're in a matrix.
*  This is a fucking fake movie.
*  It seems like almost, to watch this, the most bombastic and manly of presidents,
*  for lack of a better term, to see him with these two female bumbling secret service agents,
*  especially the one,
*  to see that, to see everything happen the way it is, to see that they knew this guy was on the roof,
*  to hear that that guy had pointed his rifle before that at a cop.
*  So the cop engaged him, he pointed the rod bill and the cop ran away.
*  The guy climbed the roof with a ladder.
*  You can see the ladder.
*  The whole thing is bananas.
*  He's 20 years old.
*  And then you find out he was in a Black Rock commercial.
*  You're like, is this the Black Mirror?
*  Like, tell me what's going on.
*  Is this real?
*  Is this real?
*  And then Trump goes golfing with a bandage on his ear the next day?
*  And then the putt, when he made the putt, did you hear his quote?
*  No.
*  He said, that's the difference between me and the shooter.
*  I don't miss.
*  This isn't a real person.
*  And then you have people flooding from the left being like, all right, that's a good quote.
*  I'll do this.
*  There's people that are like, okay, he won.
*  They've just given in.
*  They're not even going to try to run anybody other than Biden now.
*  They were trying to get Biden out.
*  And now I think they've abandoned that.
*  I wonder if they're doing the old, like, you know, train the boxer as a Southpaw?
*  I read that golf story too.
*  This is not the first time.
*  There's a lot of golf accounts that put out fake shit.
*  Oh.
*  Jamie, stop ruining our dreams.
*  I just want to add-
*  You son of a bitch.
*  That was not seemingly real.
*  Jamie plays a lot of golf and he gets very touchy when it comes to golf.
*  And he calls bullshit.
*  That's fair.
*  It just came from a Reddit post that people screenshot.
*  There was no pictures, no nothing else.
*  Oh, well, touche, young troll.
*  Touche.
*  It happens a lot.
*  You got your fucking story mentioned on the podcast.
*  That's me.
*  You son of a bitch.
*  You can get me very easily.
*  I did read that too.
*  The whole thing is so wild.
*  There's video of the kid in the Black Rock commercial and you're like, what?
*  And there's the video of a kid, like, they're saying he's getting bullied in high school,
*  but it doesn't seem like he's being bullied.
*  It seems like everyone's having fun because he's talking about how he has a 10-inch penis
*  and they're just filming each other.
*  It looks like they're having fun.
*  And you're looking like, how is it?
*  Two years later, this guy tries to kill Trump?
*  Like, what happened?
*  And then you find out he was a registered Republican?
*  Like, what?
*  You know high school, those 10-inch dick guys always getting bullied.
*  Always getting bullied.
*  He was saying it funny.
*  It was like he's trying to be funny.
*  You know?
*  Yeah, I got a 10-inch penis.
*  I mean, he wasn't saying, like, I definitely have a 10-inch dick.
*  It was like he's, it didn't seem like he was being bullied.
*  I mean, obviously I saw one clip, who knows what the fuck the full context of it is, but.
*  Right.
*  20?
*  20 years old?
*  And he's got this idea and he pulls it off?
*  He actually gets a shot off and nicks him?
*  And then they kill him?
*  Like, you've seen this 20-year-old kid, his life is over.
*  Like, somehow or another he talked himself into trying to assassinate the president as a lone gunman in Pennsylvania,
*  got on top of a roof, either through sheer incompetence or for some other reason,
*  he actually gets a shot off and the president just moves his head at the right time?
*  Like, the whole thing is, if it was in a movie I'd be like, shut the fuck up.
*  That'll make you believe in God.
*  That's like God's up there when he's going like, I don't want to talk to this guy yet.
*  He's a lot.
*  I don't want him up here yet.
*  I don't want him yet.
*  I'm the greatest angel.
*  Or maybe he wants him here to expose how crazy our political system really is.
*  Because the only way we find out how coordinated everything is,
*  whether you're a Trump fan or not, even if you hate Trump, put that aside for a second,
*  and just look at how much coordination there is in the media to go after him.
*  And it exposes like this thing where you have to step back and go, wait a minute, hold on a second.
*  What's really going on?
*  Whether you hate that guy or not, hate him, hate him.
*  Think he's a crook.
*  Hate him.
*  Think he's a liar.
*  Hate him.
*  Don't you think it's weird that they're all in lockstep with the way they talk about him,
*  even with things that aren't true?
*  Like, especially the Russia collusion hoax that they all talked about for years and years,
*  I thought it was real.
*  I thought like he colluded with Russia and that was like the crazy thing about him winning the presidency.
*  Oh my God, he worked with Russia.
*  Maybe Russia has something on him.
*  You kept hearing about it, right?
*  That was just bullshit.
*  And they went through that for years and years and then you start going, okay, what else is coordinated
*  where everybody is saying, like how about the Nord Stream pipeline?
*  You know, Seymour Hersh says, we blew it up.
*  Like esteemed journalists is like, no matter what they say, I am telling you, this was our doing.
*  We blew this up.
*  This wasn't some other country.
*  This wasn't Russia.
*  They wouldn't blow up their own pipeline.
*  We blew it up.
*  And every newspaper is like, this is bullshit.
*  This was impossible.
*  It could not happen.
*  This was Russian disinformation.
*  Russian disinformation.
*  You hear it about like every story.
*  It's like so hard to understand.
*  What is the motivation to getting these stories out?
*  Are these narratives created by the real government that runs everything and then like tells the news organizations
*  that are in business with them what to say and what to do?
*  That's where it gets spooky.
*  You get like you're voting for a guy who isn't doing much when he gets there.
*  I mean, there's a lot of people around that are making these things.
*  And I will tell you, I still believe some of the Russian shit because you heard me fucking misquote the golf thing.
*  I mean, I still believe a lot of shit I hear.
*  Oh, I do all the time.
*  They get me all the time.
*  There's so many stories that I'm sure bullshit that I've parroted.
*  But if Trump if Trump wouldn't play the political game, if he wouldn't put the people on the Supreme Court,
*  I know it's his job when he's in there.
*  But if he wouldn't do any of that shit, he's definitely the come out on stage and be like waving papers.
*  You guys are going to fucking believe this.
*  Yeah.
*  And tell everybody everything.
*  He is if he wasn't doing that other stuff.
*  But the only way he gets any support is if he does that other stuff too.
*  Like you got to understand about Trump.
*  He was a life long Democrat.
*  Yeah.
*  Lifelong.
*  Which is so weird.
*  Wasn't the when he was starting to run for president, wasn't he still like wasn't he when he started talking about it?
*  I believe so.
*  I believe so.
*  Well, he had a very close relationship to the Clintons to the point where he paid them to come to his wedding or his daughter's wedding or one of those things.
*  Like you would pay them and they would come to weddings and events and he would go to events.
*  You know, that was like the famous thing that was at the White House Correspondents Center.
*  You remember that the White House press correspondence dinner was always supposed to be this thing where comedians would do it.
*  And they were like Michelle Wolf did it one year and crushed it.
*  She crushed it so hard.
*  And they would go up and they would.
*  Trump was, by the way, the first guy to not do it.
*  Like, you know, make fun of me.
*  Just kind of a pussy move.
*  But every other president got roasted.
*  And one time during the White House press correspondence thing, Obama went on stage and he roasted Trump.
*  And one of the lines he said to Trump, he said, I'm one thing that you'll never be, which is the president of the United States.
*  Because this is when Trump was trying to claim that Obama's from Kenya.
*  Remember that?
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah.
*  The birther stuff, which is wild.
*  That stuff was wild.
*  He was like saying he knows for sure that Obama came from Kenya.
*  And then there's people that were like examining photo shops of the birth certificate.
*  It was a crazy conspiracy.
*  And that was, you know, he was roasting Trump in the audience.
*  And you could see Trump in his head going, OK, I'm going to fucking run now.
*  Like that might have been the thing that got him to run.
*  Like legitimately.
*  That's how crazy that guy is.
*  That one moment where Obama was talking shit to him might be the reason why Trump was like, I'll fucking show you.
*  Because you do not want that fucking guy on your bad side.
*  Well, this is the first time I've ever meant this.
*  But thanks, Obama.
*  Whoops.
*  What a crazy turn of again.
*  Seems like it's written.
*  Seems like a script.
*  Seems like a simulation.
*  That shit really does.
*  It really does.
*  So much of it really does.
*  So much of life really feels like a simulation.
*  And the thing about this Trump stuff and just all of the stuff that's happening with social media and AI.
*  The guy who's at the helm of one of the biggest social media networks in the world is Elon Musk.
*  Elon Musk said that the odds of us not being in the simulation are in the billions.
*  He believes wholeheartedly that we're in a simulation.
*  See if you can find him saying that because it's such a nutty quote.
*  Because when someone says that, you go, oh, yeah, maybe.
*  But when Elon Musk says that and he says it definitively, he says it like with pure confidence.
*  And he's no hyperbole.
*  He's just stating it like this is something I've analyzed.
*  This is something I've thought about for a long time.
*  He's also made that cyber truck.
*  Do you like it or not?
*  I just it's a it looks like you can't be penetrated with a bullet.
*  You can't be penetrated with a bullet and they're fun to drive.
*  You ever driven one?
*  I've driven a Tesla normal, but this is different.
*  Same thing.
*  It defies time.
*  Doesn't make sense.
*  It goes so fast for something that's so big.
*  And it's bulletproof.
*  It's like it's crazy.
*  But it's the kind of thing that you would make if you're that guy.
*  Like, let's make a fucking steel truck that's bulletproof.
*  Simulation.
*  Here it is.
*  Do you entertain that?
*  Well, the argument for the simulation, I think, is quite strong.
*  Because if you assume any improvements at all over time, any improvement,
*  one percent point one percent, just extend the time frame, make it a thousand years,
*  a million years.
*  The universe is thirteen point eight billion years old.
*  What civilization if you counted if you're very generous civilization is maybe seven or eight thousand years old.
*  If you counted from the first writing, this is nothing.
*  This is nothing.
*  So if you assume any rate of improvement at all, then games will be indistinguishable from reality.
*  Or civilization will end.
*  One of those two things will occur.
*  Therefore, we are most likely in a simulation.
*  So this is on my podcast.
*  He said that.
*  But then there was another interview where he was being questioned.
*  Like, what are the odds?
*  And he said the odds of us not being in a simulation are in the billions.
*  He firmly believes it.
*  But it might be what the universe is, which we're talking about how the universe is stranger.
*  I think the universe is stranger than we think it is.
*  That might be why.
*  It might be because it's not totally real or nothing is totally real.
*  The idea of totally real is not real.
*  Our concept of things being real is...
*  Even if you look at quantum physics, which I'm definitely going to butcher,
*  there's the observer effect.
*  There's this thing that they do where they look at things on a quantum level
*  and when you're looking at them and measuring them, they have a different reaction.
*  There's something that's going on where we're interacting with matter.
*  Where it doesn't make any sense.
*  If you get down to the lowest levels of understandable reality,
*  you get into subatomic particles.
*  And then you have spooky action at a distance where these things are somehow or another.
*  They're connected in vast spaces, but they interact with each other instantaneously.
*  And if you take photons, and photons are quantumly entangled,
*  they figured out how to take some sort of a super sophisticated image of photons that are quantum entangled.
*  They look like a yin and a yang. Like, exactly.
*  It's the wildest thing.
*  You see it and you're like, what the fu-
*  You see it? Jamie will find it.
*  Is it that golden ratio thing?
*  The golden ratio is different.
*  The golden ratio is like...
*  There's things like the Fibonacci sequence, there's mathematical ratios that exist in all of nature.
*  This is quantum entanglement.
*  This is like two photons that are quantumly entangled
*  and when they get this super sophisticated imaging of this thing,
*  it looks like a yin and yang. Like, exactly.
*  That's pretty sweet.
*  Jamie will find it.
*  So do we all- you think we all have a different simulation?
*  Like, this is what I'm seeing, but in someone else's simulation, I'm very poor, I'm living somewhere else, I'm doing this?
*  Probably all things are happening simultaneously.
*  And you're just in this one right now.
*  And I'm not even sure if you're in the same one that you were in yesterday.
*  That's where it gets weird.
*  I think when you go to bed, like, who the fuck knows what happens?
*  You're closing your eyes and disappearing.
*  Who is to say that you are coming back in the exact same place?
*  You might have been born today.
*  Your whole life, everything that exists, might have been a creation that did not exist 12 hours ago.
*  You might have woken up.
*  Here it is.
*  Look at that.
*  That is pretty insane.
*  Fucking insane.
*  It looks exactly like a yin and yang.
*  Duality and harmony.
*  That's the Chinese symbol for duality and harmony, and that is literally quantum entangled photons.
*  Like, there are so many things like that in sacred geometry.
*  And when they're looking at all of this, like, the smallest things they can measure, you're getting to magic.
*  Subatomic particles are fucking magic.
*  What are they doing?
*  They're in a superposition?
*  What the fuck does that mean?
*  Well, they're moving and they're still at the same time.
*  Like, what are you even saying?
*  What does that mean?
*  They blink in and out of existence.
*  They go away.
*  They come back.
*  They move around.
*  You don't know where the fuck they went.
*  Like, what is this?
*  It's magic.
*  It's basically something that can't exist anywhere else other than in the quantum state.
*  But that's the base of everything.
*  Like, everything you touch is nothing.
*  There's nothing there.
*  It's mostly nothing.
*  And yet it's oak tables.
*  I...
*  We might be misunderstanding what happened here a little.
*  How so?
*  We went over that with...
*  Who do we go over that with?
*  I know, but it says that they...
*  I'm rereading it.
*  We went over it with Eric Weinstein, didn't we?
*  It says so that yin-yang was programmed into it.
*  Recovering enough information to recreate a yin-yang symbol programmed into the photon generating apparatus.
*  Applying tricks of holography, the researchers were able to read positional information into interference of two separated light waves recovering enough information to recreate a yin-yang symbol programmed into the photon generating apparatus.
*  Yeah, but I don't think they're saying they programmed that into it.
*  If you see what they're saying, the researchers were able to read positional information in the interference of two separated light waves recovering enough information.
*  Recovering enough information to recreate a yin-yang symbol programmed into the photon generating apparatus.
*  I think they're saying that they're recreating this symbol based on what's happening.
*  I don't think they're saying they programmed it to look like that.
*  My guess is that they're doing that so that they were looking...
*  So they knew what they were looking for.
*  It says as simple as the yin-yang looks in this single static image represents a significant leap in measuring numerous quantum states in a short time.
*  Don't you think that Eric Weinstein would have picked up on that if that's what it was saying?
*  I'm...
*  Go back to what it just said there because I wanted to read the next...
*  Where were you?
*  Down here.
*  No, no, a little lower.
*  This method is exponentially faster than previous techniques requiring only minutes or seconds instead of days.
*  What?
*  Importantly, the detection time is not influenced by the symmetry's complexity.
*  A solution to the long-standing scalability challenge in projective tomography.
*  Okay, we're too dumb.
*  It looks like they were looking at them and then figured out how to map them by what they were looking at and then could program it, right?
*  Isn't quantum all sorts of directions, not just x, y?
*  It's a flat C image, you know, and it's like all the dimensions.
*  So it's in super space and up and down and left and right.
*  Well, how much can they see of a photon, right?
*  Like, what is a...
*  Okay, let's look at this.
*  Give me an image, Google image of a photon.
*  Let's see what the fuck they can see.
*  I mean, all this stuff is...
*  How about neutrinos?
*  They're passing through the Earth, like, passing through us right now from space.
*  What?
*  Like, what is this?
*  Is that what it looks like?
*  What is that left shapes are photons?
*  Bro, look at that.
*  Hologram of a single photon.
*  What?
*  Just that alone.
*  Okay, if that is the...
*  That's the fucking...
*  That's at the bottom.
*  You keep looking at the ingredients.
*  Individual points in a picture traditional photography merely register light intensity.
*  The interference phenomena also registers the phase of the light waves in traditional holography.
*  A well-described undisturbed reference wave is superimposed with another wave of the same wavelength reflected off a three-dimensional object when a hologram is generated.
*  Interference occurs as a result of the phase variations between the two waves resulting in a complicated pattern of lines.
*  That's a lot of words.
*  Yeah, I don't know what the fuck I just said.
*  That's the problem.
*  We're too dumb.
*  We're too uneducated to really understand what the fuck they're saying, but...
*  That's why they can trick you.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, man.
*  It's all about Jesus.
*  Jesus is the base of it all.
*  There's a lot of people that believe that.
*  Maybe in their world.
*  Maybe if you...
*  Here's where it gets really screwy.
*  Right.
*  Maybe if you believe in Jesus, it's real.
*  Like maybe that's what religion is really all about.
*  Maybe the thing is not, oh, I can prove that there's no God.
*  Maybe if you believe there's a God, there's a God.
*  Like it might...
*  That's how weird the simulation might be.
*  Well, I think it's a brilliant move because if you believe there's a God, you're never going to know you're wrong.
*  Right.
*  Because it's like ghost to dark.
*  Also, Jordan Peterson, he has this very interesting perspective on this.
*  He says, I won't tell you whether or not I believe in a God, but I act as if God is real.
*  And if you act as if God is real, you will have a better life.
*  Which is almost like that thing of the muse, right?
*  Like is the muse a real thing that gives you ideas?
*  I don't know, but I do know that if I sit in front of my computer on a regular basis and I dedicate myself to writing, ideas come to me.
*  Yeah.
*  And I don't know if that's just like, I don't know if creativity is like endurance.
*  I don't know if it's like a physical quality that you possess because of work.
*  I don't know.
*  To me, God is like year round Santa.
*  It's like go to sleep, be nice.
*  He's keeping the list.
*  Yeah, that God, that kind of God.
*  But what about the universe as God?
*  There's some creative force that absolutely exists and it's called the universe.
*  It literally makes all the stars.
*  It literally makes black holes.
*  It literally makes carbon based life forms in Goldilocks zones on planets like ours.
*  It makes it.
*  The universe made us.
*  So if you wanted to find evidence of a God, the universe is God.
*  It makes sense that it would be God.
*  It is everything.
*  We wanted to be a person who wanted to be like a guy with rules.
*  Right.
*  But there are some kind of rules, right?
*  As human beings, when we interact with each other incorrectly, we feel bad.
*  When we interact with each other correctly, we get things done together.
*  We spread love.
*  We spread joy.
*  We spread happiness.
*  And that's a lot of the tenants of religion are preaching that.
*  So it's almost like there's some guidelines that these people who had figured some whisper of what God is out and they wrote it down on these animal skins and they locked them up in a fucking clay pot and cumeron.
*  They found them and deciphered them.
*  And that's what it is.
*  Right. That's what Dead Sea Scrolls are.
*  I whatever that is, is then literally interpreted and it's interpreted by zealots.
*  And it's interpreted by people that use it to control people's behavior.
*  It's interpreted in a manner that controls large populations and enforces people to be subjugated.
*  Like that is the whole reason why the revolution when Martin Luther created a phonetic version of the Bible and others were doing at the same time as well or similar time periods, people were freaking out because now the Bible was available to people that didn't read Latin.
*  So now the Bible is available in German and the people and then guys like Martin Luther were saying interpret the Bible as you will.
*  And the priest like, No, you fucking don't.
*  We'll fucking kill you, dude.
*  They're like, you're ruining our whole gig because their whole gig was they were the power.
*  They were the purveyors of control.
*  The fucking pope ran the biggest army in the world at one point in time.
*  The pope was running Europe.
*  Well, Martin Luther, he got caught in a storm and then prayed to God.
*  He goes, If you get me out of this, I'll do this.
*  I'll start Lutheranism.
*  And that's the ultimate I'll quit drinking.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  It's like, I promise if you make me stop puking.
*  Wow.
*  So that's how I mean.
*  Yeah, man, I think at the base of it all, there's a story.
*  There's something that happened.
*  There's too many similarities.
*  And even I always say this.
*  Sorry if you heard it.
*  But the people that like when you in the Bible in the beginning, there was like, what the fuck is the Big Bang?
*  That is the Big Bang.
*  That is the Big Bang.
*  So maybe they kind of understood some things, but they talked about it.
*  It was a oral tradition for a thousand years before it was even written down.
*  Some of these stories and some of these stories have origins where they're super similar in other religions, super similar catastrophe tales, super similar.
*  Like there's Noah's Ark, which is real similar to the Epic of Gilgamesh, which is really like Thor is real similar to Jesus.
*  It's like a lot of like wheels.
*  Like what really happened?
*  And if it's the beginning and it's light, maybe it's maybe it's birth.
*  Maybe it's the beginning of somebody's life.
*  Could be that too.
*  Sure.
*  Could be that too.
*  But I find myself at the end of a drive like I used to have to drive three hours to the airport back and forth for 17 years.
*  Jesus.
*  And I'd get home at dusk and deer are everywhere.
*  And I just go, no, thank you.
*  I don't believe in God, but I just go, no, thank you.
*  Like I don't want to hit one.
*  And then I get home and I would.
*  I'd go, ah, universe.
*  Thank you.
*  I mean, it's so there's got to be something like if you're nice to somebody, niceness comes back.
*  If you're a dick in traffic, it almost seems like all the shitty drivers at once, their fucking beeper goes off and they hit the road.
*  But if you're decent in traffic, seems to open up a little bit for me anyways.
*  That's what I've known depending on where you live.
*  You live in L.A. You're fucked.
*  No matter what you're.
*  Yeah.
*  I think there's something to that.
*  But then there's also babies that get killed in drive bys.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  That's where that's where it gets real confusing.
*  So I don't think it's I don't think it's necessary.
*  I don't think it necessarily really makes sense.
*  I think it kind of makes sense.
*  And then it doesn't.
*  I just like the UFO thing and just like everything about human beings.
*  I think there's a lot going on simultaneously.
*  That's why I want that hour long plug in.
*  I don't want I don't want to turn a life.
*  You know how long that is?
*  I mean, come on.
*  I just want you might have it no matter what.
*  I just want to know.
*  And then that's if you're living a new life every time you wake up, you might get eternal life whether you like it or not.
*  That's what some people believe.
*  They believe that there's some religions that believe you will do this life over and over and over again until you get it right.
*  Hmm.
*  Well, I've got some work to do.
*  We all do.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm going to get a couple of extra.
*  But guess what?
*  If you get it all right, you're not going to get stand up comedy.
*  You know, that's the problem.
*  We are almost dooming ourselves to repeat over and over and over again because to do our job correctly, you have to step out of line and you got to crack a few eggs to make an omelet.
*  Yeah, it's a comedy is is pretty.
*  Who's the Jeff Dunham?
*  You remember him?
*  Yeah, sure.
*  So I was opening for him in Miami and I just remember this because this is the my ultimate egg cracking.
*  The crowd hated me for 30 minutes.
*  And so at the end of it all, I took my shoe off and I put my sock on my hand and I go, is this what you guys wanted?
*  And I started doing that fucking.
*  And then Dunham comes back and he goes, this isn't going to work this week.
*  And I was like, I didn't think so.
*  I'm sorry, but fuck.
*  I was just so pissed.
*  Oh, that's funny.
*  That's funny.
*  You mocked the people that wanted the puppet.
*  They were not through.
*  That happens, though, if you bring somebody on the road, you know, and you're a big act like a puppet act, like a very specific kind of act like they're like, they don't hear like your observations about your relationship.
*  Shut up.
*  I used to open for John Panet and I was in really good shape and people fucking hate it.
*  I mean, they used to have to pull seats out of his rooms.
*  Like if it was a three eighty cap, they'd have to bring it down to three fifty to make room for him to move through the aisle.
*  Well, for his fans.
*  Oh, God.
*  Because they would bring him full cheesecakes from the Cheesecake Factory.
*  Oh, my God.
*  Yeah, they were killing him.
*  He was funny, man.
*  When I started in 1988, he was an established professional.
*  And I remember I saw him one night at Nick's Comedy Stop and he was fucking killing.
*  Yeah.
*  He had this bit about going to a Chinese buffet.
*  You know that bit?
*  You've been here for four hours.
*  Kicking him out.
*  Such a good bit.
*  And he would crush.
*  He was one of those guys, too, that he had the advantage of looking funny because he was such a round, big, smiley, jolly fat guy that like you smiled when you saw him like this guy's going to be funny.
*  He's the most generous guy I ever met.
*  Really?
*  I had two kids living in Minnesota and he goes, I like you.
*  So I'm going to match what the club pays you.
*  And I'm going to pay for part of your plane ticket.
*  And I don't think I would have been able to keep doing comedy without him.
*  Oh, that's very sweet.
*  And now if you look up that Chinese bit, they've cut.
*  You know how for clips you have to cut laughter?
*  He just looks really racist because they've cut all the laughter out.
*  Oh, no.
*  So it's just him like doing the accent.
*  Why did they cut the laughter out?
*  I think to make it the right time or something.
*  I don't know.
*  But it's brutal.
*  Don't do that.
*  It's fucking brutal.
*  Don't do that.
*  Oh, no.
*  Because that bit used to kill.
*  Oh, my God, it did kill.
*  Yeah, I saw him do that bit in Boston.
*  I was like, oh, my God, he's a monster.
*  And when you see something like that when you are 21, you'd be doing comedy for four months.
*  You're like, what?
*  Yeah.
*  But there were so many guys like that in Boston at that time that were just murderous.
*  They were so fast paced and their punch lines would be bang, bang, bang.
*  They had so much energy on stage.
*  Yeah.
*  It was a crazy time.
*  Like you're saying you have to in Boston because people don't want that downtime.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, I think that's the case with all cold environments.
*  Like I said, New York was a lot like that.
*  Places where people are fucking dealing with some shit.
*  They don't have time for your nonsense.
*  You know, you can't be out there.
*  But although you can do a lot of that now in New York, you get away with a lot of nonsense in the right rooms.
*  Yeah, I think so.
*  They want nonsense.
*  They want you to sit and pontificate for a minute before you actually say something else.
*  Yeah.
*  They want you to have put social justice ahead of your laughter.
*  I have to do that?
*  What if I just tell jokes?
*  What if I just say things I think are funny?
*  Is that OK too?
*  Do I have to mean what I'm saying?
*  Yeah.
*  Instead, how about don't laugh when you don't think it's funny?
*  Yeah.
*  Don't throw a fit.
*  Just don't laugh.
*  And I'll know.
*  And then laugh when it is.
*  Some guys have to find their audience.
*  And then once they find their audience, then the people go for them for that kind of comedy.
*  Like that was the case with Mitch Hedberg.
*  That's the case right now with William Montgomery.
*  Like William Montgomery, I don't know if you know him.
*  Oh, can I tell you?
*  Yeah.
*  I did kill Tony last night for the first time.
*  I didn't know anything about this guy.
*  And he just fucking screamed in my face.
*  I thought he was going to punch me in the face.
*  So I'm sitting there watching this guy and I'm just like, there's something funny about this guy.
*  There's cameras on me.
*  What happens if he hits me?
*  I'm just going to have to sit here.
*  So you thought he was a real maniac?
*  Oh, I thought he was insane.
*  Oh, he's so funny.
*  When you see him do stand up, you get it.
*  Like when you see, and then when people become a fan of his, because he's got a huge following now because he killed Tony.
*  And then when you go see him, like the Black Keys came and they did my podcast and they were going to come to the club afterwards.
*  They said, dude, can William Montgomery come?
*  Is he going to be on stage?
*  I go, I'll make sure he's there.
*  I call him up.
*  So he wasn't even scheduled to be on the show.
*  I called him.
*  William, Black Keys want to see you.
*  So he went up there with like full confidence in front of a crowd who knew who he was and he fucking murders.
*  But I used to see him years ago and people just didn't know what to make of him.
*  He was just get starting out and he was so crazy.
*  He seemed so unhinged.
*  But then off stage like super nice guy.
*  Like, hey, man.
*  Yeah.
*  Did you meet him off stage?
*  Yeah, he came over.
*  Nice to meet you.
*  And I was like, are you fucking with me right now?
*  Because I go, you're screaming at me in there.
*  And now you're like the nicest person.
*  Just sweetheart.
*  Super, super, super nice guy.
*  Yeah, he seemed to be nice.
*  But that's the kind of guy that has to find his audience.
*  Yeah.
*  And you mentioned Hedberg.
*  I mean, you watched the old clips.
*  He used to eat shit, man.
*  He ate shit a lot.
*  There was a famous story about a club that booked him and the guy before him was like this really high energy guy.
*  I think the guy actually did like a backflip on stage, like something nutty, like to close his set out and like super high energy.
*  That was the middle act.
*  And it was like a lot of hack bullshit.
*  And then Hedberg went on after him.
*  It was bombing.
*  And so he got fucked over like they gave him the middle pay, even though he's headlining and they made the other guy headline.
*  And he's like, I got a contract.
*  They're like, fuck you.
*  You bombed.
*  It was like a big it was like a war with other comedians.
*  Stan Hope chimed in.
*  It was like a lot of shit going on.
*  But that was a guy that once he found once people knew who they would go to see him and he would murder.
*  Yeah.
*  All non sequiturs, which always killed me.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like I was like, how does he even remember all of them?
*  No shit.
*  I started in many.
*  I thought heroin.
*  Yeah.
*  It's fucking really good.
*  You remember everything.
*  I started in Minneapolis, went to Grand Forks, North Dakota to do audition for this house, MC spot and Hedberg.
*  It was right after he did Montreal and got his big deal.
*  So I got to watch him the first time he's coming off that deal confident in his prime.
*  I mean, nobody killed harder.
*  He was so good.
*  But he was also so unique and you wanted to see that kind of comedy from him.
*  You know, he wanted to he put you into this mindset like someone asked me, I wanted a frozen banana.
*  I said no, but I want a regular banana later.
*  So yes.
*  Yeah.
*  It was just such a weird cadence.
*  Just such a silly, unique cadence.
*  And how to find his audience.
*  Yeah.
*  And you knew when he was in town a couple of weeks before you because all the young guys in that town would be laughing like him.
*  Talking like him a little.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  He's David tells the worst with that.
*  Yeah.
*  People people start talking like a towel.
*  It becomes so contagious because he's so good and he's so infectious.
*  Like it's like whatever he's doing is like you're infected with his his cadences, his timing, especially when you're young.
*  Yes.
*  Starting out, Hedberg got so famous and I was so young and impressionable that we were out eating one time.
*  And he has a joke about you know what my friend said, you know what I like mashed potatoes.
*  Come on, man.
*  You got to give me time to guess.
*  That's a joke.
*  And I was the mashed potatoes guy and I used it as a fucking intro because everybody knew who Hedberg was.
*  So when I didn't have any credits, I was like, hey, I'm part of his act.
*  Oh, that's hilarious.
*  That's hilarious.
*  That's you.
*  That's funny.
*  Yeah.
*  He's another one we lost.
*  Yep.
*  That's been a long time, too.
*  Doesn't even seem like it.
*  That's the one thing about losing comics is you can you can see him still online and watch him and all this shit.
*  So they're kind of there forever.
*  I see Norm clips every day.
*  Yeah.
*  Every day.
*  Some new funny Norm clip.
*  Yeah.
*  I just saw a Norm clip when he was on SNL about Madonna having a baby and he goes, Madonna just had a baby seven pounds six ounces, which makes it the fourth largest object to pass through her vagina.
*  He was just fucking fearless, man.
*  Yeah.
*  He was a wild fella.
*  He was a wild fella.
*  Such a fun guy.
*  Yeah.
*  And the way he died is pretty gangster.
*  Had cancer.
*  Didn't tell anybody.
*  Yeah.
*  Went up to Canada to die.
*  So yeah.
*  Going into the woods.
*  Didn't tell anybody.
*  It was just crazy.
*  Even his best friends.
*  Like I'm friends with his literal best friend.
*  Didn't know.
*  Didn't know until it was over.
*  Yeah.
*  They were making plans.
*  Making plans to do stuff.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, I suppose he didn't know how long probably.
*  I guess.
*  Yeah.
*  I believe he had pancreatic cancer, which is a really, really rough one.
*  Is that the one he had?
*  I have no idea.
*  It kills a lot of people.
*  I think they just found something with a protein that causes it.
*  So they're talking like it's the big killer.
*  And so they're talking maybe they figured one of them out.
*  Yeah, I saw that.
*  I hope that's true.
*  Leukemia.
*  Oh, it was Hicks.
*  Hicks had pancreatic cancer.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a rough one.
*  Yeah.
*  He's another one.
*  Imagine if that guy was still alive.
*  I mean, he died.
*  He was like 35.
*  Something like that.
*  He was young.
*  Yeah.
*  And he had such a body of work.
*  I don't even think he was 35.
*  And you go see.
*  I think now I'm thinking about it.
*  I think Hicks was like 32 or 33 when he died.
*  That's unbelievable.
*  I think about what I was doing when I was 32.
*  32.
*  God.
*  Nuts.
*  Nuts.
*  And it changed everybody's comedy.
*  Everybody's like, Jesus.
*  I wanted to be the guy that died.
*  I wanted to be the guy that died.
*  I wanted to be the guy that died.
*  I wanted to be like Hicks.
*  I wanted to be like Hicks.
*  So much so that the back green room of the punch line in Atlanta, Georgia, somebody wrote
*  in the green room, quit trying to be Hicks.
*  It's like every time I'd go there, they're like, yes.
*  So many people wanted to be like him.
*  Even Richard Jennings said that to me.
*  He saw him and he said, every time I see him, I'm like, gosh, you're doing more stuff like
*  that.
*  Like, it was so profound for the time.
*  I like to have a guy talking like that, the way he's explaining things as well as making
*  them funny.
*  They're so different.
*  But if you're Richard Jennings and you want to be in movies, being Bill Hicks isn't the
*  way to get there.
*  Nah.
*  You know, it's just that thing that hits you when you watch someone.
*  You're like, fuck.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, that feeling of, God, I want to be doing that kind of stuff.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, but he wasn't that guy.
*  He was just a silly joke after joke after joke guy, which was amazing.
*  But for whatever reason, we put so much weight on profundity.
*  Well, yeah, people that are making a point socially relevant.
*  Mm-hmm.
*  You think, I don't want to tell these fucking stories anymore.
*  Right.
*  Especially if you can do it.
*  You can make a point and it's very funny.
*  Yeah.
*  Like it's an undeniable.
*  Burr's great at that.
*  It makes an undeniable point that's very funny.
*  Yeah.
*  That's the fun part.
*  Trying to figure it out.
*  Yeah.
*  The fun part.
*  Well, listen, man, it's been great to get to know you, talk to you.
*  Well, thanks for having me in.
*  My pleasure.
