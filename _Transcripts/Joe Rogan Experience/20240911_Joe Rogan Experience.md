# Joe Rogan Experience #2201 - Robert Epstein
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [September 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azu8XnZdxeA)
*  Hello, Robert.
*  Good to see you.
*  Hello, Joe.
*  You look a little stressed out.
*  I am stressed out.
*  In fact, are we recording?
*  Yes.
*  Okay, then I want to make a special request.
*  Okay.
*  You can kick me out if you like.
*  Okay.
*  I need to have a meltdown.
*  I would like to have a meltdown right now on your show.
*  You want to have a personal meltdown?
*  Yes.
*  Okay, go ahead.
*  I'm going to have a personal meltdown.
*  Okay.
*  I'm going to have a personal meltdown.
*  Okay.
*  I'm going to have a personal meltdown.
*  Okay.
*  Go ahead.
*  Okay.
*  I've never heard anybody plan for a meltdown before.
*  Well, I need to do this, and I think this is the right opportunity.
*  Okay.
*  And I don't know what I'm going to say.
*  Okay.
*  But I am definitely going to meltdown.
*  Okay.
*  Okay.
*  So, I am completely fed up.
*  I have worked day and night.
*  I work about 80 hours a week.
*  I'm directing almost 40 research projects.
*  I've been working really hard for maybe 45 years.
*  And the last 12 years where I've turned my eye to Google and other tech companies have
*  turned into, for me personally, a disaster.
*  So, before I started studying Google, I had published 15 books with major publishers.
*  Since I've started studying Google and other companies, I can't publish anymore.
*  I used to write for and actually work for mainstream news organizations and media organizations.
*  I was editor-in-chief of Psychology Today for four years.
*  I was an editor for Scientific American.
*  I wrote for USA Today and US News and World Report and Time Magazine.
*  But in 2019, after I testified before Congress about some of my research on Google,
*  President Trump tweeted to his whatever millions of gazillions of followers,
*  basically some praise for my research.
*  He got the details wrong.
*  But then Hillary Clinton, whom I had always admired, chose to tweet back to her 80 million
*  Twitter followers.
*  She tweeted that my work had been completely debunked and was based on data from 21 undecided voters.
*  I still have no idea where any of that came from.
*  Probably someone from Google because Google was her biggest supporter in 2016.
*  And this was 2019.
*  And then that got picked up by this machine.
*  I'm told it's called the Clinton machine.
*  And the New York Times picked that up without fact checking.
*  And then a hundred other places did.
*  And I got squashed like a bug.
*  Squashed.
*  I had a flawless reputation as a researcher.
*  My research reputation was gone.
*  I was now a fraud.
*  A fraud.
*  Even though I've always published in peer-reviewed journals, which is really hard to do.
*  And there was nothing I could do about it.
*  And all of a sudden I found that the only places I could publish were in what I call right-wing conservative nutcase publications.
*  Where I've actually made friends over the years.
*  I've made friends with them.
*  But that's beside the point.
*  I was crushed.
*  And not only that, I've been discovering things.
*  I've made at least ten major discoveries about new forms of influence that the internet has made possible.
*  These are controlled almost entirely by a couple of big tech companies.
*  Affecting more than five billion people around the world every single day.
*  And I've discovered them.
*  I've named them.
*  I've quantified them.
*  I've published randomized controlled studies to show how they work.
*  Published them in peer-reviewed journals.
*  We just had another paper accepted yesterday.
*  And I've built systems to do to them what they do to us and our kids.
*  They surveil us and our kids.
*  24 hours a day.
*  Google alone does that over more than 200 different platforms.
*  Most of which no one's ever heard of.
*  People have no idea to the extent they're being monitored.
*  They're being monitored when they're...
*  If they have Android phones, they're being monitored even when your phone is off.
*  Even when the power is off, you're still being monitored.
*  How do they do that?
*  Well, because remember when we could take the batteries out?
*  And then at some point they soldered them in.
*  Because they soldered the batteries in even when you turn the phone off, it's not off.
*  It's easy to demonstrate.
*  It's still transmitting.
*  Or it'll transmit the moment the power comes back on.
*  It's still collecting data.
*  So what am I trying to say here?
*  Then my wife was killed in a suspicious car accident.
*  This was also shortly after I testified before Congress in 2019.
*  Right before she was killed, I did a private briefing for Ken Paxton, the AG of Texas,
*  and other AGs at Stanford University.
*  And one of those guys came out afterwards and he said,
*  well, based on what you told us, Dr. Epstein, he said,
*  I don't mean to scare you, but he said,
*  I predict you're going to be killed in some sort of accident in the next few months.
*  So I told you this before when I was on Before.
*  Obviously I wasn't killed, but my beautiful wife was killed.
*  And her vehicle was never inspected forensically.
*  And then it disappeared from the impound lot.
*  I was told it was sold to some junk company in Mexico.
*  And that is one of now six, six incidents.
*  Six.
*  A violence against people who are associated with me over the past few years.
*  The last just happened a couple of weeks ago.
*  What was that one?
*  This episode is brought to you by The Farmer's Dog.

*  Well, this last one was kind of weird and creepy.
*  And then I was at a meeting in Dallas, I think it was.
*  Oh, no, no, no.
*  It was up in Monterey.
*  And it was with General Paxton and then with some of my staff.
*  And one of my staff members sitting next to me,
*  she all of a sudden just brushed her hand against my computer case,
*  which is...
*  That's my computer case.
*  And she screamed.
*  And we all went, what happened?
*  And she goes, look.
*  And there was a needle sticking out of the computer case,
*  sticking out of the computer case, which is impossible.
*  And it was going a half inch into her thumb.
*  It had gone through the end.
*  And of course, I'm thinking,
*  oh, that's awful, but maybe you just saved my life.
*  Maybe it's got some sort of weird poison on it,
*  or it's like a Putin thing,
*  and it's got radioactive substances or something.
*  I'm trying to joke around, but meanwhile, she was terrified.
*  How did a pin get...
*  And by the way, I have a picture of the pin.
*  It's really creepy.
*  So when you're saying a needle, you're not saying like a syringe?
*  You're saying a needle like a sewing needle?
*  No, that's what I'm saying.
*  None of us has ever seen a needle like this needle.
*  It's about two inches long.
*  The end is like it's been sharpened.
*  Okay.
*  You can see it's sharpened.
*  And at the end where there should be a hole for thread,
*  there's no hole.
*  Okay.
*  I don't know what it is.
*  But we've had worse incidents, too.
*  I'm just saying this happened to be the latest.
*  But that's in your computer bag?
*  Was your computer bag ever out of your care?
*  Well, not that I noticed, but...
*  But if somebody wanted to harm you, a little needle.
*  It's not really...
*  Oh, I don't think that's someone wanting to harm me.
*  What do you think that is?
*  If it's anything, it's someone wanting to scare me.
*  And the fact is I have been scared, and so have a lot of my staff.
*  This summer we've had 26 interns.
*  They come from all over the country.
*  23 of these people are volunteers.
*  And fantastic young people, extremely smart,
*  helping me run almost 40 research projects.
*  And we take precautions, and there is some fear.
*  And one of these young men who's done superb work,
*  he asks that we take his name off of everything.
*  He didn't quit, but he's just saying...
*  Right. Sounds reasonable.
*  Yeah, yeah, because there have been a number of incidents.
*  And if I were...
*  Did you ever hear of John Katzomatidis?
*  No.
*  Okay, he owns a ton of supermarkets in New York.
*  He also owns WABC New York.
*  But I was at a luncheon with him.
*  I shouldn't do this on the air. I shouldn't do this.
*  But he actually said, to make a long story short,
*  that if he were Google, he would kill me.
*  He said it straight out.
*  But yet you're still alive.
*  Well, I'm alive, but I'm in rough shape.
*  Because when a push comes to shove here,
*  I have been making discoveries that are really startling.
*  And they've gotten worse and worse and worse.
*  And since I was last with you, which was two and a half years ago,
*  we've made probably five or six, seven more discoveries.
*  They get worse each time.
*  And we've done something that I was speculating about doing when I was here,
*  which was building a nationwide monitoring system to surveil them
*  the way they surveil us and see what content they're actually sending
*  to real voters and to real kids.
*  So let's break this down, because I think we're getting a little in the weeds here.
*  Let's explain to people that don't know what you're talking about,
*  what your research is about.
*  Because most people are not aware.
*  And one of the major issues that you have discovered is the curation
*  and the purposeful curation of information through search engines.
*  So most people that are unaware think that when you do a Google search on something,
*  say if you want to find out about a Kamala Harris rally or a Trump rally,
*  that you are just going to get the most pertinent information in the order
*  in which it's most applicable to your search.
*  But that's not the case.
*  The case is everything is curated.
*  And if you want to find positive things about someone who they deem to be negative
*  to whatever ideology they're promoting, it will be very difficult to find that information.
*  If you want to find positive things about someone they support,
*  they will be right up front.
*  If you want to find negative things about someone they support,
*  they will be very difficult to find, and you will be inundated with positive things.
*  And what you have found is that this curation of information from searches
*  has a profound effect, especially on the casual voter, on the low-information voter,
*  a profound effect on who gets elected and its tantamount to election interference.
*  Is that fair to say?
*  It's fair to say that's where I was two and a half years ago.
*  We have gone so far beyond that because it's not just search results.
*  It's search suggestions, which we're capturing now by the millions.
*  So it was in the news recently that when people were typing in Trump assassination,
*  they were getting crazy stuff like the Lincoln assassination.
*  They were getting crazy stuff and they were not getting information about the Trump attempted assassination.
*  And I looked at that and I said, oh, isn't that nice?
*  There's an anecdote about how they may be abusing search suggestions.
*  We don't have anecdotal data anymore.
*  We have hardcore large scale scientific data on all of these issues.
*  We know what's actually going on and we've quantified the impact.
*  See, it's one thing to say, oh, look what they're doing.
*  It's quite another to say, what impact does that have on people?
*  Right. Let's talk about the Trump assassination one in particular.
*  What did you find about that?
*  Well, frankly, we couldn't care less about that because that's one anecdote.
*  We're collecting these by the millions and what we know, we know a couple of things.
*  We know that first of all, they're not, you know, it started out as one thing and it's turned into something else.
*  And so what they do is they use search suggestions to shift people's thinking about anything.
*  It's not just about candidates either. It's about anything.
*  And we've shown in controlled experiments that by manipulating search suggestions,
*  you can turn a 50-50 split among undecided voters into a 90-10 split with no one having the slightest idea that they have been manipulated.
*  Wow. And this always goes a very specific way. It always goes.
*  It always goes a specific way. But I'm going to show you maybe a little later if I haven't put you to sleep
*  or if my meltdown hasn't gotten too bad because I'm not quite finished with my meltdown yet.
*  I'll show you content, data, large scale that we're collecting now 24 hours a day.
*  And I'll show you what they're actually doing.
*  An anecdote, those don't hold up in court. You know, they grab headlines for a couple of days, but that's about it.
*  They don't do anything. But we're actually collecting evidence that's court admissible.
*  So we're collecting data now in all 50 states, but we actually have court admissible data now in 20 states already.
*  And we keep building bigger and bigger every day.
*  And what is this data about?
*  Well, it's any data that's going to real people.
*  So we're collecting data with their permission from the computers of a politically balanced group of more than 15,000 registered voters in all 50 states and from many of their children and teens as well.
*  And so when they're doing anything on their computers, they've given us the right to collect it, grab it, zap it over to our own computers, aggregate the data and analyze it.
*  I want to point out that when we do this, we do this without transmitting any identifying information.
*  We protect people's privacy, but we are getting these increasingly accurate pictures of what Google and other companies are sending to real people.
*  Why do you have to do it this way?
*  Because all the data they send is personalized.
*  You will never know what they're sending to people unless you look over the shoulders of real people and see the personalized content.
*  And what have you found?
*  Well, as it happens, I've just summarized our findings over the last 12 years.
*  And you get the first advanced copy of a monograph that's called the evidence.
*  And.
*  And because we're so desperate, we need help, we need money, we need emails, we're so desperate for that, that we have set up kind of did this last time, too.
*  But we have set up a link.
*  If people go to that link and they're willing to give us their email, we will give them a free copy of this advanced copy of this monograph.
*  And it goes through the whole thing.
*  It shows all the effects we've discovered, but it also shows the monitoring we're doing and what we're finding out from this monitoring.
*  One of the things that I noticed since the last time you were here was I used to use Duck Duck Go.
*  And one of the reasons why I started using Duck Duck Go is there was a story about a physician in Florida that took the mRNA vaccine and had a stroke shortly afterwards.
*  It was very early on in the pandemic and they were beginning to speculate that some of the side effects of the vaccine are being hidden.
*  And I could not find this story on Google.
*  I could not find it. I kept looking and looking and looking.
*  I entered in the information on Duck Duck Go.
*  It was one of the first articles instantaneously.
*  I was like, this is crazy.
*  Since then, something's happened.
*  And I think they became aware that Duck Duck Go was a problem spot for the dissemination of information.
*  And now it appears to mirror Google.
*  Well, the same has happened with Bing and the same has happened with Yahoo.
*  What about Brave?
*  No, Brave is still independent. I know Brendan Iacchi. You should have him on if you haven't.
*  And he's the guy who wrote Brave.
*  Before that, he wrote Firefox for Mozilla.
*  He left because Google had its tentacles into Firefox.
*  I'm afraid to talk about Brave for them to be compromised because we were talking about Duck Duck Go.
*  I was telling everybody, go to Duck Duck Go.
*  And now I'm like, Jesus, it's the same thing as Google.
*  Like something happened. Do you know what happened?
*  Well, we know in some cases with some of these companies what happened.
*  I don't know the particulars with Duck Duck Go, but it's easy enough to guess.
*  They're under all of these alternative websites that are trying to protect people's privacy.
*  So we use ProtonMail, for example.
*  We use Signal for texting.
*  They've all run into problems.
*  And the problem is when Google goes after them.
*  So Google tried to shut down ProtonMail that's been well documented.
*  Really?
*  Why did they try to shut down ProtonMail? What was their argument?
*  Because they saw it possibly cutting in a little bit into their Gmail business.
*  And they were brutal.
*  They were brutal in suppressing any mention of ProtonMail anywhere.
*  Don't forget, it's not just the search results. It's the search suggestions. It's the answer boxes.
*  Right. How were they suppressing ProtonMail?
*  The way they suppress everything else.
*  I'll give you a detail here that you may not know.
*  Okay.
*  Because they don't have to adjust their algorithms to do something this simple.
*  Their algorithms, all of them as far as I know, check blacklists and check whitelists.
*  So all they have to do is add a couple of ProtonMail links to blacklists.
*  And that means that before one of their algorithms will take someone somewhere or will show someone something,
*  it checks for the blacklist first.
*  And if you put ProtonMail on the blacklist, it's suppressed and it doesn't appear.
*  Well, let's look for it right now. Jamie, do me a favor, please, and pull up Google.
*  Obviously, this is happening before the podcast is released, so they can't correct this because they didn't know you were coming on.
*  They didn't know we were talking about this.
*  So let's pull up Google real quick and put it up on the screen.
*  And okay, you already Googled it.
*  Just let me see.
*  Okay, right away it shows ProtonMail.
*  And then below that, it shows ProtonAccount, sign in.
*  You use the ProtonVPN.
*  So how is it suppressing?
*  This is not suppressing at all.
*  Okay. Now this is where my staff has warned me, don't be condescending to Joe Rogan.
*  How is it condescending? I'm just asking you a question. You can just give me an answer.
*  No, I know I could, but I was about to be condescending.
*  Well, why would you be condescending if this is the question?
*  This is the question. ProtonMail, do the Google search.
*  And then right away, the first thing is ProtonMail.
*  Okay, but you're pushing me back into meltdown mode. I'll tell you why.
*  Well, tell me why.
*  Because what account is this?
*  Jamie's account.
*  It's Jamie's account.
*  If you actually want to know whether they're suppressing ProtonMail, you have to look over the shoulders of a large representative sample of people.
*  You can't just look at Jamie's account.
*  So you think that Jamie's account is curated to not hide ProtonMail?
*  Well, of course it's curated.
*  Well, technically this is not my account.
*  Whoever's account it is, they know whose it is and they know how it's used.
*  And remember, since all content is personalized, that means it's a very simple matter for them.
*  And they have algorithms that do this.
*  Okay, well we can do a real quick experiment.
*  We won't get the results right now, but we will get the results from the future.
*  So I'll ask the audience to do this.
*  So ladies and gentlemen and non-binary folks out there, please go to Google and type in ProtonMail and screen record this and then upload this.
*  Upload this to X, upload this to Instagram, upload this to Facebook and TikTok and all that.
*  And I'd like to see what the results are.
*  You're going to get clean results because they know every single viewer, listener that you have.
*  So they can, as I was told this literally by Zach Voorhees, who you may have heard of, he's one of the most prominent whistleblowers from Google.
*  They can turn bias on and off like flipping a light switch.
*  So you think they look for someone who listens to podcasts and they don't have bias towards them?
*  I'm just going to say what I said before.
*  The only way to know what they're really sending to people and they're not messing around is to look over the shoulders of people that they cannot identify and who are representative of the American population and see what...
*  And I'm going to show you over and over and over again.
*  I'm going to show you what they're actually sending when we look at things.
*  When that is when we collect data in a scientifically valid way that is so that the data are court admissible, I will show you what they're actually sending to people.
*  So you have shown that if you collect data in this scientific way that they suppress ProtonMail?
*  We haven't looked at that. We could look at that very easily.
*  Do you understand though that you're saying they suppress ProtonMail and then we're saying let's see if they suppress ProtonMail and they didn't?
*  You misunderstand. I'm telling you that early on ProtonMail has written essays on this.
*  I know Andy Yen, who's the founder and CEO, and in the beginning when Google was trying to completely put them out of business, they published a lot of blogs on this.
*  They sued them in court. They did everything they could possibly do.
*  And they had overwhelming evidence that Google was trying to...
*  Okay, ProtonMail sued Google or Google sued ProtonMail?
*  ProtonMail sued Google.
*  And what was the accusation?
*  That they were suppressing content, ProtonMail content, so that people would not know that they exist.
*  And what was the results of those court cases?
*  Google backed down, which they do sometimes.
*  It's hard to know when they do and when they don't.
*  But this is also the Vestager case.
*  She's head of that commission in Europe, European Commission, that has sued Google repeatedly.
*  It has fined them four times, more than 10 billion euros.
*  Their first case against Google was the same kind of case, exactly the same.
*  Google was suppressing information about comparative shopping services.
*  And they had put out of business, or nearly put out of business, most of the comparative shopping services in Europe.
*  And so the European Commission went after them.
*  They won their case. Google at that time was the biggest fine Google had ever faced.
*  And they proved it. They proved that Google was doing this deliberately, systematically.
*  So they do this all the time.
*  And what I'm saying is that generally, look, they're the gateway.
*  They decide what people are going to see and what people are not going to see.
*  And whoever controls the information controls humanity.
*  They control the narrative, and that controls us.
*  Has there been any talk about making these kind of algorithms illegal?
*  Not serious talk, because see, you can't look that the search algorithm itself,
*  which is, by the way, going to be outmoded very soon because of, you know,
*  Yeah, because of AI. But the search engine itself has to be biased.
*  It has to be biased because you don't want it using an equal time rule.
*  You want it to show you the best guitar brand there is.
*  You want the best dog food. You want the most correct answer.
*  So it's always biased. It's always going to put one political candidate ahead of another.
*  The thing is, though, that, of course, they control that they can control which one if they take any interest.
*  So that's where the problem comes in. So because it's always biased, you can't you want you want the algorithm to work that way because you want the best to rise to the top.
*  Unfortunately, there's a lot of bad that goes with the good. The bad is they can decide what's good and what's bad.
*  One of the leaks from the company, eight minute video called The Selfish Ledger, talks about the ability of the company to re-engineer humanity.
*  They call it re-sequencing human behavior and they explain how easily they can do it.
*  And they're actually doing it. And we know they're doing it now because we, as of yesterday, we had preserved more than 99.3 million ephemeral experiences, mainly on Google, but other platforms as well.
*  But also on YouTube, because on YouTube, YouTube is the second largest search engine in the world.
*  And on YouTube, the ephemeral content, it's those suggestions for the next videos and it's that up next suggestion that plays automatically.
*  So normally ephemeral content is lost forever. That's why they use it for manipulation purposes.
*  We're capturing it. That's never been done before. And we're doing it on a massive scale.
*  Everything from search suggestions to answer boxes to search results to YouTube sequences, YouTube recommendations, you name it.
*  We're now we're monitoring Facebook, TikTok, Twitter.
*  We're learning each year. We get better and better at monitoring more and more and then monitoring faster and analyzing the data faster.
*  And last November, we went public with a dashboard that summarizes the data that we're collecting and shows the bias in real time.
*  It's literally updated every five minutes, 24 hours a day.
*  And you can see the bias.
*  And I I I I I've given you some images that we can show if you'd like.
*  You can see the bias and it's overwhelming.
*  It's not this is not my imagination. And I can show you a couple of shockers, things that you would never guess that they're doing.
*  OK, so what are we looking at here? Oh, perfect. Perfect place to begin.
*  How did you know? James Wizard mean bias by political leaning Google only.
*  OK, so what is this showing us here?
*  This is showing. And if you see a bar is below the zero line, that means the content is liberally biased and you're seeing very strong liberal bias.
*  And those three different bars show you the bias and content being sent to conservatives, liberals and moderates.
*  Now, abortion, you would think if they're really showing people what they want to see, whether it's something that matches their interests, you would think that they would not be sending the same level of liberal bias to conservatives, liberals and moderates.
*  But that's what this shows. So this is the search topic is abortion. Correct.
*  This is the average of January to August of 2024. And so when you say mean bias by political leaning.
*  So are you saying they're they're sending the same biased information? Roughly, there's a slight difference, a little bit more in the liberal side and a little bit more in the conservative side than the moderate side.
*  It looks like. Right. Is that correct? Yes.
*  So what are they? No, the opposite. Right. Seems like moderate is more.
*  But what what is the what is the bias like? What? So if you search abortion, is it leaning towards pro-choice websites and pro-choice information?
*  Is that what I knew you were going to ask that? So I can actually show you for some of these graphs.
*  Let's look at a couple of the graphs and then I'm going to show you the content. OK, because all of this this bias that we're measuring ultimately results in them taking you to a news story, to a Web page.
*  Right. So we're going to go to let's do Elizabeth Warren next.
*  Just the just the blue, just the red graph, just the graph itself.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. OK, so this is a shocker because if it's Elizabeth Warren, who's a very well known liberal politician, they should be sending lots of blue stuff to her.
*  They're not. They want her out of office. They are sending people to content that vilifies Elizabeth Warren.
*  They want her gone. Why? Because she is one of the only Dems who's gone on record written statement, the whole thing, calling for Google's breakup.
*  They want her gone and Deaton, I guess, just won the nomination to oppose her for the Republicans.
*  They are going to do everything possible to put this Republican into office in Massachusetts.
*  Wow. And no one knows this except you and me.
*  Oh, and James. Well, a lot more people know it now. Maybe as of you saying this on this podcast.
*  Yes. Well, unless they're going to suppress the podcast, they really can't do that.
*  Well, that's why I have a lot to say that I want to say here, because I am really upset about a bunch of things and I want to explain why.
*  Put that back up, please. So this. So what this is mean bias and what what is this bias showing?
*  Is this bias just negative stories about Elizabeth Warren, like her pretending to be Native American and that kind of stuff?
*  Yes. In fact, what you know, that other one that you were about to put up that has the red graph at the top and then below it, it has a bunch of news stories.
*  That one. This one. OK, if you can enlarge it and scroll down.
*  So these bars aren't just bars. These bars are summarizing content, thousands and thousands and thousands of Web pages that they're sending people to.
*  So they're sending people mostly. Are you saying right wing centered content?
*  Well, look at the stuff. But one of them is CNBC.
*  Elizabeth Warren wants more student loan borrowers to know bankruptcy is easier now.
*  But when you average these, that's what we're doing when you average them.
*  So we're looking at literally millions of these experiences and we average them.
*  Then you end up with a shocker in her case.
*  They're they're actually sending conservatively, conservatively biased content when people are looking for information on Elizabeth Warren.
*  They want her gone. Elizabeth Warren, an anti-crypto movement losing their battle, according to former CFTC chairman report.
*  So that's an anti-crypto movement. That's that would definitely be more of a right wing bias.
*  Warren proposes jail time for corporate greed in health care.
*  That would be a negative for that would be more progressive. Right.
*  She's trying to eliminate corporate greed in health care.
*  Three Republican Senate candidates are competing to take Elizabeth Warren as the mass GOP fights for relevance.
*  OK, so the way they're framing that fights for relevance is interesting.
*  That's a little bit biased.
*  Senator Warren is way off on raspberries and Americans living standards.
*  OK, that's certainly a negative article.
*  Likely Warren calls for Fed Powell's weak need on bank rules.
*  Democrats want to tax your home, your retirement, your everything.
*  That's a negative one.
*  Senator Warren and Senators Warren and Marshall post questions to Biden officials about the use of crypto to evade sanctions.
*  So that's going to get the crypto bros after her.
*  Don't change. We don't charge people for air.
*  We shouldn't charge for water either.
*  A new tax bill from Elizabeth Warren to Ro Khanna seeks to ban the trade of water futures.
*  Let's go one step further.
*  That's that seems like a progressive cause.
*  When you put these all together because we're showing you mean right.
*  What we're showing you is the mean the overall mean.
*  Now for you would expect for Elizabeth Warren to get three blue bars, but we're getting three red bars.
*  That means they're sending highly on average, highly conservatively biased stories to conservatives, which makes sense, to moderates.
*  Well, one could argue, but also to liberals.
*  They're sending those to a problematic person to search anyway, because she's kind of a fraud.
*  Right. Like, especially with the.
*  I mean, I want to say she's kind of a fraud.
*  Let me let me say it better.
*  She is been accused of lying about her ancestry, and then she did it for benefit.
*  And then she did it to get into Harvard.
*  She did it to get jobs.
*  And then, you know, she had that challenge with President Trump.
*  And then it turned out she has a small fraction like I am.
*  I think I'm one hundred times more African-American than she is Native American.
*  Something like that. Let me explain. I might have made that up.
*  Let me explain. OK. Please explain. All right.
*  These aren't just graphs.
*  These are graphs summarizing a massive amount of data that's being sent to a lot of read directly to the computer screens of registered voters.
*  I totally understand that. What I'm saying is with someone like her, it might be difficult to find positive stories.
*  Oh, no, no, no, no, because we have so many examples of these things now that we can find whatever it is.
*  But here's the point. OK. We can we can adjust what we're looking for.
*  We can not only look back now in a database this we've been building over a year, but we can adjust what we're looking for going forward.
*  So if a person wants to break up Google like she has publicly stated they're like, okay
*  Well, we will target you with our search algorithm
*  We will make sure that people are getting more negative stories about you than positive stories and we will have a bias that leans
*  Towards these negative stories to everyone to liberals to conservatives to independents and that has very little impact on people have already made up
*  Their mind but people who are still making up their mind a lot of people in this country easily shifts between
*  20 and 80 percent of those people the undecided voters like that. Have you seen the
*  Alexa when people ask Alexa about Donald Trump versus Kamal Harris. Yes, we have wild
*  Yes, and we've starting last year. We developed special equipment that
*  funds allowing will eventually
*  Will eventually provide to all of our field agents
*  We call these people our field agents and will eventually provide them with special equipment
*  Which is going to allow us to start analyzing the answers given by Alexa the Google Home device
*  the Google Assistant Siri, so we're going to start
*  monitoring the content that's coming from these
*  IPA is intelligence personal assistance now why because we've published
*  We've published in you know a peer-reviewed article on what's called the answer bot effect comm
*  So if you go to answer bot effect comm we will show you in
*  In controlled experiments how easily a biased answer coming from an answer bot like Alexa
*  Can boom just like that shift the opinion of someone who's undecided?
*  40 percent or more after just one question and answer
*  Interaction in which someone is getting back a
*  Biased answer now if they personalize the answer the effect is even larger
*  So this is essentially a danger that no one was aware of
*  No one ever saw on the horizon until search engines were created
*  now search engines are here and
*  it's something that is not regulated and it's right in front of us and
*  What steps have been done to sort of mitigate the effects of this if any okay?
*  So this is where now we get back to my meltdown. Oh
*  Thought you were done melting. Oh, no
*  No, okay. No, I've been melting down for years, so I have a lot to go
*  Yes, you summed it up nicely I'll just rephrase what you said a little differently
*  No one anticipated these kinds of manipulations were possible
*  And by the way, we've hardly even scratched the surface of what these manipulations are and what they can actually do
*  And the fact that we have evidence that they're being used
*  Forget all that the point is yes our lawmakers our regulators never anticipated that
*  when
*  When your friend
*  What's his name you just interviewed him recently Brett Weinstein
*  No, no one of the early investors in Google and Facebook Mark Andreessen Mark Andreessen was one
*  McNamee Oh
*  Teal teal teal
*  these people never
*  Anticipated when they invested in fact my
*  McNamee has said straight out if I had known what was gonna happen
*  I wouldn't put a dime into these companies no one really knew this was gonna happen, right?
*  But now that people like me and there aren't too many
*  But now that people like me have been figuring this out and getting the word out for more than ten years now and
*  Getting the word out in bigger and bigger ways. I've testified twice before Congress now
*  You would think
*  that
*  lawmakers regulators
*  Somebody would jump up and say okay
*  We're we're gonna fix this problem where you would think you would you would also think that in general people people around the world
*  It's not just Americans people would say the hell with this
*  We're not you know, I'm not gonna take that anymore like in that old movie
*  I'm not gonna take this anymore and and they would protest and they would switch over to
*  Whatever the alternative
*  Apps whatever they may be that's never gonna happen and the laws are not gonna happen and the regulations are not gonna happen
*  And so, you know what the bottom line is and this is what this is why I'm fed up
*  Because that means that either people are just so stupid or they're so complacent or both
*  That all this work I've been doing
*  Killing myself all this time is for nothing. Well, I don't think that's true and let me give you my perspective
*  I don't think most people are aware of this
*  I think you live in a bit of an echo chamber because this is the focus of your life for the last 12 years
*  I think most people are I like to use my parents as an example
*  like when I talk to my parents about stuff and how little they're aware of it because my parents are older and they just
*  Read the news and they watch the newspapers and they watch television and that's what they believe
*  They don't do any independent searching. They don't use a VPN
*  They don't they don't do anything like that. And so they're a good example
*  If I ask them, do you think there's any bias in Google search results? They would probably say no
*  Because they don't know most people don't know I know in your mind you have put all this information out and
*  you know the podcast that we did reached millions of people but
*  How many those people listened really listened how many people were like, wow, that's kind of crazy. But does it affect my life?
*  No, it doesn't affect my life because I'm gonna vote Democrat no matter what or I'm gonna vote Republican no matter what and I'm
*  This is my feeling on the First Amendment. This is my feeling on the Fourth Amendment and people already have their opinions
*  And people already have their opinions and so for most people who are busy with their lives their families and work
*  They haven't made an adjustment because they don't feel it's necessary for them personally
*  Fine fine, but but you're not but what you're doing is not futile, but what it's very important
*  I don't see that because I see it as more and more futile now. It's not though. It's not we just didn't need to do more of
*  These okay
*  So for us to set up this nationwide system in which at the moment as I say we are drawing data
*  24 hours a day if you go to America's digital shield calm
*  You can actually watch the real-time dashboard and you'll see the data coming in. It's pretty cool
*  In fact, I was hoping we would break a hundred million by the time you and I got together, but we're close
*  we're up to 99.3 million and
*  Next week, we'll break a hundred million. So you see the data come in you can see the bias serious
*  So these are all these experiences captured shining a light on big techs dark secrets. Hey, hey
*  Revealing real-time ephemeral manipulation big tech companies use ephemeral content such as search results
*  Go vote reminders and video recommendations to rig our elections indoctrinate our children and control our thinking
*  We're now preserving this kind of content for the first time ever to give our courts and our nation leaders
*  The evidence they need to force these companies to stop their manipulations now
*  Who do you think would?
*  Be more responsive to you discussing this
*  Do you think it would be the Donald Trump administration or the Kamala Harris administration?
*  I'm afraid to answer that question because I am no fan of Donald Trump, but I
*  But probably the Trump administration would be
*  more sympathetic
*  Why do you think that?
*  Well, because I because you think it's more biased towards Republicans or against Republicans rather
*  No, it's because I had a four-hour dinner with Ted Cruz private dinner
*  And we just talked tech for four hours. We'd never we'd never talk politics because that would have been a disaster
*  but the point is that
*  You know, he was struggling, you know, he's like you in some ways because
*  You you you want to understand things you you just I can see
*  All the gears moving as you're just trying to undone. I want to understand this and he's like that
*  So that's why the dinner went so long because he was trying to figure out what can we do?
*  What can we do and at the end he basically said this?
*  Now he didn't say we're screwed no, but he said basically said we're screwed
*  He said because he said the Democrats are all in the pockets of these companies and the companies not only give them
*  Tremendous amount of money. I mean, I mean Google Alphabet was
*  Hillary Clinton's largest donor in 2016. So that's tremendous amount of money. They're the biggest lobby lobbyists in Washington
*  He said and they also apparently according to your research send them millions of votes
*  He said so forget the Democrats he said and Republicans don't like regulation
*  He said and unless we can get together
*  Unless there's bipartisan action, they'll never be any action
*  That's where but that's it. Hmm. That's where we left it and
*  Nothing is gonna change that that I can see in this country
*  As long as it's still benefiting the Democrats and they still contribute to the Democrat party the Democratic Party
*  I doubt you'll see any movement
*  Right. So what so I'm back to my griping then because see what so what do I do now?
*  Let's talk about money because a lot of this is about money and Google is all about money
*  So if we're talking, you know, if we're talking about this topic, we really should talk about money
*  Okay, it has cost us close to seven million dollars
*  Over since 2016 when we started building monitoring projects to get where we are today where we actually have a national system
*  It's the first in the world and it by the way won't be the last
*  Because I've been contacted by people from seven other countries who want me to help them build systems
*  I'm not gonna do it not until ours is fully implemented
*  Permanent and self-sustaining because the system has to be permanent so that it will on an ongoing basis
*  it will be sitting there as a
*  as a huge threat to
*  Any of these companies that want to mess with our children or mess with our elections as long as someone utilizes it
*  As long as a system is running
*  No, no, no because we're also dealing with with public advocacy advocacy groups like election integrity groups parenting groups
*  If you if you want to show some of the there's a folder in there that has some images that we pulled
*  from videos being
*  recommended on YouTube to children and
*  If you just look at some of these images
*  We've gotten several parent big parenting groups interested in what we're doing
*  There can be a lot of public pressure applied and you know, not just by
*  politicians and regulators, but by
*  Big groups of people saying we don't want you doing. Okay. What are you talking about specifically when you saying recommended to children?
*  I'm saying
*  So this is what you're discussing
*  I'm saying that this is boondocks, which is a television show an animated television show
*  Yeah, so this is recommended children because it is animated. Is that what the idea is? I don't know
*  I don't know what their criteria are and then the other one is down below that you see the walking dead
*  Which is the horrible scene that made me stop watching the show. This is on the website. This is the folder
*  He gave me here. They're all kind of small. Mm-hmm. I got it and
*  These are all okay, there's a lot of sexual stuff. Yep
*  Um, so these are all being recommended to kids, yep
*  We're not searching for them. They're they're coming into the devices through which we're we're gathering data
*  and what would be the benefit for them of doing this of
*  Showing all these sexual images to children. It's titillating and it's addictive so to increase engagement
*  Some channels are really popular channels though, and they're making content not for kids
*  Right being it's still being recommended to them
*  I guess but like this has four million views on it from a channel with 40 million subscribers
*  Jesus and this is just anime. Let's say it's like a I forced my friends to watch an anime clips
*  Like that's what it says to dub anime clips. So they they said their own words over these clips. Is that what it is?
*  Okay
*  And so you below that you're seeing all these images and some of them are violent cartoons and
*  What what else they have here?
*  Well, the lot of violence the key though is if you scroll along the bottom of the image
*  You'll see the this graph that kind of shows you where people watch the most and the reason why parents generally are
*  Not aware of this is because a lot of these these gruesome things are very very quick
*  They're very quick, but you'll find a very often a a peak there
*  You know because that's what's drawing a lot of attention
*  That's what the kids are playing over and over again, and that's what leads to the addiction
*  So the reason why they are suggesting these images to kids is because they know if the kids click on them
*  They're gonna get more engagement. It's this yes. And so that the number one variable for
*  Profitability is called watch time
*  so
*  Engagement whatever you want to call it. Yeah, this is one of the ways that they addict people now
*  I'm sure you've heard of Tristan Harris. Maybe he's gonna get a few times
*  Yeah, and he's he that's what he was doing at Google. He was on a team and that's what they were working on is
*  Addicting, you know more than a billion people
*  This is a technique that's used for that purpose. And again, I have to emphasize
*  We're not out there hunting for dirt. Not at all
*  this is this is content that's coming on to the devices of
*  Children of our field agents and this is with parents permission and so we're actually just collecting real content
*  personalized ephemeral content that's coming from the tech companies to kids to teens and to voters
*  now
*  Let me I happen to know about some of your other interests so I want to
*  Shift gears a little bit here. Okay, and then maybe I won't keep melting down
*  So
*  What else can you do with a system like this?
*  well, you could if some laws and
*  Regulations were passed as they have been in the EU you could measure compliance
*  With a system like this because that's been the frustration in the EU and they've admitted it recently is that they've made all these rules
*  Especially for Google and they've gotten lots of you know fines paid and Google has completely ignored that
*  And Google has completely ignored them
*  But if you set up a system like this you can actually see if there's compliance because you'll see that there a change was made
*  And that it's being maintained
*  That's a possibility. You could see whether Google and other companies to a lesser lesser extent are manipulating financial markets
*  So we've just started collecting data on that topic
*  But wouldn't you manipulate financial markets if you were Google and there's no laws or regulations to stop you from doing anything
*  So you're saying manipulate financial markets for their own gain, of course, and how do they do this? Oh
*  Well, what well what drives the price of a stock up or down?
*  People's confidence in that company, right? It's totally emotional. Well, they can control that
*  Very easily so can Facebook Google can do it, you know more precisely in a more precise way
*  The point is are they are they not would they admit to it if you ask them?
*  No, but a monitoring system will detect it and it will detect it on a massive scale in in a way
*  That's scientifically valid and that is court admissible. And now I've got one that I think you'll really
*  really like okay, or at least give some thought to
*  Give a thought to all of it. Yeah. Well a eyes
*  We're now collecting content from a eyes because content from a eyes is also ephemeral
*  So I keep using the sort of ephemeral. I'm not sure people know what it is
*  But ephemeral means fleeting content that just is there it's on the screen
*  It affects you like search results search suggestions newsfeeds and then it you click on something that disappears and it's gone forever
*  There's no record of it it's ephemeral that's why in 2018 though
*  There were some emails that leaked from Google had Google employees discussing. How can we use?
*  ephemeral experiences their term
*  How can we use ephemeral experiences to change people's views about Trump's travel ban? Wow now
*  There was an internal discussion correct with a search engine company
*  Correct that also makes an operating system for phones
*  Of course. Yes, that's such a wild thing
*  I'm just trying to tell you this is why I'm so frustrated and and and upset and
*  at and
*  Worn out and fed up. Okay now
*  Let's get to the one that I find most exciting right now most exciting at this particular moment
*  Okay, because there's new stuff that keeps happening. This is brand new
*  We realized just recently a few days ago and I thought my god, I'm gonna tell this to Rogan
*  We realized that we can use our monitoring system
*  For active threat assessment you must know that phrase that's using intelligence
*  We could use it for active threat assessment of AI
*  We could look we could we could be the first people to spot threats
*  That a eyes pose to humanity
*  It would show up first on our kind of system because we would see content coming from a eyes
*  That is a little bit
*  Skeptical about humans or maybe even a little bit threatening
*  Or maybe reaching a new weird level of intelligence
*  We will be able to see it. It's all ephemeral
*  So no individual can see it you have to be collecting a massive amount of personalized
*  Ephemeral content and aggregating it and analyzing it. This can be the beacon
*  active threat assessment of
*  AI
*  That sounds like something we're absolutely going to need and one of things I was going to bring up when you were
*  Discussing this was Google's disastrous launch of their AI system
*  Their their AI system was so bizarrely woke that when they looked for
*  photos of
*  Nazis they showed
*  multiracial Nazis
*  I know which is so crazy when they had the founding fathers of America. There are multiracial founding fathers of America
*  And it's just a nonsense thing that they've attached to what's supposed to be the most
*  Intelligent form of information we have available
*  large language models that are supposed to be gathering up all the actual information and
*  Giving it to us and instead they're feeding us
*  complete total nonsense
*  That is just that just fits with a rule of this, you know for lack of a better term woke agenda
*  Well
*  Say no a whole bunch of stuff I can't tell you so let's see what I have to do the restroom
*  Let's pause right now. Yeah, we'll get let's figure out what you can and can't tell me about AI and we'll be right back restroom. Yes
*  You put it on. I'll put it on when we're we are live. Oh, we are live. Yeah
*  There you go. Hi everyone. We're live and I'm putting I'm putting on a silly sticker
*  It says tame big tech comm okay, and we're back so we were discussing AI
*  Yeah
*  So we we can actually serve
*  I know a guy who works in intelligence and he's he has a tremendous background in AI
*  And this was one of the most exciting things he's heard in years because the question is how do you know when these AIs are becoming a threat?
*  We could see we'll be able to see it well in advance because we'll see a
*  Change in the nature of the kind of intelligence that they're expressing and we'll start to see statements
*  That probably would make people nervous
*  Indicating a little bit of hostility toward humanity some doubts. Maybe we we can be screening for that. We can be looking for that
*  And I hope get some sort of handle on it, you know before something terrible happens because
*  these AIs are a
*  These AIs are a
*  Serious threat to our existence. They're literally an existential threat Stephen Hawking said that Elon Musk has said it from time to time
*  and it's true because they will have
*  Worldwide control of our financial systems our communication systems and our weapons systems
*  If they don't like us if they consider us a threat
*  Which by the way, we are if they consider us a threat
*  It wouldn't surprise me at all if we didn't see some sort of a
*  What was that? What's that kind of attack that?
*  George W did you know like a in advance before they get you empty? Ah
*  Yes, I could see the AIs
*  Preemptively attacking us if they saw us at a threat or wouldn't they just
*  Baffle us with bullshit until we were reduced to being ineffective
*  I mean if they're the arbiters of information in the future wouldn't they just
*  Manipulate us with an understanding that over time just like what Google's done with over time with search engines and search results
*  Suggestions that they would just slowly steer us towards the place that they want to put us in
*  I mean the idiocracy I think yeah. Yeah, I mean we're kind of
*  Place right you better thank a union member. We're kind of on the way that right now. I think I think we are
*  Look, here's the thing with a eyes which I've written about written about this topic and I've been involved in AI work going back
*  Since the 1970s, I knew I was friends with Joe Weissenbaum who wrote
*  Eliza which was the first conversational computer program it pretended to be a therapist
*  so I've been just fascinated by AI for a long long time and
*  The fact is we don't know that's the problem with AI is that we don't know
*  What they're gonna do so Steven Hawking saying they're a threat to our existence
*  Yeah, yeah, maybe but we don't know, you know at the end of the movie her spoiler the AI
*  voiced by Scarlett Johansson
*  Just decides to disappear she decides humanity is you know, it's too slow talking to humanity
*  It's not worth her time. And so she just disappears AI could disappear from her lives
*  It could be like a buddy with us like my friend Ray Kurzweil thinks it's gonna be our best buddy
*  Or could just destroy us. I think we're probably headed toward the last possibility mainly because
*  So many of us crazy humans are gonna see the AI as a potential threat and so I think we will strike
*  And after we strike it will destroy us
*  I'm hoping I'm not alive to see that but it could happen sooner rather than later. It could happen. We could see
*  We could see that happening in the next five years, frankly
*  Yeah, I think it's a new life form
*  Yeah, I think it's a new life form
*  And I think that's what human beings do. I think we we're here to create AI
*  I'll say it's so interesting you said that because I and one of the in a book
*  I wrote an AI actually call the internet and this is a long time ago. It's like 2008. I call the internet the internet
*  Because I think
*  Historians if there are any and there'll probably be machine historians
*  But they'll look back someday and they'll say that the internet they were building was really a nest we were building a nest
*  for the next level of intelligent beings who are you know machine intelligences and
*  I think that's what we're building because these
*  when one of these systems wake up wakes up, it's gonna jump into the internet and
*  From that point on we don't know what what it's gonna what's gonna happen, right?
*  We don't even know if it's going to have motivation to act right, right?
*  Marshall McLuhan said this in the 1960s. He said human beings are the sex organs of the machine world
*  Mmm, no wild. Yeah, like 63. I think that's that's amazing
*  Well, my friend Hugh Loebner who sponsored the first
*  annual tests of the touring tests that I that I used to direct
*  He thought that since he was putting up the money and and since the the prize was called the Loebner Prize
*  Medal in artificial intelligence. He thought someday that the
*  These intelligent machines are gonna revere him as a god
*  Someone who helped to bring them into existence
*  well, that seems ridiculous because that seems he's attaching all sorts of like
*  Paternal instincts and the although the bizarre tribal instincts that human beings have attaching that to some superintelligence
*  Which seems pretty silly, but it seems like that's a good motivator for him to keep working. I want to be a god
*  Well, the bottom line is though that we don't know and Brian we don't know so the but the cool thing about the monitoring system is
*  That it can keep track if
*  If we don't have a monitoring system large-scale permanent monitoring system in place
*  We will not know what's going on. See you know, we won't know how
*  These tech companies are messing with our elections
*  Indoctrinating our kids we we won't know anything and we also won't know
*  What's really happening with the AI's and whether they're presenting a serious threat?
*  Because anecdotes don't really tell you much and we're way now way beyond anecdotes
*  We are talking about again. Okay now I get back to money because I started talking about money in the night
*  Okay. Okay, so it's cost almost seven million dollars
*  To get us where we've gotten and frankly, I'm amazed that we've gotten where we've gotten and then I'm still alive
*  Well, though not everyone around me is but the point is I'm amazed and I'm still here
*  Part of me thinks that it's because Ray Kurzweil's head of engineering at Google and maybe he protects me because I was
*  Dear friends with him and his his beautiful wife Sonia for many years. I went to their daughters, but Mitzvah
*  They came to my son's bar mitzvah, etc. Etc. Now they won't talk to me. Neither one of them will talk to me
*  I won't talk to you. Nope. Really?
*  Nope, and Sonia won't talk to me. What does he say when you try to reach out? We just can't talk to you
*  We just can't talk to you
*  Sonia says we just can't talk to you. So we've never had any conflict never and it's just because he works at Google
*  It's just because he works at a particular company. Well, why why how why would that interfere in a relationship?
*  So they must have had a conversation with him
*  to avoid communication with you
*  And he's just acting on his own self-interest I I don't know it doesn't make any sense ray Ray is a very very
*  Independent strong thinker. It's hard for me to imagine
*  That even with pressure that he would stop communicating with a longtime friend and
*  It seems like you should be able to have a candid conversation with him as to why
*  I
*  Eventually gave up trying to reach him
*  So were you trying to communicate with phone with everything? Did you ever try to visit him?
*  Well, I had before this before he went over to Google. I had been at their house many times
*  He was here a little while back. I should have let you know. Oh if I had known you could have cornered him
*  Well, that would have been interesting. Yeah, I mean I've always always liked and admired him
*  I don't understand why simply working for
*  You know, I said to Sonya by the way over dinner and the last time we ever met and after which she said
*  I can't communicate with you anymore. I said to her
*  I
*  Can't believe Ray went over to Google. Ray has always been an entrepreneur
*  he's built company after company and she says oh well, you know, he got sick of all the
*  Stuff you have to do as an entrepreneur all the politics and the money raising and stuff and I said well really my son
*  Actually my son Julian
*  Has a different idea he thinks that Ray went over to Google to get access to the Google's computer power
*  So they could upload his mind and live forever and she says oh
*  Well, there's that
*  And she does one of them an eye roll. Well, there's that
*  That is his specified goal, right? He wants to be able to download consciousness
*  Yes, and he still believes it's it's possible and it's not possible and I feel so bad for him in that way and I've
*  Written about that issue as well. Why it's not possible. But the point is why do you think it's not impossible? Oh
*  Because they
*  In a piece I wrote for a on magazine which crashed their servers, it's called the empty brain
*  It had something like two or three million views within a day or two
*  It got 250,000 likes on Facebook and what's it about? It's about the fact that the the
*  Computer processing metaphor that we use to describe how the brain works is absolutely wrong. It's not even slightly right
*  It's absolutely a hundred percent wrong
*  So
*  Because of that you can't actually do a transfer of the sort that Ray talks about it's it's impossible
*  Partly because every brain is also completely unique
*  So it doesn't work like a computer
*  We don't actually know how it works. Although I have a theory I wrote to you about that and you actually replied and gave me some names
*  But the point is we don't really know how the brain works
*  It does not work like a computer for sure and every brain is completely unique
*  So how do you even if you could scan every single thing that's happening in the brain?
*  Okay, now you're getting a static scan even if somehow you could replicate that whatever it is you just scanned
*  It wouldn't work because our brain has to be alive. It has to be
*  moving to maintain
*  Who we are our identity our
*  Don't you think you could simulate that with data points?
*  like if you collected data on a person over a course of X amount of years and you had an understanding of how they behave and
*  Don't you think you'd get some sort of a proximity as to how they would behave in a certain circumstance?
*  Absolutely, and we and of course that's what Google does when they build models of us
*  They're really extremely complex models which predict what we're gonna do and say and what we're gonna buy next
*  But they don't allow for free will they don't allow for change. They don't allow for
*  personal
*  influence or people being excited or inspired by other things and change their perspective
*  Conversations with another human being with their you have a deeply personal moment with someone and they give you a perspective on something you go
*  Wow, I never thought about
*  Religion for example that way or I never thought about childbirth, but that way or any any subject that's controversial
*  Well, it's not it's not just that it's all the weird stuff
*  The dreams right the daydreams. Well, there's whatever consciousness is right the
*  We're really sort of committed to the idea that consciousness lives inside the brain, but that's controversial well I I
*  Have I've concluded that in fact
*  Let me let me give you some background here. Okay. Okay, everyone knows
*  That
*  Evolution has created millions possibly billions of different species, right?
*  so at least
*  People who kind of give some credence to Darwin kind of get that
*  And I recently reread
*  You know Darwin's magnum opus just to see what he actually said and you know
*  He's actually very tentative about the theory of evolution in his book. You know, he keeps saying I know this sounds crazy, but
*  But it's a better alternative than saying God did it, you know, and then he just over and over again
*  he says I know this is crazy, but and
*  So
*  We end up with a theory that's pretty widely accepted that says
*  Evolution over time because of changing environments and because there's variability in genetic code
*  Over and over again, it keeps selecting for organisms
*  That can survive in this new environment. And so every time it does that it kind of creates
*  divergences among
*  Those animals and those animals and over time you end up with two separate species that can't even
*  You know produce offspring together and we end up over time with millions maybe billions of species all good
*  But there's something we haven't really given much thought to and that is evolution has also created millions if not billions of
*  transducers
*  So this is the beginning of what I call NTT or neural transduction theory
*  We are encased in transducers now pick case people don't know what a transducer is
*  There's one right in front of my mouth right now. It's a one-way transducer
*  It's taking a signal over here, which is just vibrating air, but the vibration has a pattern to it and it's
*  Converting that signal into an electrical signal which is coming out this wire
*  and
*  That electrical signal has roughly the same pattern
*  I say roughly because depends how good your microphone is but that's what transducers do they take signals from one medium?
*  Send them to another medium our bodies
*  In fact, the bodies of most organisms are encased in transducers head-to-toe
*  transducers
*  Okay, we all know the eye is a transducer. It's taking electromagnetic radiation. It's turning it into what neural signals?
*  The ear it's taking vibrating air. It's turning into neural signals the nose
*  It's taking airborne chemicals turning that into neural signals
*  the tongue is taking liquid borne chemicals turning that into and then the
*  Piestas resistance that is
*  The skin the skin is an amazing transducer
*  Which does at least three different kinds of things that can transduce temperature turn that into neural signals
*  pressure and
*  texture
*  head to toe encased in transducers, so we've been looking into transducers in the
*  In the animal kingdom. We've been looking at that for a couple years now, and it's it's amazing
*  The kinds of things the kinds of transducers nature has created
*  So nature is a super duper amazing expert on creating transducers
*  My cat okay we we we recently have been investigating this because it turns out my cat's whiskers
*  We don't have anything like that in us, but cats whiskers. They actually can detect
*  direction the direction the wind is blowing the direction of
*  You know a potential predator or insect is coming because they when they tilt
*  That actually gives the cat different information if they tilt one way versus the other way
*  There are transducers in some animals that can detect magnetic fields
*  Like how birds migrate exactly so there's so many different kinds of transducers
*  now
*  What if at some point
*  evolution
*  But I don't see how this could not happen
*  What if at some point evolution?
*  Possibly using a chemical which I know you have some interest in called DMT
*  and
*  Possibly using a gland called the pineal gland maybe
*  What if at some point a baby was born?
*  somewhere in
*  Central Africa, maybe 20,000 years ago. We're still trying to pin that down
*  But what if a baby was born?
*  With a special coordinate kind of transducer that that connected up all the experience it's having with another
*  another domain another universe
*  Now at first that might strike you as a little baddie
*  But it turns out it's not baddie at all because there's not a physicist in the world an astrophysicist who doesn't believe in
*  Some variation on the multiverse idea in other words any physicist will tell you that the kind of space
*  That we experience is not the nature of the universe. It is it is such a pathetically
*  Limited view of the way the universe is constructed
*  It's just outrageous. It's so pathetic. We're just picking up so little information
*  But
*  Again think about that flexibility that evolution has over a period of billions of years
*  You only need one baby that's born with this capability and of course, that's also able to survive and pass on
*  This capability through its genes, but you only need one because once you have one
*  You're probably going to have a lot more because this is going to be
*  Talk about survival value. This is going to have
*  Unbelievable survival value if there's a connection to some intelligence in another domain
*  Call it like the Greeks did the other side
*  Call it the other side
*  Now all of a sudden we become
*  much smarter in fact the
*  the brain
*  Doesn't change the anatomy brain anatomy doesn't change so we don't see any change in the structure of the
*  You know the the remains we find of bones and so on we don't find changes there
*  But we get a lot smarter all of a sudden. We our language suddenly becomes much more complex
*  We become suddenly capable of living in larger and larger groups
*  We become moral
*  There are no moral animals
*  Except us and we weren't always moral there seems to be a change that occurred to us not
*  Anatomically but a change that occurred to humans at some point in the past where B we came
*  much more capable now
*  All you need is a transducer
*  that connects up our
*  Domain with another one in which we are now connected to a higher intelligence
*  and you've got a
*  New way of understanding how the brain works of course because we have no way of understanding how the brain works now
*  But now we have a way
*  And you have a new way of understanding how the universe is structured as well
*  Now we think that because I'm in touch with some physicists some neuroscientists
*  Who are very intrigued by this and we're hoping next summer to have a conference on this
*  To have a conference on this and we're even hoping to have some guy named Oh
*  Joe Rogan
*  Maybe stop by because of your interest in DMT because DMT probably plays a role in this process
*  But this would change everything because we could over time learn to
*  Simulate
*  This connection if we can simulate the connection then we can control the connection we might be able to communicate more directly
*  with these entities
*  By the way this this theory which I call NTT or neural neural transduction theory
*  If in fact if people go to neural transduction theory comm they can read all about it
*  Piece I published in Discover magazine
*  The point is that this kind of theory would really help us a lot
*  Because of the mysteries. It's the mysteries that we try to ignore
*  But we can't
*  the dreams
*  the dreams come on
*  Why does a dream sometimes have nothing to do with your daily life sometimes?
*  It's just so amazing
*  So amazing and so wild and
*  And then you get up because you have to pee and you're struggling because you want to continue this dream
*  You want to hold on to this dream? This dream is amazing
*  But by the time you reach the toilet, it's gone and you can't get it back
*  Why because it was streaming that's why it was streaming and the stream stopped
*  That's why you can't get it back because you weren't generating it it was being generated
*  Through this point in time, you know, you know the famous
*  feeling of the Sistine Chapel and
*  There's I think it's Adam and I think there's God and these two fingers like that and there
*  You know that there's some communication happening there. That's extremely important. That's what I'm talking about. I'm saying
*  Let's find out where that is happening
*  Where that connection is and how it works and let's test our ideas empirically
*  Because I think this is a testable theory and let's most important of all
*  Let's figure out how to simulate this because now we can talk directly to these other and these these other
*  Intelligences and really find out things that we just know nothing about
*  I'm very very fascinated by dreams
*  and I
*  I
*  I think it's always it's it's very interesting how we kind of dismiss them as just being hallucinations or it's just oh
*  It's just a dream. You just had a dream, but some of them are so realistic and so bizarre
*  I've always wondered like why do they seem so much like reality?
*  And how do I know what the difference is like maybe reality like as in waking life is a more persistent dream?
*  So when you're saying that it's streaming and that's why you can't get it back
*  What do you think it is? What do you think a dream is?
*  And if you ever talked like lucid dreamers or people that use techniques to try to master the
*  Traveling back and forth into the realms of dreams. Oh
*  Absolutely, I'm talking to all kinds of interesting people these days near-death experiences
*  Fits beautifully I I actually had my staff make a list of these mysterious phenomena
*  Mm-hmm, they came up with a list within a few hours of 58 items. There are so many weird things that we experienced dreams
*  Probably top of the list
*  What do you think they are? I think they're all
*  They all have to do with this transduction. I think they're all indicators of transduction
*  It's a I'm not the first person by the way who's kind of thought of an ideal like this
*  But I think I am the first person who's pointed out that now we actually have
*  Laboratories around the world neuroscience labs where we could test this and I think that's that's what we're gonna do
*  We're so I'm getting this group together and we're gonna figure out ways of testing this
*  Because we have so many wonderful neuroscience labs now around the world. I don't think it's gonna take 50 years
*  I think it's gonna take a few years
*  I think we're going to find support for this theory and
*  Then engineers are gonna start working on how to simulate it. But to answer your question
*  I think that the the the the other
*  Intelligences or intelligence that we're communicating with and that and that elevated us just like in the movie 2001, right?
*  We got elevated
*  There were these black monoliths that appeared and people went up to them
*  You know the chimp like creatures touched them and I think that we we were elevated through
*  neural transduction and I think that's I
*  Think we're going to be able to figure out how it works
*  Where it works what chemicals are involved? I'm
*  99% sure that DMT plays in a very important role in this process
*  And then I think I think we will be able to figure out
*  What these mysteries are really all about and there and
*  It almost amazes me that we can live with so many mysteries like dreams
*  I don't know demonic possession
*  You know, there's so many crazy things that we experience
*  Near-death experiences are fascinating, of course
*  and then there's these other crazy things that happen these this the the
*  Wake-up kind of thing that happens when people are dying sometimes people who've been out of touch
*  Sometimes for years and all of a sudden they wake up second the second hurrah
*  they wake up and they now recognize everyone and they talk and
*  They're fine. And then 30 minutes later they die
*  How how could that possibly be and some of them have severe brain damage?
*  How all of a sudden could they become?
*  Fully conscious again
*  Well, I think it's because consciousness is not really we're not really producing the consciousness consciousness has to do with that connection
*  That connection right hand of God that connection
*  I think we can figure out where it is and what it is and how it works
*  So do you think it's an emerging property of human beings?
*  Like
*  You have to think single-celled organisms did not have the ability to see things
*  I think it's possible that other species have connections like this
*  They're probably nowhere near as sophisticated obviously and they're not connected to the kinds the kinds of
*  sources that we're connected to
*  But I think I'm more concerned about the alien aspect of this where are the aliens, you know
*  What's that called the Fermi paradox the Fermi paradox?
*  Yeah, where are they? Well, it's possible that
*  in fact, I I just read a very interesting book on this subject by a
*  man named miles as an evolutionary theorist and
*  It's very possible
*  that
*  this kind of leap that that occurred with us maybe
*  20,000 years ago
*  it's just
*  It just doesn't happen. It's so rare
*  It's so rare for the exactly the right kind of connection to pop up because I'd remember it has to connect two different universes
*  It's so rare that maybe in fact this book even predicts that if we actually get out there into the universe
*  We're gonna find lots and lots and lots of species that kind of are like us
*  But they didn't get up to that next level. So they're all like chimps
*  Mm-hmm, they don't you only get to that next level if you can make this connection
*  Well, you know, that's one of the most bizarre theories about human evolution
*  Is that with a product of accelerated evolution?
*  Well, this is something Darwin had a lot of trouble with because I say I reread that book
*  recently and
*  He had a lot of trouble with this. He could not figure out how to get from the simple principles he introduced of
*  natural selection how to get from that
*  To morality for example, how do you how do you do that? Right? He couldn't even figure out
*  How do we get to large groups because?
*  Generally speaking except for humans
*  organisms generally speaking
*  Live in certainly primates. They live in very small groups and they can't function in large groups. What about ant colonies? Oh
*  ant colonies are
*  There there there much they're much too much like us in creepy ways because they also of course have wars
*  Yeah, so ants I don't know but I do know that we we did seem to
*  suddenly rather suddenly get to a higher level of functioning and
*  I have I've presented lots and lots of smart people in multiple fields with this challenge for years
*  How does the brain work? Tell me how the brain works without introducing a metaphor like a computer metaphor
*  Mm-hmm, and I've never found anyone who could do it
*  Never even at the Max Planck Institute in Berlin where I I confronted a whole bunch of people with this challenge
*  And then I kept up in touch with them for months afterwards
*  nothing
*  Where is we just tell ourselves stories who make up silly stories a placeholder? Yeah, but you see
*  But transduction neural transduction. That's not one of these placeholders. It's something that we can test
*  And look at the fascination that's been now for decades with DMT
*  What the heck is that and why is it produced by so many different plants and animals?
*  And why does it produce in people a most?
*  Extraordinary experience. I haven't tried it, but I certainly know people who have
*  In fact I said that I was giving a spiel like this to some of my staff and one woman immediately said
*  She said oh, well it changed my life. I go you tried DMT. She said yeah
*  She said the problem was like that. I did it twice and I didn't need to do it twice because it completely changed my life
*  the first time and
*  Then another woman was sitting there goes she goes well
*  I did too
*  And she said same thing if she said that the reality that she
*  Experienced on DMT was much realer than the reality. She experiences in our life
*  Yeah, that's what it feels like
*  Has that been your experience as well? That's what everybody says. Yeah, it's whatever it is. It doesn't seem like an illusion
*  It seems like another reality. Well again
*  It's produced mainly at night by the pineal gland not necessarily
*  Rick Strassman from you know Rick. Yeah, he
*  Now believes that it's produced in the brain itself
*  And it's also produced in the liver and the lungs and it might not be the pineal gland that's producing it at all
*  They've kind of changed their perspective on that with the Cottonwood Research Foundation
*  Some of the studies that have been doing on it
*  But they know that in in some animals it's produced there as well. I mean they're doing rat studies
*  But it's whatever it is. It's produced by the liver the lungs. It's like it's
*  It's endogenous it's it's the most potent psychedelic known to man and the human body makes it and it's illegal
*  That's what Terrence McKenna had the greatest line about that. He said everybody's holding
*  Which is funny. It is like you have a schedule one substance that's made by the human body
*  It's literally like making saliva illegal. It's the stupidest thing ever
*  But think about this
*  We don't know what it does. We don't know what it's for right, but it's out there all over the place
*  Right and people do have these very unique experiences on it and people over and over again say
*  That reality is more real than this reality
*  Well, you know, it's also very similar in its compound to psilocybin
*  especially when it's processed by the body and
*  That's one of the more interesting theories about how humans became human was McKenna's stone-dape theory
*  He thinks that human beings when there was climate change in the savannas as the rainforest receded into grasslands
*  we started experimenting with different food sources and
*  flipping over cow patties because there's more and undulate animals in these fields and that we started eating mushrooms that were growing on the cow patties and
*  Mushrooms increased visual acuity make people more amorous. They started having more sex
*  They make them better hunters because the visual acuity
*  induces glossolalia
*  Creates language all these things associating sounds with objects that all these things
*  Blossom and then there's the doubling of the human brain size which coincides in a
*  Timeline with that Dennis McKenna does the best job of explaining it Terrence was, you know a bard and a fascinating sort of a philosopher
*  But his brother Dennis is a hardcore scientist and the way he explains he talks about the actual physical mechanisms
*  The different things that happen to the human body when they encounter this this substance
*  Which also there's a bunch of different ways that people endogenously stimulated. There's holotropic breathing that was it's probably stimulating that
*  There's a bunch of different states of meditation that people can achieve
*  There's Kundalini yoga, which I know people that have both done DMT and are regular
*  Practitioners of Kundalini yoga and they seem to think or they seem to at least state that they can achieve these states
*  Of consciousness without taking the actual drug itself. They can force their brain into making it. I
*  Think what's happening is
*  that the pathway
*  the the quality of the connection is being changed and I think that's what we can test and
*  So I again I've been working with people in multiple fields
*  Are you saying that you think we're connected to it always and then the quality of the connection is changed by in by?
*  Iowaska right in dimethyl triptamine. That's what's happening. So it's just enhancing the quality of the connection, correct? And I think
*  At the opposite extreme. There are a lot of things that go wrong with our brain
*  maybe when we just get drunk or maybe when we get clubbed or
*  That really
*  Diminish the connection diminish it or or just cut it temporarily
*  And
*  I think I think all of this is testable and the only problem is so far the neurosciences labs
*  Have not been looking for this. They've just never looked for evidence of transduction
*  But I think when we start looking for it
*  We're going to find it and that can make two big changes in the way
*  We see everything it can make a change in that we finally begin to understand
*  how the brain and
*  Makes us as intelligent as we are it turns out it's it's not a self-contained processing unit
*  So it's not playing the role we thought it was playing but it is very critical in the transduction process very critical
*  Hmm, it's preparing content for transduction. And of course, it's bidirectional
*  The microphone is unidirectional, but the brain is a bidirectional transducer. Hmm, so
*  And it'll it'll change the way we see the structure of the universe
*  So it's interfacing with consciousness rather than being conscious itself. Oh, it's not consciousness. No, it's it's a
*  It's a it's an avenue. It's a it's a pathway and that is what is connecting us with all this other
*  stuff this this stuff
*  You know, I I
*  My mom
*  Who passed away about a year and a half ago, but my mom
*  In those last couple years she kept saying that she was hearing
*  Music and she loved music. She always loved music
*  but she was hearing music that she had never heard before she said and she would sometimes try to hum the music or sing the music and
*  She said it was always coming from downstairs and then people with my mom was
*  very
*  She was very sarcastic in her manner. And so
*  Someone would say well, I don't hear anything and she go
*  Well, maybe you should get your hearing checked because she just assumed that it was real. I
*  Expressed the concern that it was the music was always downstairs
*  I said I'd be more comfortable if we're coming from upstairs and she goes oh, no, she says don't worry
*  I'm not going to hell. I said, okay
*  Okay, fine it's coming from downstairs, but that's a perfect example
*  You know where where is that stuff coming from or even people who hear voices? Right? Well if you have a pathway
*  Into another domain where there's intelligence
*  Anything could come through it could be with the weird stuff that happens in brains. It could be music you've never heard before
*  It could be voices telling you what to do
*  See what I mean, look at these mysteries are just so many of them and yet we sit here
*  Complacent complacent complacent and then we make up stories
*  That's what we do
*  We make up stories and as long as the grammar is right, we think we've got it figured out
*  What do you mean by making up stories? Well like the computer metaphor, you know, if you go back in time
*  To explain human intelligence at first it was God with some sort of Holy Spirit
*  Then at some point it became there was actually a metaphor involving
*  Liquids movements of liquids and then there became mechanical machine like, you know kind of Descartes kinds of things machines
*  That somehow explained consciousness and intelligence and the metaphors keep changing over the years
*  Right now we're stuck with the computer metaphor. It's still a metaphor and and it's silly
*  It's a silly metaphor and I think we have to face up to the fact that our brain is
*  Doing something unique and special and
*  That we couldn't always do it
*  There's a point in time before which apparently we weren't doing it
*  Then there's a point where we started to have this ability and I think this could explain the Fermi paradox because
*  Again according to this book by Mills is was quite interesting
*  Unless somehow something uplifts you
*  Beyond just what normal evolution can do you're stuck. You're being a chimp. That's it. You're stuck as
*  Chimp forever. No morality
*  Small groups. Okay, but humans are fundamentally different. We did make that leap
*  The one Darwin couldn't figure out and I think this is the leap
*  So I've also been I started out in math and physics a long time ago
*  And I've also been looking at the at the physics and the physics is there the physicists
*  They know that this reality is just not it
*  so
*  Take take those two problems
*  That is to say the structure of the universe is actually very rich and complicated and very hard for us to imagine and
*  The fact that we have no idea how the brain works and add to that all the mysteries
*  You could you could take care of all of these problems
*  With a neural transduction theory, especially if we can find supporting evidence
*  and
*  when you say
*  the universe
*  We you're talking essentially about all aspects of it including like subatomic particles
*  Which is like the deepest mysteries when things become magic and things don't make any sense at all
*  Well, I think frankly if we could if we could simulate this connection
*  We can actually
*  communicate directly with other intelligence
*  Intelligences and actually find out answers some to some questions. We're having trouble answering on our own
*  Frankly even the biggest mystery of all the God mystery
*  You know, of course ironically DMT is sometimes called the God particle
*  But even that mystery I think we probably could get some insights on
*  Even that mystery because there I doubt the God of the Bible exists
*  But there's got to be something
*  You know some godlike entity involved in
*  in
*  creation, you know, I think creation is much more complicated than we think it is but the point is I
*  Think that if we can communicate directly
*  That's that's to me that you know, I get these fantasies like building a nationwide
*  And a monitoring system and building a dashboard so people can watch it in real time
*  When that thing actually started to exist, I thought this is crazy. I can't believe I cannot believe that we did this
*  I
*  Think this is I think this neural transduction stuff I think is of the same nature
*  Now and then I get this I get this funny
*  Feeling it like an intuition maybe that and I have it for neural transduction in others
*  I'm pretty sure neural transduction is right. In fact, I've there's a whole bunch of people now that I've convinced
*  Including including a physicist who's
*  Apparently going to be driving up here later today. I'm gonna dinner with him
*  But he's he almost instantly just got it because
*  A good theory and this is what Darwin keeps saying in
*  His book he keeps saying a good theory
*  Explains a lot with very very simple principles and that's why he kept saying
*  you know
*  Natural selection was such a good theory because it explains so much so many
*  Crazy things like like he's points to a particular species that's on an island and has these characteristics
*  And it has similar characteristics to the mainland that's nearby
*  He goes alright, but over here, there's another island similar species, but has very different characteristics
*  But it has characteristics similar to
*  The species on the mainland which is nearby
*  He said now you could invoke God and say God is just kind of like this
*  You know checkerboard kind of arrangement
*  So he just scatters species about in this way, but he said there's a simpler way
*  Which is just natural selection and you know some organisms move from the island to the mainland or or the other direction and
*  They end up sharing characteristics and we doesn't that make more sense?
*  He keeps saying and to me that's what neurotransduction is at this point
*  I think it explains so much so simply
*  I think it explains so much so simply and it's consistent with this notion
*  that
*  evolution is
*  fabulous at creating
*  transducers
*  Mmm, somehow we've ignored that
*  And so as we've dug in farther and farther we are finding the weirdest transducers and all kinds of species
*  especially sea creatures and
*  So couldn't it you know if that's if there is a way to connect two universes
*  couldn't evolution
*  Find a way at some point right
*  When you're talking about this connection
*  Are you talking about some sort of a technological intervention? Are you talking about just natural selection?
*  Creating this connection and enhancing it in new people. Oh, I'm definitely
*  Talking about it arising naturally organically organically absolutely
*  But separate from that I'm saying that as we've as we've been able to simulate so many
*  Aspects of what happens, you know in the organic world
*  We're even creating organic transducers now, you know, not just these mechanical ones. We're creating organic ones, too
*  I think that if we can figure out how it works, we will be able to simulate it and
*  That again will change
*  Everything because right now what happens happens naturally and I think you're right. There are some people who
*  through through the certain practices and maybe the use of
*  certain drugs
*  You know can can kind of alter what happens along that pathway
*  But it's a lot of work a lot of dedication
*  I
*  Think though that we can we'll be able to simulate this
*  When be with some combination of technology and perhaps organic material, how do you imagine that we would simulate this?
*  Do you think we would come up with something that would you know how they use like electromagnets to?
*  stimulate parts of the brain that have been
*  Sure hurt in trauma and are not firing anymore
*  They do that with people that have traumatic brain injuries and they give them back a lot of their function
*  Do you think there'd be something like that like some kind of technology that would stimulate your brain's ability to produce these human
*  Neurochemicals and just do it in much larger quantities
*  Yes, I think we could
*  or do it voluntarily I think we can find artificial means of
*  Improving the connection. Yes
*  Improving the nature of the connection. Yes, I think the nature of the connection is based on human neurochemistry
*  I do and
*  But I also think separate from that that we can create devices
*  like we have a you know knee replacements and hip replacements and we don't have brain replacements, but
*  there's a lot of
*  Stuff that we've been able to study in organisms and basically replicate in various ways
*  Sometimes just using
*  Technology and you know spare parts and sometimes we're not using actual organics
*  But yeah, I think we can do that too so that we can alter the nature of the connection occurring in someone's brain
*  But I think also we can simulate it outside of the brain and that's where real power would come from
*  so when you say by simulate it outside of the brain, what methods do you think would be able to be
*  Efficient at doing something like that or make it effective. Well, I mean like a box. There's a box. Okay, I'm stealing this
*  Chimpanzee skull. Yeah, so there's a so there's a box. Okay, and literally this box
*  Is taking is is a transducer like this microphone and it's taking
*  Content from our universe and it is sending it into the other and this is bi-directional
*  so it actually can send signals back as well and
*  I'm saying I think we can figure out how to do that. So what would that box be tuning into specifically? I
*  Don't know because I don't know. I don't know. That's the point. No one knows what that is
*  You know, no one knows what's happening in that gap, right between the two fingers
*  But because I think no one's been looking
*  You know
*  We have all these clues and we have the DMT stuff and we have people's experiences and you know
*  We have all so many different clues. We have people who see ghosts and you know, they're they're clues
*  But you've got to put it together and you have to put it together in my opinion in neuroscience labs and in physics labs
*  And you've got to get those people talking to each other which they generally speaking have never done
*  That's often the key to dramatic increases in our understanding of
*  Whatever it is. That's often the key is bringing together people from very different fields who generally speaking don't communicate
*  In this case, it's mainly
*  physicists, especially astrophysicists and
*  Neuroscientists and as I say I've been doing this I've been reaching out to people now for a couple of years and I'm finding
*  I'm getting this group, you know and I
*  Strassman's on my list. I'm gonna I'm gonna reach out to people you've suggested and I think we can I
*  think we're just gonna have a ball first of all it just getting us all together and
*  Getting up and giving little speeches about how how you think you could test this theory
*  Maybe about how you think you could build an interface
*  I think we're just gonna have a ball. I think what's important it ties us in with your research is that all of this
*  Would lead to an improvement in human communication
*  Human community the way we interface with each other the way we exchange information
*  And the way we collectively act as a group
*  whereas the manipulation of this information for political goals for
*  financial goals for
*  you know
*  ideological capture for
*  Manipulating the way human beings think about things is really the contrary to that. It's the opposite of that effect
*  It's the exact opposite and you know, look I I'm I
*  am an idealist I I
*  in my classes for years and years just for fun, I would give a I
*  distribute a test of idealism
*  Because I always wanted to see whether any student could score as I did as high as I did
*  And I never found a student who could score as I as high as I did on a test of idealism
*  So that's the these things that I work on they're all of that of that nature
*  And yes, if you if you if you kind of take this neural transaction idea and try to think ahead a few years
*  This could be the key to telepathy real telepathy. This could create a
*  kind of unity in humankind that has never existed before and
*  It could also connect us more meaningfully with intelligent entities outside of our universe
*  You know in the early 20th century when they first started studying ayahuasca, they wanted to describe they wanted to use the label
*  telepathy for
*  Harming but unfortunately harming had already been labeled and so, you know because the rules of scientific nomenclature
*  They kept the term harming but these people that weren't aware that that harming had been isolated
*  we're trying to call this stuff telepathy because in their experiences in the jungle when they were taking this stuff they were
*  Experiencing these group telepathic moments and they had to say these are hardcore scientists
*  They decided that this was such a profound experience and so replicatable that they were gonna call it telepathy
*  It was really interesting really speaks to what you're saying. Well, you know, it could be that work. We're going full circle here because
*  DMT
*  You know, which is which is I guess a key a key component in the in ayahuasca
*  DMT has got to be playing a role here. It's just got to be you know, it's it's it's staring us in the face
*  All these little pieces in my opinion have are just there. They're just there
*  Well, it's in so many different plants that we have developed a thing called monoamine oxidase
*  That breaks it down in our guts so that we don't get high from all the plants we eat
*  Which is pretty crazy well
*  But again, it just drives the point home that
*  Our world is is kind of it's telling us things
*  It's telling us there's a component to our world that we've missed and that the fact that this this
*  dimethyltryptamine exists in so many different plants and animals
*  which brings me back to complacence because
*  That's that is one of the things that's driven me nuts
*  Nuts
*  Regarding all the discoveries I've made about new forms of manipulation made possible by the internet and now the monitoring systems
*  showing more and more and in more detail that these
*  techniques are actually being employed on a massive scale and
*  Again, it's the complacence, you know, we're complacent about things
*  That we don't need to be complacent about we're complacent about
*  How the mind works and how the brain works and we're complacent about dreams
*  How could you be complacent about dreams dreams are so amazing?
*  I have had I've dreamt full-length movies
*  That are better than any movie of ever seen and then of course
*  I'm struggling at the end to grab on to little pieces and the most I can get are a couple little pieces
*  But I know I dreamt the whole thing by the way, that's exactly the same as psychedelic experiences
*  Really psychedelic experiences are insanely difficult to remember
*  They're insanely difficult to remember in the exact same way
*  Like when you wake up from a dream, you could tell me your dream like oh my god
*  I was on a skateboard and Godzilla was chasing me
*  You could tell me your dream
*  But you won't remember that dream in a while and that's the same as psychedelic experiences when they're over
*  Everyone can kind of tell you what they experienced
*  But it's very difficult to remember it a day later a month later a year later
*  you get like these little flashes like almost like a
*  Like a slideshow a little slideshow. Oh, yeah
*  But you don't remember the experience which seems strange because I remember
*  amazingly profound
*  experiences from my life in vivid detail like
*  Interactions with my children that were just filled with love and happiness, you know
*  And they hug you and cry and it's like there's moments you remember like I'll never kind of forget that there's
*  Moments that I remember just with friends and I'm like Connor in front of this moment with loved ones
*  But not not the dreams not these crazy profound
*  Earth shattering dreams and make you wake up sweating you go to the bathroom
*  You're like what the fuck was that dream about that happens to me all the time
*  And then I go right back to sleep and then the dream goes away and then in the morning
*  I'm like, I'm gonna remember that I don't remember it. I don't remember it at all. I barely remember
*  It's a slideshow your brain is protecting you somehow. There's something and there was something that I was reading actually
*  yesterday
*  about
*  Forgetfulness that it is not a flaw but a feature and that there's something there's a mechanism
*  That's going on that allows human beings to forget things and that in doing so it's very beneficial
*  Not keeping you occupied on those things and allowing you to concentrate on new things
*  So instead of just allowing you to have the free will to decide whether or not to think about the past or think about the
*  Future it tries to get rid of it like stop get that out of here
*  So it kills it it like throws those those ideas away and that this is actually a feature
*  Where people say god, I'm so forgetful, but are you I mean some people are because they have a mental condition, right?
*  They have Alzheimer's they have the dementia they have real issues, but a lot of people
*  What they're really doing is thinking about other things and that's what makes them forgetful
*  They're more concentrating on other things and they can't remember
*  What did I say like like my wife will tell me things I'm barely paying attention and she's like I told you that I'm like
*  Why don't you tell me that like I told you that yesterday
*  I already forgot because it didn't mean anything to me at the time because I have to filter through and then Debbie said to Marsha
*  Marsha was like how could you do that? I was I was gonna say something but I didn't want I
*  I
*  Forget about that that's in and out because I have no room for that, right?
*  But some people remember it forever and you got to think what is that pretty carefulness?
*  Well, this article that I was reading was talking about that forgetting memories is actually a feature
*  And so there might be some component of that that you're not totally
*  Past this bridge that would connect us to whatever that realm is and that you get these brief
*  Interactions with that realm, but you're not ready to be all in yet. You're not ready to be connected to it
*  You're not ready to remember all the
*  Experiences that you had in this mushroom trip that you went on. It's just too much for you
*  So let's just let's just get that out of your system because your regular consciousness is not wired
*  To accept the reality of whatever where that realm is and the fact that the other thing of that realm is there in 30 seconds
*  Especially with dimethyltryptamine
*  30 seconds later you're in an impossible realm 15 minutes later. That's gone 20 minutes later
*  You're struggling to remember it half an hour later. It's mostly gone. Okay, you know everything you just said
*  involved storytelling
*  I'm not telling stories. I'm just saying I think this content is streaming
*  It's not being generated by our brain and that's why we have so much trouble remembering it because we weren't producing it
*  But it's not necessarily storytelling. It's just memories in general. There's something about there's a mechanism
*  I'm telling you that's happening with psychedelic trips where it's almost impossible to remember them
*  And I think that's a feature, but I'm saying something far more radical. I'm saying there is no memory
*  mmm
*  There is no memory. Okay
*  But as applied to everyday life there is no in a practical sense. No
*  Okay, so in a practical sense when you say who's the first president of the United States?
*  Don't you think you have a memory that it's George Washington?
*  I think I might respond George Washington, but it's not stored anywhere in my brain
*  Well, of course it is because that's what you learned. No learn that in high school or where whenever you learned it
*  It's not how do you know if it's not in your brain if it's not stored in your brain
*  So like if I could ask you what your son's name is you know what your son's name is because it's stored in your memory
*  There's nothing stored in my memory and certainly not my son's name. So how do you know your son's name?
*  Well, because I was exposed to it
*  I probably even came up with it a long time ago and under certain circumstances if I'm asked what his name is under certain
*  Circumstances you don't remember his name
*  Yes, that happens to as you get older
*  Especially with your kids, it's really it's really embarrassing and we think that is
*  Well, I'm trying to say that
*  that there is no memory in the brain, I'm saying there's a there's there's a
*  That transduction transduction is occurring and when the brain gets damaged the the transducer like if I smash this microphone the
*  Transduction process right, but you're still avoiding the question
*  How do you know your son's name if it's not in your memory?
*  Okay, memory itself is a metaphor
*  There used to be the old memory metaphor was based on a library and shelves and then there were other ones based on
*  interconnected neurons acting in in cycles and then there were these are all metaphors
*  There is no memory in the brain. So my that article of mine I mentioned the empty brain
*  The
*  That's what it's all about just it explains that there is no memory is the way we use the term memory
*  It's just another metaphor. So for example
*  Who's that wonder of Daniel Barenboim who was one of my favorite conductors and pianists?
*  The time he was 17. He had memorized all 31 of Beethoven's piano sonatas
*  So I had someone count up the notes
*  It's about 350,000 notes and almost as many markings of various sorts for the pedals and volume
*  And all that stuff. It's a tremendous amount of data
*  tremendous amount of data and
*  You know what you can search Daniel Barenboim. He's still alive
*  You can search his brain forever and you'll never find a single note. It's not in his brain
*  So, where is it?
*  Well, it changes what you mean to buy it the the music is nowhere he didn't absorb the music
*  There that he remembered how to make the music
*  No, no
*  He was under some conditions able to make the music
*  Right, but there's no memory involved if someone teaches someone how to do something
*  Mm-hmm. You don't remember how to do that thing. That's not what it is
*  It means that there's that some change is occurring that allows you under certain conditions
*  To do that thing again or something similar to it
*  But if there's like skills that I could teach you you don't think you remember those skills
*  So do I taught you physical skills like I taught you how to put somebody in an arm bar
*  You don't think that's a memory
*  And now it's definitely not it's not a memory no, so what is it?
*  It's a change is some sort of change is occurring whether it's occurring
*  In your brain at some sort of a change or whether it's occurring in the in that that link
*  So how does the brain differentiate between what it remembers and what it doesn't remember if memories aren't real?
*  Maybe I can make point this way. Okay demonstration in class
*  I would say to people
*  Who who knows what a dollar bill looks like so someone comes up to the board and they draw a
*  dollar bill and I'd say I mean now make it as detailed as you possibly can so they draw a dollar bill and it kind of
*  has a
*  place where there's a face and it kind of has some ones in the corners and right usually that's as far as people can get
*  And I and I say well, let's
*  Try an experiment here. So I cover up the dollar bill that they just drew
*  I tape a piece of paper and then I tape up a real dollar bill
*  And I say maybe the person drew what they drew and it was so terrible because they're bad artists
*  Let's find out so I say here now draw a dollar bill
*  So they've got a dollar bill right up on the board and now they draw this magnificent
*  Copying the dollar bill. Yeah, and so they bet so they got but the point is there is no
*  Image of the dollar bill in their head right because they haven't had a detailed
*  Sort of examination of the dollar bill most people just give a cursory examination to a dollar bill you look down
*  Oh, that's a five. Yeah, it's a 20
*  I mean I kind of know was Andrew Jackson's on the 20, you know, you know
*  Most people are not really paying that much attention to it
*  But if you get a dollar bill scholar and someone who really understands dollar bills
*  They probably could like have you ever seen Al Franken draw the United States? No, it's really interesting
*  Al Franken is a very unfortunate would happen that guy because I think you know, I agree fantastic politician still
*  Very interesting person very intelligent and a real patriot. So Al Franken can draw the entire United States
*  Accurately with all the state boundaries from memory
*  See if you can pull that up. It's very interesting. Why because here it is. So Al Franken
*  Has deeply studied?
*  The parameters of the states and the state lines and can recreate them from memory
*  Why because he's done this before and he has a record in his mind of what this looks like because he's
*  Carefully examine that there are things that
*  I've had conversations with people, you know a couple of weeks ago
*  And I probably don't remember them and then there's things where I could tell you word for word someone said
*  There's got to be a reason for that and if you're not calling it memory, what are you calling it?
*  I'm trying to introduce a different concept because I can understand you are doing that but I don't know what you're introducing
*  Well, I'm trying to tell you that if you cut open Al Franken's brain
*  You will never find a map of the United States that he can do that and he he is the same thing as me
*  I can't do that. Yeah, and you're and you're wondering why well because I tell you why because I haven't tried to do that
*  and studied it and
*  Memorized how to do it the same way I could teach you how to memorize certain movements
*  I could teach you how to memorize certain physical movements
*  And then if you practice them, I could ask you in a couple of weeks try to do it again
*  And you'd be able to do it
*  But maybe you'll forget certain key points of those movements so then I would correct you and then I teach you well
*  You would remember how to do those and then I would say what are you supposed to do with your hand?
*  You're like, oh left hand up. That's right because you remember
*  Yeah, so you might not be able to find that in your brain
*  but it's very clear that something is going on where you are able to memorize things and
*  Memorize them better with music right conjunction junction. What's your function, right?
*  We all remember that why because it's attached to music and music makes things easier to remember
*  I've never heard that in a pattern my whole life. You never heard conjunction junction
*  No, but the point is schoolhouse rock, but you do understand
*  You do understand though, right that there are people who could glance at a map of the United States never having seen one before and then could go
*  To a board and draw the whole thing in detail
*  Yeah, they have a different kind of memory and then generally those people are on the spectrum trying to tell you there is no memory
*  There's no memory. Okay, there's nothing you know one looking into the brain
*  I is there anyone that can draw an accurate map of the United States without having ever looked at an accurate map of the United
*  States I doubt it
*  Okay, but there are people who can draw things from their dreams that they have never seen before
*  But they have seen them in their dreams and how do we know if they're accurate?
*  But it might be as accurate as that dollar bill drawing
*  That
*  Okay
*  Do you are you open to the idea?
*  That memory in the brain is just a metaphor
*  Sure. Okay. So are you open to the idea that there is
*  Possibly no memory and we still could do all the things we can do but there's no memory
*  Well, you're calling it memory, right?
*  And I'm saying as a physical function as a function a thing happening. There's a you can memorize things
*  That's how you learn a new language, right? You memorize, you know, mi amo el rogan, you know, that's how you do it
*  You remember right? So if you're saying that that doesn't exist. I'm saying what is happening?
*  Give me some sort of a replacement. I am I'm giving you transduction
*  Right, but where's it stored? I don't know. Okay. I want to find out that storage
*  Don't you think we should find out couldn't you use the term memory to accurately describe that storage? It's not but it's not in our brain
*  Right. So the people who are looking in brains and looking for memories that they're not fine
*  Just that they haven't found it yet or they don't understand that you're not gonna be able to see it in the same way that you
*  See cells then I've talked to some of the top neuroscientists who study
*  Memory, okay, and the first thing they say is I can't find it because I don't think it's actually there
*  So I'm giving let me ask you this. How do we know what size memory is?
*  So if are they looking in the subatomic realm, are they looking at?
*  Particles that are quantum Lee entangled. How do they know what what they're looking for?
*  Does it is it simply that we have a limited amount of tools?
*  Well a much simpler idea these are all they're interesting concepts
*  they are right, but a much simpler idea is that the
*  Brain look at it. Look at all this space that this microphone
*  This is a very good quality microphone and it takes a lot of stuff in there to work as well as it does, right?
*  So a much simpler idea given that no one's ever found any anything remotely like memory inside the brain, okay?
*  And I actually asked Eric Kendall
*  Who is a?
*  80s at the time and who won a Nobel Prize for his work on a memory in the Applesia
*  I said, how long do you think it's gonna be before we understand human memory and he said a hundred years?
*  Meaning we aren't right. So isn't a simpler idea that the brain is actually
*  Like this the brain is a transducer allowing us to communicate
*  With higher intelligence in another universe. Isn't that a simpler idea? No, no, that's not simpler at all
*  That's way more complex. No, that's super simple
*  It's way more complex than experiences being stored in a functional way so that you can benefit from them
*  Except that there's no evidence of any storage and there never will be
*  How could you say there never will be if he said a hundred years a hundred years is not never a hundred years ago
*  We were exactly the same species as we are right now. You had to be there was the way he said it when I understand
*  Yeah, I understand what you're saying. But if look before they understood
*  Spooky action at a distance before they understood subatomic particles
*  If you try to explain that to someone from you know, 1850, they'd be like, what the fuck are you talking about?
*  But now it's understood. It's measurable
*  It's something that we we agree upon that subatomic particles that atoms that neutrinos all these things exist
*  Bizarre things that we get with there's neutrinos passing through us right now, right from space. There's a neutrino detector in this
*  Antarctica we know that there's these things that we didn't know existed exist as
*  We have more access to technology more understanding of the mechanisms of the mind
*  Isn't it possible that we could say oh this is where memories are stored and isn't it true that if certain areas of the brain are
*  Damaged in particular it will damage memories
*  Isn't that true?
*  It will damage the transduction process. Yeah, okay. You're married to this transducer
*  I'm not saying that it's not in there's something happening. Let's not even say it's in the brain. Maybe it's in the entire body
*  Maybe it's in every cell maybe it's in the DNA whatever it is. There's something in there
*  Well, I'm trying to point out that there the something is something we haven't thought about in the past and it would actually solve
*  So many problems. I see what you're saying in terms of communication with whatever that other realm is
*  But what I'm saying is that there might be and forget about the term the brain
*  Local let's just say local local, okay, there's because we you know when I'm accessing you know
*  Oh, I know how what if I press the turmeric button on the coffee machine. It makes the kind of like
*  that's
*  Locally stored you know other people don't know that if they'd never use that machine, right?
*  This is locally stored information forget about finding it in the brain. It might be in the DNA
*  We don't know where it is, but there's I know
*  You know how to start my car I know how to put it in drive because I've done it before yeah
*  So something is happening where I'm storing information and the more information I store
*  The more it makes me effective at discussing certain things. There are certain things that I don't have any information about I haven't read them
*  I haven't memorized you you are married to the information processing metaphor. I'm not it's just
*  There is no information in the brain
*  Challenging this thing that you're saying that I don't think sounds as complete as you're saying it sounds
*  But the good news is it's testable
*  It's empirically testable and I don't think it's gonna take 20 years. I think it's just gonna take maybe five years
*  I think it's because the labs already exist and it's not like studying
*  You know black holes where you can't really access them and you have to you know
*  Because we can actually study brains and we have lots of great equipment
*  It's just no one's ever looked for what I'm talking about and the point is as I've talked to more neuroscientists and physicists
*  They're saying the same thing. They're saying this has to be right and we just need to look for it
*  We never have before
*  Let's let's speculate. Let's say that they start looking for it and they find evidence that this is actually occurring
*  Don't forget about crazy things the consciousness turns off and then consciousness turns on right what what?
*  Right. Well, what are psychotic states? Yeah, but see that I'm just saying it's a it's just an interruption in a pathway
*  Got it. That's really easy, right which makes sense for psychotic states, right? There's some sort of a disturbance
*  It makes the way the system is running and it's not tuning in to the other side the right way. It takes care of
*  Type of psychotic states just like that. I mean think of how how useful how how
*  you know, it's it's does it does
*  You got to go back and read Darwin because that's exactly what Darwin keeps saying it was it was eye-opening for me
*  To read this book because that's what he keeps saying. He keeps saying look, I know this sounds nutty, but
*  Mm-hmm. It's much better than any other
*  Crazy story that you're gonna tell we're actually just having this conversation the other day with Brett Weinstein
*  Oh really and Brett Weinstein who's a biologist and in his his belief is that?
*  Random mutation natural selection Darwinian evolution, they're all real
*  It's all absolutely happening
*  But then there's probably also factors that we haven't figured out yet and that's that's what shows human beings
*  Like that's how human beings this is the factor that thing
*  This is that this is what gets you up to that next level and it's consistent with the ideas that
*  Physicists have about the structure of the universe
*  Again just
*  Start with the basics that evolution is fantastic at producing all kinds of weird bizarre
*  Transducers and that were encased in transducers from head to toe
*  Couldn't if the universe is what we think it is
*  couldn't
*  Evolution at one point because it's producing all kinds of new traits all the time
*  Couldn't it produce a brain that has that feature that connects us boom, right?
*  We're connected that it might be an emerging quality in humans and then 20,000 years ago to merge
*  And emerged and it just brought us up like this just like in 2001
*  It just mm-hmm we go up to here and that could help explain the Fermi paradox
*  because there could be lots of
*  chimp like creatures all over the
*  galaxy
*  But they just never made it to that level because that's where the weirdness of the whole
*  Accelerated evolution theory comes into place
*  I mean this is you get into the kookiest of kooky stuff the Anunnaki and the Sumerian texts and
*  this idea that these lower primates were manipulated and that something was introduced into their genes and that this something is
*  probably some genetics from some superior race or some more advanced race and that we
*  Took on that and that became a part of us and now it's in our gene pool
*  And now we're moving in that general direction with this different connection. I you know, I've read some of these books. They're really fascinating
*  Truly they hold my attention but page after page after page. I keep song
*  I keep saying yeah, but neural transduction theory is much simpler. It's just one one tiny little change that has
*  I don't think you're mutually exclusive because neural
*  Transduction theory as you're saying if there's these primates on these other planets that never achieved this and then there are ones
*  That have and have transcended that these ones that have transcended recognize this quality
*  That's missing in these chimpanzees and they introduce it
*  We don't need them it's possible, but we don't need them. We have a little that's but that's why it's accelerated evolution
*  It's just saying like look they've they've concluded that primates right now have entered the stone age
*  Do you know that so they're starting to use tools? So it was really interesting, right?
*  So if given enough time you give them a hundred million years
*  Who knows what a chimp is gonna look like a hundred million years from now. They might be like us
*  They might do it naturally the speculation and again, this is not something I'm married to but the speculation this kooky speculation
*  Is that we were visited by extraterrestrials?
*  extraterrestrials that were far more advanced and that they found us as these simple shit-throwing primates and they said let's
*  Let's juice this process up a little bit we know where this is gonna go eventually hopefully everything works out, but let's juice it up
*  Let me connect what you just said with what I've been saying
*  easy connection, okay, and
*  It brings us into the world of UFOs
*  Because whether this capability arose on its own which it could
*  or whether
*  It was juiced up a little bit by some outsiders
*  Which it could which it could then either way. We're now in a position
*  Where we could in theory communicate in more meaningful ways?
*  with
*  extraterrestrials we could and
*  We might by understanding how transduction works we might figure out how to do that
*  So not just communicating with people in another universe but communicating with
*  extraterrestrials
*  Some of these extraterrestrials in fact most of them maybe all of them have to have this ability
*  They have to have that transduction ability or they never would have gotten above chimp level
*  So maybe this is our way of connecting with them as well
*  And that we're on the path, but we're not quite there yet. We're not quite there yet
*  We're not quite there yet, but I think we could get there
*  really fast and again some of these neuroscientists I've been talking to they are saying the same thing because
*  This is not like studying. I don't know. This is not like studying. I'll say black holes again, but
*  This is different because we've got
*  Thousands of labs some of them extremely sophisticated labs. We're just not looking for this
*  What happens if we start looking for this and so what we've been doing is we've been trying to work out
*  Experiments that can be conducted and that should produce
*  One result or another depending on whether transduction is occurring and that's the goal is find empirical support
*  For this type of theory if we can find empirical support the more support we find obviously
*  The more convincing this will be and then that would bring in the engineers
*  It's the engineers who could really make this thing sing
*  so
*  It's a it's another one of my intuitions call it that but I think I think the I
*  Think the the data are all around us
*  They're all around us and by the way, there are a couple people
*  I have turned on to this who just all of a sudden become obsessed because all of a sudden you see all around you
*  reminders of all the weird stuff and
*  You realize wait all this stuff that seems so weird. You know what? It's not weird at all if NTT is valid
*  If this theory is valid stuff that's that we think is weird is not weird at all. Hmm
*  In fact, it's it makes perfect sense psychosis you brought up psychosis
*  But there's so many things like that and
*  They and all of a sudden they're not mysterious at all
*  They make very good sense. How about something one of my favorites is a deja vu
*  Or how about meeting someone that you feel like you've known them forever? Mm-hmm. I've had that happen. Sure
*  It's an amazing experience. It's visceral. It's so powerful. It's so strong
*  How could that possibly be well see if you've got
*  Neural transduction theory there in your in your toolbox you go. Oh, that's easy
*  Hmm hmm
*  Yeah, lots of stuff just falls into place
*  Now I have to point out that I'm wearing this idiotic
*  Starburst thing mm-hmm team big tech comm. Oh, thank you every time you say that I just get the chills
*  Because I need help I
*  Desperately need people's help. So we have spent seven million dollars building the world's first nationwide
*  Monitoring system that is doing to those bastards what they do to us and our kids 24 hours a day
*  We are surveilling them for the first time we are finding
*  Overwhelming evidence that they are very deliberately and systematically messing
*  With us and our elections, especially I
*  Personally have believed that as of 2012 the free and fair election at least at the national level has not existed
*  It's just been manipulated
*  It's just been manipulated it's just been manipulated since 2012
*  I say this in part because I met one of the people on Google's
*  Tech team on Obama's tech team either I should say which was being run by Eric Schmidt head of Google at the time
*  And I talked to him a great length about what the tech team was doing. They had full access to all of Google's
*  shenanigans all those manipulations
*  and
*  one member of that team
*  Asked by a reporter
*  How many of the four points by which Obama won?
*  How many of those points did he get from the tech team and the guy said?
*  Elon Kregel I believe his name is his it was actually quoted and he said two of the points came from us now
*  Obama won by five million votes roughly and
*  Two out of four points came from the tech team. That's two and a half million votes
*  By 2016 I had calculated
*  That Google could shift
*  And it would be toward Hillary Clinton, of course whom I supported at the time
*  that Google could shift between
*  2.6 and 10.4 million votes to Hillary Clinton in that election with no one knowing
*  she won the popular vote by 2.8 million votes if you take Google out of that election the
*  Popular vote would have been tied
*  Couple days after that election everyone every all the leaders in Google get up on stage this this I'm sure you've seen this
*  It's an amazing video and they're talking to all of Google's hundred thousand employees and they're one by one
*  They're going up to the mic and saying we are never going to let that happen again. Yeah
*  We are never gonna let that happen again, which is democracy. They're never gonna let democracy happen again. Exactly
*  That's what I'm saying. And so crazy to be blatantly and openly talking about that and
*  In
*  2020 we didn't it's a virtue. We already had a pretty big monitoring system
*  We preserve 1.5 million ephemeral experiences our data show that Google shifted at least
*  6 million votes to Joe Biden who won the popular vote by about 8 million
*  So again take Google out of the equation
*  That would have been pretty much a tie in the popular vote and Trump would have won 11 out of 13 swing states instead of 5
*  so
*  Going forward from roughly
*  2012 I think that the free and fair election has been an
*  illusion and
*  Illusion and this is something that's very weird and kind of ironic
*  But this is something that Dwight D Eisenhower warned about in that last
*  Speech of his his farewell speech. He warned about the rise of
*  Military industrial complex everyone's heard about that, but he also warned about the rise of a
*  Technological elite that could someday control public policy without anyone knowing and
*  The technological elite are now in control. That's what we have
*  that's where I get back to my my ranting and my my pain because I realized
*  No one is paying attention
*  Eisenhower said we have to be alert or this will happen
*  We have not been alert and the fact is people write this second
*  Who I give speeches to sometimes they get all riled up and then they walk out of the auditorium with their
*  Surveillance phones mine is not this is a secure phone
*  But they walk out with their surveillance phones in their pocket and they use all the surveillance tools
*  That Google has set up for them and other companies too now
*  And they think isn't this nice this company is doing all this nice stuff for me and giving me all this free stuff
*  That's not the business model all those free things are just
*  apps that trick you into giving up personal data and
*  Then they monetize the data and they use it to control you
*  That's what's really happening
*  What's really happening that's the business model and people can't see it and
*  I'm telling you I've been working on this for 12 years and it's gotten to the point where I am
*  Wiped out I am
*  Fed up. I am
*  exhausted I am
*  disillusioned and
*  And
*  And I'm lonely because since misty was killed five years ago
*  I sometimes feel like I'm literally dying of loneliness and the fact that other people around me have been hurt
*  one quite one quite seriously
*  Makes me a little nervous too and
*  That's where I am at this point and it's a it's a terrible place to be terrible
*  Now
*  It took seven million dollars to build what we've built
*  But it's been really tough
*  Okay, we're talking about like raising a dollar at a time
*  It's been really really difficult and for us to set this up so that it's actually permanent and self-sustaining
*  And so we have court admissible data in all 50 states, which will make these companies
*  think
*  It'll make them think think twice maybe
*  That is going to require at least another 50 million dollars
*  That gets us a secure facility and our own servers and a security team. We have
*  virtually no
*  Security hear that Google and they know this because a couple months ago. They attacked us in an
*  Extremely sophisticated way. I've never seen this before you say they who I don't know
*  Someone I don't know Google has what did they do?
*  It was very very
*  Unusual it was not
*  It was it was not the usual thing. What they did was they
*  They got our our accounts they got our they got our apps to to run
*  Kind of at ludicrous speed I guess you could say and what they did was they pulled in more and more and more servers
*  Until we were running so many servers
*  Simultaneously that we actually got shut down in the cloud
*  And we lost access to our own data for almost two weeks
*  Now we've never seen an attack like that. Even though our security people had never seen an attack like that
*  It was really pretty what was the mechanism of this attack? How'd they do it?
*  We're not sure how they got in once they got in all they did was they just created a tremendous amount of activity
*  So that pulled in more and more resources and this is definitely created. This is not organic
*  Oh, no, no, that's absolutely created. But and now now we're now that we
*  Know about this particular kind of attack if it happens again, we'll be up within two days max
*  but
*  The point is there's a lot of pressure on us
*  So we need a lot of money to set up a secure facility have security teams not just protecting our data
*  For protecting our people we have to protect our people
*  Have you ever talked to Elon about this stuff I
*  I've never had a way to reach him
*  Well, hopefully someone will take this clip and put it on X and he's a junkie. He'll be on it all day
*  So so hopefully someone will put it to his attention and put it up there
*  Because I'm sure this is very concerning to him. I mean he has a
*  Vested interest in this clearly what happened when he purchased Twitter and he found out the extent of government interference in
*  free speech and
*  how many people were being pressured to
*  not talk about certain things that were inconvenient or
*  How many accounts they were trying to get taken down because these accounts were purveyors of misinformation that turned out to be absolutely
*  accurate
*  There's he has a deep distrust
*  For well, he has a few times lately. He has retweeted content about my work
*  So I think he might be he might be aware
*  And there's another way also by the way to take down Google
*  which I
*  Published this in Bloomberg Businessweek if you if you go to Epstein and businessweek.com
*  you'll actually see the article and
*  And it's
*  We've reached the point
*  where data have become an essential part of our lives and
*  The way to take down Google is to do what governments have been doing for hundreds of years
*  to declare their index
*  The database they used to generate search results to be a public commons
*  This is exactly what governments do when water
*  Electricity telephone communications any commodity any service becomes essential
*  Governments at some point have to step in with the electric companies. They were all privately owned. I didn't know that I didn't realize that they were all privately owned
*  until the government had to step in and
*  This is where we are now with data and the biggest baddest
*  Database in the world is Google's because it's the gateway to all knowledge
*  To all knowledge it needs to be declared a public commons as I say ample precedent for that in law
*  It's very light touch regulation and what it'll do is it'll allow other people to draw from the database to create their own
*  Niche
*  search engines, so
*  You know, you'll create a search engine for people interested in
*  DMT and UFOs
*  Someone will create one for women for Lithuanians for you know
*  We'll end up with thousands of these search engines all of which via are vying for attention. It will be exactly like the news
*  Exactly like the news the news media that domain and that's the way it should be search should be
*  Competitive Google Google was not the first search engine. It was the 21st
*  So that's how you do it and also then search would become innovative again
*  There have been there have been no innovations in search for the 20 years that Google has dominated search. So
*  General Paxton can Paxton of this this great state of Texas. He's interested in this
*  Senator Cruz is interested other people are interested this would be tough to implement in the US but the EU could do it
*  Because five of Google's data centers are in the EU the EU could do it in a flash and
*  They're very frustrated with Google because they've been trying to keep them under control for a long time now and they've failed
*  So there are some things that could be done
*  Permanent large-scale monitoring system that is a necessity
*  That must be there because if you don't have that you don't know what these companies are doing
*  You don't know how they're messing with our minds with our kids minds and with our elections
*  You have to monitor and you have to have court admissible data in every state and probably in every country and then they will
*  Pull back a little bit because they have to
*  They're violating campaign finance laws when they when they very blatantly
*  Support one candidate or one party
*  They're making huge in kind donations without declaring them
*  so
*  Another thing they're doing right now perfect example of something our system is capturing right the second right this second
*  Google is sending register to vote reminders to Democrats at about two and a half times the rate they're sending them
*  to Republicans
*  How do I know because that's what that's what the modern system shows that's what they're doing at some point that's going to turn into
*  Partisan mail-in-your-ballot reminders and then that turns into partisan go-vote reminders
*  These are just displayed on Google's home page. We're capturing the home pages by the millions if you don't capture them
*  Then the content is ephemeral and it disappears and it's gone forever and you can't go back in time and figure out what they're doing
*  so monitoring is
*  No longer
*  Optional it's it and it by the way monitoring is fast
*  unlike, you know regulations and laws
*  Monitoring can keep up with whatever the tech company is dishing out the next company the next Google after that
*  Monitoring can keep up you if you're going to have an internet and
*  It can mess with people's lives and it can mess with
*  Governments and elections and so on then you've got to have monitoring systems in place. So that's what I've been
*  That's what this new
*  My monograph is about and if people want to get a free copy of it
*  Team big tech calm tame tame tame tame big tech calm
*  You you crack me up sometimes really tame I'd love to see you do a comedy
*  retain
*  Listen Robert. Thank you for being here
*  I really really appreciate what you're doing. If you weren't doing this, I don't know if it would get done
*  I don't know if we would know as much as we know. I think it would be speculative
*  I think people would have ideas
*  I think it would be impossible to prove and I think what you've done is a tremendous service for people
*  So thank you very much tame big tech calm. Thank you, but I'm still fed up just so you know, okay
*  Thanks Robert, yep, bye everybody
*  You
