# Joe Rogan Experience #1547 - Colin Quinn
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [October 08, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckjwkCbGIu8)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day.
*  Colin Quinn, I had to move to Texas to get you on this podcast.
*  I tried forever to get you in LA.
*  You said no chance.
*  Not true.
*  Oh, okay.
*  Every time we see each other, we just, yeah.
*  I was always like, I'll get out there one of those days.
*  I'm glad I waited this long.
*  I can savor it.
*  I can appreciate it.
*  I'm savoring it right now.
*  If I was on one of the first podcasts, I'd be like, yeah, I was on Joe's and I was on
*  this one.
*  This is like, you know, you're getting the respect you deserve now.
*  I see.
*  What is it like in the lockdown for you?
*  You still living in New York?
*  Yeah, I live in New York.
*  Is it weird?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I was telling everybody, it's, you know, it's very, it's not like people like,
*  oh, it's like New York in the 70s.
*  Now, the 70s was a whole different vibe.
*  But now, it's all boarded up stores.
*  The store in my corner, like the corner bodega basically just closed and it was, you know,
*  it was around for a long time.
*  And, you know, it's depressing.
*  Like you're on the subway, there's only a few people on and it still smells.
*  It smells as bad.
*  They've been cleaning it every day and it still stinks.
*  It doesn't even smell better.
*  That's how ingrained it is.
*  And you know, the pigeons are homeless because Antifa took down all the statues so they have
*  no place to live.
*  And yeah, it's a very, it's a very weird place.
*  You can't say, like people that say it's like the 70s, like no, the 70s, it was like, it
*  was the 50s and the 60s and the 70s.
*  It was like, it didn't change much.
*  It was seedy and weird.
*  But it was always like that.
*  This is a drastic change from six months ago.
*  You can't say it's like the 70s because it's not.
*  It's like something's deteriorated.
*  There's a collapse.
*  Right.
*  And then there's all this weirdness that comes along with that.
*  Well, the 70s was kind of a collapse, but it was a different type.
*  So like in the 70s, all the stores at night would be locked up, but they were open during
*  the day.
*  So at night, if anybody's out after night at night, that was on them.
*  But I mean, but it was not like now it's just 20 walking down deserted streets.
*  There's nobody out. You know what I mean?
*  Have you always lived in New York?
*  Depressing. Yeah.
*  So so it was sketchy in the 70s.
*  Oh, my God. Yeah. I mean, I did a whole I did a whole show about it, basically.
*  But I mean, it was basically like we're in part one of the jokes for my own New York
*  story was that it wasn't a joke.
*  It was if you walk down your block because there's no cell phone.
*  So if you walk down the block from the train after nine at night, people would lean out
*  the window and be like genuinely surprised, like good for you.
*  You made it home. If you if you stayed out after nine, like Times Square, people would
*  go to Broadway shows by 11 o'clock.
*  It was deserted except for criminals because people would leave Broadway show.
*  They wouldn't go out for a drink or dinner.
*  They would get in their car and get out immediately.
*  And Giuliani is the one who cleaned all that shit up.
*  Giuliani cleaned it up. Yeah.
*  Isn't that amazing? The guy gets no respect now.
*  Now I know he went a little crazy, but he really he he did what no politician has ever
*  done in any in history, which is he said, I'm going to transform this.
*  And he did. He turned it around.
*  Yeah, he really did.
*  He really did. Maybe a little too far.
*  Like it may have been a little too far.
*  Times Square became like a mall.
*  Yes, Times Square is very uninspiring.
*  It became like a big Applebee's.
*  But that's yeah, that's exactly that's exactly what it's like.
*  And, you know, even though like now I look back and I go taxi driver, New York, it was
*  edgy, it was fun. But at the time it was no joke.
*  People, you know, I glamorize it through rose colored glasses, but it was serious.
*  Yeah, that's the thing about crime and crime written areas.
*  Like people always glamorize it after the fact.
*  But if you're living there while it's going down, it's fucking terrible.
*  Yeah, yeah. I mean, most people love New York.
*  Once he took over in the 90s, people forget that.
*  Yeah. That everybody was just like, I can go out at night.
*  Oh, I can work. I can.
*  And I mean, before that, it was it was crazy.
*  And I used to bartend around Times Square.
*  And I mean, the stuff you saw, you know, was just brutal.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Well, one of the things we're finding out from this lockdown is that it really is
*  important who your mayor is.
*  It used to be important.
*  He didn't really care.
*  People didn't care who the mayor of L.A.
*  was. Half the people didn't even know.
*  That's right. And now they're like, who is this motherfucker
*  that's keeping everything closed? Yeah. Yeah.
*  And the same thing with New York.
*  Oh, yeah. Well, we did.
*  Blasio from day one.
*  A lot of people like, oh, and now everybody hates him.
*  But this is his second term. Yes. He got reelected.
*  Oh, he swept both elections.
*  That's hilarious. You know, and now we're finding out. Yeah.
*  Oh, he's he's a dipshit. Yeah.
*  Just took it took something.
*  Whereas a crisis where you realize like this is not a leader.
*  And everybody hated Bloomberg for running a third term.
*  They wish they had him for fifth now.
*  Yeah. Members like, oh, he's forced himself to run for a third.
*  Now, when he misses, you know, a guy like him, could he go back?
*  Could he run again? Because he can't be president.
*  No one's not going to vote for him for president.
*  But I don't know.
*  He was so terrible in the debate.
*  It's so funny because
*  the thing about Bloomberg that disappointed me as president was when he was mayor,
*  when he first got elected mayor, I was
*  Darrell Hammond had to bail on some show he was supposed to do.
*  So at the last minute, they asked me to do a favor, do
*  a guest shot at the show, which I go up.
*  Really didn't go that well.
*  But it was, you know, I did what he was asked me.
*  What kind of show was a standup show?
*  But it was a show for Bloomberg.
*  Yeah. Bloomberg was trying to get the the Olympics here or something.
*  The only idea was the Olympics.
*  So he asked me to, you know, the Darrell's was a show and he had something else.
*  So I ran over and I lived in Midtown.
*  I ran over, literally ran over, did the show in front of the Olympic committee
*  or whatever the committee was. I think it was Olympics.
*  And, you know, 30 people in this uncomfortable room.
*  And then afterwards, Bloomberg shook my hand and I knew he was already a billionaire.
*  And he goes, I owe you one. I go, thanks. Thanks.
*  He goes, no, no, no, I don't just say that.
*  I always repay my debts. I owe you one.
*  So I was kind of hoping to be president.
*  And then I could call in my chit because I never did the whole time as mayor.
*  Well, I see was busy. I let it slide. But he still owes you, though.
*  Yeah. You got it on a ledger somewhere.
*  No, but I just have my oral.
*  I believe in the or I have the oral history. Oh, yeah.
*  I mean, I thought it came right out, didn't it? Yeah.
*  It's not like I got it. Oh, yeah.
*  So maybe if he becomes, can you become mayor again?
*  How does that work? Can be president again?
*  Can you be mayor again? I guess you can.
*  Yeah, why not? There's probably no law.
*  We'll govern California that Jerry Brown guy.
*  He became governor again. That's right. Yeah.
*  So if he can be governing, you've got to be mayor.
*  He was governor in like the 90s, like the early 90s, I think.
*  I think in the 80s, because I think Johnny Carson used to make those jokes.
*  For smoking crack, didn't he win again in D.C. for being mayor?
*  Yep. Yeah, yeah.
*  Marion Barry. Yeah. There you go.
*  I wonder how many terms he did, though.
*  I wonder if there's like a limit on how many terms you could be.
*  You're more politically minded than I am.
*  Like, I don't know that kind of stuff, though.
*  No. How many terms can you be a mayor?
*  Because someone like Bloomberg has got to come back in and clean New York City up
*  because it's you're not going to get there with this social justice warrior
*  attitude that de Blasio has.
*  It's just going to lead to more complete deterioration of that city.
*  Yeah, but it may it may be too late.
*  You never know. Too late.
*  You never know. I mean, nobody likes to think in New York that way.
*  But it's like a lot of people.
*  So many people moved that I was shocked, moved to the suburbs that I was like,
*  wow, this is serious.
*  Like, I didn't really believe it just because I'm so New York.
*  Like, I just I don't even think in terms of leaving New York, even even though,
*  you know, it's irrevocably changed to me before any of this happened.
*  But so many people moved out.
*  I was like, this is getting serious.
*  What did you think about that?
*  Altucher, Jerry Seinfeld will feud about New York is dead.
*  Fuck, you know, it's not. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  I mean, look, you can argue either side of it and be right.
*  You know what I mean? Like, I don't want it to be dead.
*  But at the same time, I'm not going to pretend it's not in deep trouble.
*  Yeah. So I mean, I just don't know how it gets out.
*  That's what my worry is. I know.
*  Unless Covid gets cured and then Ari Shafir thinks artists are going to start
*  moving in again. But that's he's one of those guys. Right.
*  He's got that, you know, because you need to be gritty.
*  Oh, New York City needs to be gritty. Right.
*  And now, guys. Yeah. But never been mugged.
*  That's why never really had the fuck beat out of them.
*  Yeah. You do need a couple of those in life.
*  You just need to know that it's possible.
*  Just need to be like, oh, what does gritty mean to you?
*  Let me tell you, it's a fucking it's not Midnight Cowboy.
*  That's a movie. Yeah.
*  Real gritty is you get stabbed and then it gets infected.
*  And then you're in the hospital for six months.
*  Yeah. You need to at least have had had regretted laughing
*  because you're holding your broken rib for six weeks in a row.
*  Is this ever going to get better?
*  Yeah, it's that gritty shit is like, boy, yeah, I see what you're saying.
*  I kind of get I know. Yeah. Some places are gritty. They're fun.
*  Yeah. No, it's it's funny.
*  Like I said, when I'm watching Taxi Driver, I'm like, yeah, I miss New York.
*  But I mean, I would walk.
*  I remember walking through Times Square.
*  We don't have to ask what I was doing at 12 o'clock at night.
*  By myself, 1980, 81.
*  And literally they had like thieves dens above the porno theaters.
*  They had thieves dens.
*  So like they go through they had a little turnstile.
*  I went in one once with this kid.
*  He was taking me there.
*  I forget we were trying to do something shady.
*  And he went we went up and it was like 50 like thieves, like like like Oliver.
*  Only New York.
*  Really? Like a gang of people with illegal goods, trading illegal goods.
*  Right up on 42nd Street. Wow.
*  It was crazy.
*  As you see gangs running down, if anybody was they just swarmed somebody,
*  take their stuff, leave them on the ground and just keep going.
*  The thing about it is, though, the the disrespect to the police right now.
*  Right. It leads it to a very difficult situation of trying to bring it back.
*  It's like that didn't that wasn't the case in the 80s and 90s.
*  People respected the police.
*  Like when they when Giuliani brought it back, there wasn't this
*  overall nationwide resentment of the police force like we're having now,
*  which is pretty unprecedented.
*  Well, I mean, there sort of was in New York, actually, at that time.
*  There's a couple of incidents where, you know, but yes, not like this.
*  This is a different this is a luxury
*  that people were able to indulge themselves by by putting all,
*  you know, lightning rod sort of, you know what I mean?
*  Like the police, to me, it's like a proxy war.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Everybody knows cops. Everybody knows cops are nuts.
*  We all had the friend that you grew up with.
*  You're like, what if it happened to him?
*  He became a cop. He became a cop.
*  But but you know, no one denies that part.
*  Even cops know that. Yeah. About themselves.
*  But that being said, it's easy for everybody to just go, OK, like I say, proxy war.
*  So all the bottled up racial resentment in the country.
*  And it's like the people that have to actually go and say, hey, listen,
*  here's what has to happen.
*  They're going to be the they're going to be the fall guy for that.
*  And that's you know, I mean, that's what this is, in my opinion.
*  Well, you know what it is.
*  It's like social media only captures the things that are viral, right?
*  With the things that you're going to watch are only going to be viral.
*  And the ones that go viral are the ones that are really bad.
*  Yeah. I mean, nobody wants to see.
*  There's no viral videos of a cop pulling a guy over and having a laugh with them.
*  And so listen, man, you're going 63 and a 55.
*  Just do me a favor. Slow it down.
*  All right, sir. I'm a big fan of the police.
*  Thank you, sir. Appreciate you. Appreciate.
*  Shake your hand. Bye. Take care.
*  No, instead, you have some asshole
*  grabbing some black woman and pulling her out of the car and body slamming her.
*  And you like these motherfuckers. They keep doing this. Right.
*  But you could have millions of interactions with cops. Yeah.
*  And you're only going to see one.
*  And you decide that all cops are pieces of shit when there's these hundreds
*  of thousands of cops that are great guys that are just doing a really difficult job
*  and trying to keep it together.
*  But one or two a week. Yeah.
*  Is going to go bad.
*  And that's all you need to know.
*  And everybody thinks that the world is falling apart because you see those videos
*  and those videos get two, three, four, five million downloads.
*  And and everybody just thinks that all cops are terrible people.
*  And it's just it's not the case. Right.
*  No, exactly. But try telling people that.
*  And they think you're a cop apologist.
*  Yeah, they say you're a piece of shit.
*  Yeah. You're a white supremacist. Right. Right. Right.
*  Yeah. Stand down and stand by.
*  What the fuck was that?
*  A Trump that tell the white supremacist to stand down and stand by.
*  And it's one of those moments where you're like, you know, it's basically
*  the like the one thing you wouldn't.
*  It reminds me like not like Nero fiddling while Rome burns.
*  I feel like it's when all the Roman senators go, so what are you going to do now?
*  Nero and he starts taking the fiddle out of the case and like, no, he's not going to fucking.
*  Is he going to fiddle right now?
*  This is he's really fiddling, right?
*  But you were saying earlier when we were talking outside that he just
*  called the KKK.
*  What did he just say that somebody else?
*  Oh, somebody else was out there saying that he called them a terrorist group.
*  Right. Didn't he say that?
*  Like, I don't know. Is that the case, Jamie?
*  Someone out there was saying some of the law.
*  I forget who said it.
*  He called the KKK a terrorist group like the week before or labeled them.
*  Is that true? I don't know about wording it that way is correct.
*  I don't think he called them that.
*  Let's see what he said.
*  Again, he didn't he didn't call them that the White House labeled.
*  Oh, the White House labeled them a terrorist group.
*  He didn't say it somewhere or whatever.
*  Right. But that opportunity, it was so funny.
*  Like he's telling Joe Biden, I want you to say law and order.
*  You can't even say it. You can't even say.
*  And he didn't say it. Right.
*  And then he said, you know, I want you to denounce white supremacy.
*  And then Chris Wallace is like, Mr. President, do you denounce white supremacy?
*  I tell them to stand down and stand by like,
*  the people that were like strategists, probably like, what the fuck?
*  He's like, you can't say bye.
*  He's like, whoa.
*  Hey, come on. I don't get it.
*  What about you?
*  All you had to do is say, yes, I denounce white supremacy.
*  Of course. All you had to say.
*  See, but that's why you should be moderating this debate,
*  because you could be physically grabbing both of them and saying, listen,
*  here's what's going to happen now.
*  Instead, Chris Wallace, like, excuse me, guys.
*  What? I mean, he's not.
*  You need alpha.
*  You have to be able to physically walk up to the podiums and put people.
*  Well, that's why I was saying that big John McCarthy,
*  they need the UFC referee, big John McCarthy, the famous big giant dude.
*  He can handle that shit.
*  He would tell people to sit the fuck down. He was a cop.
*  Yeah, he knows how to like control.
*  I would be laughing.
*  The problem with me, I would be like, oh, my God, what a shit show.
*  I would turn to the camera. I'd break the wall.
*  I'd be like, ladies and gentlemen. Yeah.
*  You just got a real fucking problem.
*  Yeah. Folks, you may want to tap out on this country.
*  Yeah. Jesus. Canada don't look so bad right now. Yeah.
*  I know that Justin Trudeau is kind of a pussy, but they said a lot of.
*  What do you mean? He was a boxer. Was he? Yeah.
*  Already was.
*  I played basketball a couple of times. I don't call myself a basketball player.
*  Well, maybe he's the kind of boxer where they're like, hey, listen,
*  that's the prime minister's son. So if he hits you, just flinch.
*  Don't hit him. Oh, one of those. I don't know.
*  Yeah. There's a lot of that going on.
*  I've seen that before. No, I'm sure.
*  He actually did. He did have a boxing match.
*  He's a little too handsome for my taste. Yeah, I don't like it either.
*  Beautiful man. He did blackface at least 30 or 40 times.
*  That's right. Didn't he? In Canada, it's different.
*  I think he played Indian people or something.
*  Oh, that's right. Right. Right. Right.
*  Black. He was like brownish.
*  Yes, it's indigenous face. Yeah.
*  It is kind of funny.
*  You're like white face. White faces.
*  Like no problem at all. Right. Good luck.
*  Yeah. You know, you could be white face.
*  No one cares. Oh, yeah.
*  Can you play a redhead if you're not a redhead?
*  Is there any shame in that?
*  Well, would you want to is the first question.
*  But second of all, no.
*  If someone had to do like the Andrew Santino story.
*  But I don't know Andrew Santino.
*  He's a comic.
*  I mean, very funny. Yeah.
*  But Pilbara's he's bald.
*  He's too bald to be called.
*  Yeah. It's like it's hard to call him a redhead now.
*  Who would like Carrot Top? OK, Carrot Top.
*  Yeah, that's that's the most famous like clearly.
*  I mean, it's in his name. Carrot Top. Yeah. Right.
*  Could you be is there any shame in that?
*  No, no. No. Why?
*  Nobody ever owned redheads.
*  No, I did, because there were a lot of Irish slaves. Right.
*  Yeah. Back in the day, the whole thing was Irish.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Where the original redheads were?
*  Well, it's probably from the Scandinavians.
*  The Vikings had a lot of redheads like Eric the Red.
*  Oh, right.
*  That's the only reason I think Vikings had redheads.
*  The guy's name is Eric the Red.
*  Hmm. Probably had a red beard and blonde hair.
*  Probably covered in blood, too. Right. Oh, my God.
*  Those motherfuckers.
*  You ever go to you see those people in Iceland
*  that win those strongman competitions? Yes.
*  They're the remnants of the Vikings.
*  They are enormous human beings that live in the frozen north
*  where the Vikings lived.
*  The only thing I know is that the word berserk comes from them.
*  Berserkers. Yeah.
*  They used to come down and go berserk.
*  And you know what they used to do? They used to take mushrooms.
*  They did. Yeah, that was their big thing.
*  They would take mushrooms and slaughter.
*  Now, wait a minute. Where do they get mushrooms up there?
*  I thought mushrooms are from South America.
*  No, mushrooms are from all throughout Europe.
*  Mushrooms are all throughout North America.
*  They're native to a lot of different climates.
*  Well, they would preserve them, too.
*  They would get them in the summertime
*  and then they preserve them in the wintertime.
*  But I'm 99 percent sure that was a part of the history of the Vikings
*  is that they would they would take a lot of mushrooms.
*  Well, when when I was growing up, I mean, I consider myself the early.
*  Here we go. Fly, Algaric mushroom.
*  Yeah, that's the emanated muscaria.
*  The first account of Vikings going berserk because they ate magic
*  mushrooms was hypothesized in 1784 by a Christian priest named Odman.
*  He came to a conclusion that connected the berserkers
*  to the fly, Algaric mushroom, because he read that Siberian shamans
*  did the same thing when they were healing.
*  Hmm. That show Vikings. Yeah.
*  See that show? No, fun show.
*  They take mushrooms in that show.
*  But the did Vikings eat mushrooms?
*  Let's do that.
*  See that that's they connected to the emanated muscaria, red and white mushroom.
*  So that's not the same mushroom in the Viking movie
*  or the Viking television show.
*  It looks like they're taking psilocybin.
*  Some scholars propose that certain examples of the berserker rage
*  had been induced voluntarily by the consumption of drugs,
*  such as the hallucinogenic mushroom, emanated muscaria
*  or massive amounts of alcohol.
*  But here's my problem is that when I was growing up, we had a lot of mescaline,
*  which is basically mushrooms in organic, you know, it was like chemical.
*  What's that sort of mescaline is actually a yoding.
*  Yeah. But mescaline is that I think it's more it's in the stimulant category.
*  I think even more so is going to prove my point.
*  When you're eating mescaline acid, any of this stuff, mushrooms,
*  you don't tend to want to get violent.
*  That's true.
*  But if you live in a completely violent world, right.
*  And you took mushrooms, I don't think it would turn you peaceful.
*  No, and I turn you peaceful.
*  But you might be like, I'm just going to stay in the forge.
*  You know, these guys are going on a stupid trip.
*  You're going to go on an 18 hour trip to go and rampage through some civilization.
*  You know, here's why I disagree.
*  It's become a thing with fighters to take mushrooms and fight.
*  What? Yeah, it's it's actually really common.
*  And the thing is, they're not really testing for it.
*  So there's certain fighters that are taking mushrooms
*  and then competing in kickboxing, competing in MMA on mushrooms.
*  On mushrooms. Yeah, that's the hilarious.
*  That's one of the greatest things I've ever heard.
*  Well, they say it makes them way more effective
*  and then they almost can like read things better.
*  They're locked in better.
*  I could see locking in, but you also get trails and stuff like that.
*  This goes on. You know, maybe it's how much you take.
*  Like maybe just take a dose that's also you got to realize these people are
*  like their adrenaline is through the roof.
*  Like the effects of the mushroom is probably very different
*  if you're about to go into a fight.
*  My adrenaline was through the roof when I was 17.
*  Now, listen,
*  Doc Ellis, of course, took the acid.
*  That was a famous one. Yeah.
*  But that's not a game.
*  Oh, yeah. He's pitching no hitter.
*  He pitched a no. Yeah.
*  Pitching no hitter on acid.
*  But this real there's real evidence that, though, in some circumstances,
*  psychedelics can enhance your performance.
*  Well, I'll tell you.
*  I'll tell you a story when I'll tell you.
*  Probably the third time I took acid, maybe I was 16.
*  And this is a fight.
*  It's got violence in it, but it's not that I was.
*  So I was I was at a Sweet 16 in Brooklyn.
*  You know, it was a mob.
*  It was a mob run place, by the way.
*  So you do Sweet 16.
*  This has a lot to do with my whole life when I really look back on it.
*  So 16, I was in love with this girl.
*  She wasn't dating me, but she was at the party.
*  But the way they set it up.
*  So it's like, here's a Sweet 16.
*  Here's an office party.
*  They're all in the same room.
*  And then there's a stage down at the bottom.
*  And here's, you know, some guy that, you know, just got his
*  you know, you retired from the job, whatever job
*  then you have, you know, so it's like 15 different events
*  of two tables each at this place, Palm Shores Club, it's called in Brooklyn.
*  So I'm at the party with my friends and there's this girl I'm in love with,
*  but I haven't dated yet.
*  And we ended up going out for a couple of years of this.
*  But so she I'm tripping on acid.
*  And then the one of the other groups that was with our group,
*  because the girl in Sweet 16 had our other friends there, too.
*  One of these guys sold pot to the girl I loved.
*  So a bag of weed.
*  So she's like, you know, Brooklyn, she's like, look at me.
*  Beat me on the sweetie.
*  So me like four joints.
*  What a ripple force.
*  So me, shit night and shining armor.
*  And I go up to him.
*  I don't know the long tables, two or three long.
*  Excuse me. Tap him on the shoulder, you know.
*  Excuse me. She feels like she ordered her.
*  I'm not dating. I'm just, you know, I'm in love with her.
*  She shorted you on you shorted her on the sweet.
*  So, you know, you might want to give her a couple more joints.
*  Because like, no, I didn't. Turns away.
*  Listen, excuse me.
*  You know, she feels you did.
*  You gave her four joints, whatever.
*  In those days, you get like six joints for a big fat olive bag.
*  Maybe seven. Yeah.
*  I was like, yeah, kind of shorted her.
*  I'm still not sure to this day if he showed her, by the way, I didn't count.
*  You know, you were just being a white knight.
*  I was just being a white knight.
*  So he goes, no, I didn't get fuck.
*  You know, just basically like, you know, he has to show his pride, too.
*  He's letting this guy tap on the shoulder a couple of times.
*  He's with his friends.
*  I'm with my little friends.
*  And I go and he goes, get the fuck out of here.
*  Like, you know, just, you know, now I'm starting to annoy him.
*  You know, and he's like, was this bad?
*  You know, he had to do that.
*  So I was like, ah, bah, jump on him.
*  Start punching him in the middle of a giant event.
*  Oh, no. Jumping, punching him.
*  That would, you know, a ruckus erupts.
*  You know, it's like a whole place.
*  So our tables going crazy screams, you know, fights.
*  And the grandmother, my friend wrote a song about it, by the way, the next day.
*  And because the grandmother kicked me in the ear.
*  My whole my whole ear was caked with blood because I'm ruining it.
*  Grandmother kicked you in the ear.
*  Yeah, the grandmother.
*  While you're scrambling on the ground on the ground.
*  I mean, he was caked with blood because I'm ruining a granddaughter's 16.
*  I don't believe me.
*  And they're breaking up.
*  But meanwhile. Oh, so anyway, long story short, I'm still I'm tripping.
*  So like this is like the third time I've tripped, maybe maybe the second.
*  I was on acid. I had done mescal and everything else.
*  So I'm tripping.
*  So finally they drag me out.
*  I'm picked up like bodily.
*  It's a mafia place. Remember downstairs in the basement.
*  These two guys, a couple of young, the young mob guys, you know,
*  I could tell it like young thin, you know, guys.
*  They didn't look like to me like my.
*  And stop punching me.
*  And then they just look at me.
*  I could tell they were just like, look at this guy is so pathetically
*  pussy whipped.
*  They just tell him my eyes.
*  I was just like, get him out of here and just toss me onto Evans Avenue.
*  It's a big street in Sheebs Bay.
*  And then my friends drove by like I'm walking, you know, stumbling along
*  like three minutes and my friends drove by because they left to they had to leave.
*  And they just could not stop laughing.
*  I'm just standing.
*  But here's the weird part about the story is that on stage
*  was this old man who at that moment was doing standup comedy.
*  And to this day, anytime I have like hecklers, I'm like, that's karma.
*  Because I was the guy that ruined his and he's going, come on, fellas, calm down.
*  I heard him say that.
*  And at the time I noticed because I was like, why is there an old guy
*  so old doing standup?
*  But he's probably a guy, you know, doing it at that time.
*  And she said, was some knock around joint getting paid, getting paid.
*  And then an idiot ruins his whole show with a brawl
*  over a five dollar bag of weed over a bag of weed, which may or may not have been short.
*  And when you think about that, like, have you ever done gigs like that?
*  Did you ever have to do like a like a kids party or anything like that?
*  Oh, my God. Yeah. I mean, did you?
*  You mean gigs where you just where you just don't.
*  I mean, sure. I mean, you have a bachelor parties.
*  I did a couple of those.
*  But bachelor parties, they suck. Yeah.
*  But at least it's not like you ever do a gig where you don't
*  when you first start out, where you're not you don't have enough clean material.
*  And you walk in, you go, I can't.
*  I have to cut every curse out and you have nothing left.
*  You realize I have nothing to say to these people.
*  Oh, because my act is for nightclubs and this is not a nightclub.
*  It's a daytime club. Yeah.
*  I've done a couple of those like just small events
*  where just you feel like it exposes every flaw in your comedy.
*  It does. It does.
*  So does small shows. It does. Small.
*  That's the beauty of small shows.
*  They're like a cleansing agent. Yes.
*  All the fat in your act.
*  All the fat, all the cheat, all the momentum that's just based on them.
*  All the horses, the curses.
*  Yeah, just all right there.
*  And these people are looking there and they dress nice.
*  And I did a car show when I think two years in was like an afternoon show,
*  like 200 bucks, which in those days, like 200 bucks afternoon show.
*  I went there and it was just maybe 50.
*  And I was too new to know that I was walking.
*  I didn't even realize.
*  But like now, if you walked in, you'd be like, OK, this is a nightmare.
*  Here's what I got to do.
*  That was like a really smart thing that Chris Rock used to do a lot,
*  is he would show up at the store unannounced late.
*  So he would go there where there was the audience is down to like 15, 20 people.
*  And then he would go up with the shit that he was working on
*  and he would find out what's good and what was bad.
*  Because when there's 15 people and they're spread out, there's like three here,
*  two in front of you and five over there. Yes.
*  You really know what the fuck is good and what's not.
*  If you're there in front of 300 people like, oh, my God, it's Chris Rock.
*  Everything he says is amazing.
*  You're with your date like, wow, we got lucky tonight.
*  Chris Rock's here. Yeah.
*  But if you're there, there's fucking 15 people.
*  It's one in the morning.
*  Like then you find out how much of your material is nonsense.
*  Oh, my God. Yeah. No, of course.
*  I mean, that's that's where you really get exposed.
*  And it's the best any of your best sets. Yeah.
*  But but the negative side of it is then you listen to the tape
*  like a lot of that was free association.
*  You know, it wasn't that great.
*  Well, that's the thing about comedy.
*  Like I feel like comedy to really develop a good set.
*  It's almost like it's like cross training.
*  Like you needed to lift a little weights, but you also need to do some jogging.
*  Like you need to do a bunch of different things and you need to.
*  You have a big crowd.
*  So you see if this is a set that you could that's really worth filming.
*  And then sometimes you have to have a little crowd where they're not impressed
*  by you, they're not there to see you. Absolutely.
*  And you see if they can if you can if this stuff
*  that really can resonate with people that don't even know you.
*  Absolutely. Absolutely.
*  I mean, that's the beauty.
*  The reason we're all still so obsessed with comedy is because of these little
*  that it could still surprise you every time and still challenge you every time.
*  Yeah. There's a million things where you're like, I can't believe
*  I know so much and I know so little after all these years of doing it.
*  You know, well, the beautiful thing, too, is every time you do,
*  especially become a beginner again,
*  because even though you know how to craft the material,
*  the material you have is dog shit.
*  And it's like it's on Bambi legs.
*  And you got to you got to figure out a way to get it moving again.
*  And that's why my new theory, which you're going to like this for the
*  for the Austin Comedy Club, is that down south now,
*  because nobody can work out up north once it gets to be winter.
*  So it's going to be like baseball, how all the Dominicans began.
*  But all the south is where all the great comedians are here year round.
*  Because the covid is going to hit New York City and shut everything down again.
*  Yeah. Once flu season kicks in.
*  Yeah. It's already shut. It's never opened.
*  Comedy clubs haven't opened.
*  But they're open outside, right? A few of them outside.
*  Yeah. But how are they doing that? They're on the street.
*  Like, what are they doing? They're on the street.
*  Well, most of the one comedy club is on the street,
*  but most of them are in like parks or in like parking lots.
*  There's a lot of so weird. Yeah.
*  So how do you get people to pay to sit in a park?
*  Yeah, I don't know. I mean, because otherwise, I mean, people could just walk up.
*  I mean, that's down the outside and listen.
*  They don't have to pay. Yeah.
*  And the parking lot, you always just the problem with doing a parking lot is
*  you know, you could be doing great.
*  You know, there's some idiot outside the parking lot that could start screaming.
*  Yeah. Like when I was 16, I would have done, you know, sure.
*  Honky horn. Yes. Yes.
*  Oh, my God. Or just play Andrew Dice Clay really loud in your car.
*  Just something to distract.
*  Give them a good idea. Yeah.
*  I did a gazebo a couple of weeks ago, a benefit up in Connecticut.
*  And like a wedding gazebo.
*  Yeah, like an outdoor New York or in a gazebo.
*  Yeah, he's doing in Ohio.
*  It's well, it's like a wedding chapel outside wedding chapel.
*  That's where he's doing his shows. Yeah.
*  I don't know. It's in the town square.
*  I was just doing a benefit.
*  And yeah, a couple of kids drove by with the guy before me was on
*  and just honked and screamed.
*  Yeah. Ruin the joke.
*  Do you know Bert Kreischer? Sure.
*  Yeah, Bert's doing a lot of these drive in shows.
*  I know. I know he is. Of course.
*  I go, how was the show?
*  I go, it was great. It was 700 cars.
*  Well, 700 cars.
*  Now that's a lot of cars.
*  Yeah. Yeah. I just did it for HBO Max.
*  I did like a comedy outdoor special with a bunch of comedians from New York
*  and 30 cars.
*  And it was it went back far.
*  How did he get seven?
*  He's doing giant plays. This was 30 cars.
*  And it was way back.
*  Yeah. This must be like.
*  I mean, I can't imagine how far back it must go.
*  It goes far. And they all light their lights and honk their horns and shit.
*  That's right. That's what they were doing.
*  Yeah. Oh, my God. 700.
*  That I'd like to now I'd like to see that.
*  Yeah. But Bert's hammered, too, right?
*  So he's like barely aware of what's happening when the lights are flashing.
*  People are honking. He's having a great time.
*  Yeah. There you got video of it.
*  Like this is, by the way, this is I'm 99 percent sure.
*  So I'm just going to say this.
*  This is all his idea. Look how big this is.
*  This huge. Wow. Wow.
*  There is in Philly.
*  And he did it all across the country.
*  So it takes his shirt off every show because it's important.
*  Oh, my God. Yeah. Yeah.
*  And now he has to. Yeah.
*  Now he has. He's like Ellen.
*  Dancer. Right. Right.
*  She has to dance every show. He's trapped.
*  So this is how he did it.
*  So he would go out and do these crazy shows where he's in the parking lot.
*  They'd set up a stage with lights and everything.
*  Look at that. He's been touring.
*  Look at that. He's one of the only guys that through this pandemic
*  has been regularly touring in a pretty safe way.
*  Look at all those fucking cars.
*  That's crazy. Pretty safe.
*  That's kind of cool.
*  It's actually really cool looking.
*  He said he enjoyed it. He said it was great.
*  He enjoyed it. But you know, but Burt's kind of guy that enjoys things like that.
*  Yeah. Yeah. You know what I mean?
*  Like I could see myself getting aggravated by this and Burt's like,
*  what's the greatest? You know, he he'll be jumping in a car,
*  start making out with him.
*  You know what I mean? Like Burt enjoys stuff.
*  Exactly. Exactly. Yeah.
*  I just I, you know, I miss real comedy.
*  Like Mark Norman said it best.
*  He's like, this is all methadone.
*  He goes, we're all doing methadone.
*  He goes, I want a real shot.
*  He goes, I want I want the real hit right in the veins.
*  He really is. I don't want to take this methadone.
*  These park shows, these outdoor shows and the virtual shows, the worst.
*  Like that's just. Oh my God. Yeah. That's crazy.
*  I've watched good comics bomb on Zoom and I'm like, stop. Yeah.
*  Stop doing that. There's no one there. You can't do that.
*  No, it sounds like it sounds like pigeons.
*  Like, you don't hear laughter.
*  You just hear this weird, weird laugh. What's going on?
*  It's so bad. It's just not a bad.
*  It's a terrible way to do comedy.
*  No. Yeah, it's it's.
*  But that's again, what I love about it is that it makes us really like
*  you realize a lot of people are going to fall by the wayside, too.
*  Yeah, because that money is going to go down.
*  Thank God. Yeah. Thank you.
*  The money's going to go down.
*  The same prep prepping people for low salaries at Austin Comedy Club.
*  The money is going to go down.
*  You're going to design Austin Comedy Club for me.
*  I would love it.
*  But I'd like to really I'd like to curate the audience.
*  How are you going to do that?
*  Already, we had a conflict when I was telling you, I don't want those drunks
*  in the audience like, let them have a few drinks.
*  I'm like, no, Joe, you want to test them all to make sure they're not drunk.
*  Yeah, because I don't like you like, well, some drugs don't heckle.
*  I know. But then they sit there like this and you think they're listening to you.
*  And they're also.
*  Because once I once I was in Cleveland, I was yelling at the whole crowd,
*  so drunk and just horrible.
*  And it was this beautiful couple up front, guy and girl blonde dressed expensive.
*  Like, I mean, they just looked like model movie stars.
*  And I was like, these people, people like this come to see a show.
*  Bop, I just yell at the crowd like heckle.
*  This is a late show, you know.
*  And then I finished in like five minutes later, the couple got up
*  to go to the bathroom with Lever, and they both face planted and passed out.
*  They were so happy. They didn't know I was talking.
*  They didn't know where they were.
*  We finally have a rapid test.
*  So here, like we got tested.
*  We got the same test that the White House uses.
*  So they have a machine do a nose swab and get a result in 15 minutes.
*  So you could conceivably have a show where people would show up, say, 40 minutes early.
*  Everybody gets in line, gets tested when you get cleaned.
*  You can get inside and have a drink.
*  So you could do a comedy club and have everybody with no mask on.
*  You could you could conceive.
*  Yes. The thing is, people like even if people get tested, wear a mask.
*  Like everyone's so mass conscious now.
*  Like when we do the UFC, I can't do in person interviews with the fighters.
*  Right. But I'm tested and they're tested.
*  Everybody's tested. You have to be tested to even be in the building.
*  You have to be clean the day of to be in the building.
*  But yet still, they want everybody to wear a mask.
*  Like, that doesn't make any fucking sense.
*  No, but it's also because when you live in a country that's built on lawsuits,
*  everybody's like, whoa, that sounds like there's 80 people going, don't wear a mask.
*  I want to see what happens just so they can try to sue you.
*  That's well, you'd have to sign a waiver.
*  Well, if you're going to get to Austin Comedy Club, you'd have to sign away.
*  Well, Austin Comedy Club.
*  I hate to say this. It sounds like I'm already abusing the system.
*  But I think the emcee should have to do the testing.
*  They should have to be registered.
*  A registered nurse.
*  You have to be a nurse to be an emcee.
*  You want to host? You got to be a nurse.
*  You got to get there early.
*  Do that. You know, it's a few bucks.
*  Yeah. You know, like hosts would have to like pitch chicken wings at some place.
*  You know, try the wings in this place.
*  Well, I used to bartend when I started comedy.
*  I would bartend at the comic strip, but they wouldn't let me on
*  because they were like, no, it's a conflict of interest.
*  It was a big ethical problem. Really?
*  You had to quit your job as a bartender to be.
*  I quit before I could audition. Yeah. Oh, that's ridiculous.
*  But the stores, the opposite the store, all the people that work there are comics.
*  Everyone, the doorman.
*  But they actually like Ari, when I met him, he was a doorman.
*  He was. Yeah, it became.
*  And then there was the beautiful thing was he eventually filmed
*  his first special at the store, his Comedy Central special.
*  So it was like, wow, what a full circle he made. Yeah.
*  He's he seems more like a comedian than a doorman, if I may say.
*  He was a doorman. I don't give a fuck where you sit.
*  Sit wherever. This place is gritty.
*  This place is crazy.
*  Yeah, but everybody, Tony Hinchcliffe, everybody that works there, they they
*  well, everybody that works there as a doorman is a comic.
*  Everybody that works the cover booth is a comic.
*  A lot of the people that work behind the bar are comics.
*  Well, you guys is crew really turn that place around
*  because I was there in the early 90s and the comedy store.
*  I was there working.
*  You know, I can't even work that much when I've done that.
*  Like, but it was a shithole.
*  Well, not only was it a shithole, Monday was considered gang night.
*  And it wasn't like it wasn't an inside joke.
*  Like everybody knew gang night.
*  The gangs knew it was gang night.
*  So they would have gangs.
*  It was just this crazy atmosphere, like this tense atmosphere.
*  Every Monday night was gang night.
*  Yeah, it was not good when I got there in 94.
*  I got there in 94. It's pretty rough.
*  But occasionally it was good.
*  Like occasionally, like Damon Waynes would stop by or Martin Lawrence would stop by.
*  Like someone good would be there and you'd go, wow. OK.
*  Now I get to see a real comic.
*  But a lot of it was like half empty, not even.
*  Yeah, they had some tough years.
*  A lot of boat acts. Oh, yeah. That's right.
*  Yeah. A lot of guys that really just shouldn't have been there.
*  And my theory was that like Kinnison had left there somewhere around 86. Right.
*  And when I got there in 94, eight years later, it was just still like
*  because before that, it was booming. Right.
*  There was Kinnison, Letterman, and all these guys were there.
*  And then when he left and he was banned from the store,
*  I think he took everybody with him.
*  And I think when I got there in 94, it was like he was already dead.
*  And it was like the echoes of that that his generation had already kind of died off.
*  Yeah. Well, I was when I was in L.A.
*  I was in L.A. in 89, I guess, or 90 or something.
*  88, 89. And the improv was the respectable club.
*  It was what the store became.
*  And the store was already crazy. You know? Yeah.
*  And it was like that in 94. Yeah.
*  The agents wouldn't go there because they couldn't get in for free.
*  Right. Right. Right.
*  Because Mitsui was like, I don't give a fuck where you work.
*  Yeah. Like if you if you were an agent and you wanted to get a table, it's like, pay.
*  Tell them to pay.
*  You know what? I don't believe it because the whole town was an agent.
*  She wouldn't have made a dime. Yeah. Yeah.
*  And not only that, they didn't pay attention.
*  She would say they would talk. Yeah, they did.
*  I remember I went to see a showcase once and they for whatever reason.
*  William Morris had a showcase at a nightclub
*  and there was a downstairs where they had people seated
*  and the upstairs was like this little balcony where there's a bar
*  and it was filled with agents and they were talking full blast
*  while the show was going up. And I said, I'm not going up.
*  I told my agent, I'm not going up.
*  There's no fucking way. And DePaulo was on stage and DePaulo's on stage.
*  He's yelling at these fucking people that are up in the balcony.
*  Like he's talking shit about them. It was terrible.
*  Yeah. It was like the worst atmosphere for comedy.
*  And the agents didn't give a fuck.
*  It was agents assistants, a lot of them. They were drinking and talking.
*  Yeah, they're just laughing. Yeah.
*  They're having a social time. They're having free drinks.
*  You know, it's like this is their their opportunity to chit chat.
*  So while the show was going on, I mean, full blown bar level talking.
*  Yeah. Yeah. It's terrible.
*  So that was what Mitzi tried to avoid.
*  She's like, get him out of here.
*  No, she had the right. She had definitely had the right spirit.
*  So I didn't even know.
*  Kennison was I remember Kennison was there one night.
*  Rich Jenny told me, well, you know, rest him in peace, too.
*  Love that guy. Yeah. Great guy. God, he was good.
*  But he knew he knew Kennison and Kennison owed him one hundred dollars.
*  So he went by the comedy store to get paid.
*  He was in town. He's like, you know, the guy's doing great now.
*  He's making a lot of money.
*  It's like 1988, 89.
*  And he goes, I'm going to get paid from I'm going to go bar them.
*  And he goes to the MC.
*  When he gets off, I'm getting 100 bucks.
*  He owes me 100 bucks. He never paid me.
*  He's rich. I'm just, you know, working the road.
*  And then just then Sam starts screaming at somebody.
*  I can't. You know, that bit he used to do where he goes,
*  I'm going to take this napkin.
*  I want you to write down the names of all your all your loved ones.
*  Your dead grandmother that will always treat you and go through the whole
*  state to somebody to audience and go right down.
*  Your dead grandmother was always there for you.
*  Write down your uncle that paid your way through, you know.
*  And I want you to write them all down.
*  And then I want you to hand it back to me because I'm going to wipe my ass.
*  And he said that he said the guy just exploded, attacked him.
*  Sam's bodyguards just done punch it, you know,
*  turn into like a brawl at the comedy store.
*  The guy was so mad, you know, and then the MC goes,
*  Jenny, maybe she's asking for 50.
*  Yeah, he was I missed all that.
*  I missed the Kinnison.
*  I saw him live a few times when I was an open micer, when I was in Boston.
*  I went to see him three times while he was alive.
*  One time was at Great Woods and one time was down the Cape.
*  And then there was one other time.
*  And it was just it was just it was interesting to see
*  because it was like he didn't have new material.
*  And he was trying to do some of the bits from the old stuff.
*  And people would call out the punch lines.
*  And so then he had he had to kind of write new shit while he was touring,
*  you know, and the HBO special had just come out
*  because it was kind of a new thing back then.
*  Like there weren't a lot of HBO specials.
*  It wasn't. No, no real common thing.
*  No. And he developed that act over years and years and years.
*  Yes. And then all of a sudden he's this hugely famous comedian.
*  They come to see him and he doesn't really have a lot of new material.
*  Yeah. No, that definitely happened with a lot of guys back then
*  where they'd just be like they weren't used to people knowing their act.
*  Yeah. And people like, I don't hear that's the thing about comedy.
*  Musicians, people are calling out for their best hits.
*  Yeah. If you do something new, they get mad.
*  Yeah. Comedians just the opposite. I know. It's crazy.
*  It's such a hassle. But, you know, it's the way it is.
*  And especially Sam's act, because it was all build up.
*  Yeah. And then the big punch line.
*  So there was no in between. Yeah.
*  Yeah. So I got to see like his B level material.
*  I never got to see the A material live.
*  I got to see it on TV.
*  But when I saw him live, it was all kind of like half assed stuff.
*  Yeah. It wasn't really that good.
*  But it was also because his crowd was so annoyingly like screaming at him
*  that he ended up having like he almost couldn't develop.
*  Yeah. Because like you said, he should have been what Chris did.
*  Go in when there's 15 people. Yep.
*  He should have done that. Well, he was just touring. Right.
*  He wasn't. Yeah. Like he developed his comedy by going up late at the store.
*  Right. That was right. Like going up late.
*  He put that act together over years of struggle.
*  And then all of a sudden he was huge.
*  And now he's got to do these thousands of seats.
*  And it's not the same. You can't develop an act.
*  It's just you can. But it's God damn it's hard to develop an act
*  in front of thousands and thousands of people.
*  And how about I know? Yeah, I don't know.
*  I don't know how you could do.
*  I mean, how about the fact that him and Pryor are both from Peoria?
*  Crazy. Isn't that wild? Weird.
*  But he started in Houston.
*  They said Sam in Houston, him and Bill Hicks, all of that.
*  And they said, Sam, one time he like tied himself to the thing outside.
*  Yeah, the annex because they they they censored him.
*  They wouldn't let him go up.
*  Yeah, they those guys, they had developed a real scene down here in Texas.
*  They really did. Hicks had a real scene in Austin.
*  Hicks started out here and then eventually went to went to Houston.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  Maybe he started in Houston and went to here eventually.
*  That's right. I think he started in Houston, did Houston and Austin.
*  And then he went up when he came to die. He died out here. Wow. Yeah.
*  Yeah. I used to call him the Houston comics that hate God.
*  Well, it was odd because Texas is often thought of as being very.
*  That's why they're so obsessed with it.
*  You know, but a lot of like I think a Raffalo came out here.
*  I think she came here during that time, too.
*  That's right. Yeah.
*  They had a bunch of because it was like a scene like I remember hearing
*  that she was coming out here because I knew her from Boston.
*  I was like, wow, that's kind of wild.
*  Like Texas is that like it made me rethink what Texas is in my head.
*  Yeah. And Brett Butler was here.
*  And this was during the 80s.
*  And this was during the Kinnison era.
*  And that was when they had Ron Shock. You remember him?
*  Yeah. Yeah. And do you remember Andy Hinton?
*  Jimmy Pineapple. Yeah. I worked with Jimmy Pineapple.
*  One of the first times ever did the Houston laugh stop.
*  I worked with Jimmy Pineapple.
*  That's crazy. Yeah. Those guys.
*  Speaking of laws of comedy, Andy Hinton used to have a joke which,
*  you know, he goes, so these girls having sex younger and younger these days.
*  I overheard my sister's friends talking about it.
*  They're they're 14 and they're having she's having sex.
*  I pulled her aside. I said, first of all, what we did was wrong.
*  Second of all, telling people about it is not going to make it better.
*  Fuck. Today, you get canceled.
*  Oh, my God. Yeah. You'd be in real trouble.
*  Oh, you'd be in real trouble.
*  All female comics would start Twitter threads about you.
*  Expose him.
*  But Andy Hinton, him and Ron Shock once did a T Sean Shannon.
*  You know him. He's from there, too.
*  And he told me the story about Ron Shock and Andy Hinton.
*  We're tripping one time.
*  And, you know, Ron Shock was, you know, he just was like kind of bregadier.
*  And he goes, there's and then Andy Hinton goes, Ron, you're going to make it.
*  When they first started, he goes, I know.
*  And he goes, he was waiting for him to say it back to him, you know,
*  because two comedians are new.
*  So you said back to each other.
*  Sure. And he goes, and then finally, Andy Hinton couldn't take it.
*  He goes, I'm going to make it, too.
*  And he goes, sure, you are, Andy. Sure.
*  They had a great open mic night back at that laugh stop.
*  That was one thing about the laugh.
*  Did you work that place in Houston?
*  Yeah, the laugh stop. Yeah, it was a great club.
*  But they had the bar area was an open mic night.
*  And then they had the main showroom area.
*  And I remember I came in to do the show there.
*  I did two shows.
*  And from the moment I got on stage, they had the open mic going.
*  And then when I was by the time I was off stage, the open mic was still going.
*  So the open mic would go to like two o'clock in the morning.
*  They had guys still going up.
*  Like it was a real comedy community there.
*  They really worked on their crowd.
*  They didn't tolerate any hacks.
*  No, no bullshit. They were a serious thing.
*  It was a great place.
*  It was a great, great scene.
*  That crazy Mark Babbitt ran it.
*  That crazy fuck. Yes.
*  Yeah, he was a he was a nut, but he really loved comedy.
*  He loved comedy.
*  You got to have a nut.
*  You like like people think, well, you know, that guy wasn't the best business man.
*  Like you're not going to get the best businessman to run a goddamn comedy club.
*  You're going to get nutty people. Yeah.
*  Yeah, I know exactly.
*  Mitzi Shore was a different kind of nutty person.
*  Mark Babbitt was a different kind of nutty person.
*  But all the great club owners were all crazy.
*  Well, the reason Boston was a good scene, too, was a great scene when I started.
*  You know, I came in like 85, let's say to Boston, right?
*  First time ever was because Mike Lenny Clark and Mike Clark.
*  Mike Clark, the money they paid in Boston was like three or four times
*  more than any other place.
*  Three or four times like a gig in New York, pay 80 to be the middle.
*  In Boston, we pay 290 or something because Lenny
*  and Mike was not ripping people off like that.
*  Yeah, Mike's a great.
*  I'm still a good friend of them to this day.
*  I was texting with him yesterday.
*  But I love that guy.
*  And he whatever his thing was, he was just this guy that was like, yeah,
*  you should get paid.
*  And it was like this Valhalla, you know, this.
*  And what was regulated, it was also the big four.
*  You know what I mean?
*  It was like the Mount Rushmore of Boston, Sweeney, Gavin,
*  and Rodgers.
*  And and they were just, you know, they just set a tone.
*  Everybody's, you know, you just.
*  And they were big guys, too.
*  They were big.
*  Lenny Clark's a fucking gorilla of a man.
*  Yes. Big dude.
*  Oh, yeah. It was it was an interesting play because they were men.
*  Like we thought of comedy as being like these do we be like interest.
*  But those guys were doing coke and punching people.
*  They were wild fucks.
*  All those guys were hammered all the time.
*  They're all a bunch of wild people.
*  Oh, my God. They were insane.
*  They brought me up to be Sweeney one afternoon at Nixon.
*  He was just in the back like this.
*  You know, like you want to be Sweeney's and after it was just him in the dark
*  and just looking like it was this audience with the pope.
*  Were you there during the coke days where they try to pay in coke?
*  Yes. Well, not me.
*  I was already clean, but yeah, they tried.
*  They paid people in coke all the time.
*  It was great. It was psychotic out there.
*  What's the only way you get great comedy?
*  I think it's like it doesn't last because it's not sustainable.
*  That kind of a business model.
*  And then the comics never pay their taxes.
*  They all wind up getting audited.
*  And you stop writing because you're coked up.
*  Yeah. Just waiting for the coke deal.
*  Yeah. Yeah. When they had the the guy on the side, I mean, they're dealing coke
*  and uniform and it was nuts.
*  Yeah. Well, I was a famous emcee.
*  I heard that story when I went up there and they pulled the old
*  thing where Sweeney and Chance went on before me and just destroyed
*  the place, destroyed on a Friday second show.
*  And then I end up literally because I remember I'm from New York.
*  I don't understand.
*  It's 1985 or 86.
*  So I don't understand the culture.
*  So I see a bunch of guys in polo shirts
*  with with blonde hair, deck shoes, white pants.
*  I'm like, oh, these must be some spoiled Kennedy guys.
*  Like they look like yuppies, like they look like rich bank robbers from Chelsea.
*  Yes. Yes.
*  But I'm looking at this audience full of these guys in pink.
*  I saw shirts or, you know, and that's exactly.
*  And then these badasses, they're savages.
*  Yes. So I'm like, so I go cursing them because I'm bombing.
*  So, you know, we get into it.
*  They're like, I'm like, you know, fuck you.
*  And just I go, go fuck yourself.
*  You know, I'm just giving the thing.
*  I see you fucking asshole.
*  Get to go back to, you know, Hyannisport and go play touch football.
*  You little put it and these guys.
*  And I start to notice then and finally I start to notice.
*  Wait a minute. Some of these guys have tattoos back in the days when, you know,
*  I'm like, guess I'm like Shermack tattoos.
*  I may be misreading because I didn't know anything about Boston
*  as far as the neighborhoods.
*  I don't know what's going on there.
*  You know, I just saw pink eyes on shirts and, you know,
*  facial scars.
*  Yeah, I'm like, Jesus, these guys are pretty muscular, too.
*  You know, and then long story short, it got so ugly
*  that Joe Yannetti had to come on stage from the back of the room.
*  They took a joke or they'll save it because they're getting ready
*  to rush the stage and beat the shit out of me.
*  The whole crowd almost felt like Joe Yannetti goes on stage and he goes,
*  folks, I'm from Eastie.
*  This is my friend.
*  We're going off stage now.
*  You leave us alone.
*  We're going and he explained to him, I'm from Eastie.
*  He's from one of the neighborhoods.
*  So, you know, I'm a legitimate person.
*  And then we just had to hide in the kitchen until the whole crowd emptied out.
*  Well, if you were a New York guy, you already had three strikes
*  against you go off the stage.
*  Yes, I knew none of that.
*  But yeah, they set you up to they would say I said Billy Crystal.
*  Well, I walked in after the fact.
*  I didn't actually see it, but I walked in after the fact.
*  They were all bragging about it.
*  They set up Billy Crystal with like Sweeney, Knox, Gavin.
*  Boom, boom, boom.
*  They just had a murderous assault of local humor.
*  You couldn't follow. You couldn't.
*  They're talking about fucking Cape Cod going down the Cape.
*  Yes. Having con.
*  They talk in the Boston accent.
*  Everybody's dying.
*  And then you would go up and like, I'm Billy Crystal.
*  Hey, how's that? Do you like the Emmys?
*  And they're like, get the fuck out of here.
*  They did it to everybody.
*  Well, guess what?
*  It's funny you say that because of the local references.
*  The last thing I remembered before I went on stage,
*  I mean, they're ripping is Chance Sweeney.
*  Sweeney's got a mop in his head like dreadlocks.
*  Chance is playing guitar and they're singing a song called
*  Come Back to Jamaica Plain.
*  That's where I lived.
*  I lived in Jamaica Plain.
*  Yeah, it was all local stuff.
*  That was a real problem when I started doing the road.
*  I had so much local material because they loved local material.
*  It was like a cheat code.
*  Like you can get a laugh you didn't deserve with local material.
*  Well, same in New York.
*  You do that subway stuff. You're in North Carolina, which is people be like,
*  what is this? What are you talking about? The subway?
*  We know what it is. But but it's funny.
*  You said the after I was there for the aftermath because I pictured the room
*  when an aftermath when, you know, sometimes you go into one of those clubs
*  in New York, too, but in Boston next.
*  And there was just broken shot glasses thrown around the room.
*  Just chairs turned over and you're like, whoa,
*  what happened here?
*  But it was just a crazy business model that they would set up
*  these headliners for failure on purpose all the time.
*  Yeah, all the time.
*  And if you didn't know, like if you were a guy from New York
*  that was doing the Tonight Show and you're starting to do movies
*  and you thought you were the shit.
*  And they would let you go on stage and they would like, oh, yeah,
*  we're going to have this guy headline.
*  He's going to tonight show.
*  And they would set you up with four murderers.
*  Would go on in front of you.
*  I don't blame them.
*  That's how you when you're making that much money locally,
*  you don't want a bunch of people come to horning in and you're making your then.
*  But by the way, I wasn't a headliner.
*  I was just up there visiting.
*  I was staying at Tony V and Dennis Leary's house.
*  I wasn't a headliner, but they just did it for whatever for sport.
*  Keeping shape. No other place would do that.
*  If you went to Houston, they would give you like a local act to be an opener.
*  It would be normal.
*  I mean, you have good comics, but they wouldn't have headliner
*  after headline after headline trying to blow you off the stage.
*  Right. They did it on purpose. Yeah, they did.
*  Oh, yeah, I know they wanted you to eat shit.
*  These guys were your best 20 minutes.
*  Just like a bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.
*  And you would go on stage an hour and 15, an hour and 20 minutes
*  into a show where the audience was beaten into a pulp.
*  And then these guys would bomb.
*  It happened to me. That's exactly what happened.
*  And I was in the headline.
*  And here's what happened, by the way.
*  I just remembered I was the middle.
*  But chance goes, I'd like to get home early, Colin.
*  Would you mind if I went ahead of you?
*  Oh, and I was like, yeah, OK.
*  Dirty trick.
*  Because I had first show had been fine.
*  So I was like, yeah, fine. Go ahead.
*  I didn't know him. I didn't know anybody.
*  Oh, it was really funny. Dirty trick.
*  They do that on purpose. Yeah, of course.
*  But it was. But, you know, do you really blame?
*  Look, here's the way it is.
*  You're in the city. You're making great money.
*  You know, you're doing getting paid in coke.
*  Everything's set up correctly.
*  Plus, you're Irish.
*  So you're like, who these assholes think they're going to come in here
*  and big shot their way around.
*  It's the perfect Irish arrest to just go,
*  we're going to show you what a fucking big shot you are.
*  The pleasure they got in their souls out of watching that week after week.
*  Of course, they did it constantly.
*  The only person I saw survive that that gauntlet was Dom I.
*  Rara. Dom I. Rara.
*  I can see it. He murdered.
*  He went up there and he was famous enough at the time
*  that a lot of the audience was there to see him.
*  And he was working so much. He was cool as a cucumber.
*  He would go on. And his material was so goddamn so funny.
*  So solid. He went up there and he killed.
*  I remember at the end of it, he goes, he goes, Ladies and gentlemen,
*  I've been Dom I. Rara. I've been great.
*  You guys were OK. You weren't a bad audience.
*  He just had this casual confidence and just.
*  Yeah, he survived the gauntlet.
*  Oh, I tried. I tried to take him out.
*  I could see it.
*  One of the other they set people up.
*  I saw some crazy shows. I saw Bill Hicks get set up there.
*  Oh, wow.
*  Bill Hicks got set up there, cleared the fucking room and never stopped.
*  Never stopped swinging.
*  It was me and Greg Fitzsimmons.
*  We were open micers at the time.
*  And we were sitting in the back of the room at Nick's Comedy Stop.
*  And Hicks started out with 300 people and he was down to maybe 40,
*  maybe 35, 40 people at the end.
*  And everybody had just gotten up and left.
*  And it was a row of comics in the back laughing our fucking ass off.
*  It just like he he was looking up.
*  He had this some bit about someone taking a shit.
*  So he's like grunting over a toilet bowl.
*  And he looks up and he goes, This usually clears the room.
*  And people are just getting up.
*  And just the crazy thing about it was the calmness of his bombing
*  was stunning.
*  Always. I was like, he's so relaxed while bombing.
*  Yeah.
*  No, I never saw anybody who literally would just be like he had such a
*  a zen like attitude about because he did it since he was like 15 or whatever.
*  Yeah. And T.
*  Sean's speaking, they all knew him when he first began.
*  And they said his whole act was joke jokes, hilarious joke jokes.
*  Like he had all this material, but it was all like one liner.
*  When he's 16 and 15.
*  Yeah, there's a video of him when he was really young.
*  Yeah, he was real smooth.
*  And the video is him before he was 18.
*  He's fucking smooth.
*  And then he was like, Hey, guess what?
*  I want to do this a different way.
*  And I mean, he was just a searcher.
*  And also, when I caught him, when I saw him, I saw him live a few times.
*  He'd already quit doing drugs.
*  Yeah. He was already clean.
*  And he just this really strange, introspective, thought provoking act.
*  Right. And people didn't know what to make of it.
*  He really changed comedy in a lot of ways, because a lot of people imitated him
*  because they they they would see him and they would go, you know,
*  comedy can kind of be profound.
*  Right. Doesn't just have to be funny.
*  Like this guy made me feel like what I was talking about was stupid,
*  that I was dumb, right?
*  You know, and then so a lot like I remember in the back
*  green room in the Atlanta punch line.
*  Right. There was a the green room had a graffiti on the wall.
*  And one of the things that said, quit trying to be Hicks
*  because there's so many guys that were trying to be Hicks.
*  Yes. So common.
*  Yeah. People would like tell the audience how dumb they were and how dumb America was.
*  And I know they were trying to be profound without doing all the work first.
*  That's right. That's right.
*  Oh, yeah. I mean, how many people masquerade
*  as, you know,
*  freaking out the crowd with their brilliance, which just that you're not that funny.
*  Yeah, you just mean, you know, first be funny like doctors first do no harm.
*  First be funny.
*  If you can be profound, that's great.
*  That's another level.
*  But don't be up there going, hey, you guys don't get it.
*  I'm bugging. I'm I'm ruining your middle class bourgeois mentality.
*  He's like, no, you're not stupid.
*  When Lenny Bruce did it. Yes.
*  That was shocking. And he was groundbreaking.
*  Don't act like you're any Hicks or Lenny Bruce.
*  I would have loved to see Hicks with a podcast.
*  God damn. He would have had a great podcast.
*  Yeah. He would have had a really interesting podcast.
*  Yeah, you're right. He had some.
*  There were some real interesting interviews with him where, you know,
*  he would do an interview and he wouldn't really try to be funny.
*  Like that was the thing in these interviews.
*  Guys would be like half doing their act.
*  And sure, he did a little bit of that.
*  But for the most part, he would actually talk about shit.
*  Now, yeah, I'm going to do that for the second half of this.
*  I got some about that's what I was getting to.
*  Trying to work you into that.
*  But you don't have to be funny.
*  No wonder you still were.
*  They used to do that radio in the 80s.
*  At least I saw they go, listen, tell us what you set you up for.
*  Oh, yeah, to the 80s.
*  I had someone try to do that to me in like 2014.
*  I did the Bombard Tom show back then.
*  They're like, I was like, what? Yeah.
*  Talking about set. Yeah. What do you want to do?
*  It was 2005, but it was it was the 2000s.
*  Yeah. For sure. In the 80s, that was the normal thing.
*  If you said no, they'd be like, oh, my God, this guy's going to be terrible.
*  In Bob and Tom's defense, they didn't care.
*  But the producer was adamant that I need to have specific things
*  to talk about to go into. Right.
*  I was like, what? I don't.
*  I'm not just going to go that go have fun.
*  These guys are fun. I'm fun. Just relax. Yeah.
*  Exactly. So you flew out here. How was your flight?
*  You're like, oh, well, it was pretty good.
*  But there was a guy next to me.
*  Yeah. The morning radio thing.
*  There was a lot of guys would do their act on morning radio
*  because nobody was recording it because it was like, you know,
*  there was no Internet back then.
*  And comedy was so new that people would drive and go, hey,
*  this guy's pretty funny. Let's get out there.
*  I mean, it was it was there for a reason.
*  You know, guys would do routines in the morning. Yeah.
*  And it worked. Yeah.
*  It got people to come out to the club and then they would hear the same jokes.
*  Yeah. At the club. Yeah.
*  That was the other thing, too, is nobody wrote new material back then.
*  Nobody. I know so many guys that were so funny.
*  And they write maybe 40.
*  And that was it. And it was funny as anybody.
*  Yeah. Forever. Forever.
*  And then you fade away.
*  But I mean, yeah, and they had fun.
*  And it was it wasn't that the material was dated.
*  It was just once you stop writing that stuff,
*  something about you becomes dated. Yeah.
*  Well, their act would get so polished.
*  It would be like a samurai sword.
*  They would hammer it down to just a perfect sharpness.
*  And they would like Don Gavin.
*  His fucking timing was so precise.
*  But Bing, Ba-Bang, Ba-Bang.
*  And you'd be crying. He was so confident and loose. Yeah.
*  But they never left. They never left Boston.
*  They stayed. They had that 40 minutes.
*  And they were they were as good as any comic that has ever as anybody ever.
*  Yeah. And people didn't know.
*  But in New York, too, there's a bunch of guys in New York
*  that were just great in the mid 80s when I started.
*  And they were like, these guys were so funny.
*  I was I was I was afraid you were going to say that.
*  Well, like a guy like John Heyman, hilarious.
*  He became a writer.
*  But I'm saying he would get up and just so funny.
*  And he was just he was the guy that would just sit at the bar
*  all in the community, just clever, witty guy.
*  You know, I mean, he could have been one of the greats and everybody knew it.
*  New York had a different thing in that the clubs were smaller
*  because space is more limited.
*  So the people were on top of you.
*  See, a lot of guys work in the crowd because they were so close to you.
*  You almost felt like you had to. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Well, I mean, yeah, most of the clubs in New York.
*  It was a lot. It was a lot of crowd work. Yeah.
*  Which was good and bad.
*  It was good in the sense that, you know, it's funny to watch somebody be,
*  you know what I mean? It keeps it.
*  But it's bad in the sense that a lot of people just became great
*  at crowd work.
*  I mean, how many guys that are just great at crowd work,
*  crowd works, fun and it's funny, but you got to discipline yourself.
*  If you're not right, when you're going to do a show and the stage is up there
*  and you're talking to imaginary people, which a lot of people do.
*  Yeah. And you're like, hey, that guy.
*  And then after the show, when you start and you're like,
*  hey, that guy wasn't fat. Hey,
*  she was hot tits worn out.
*  Why is he saying she was dressed like a hook?
*  This guy's is this fake crowd work? Yeah.
*  Yeah. There was a lot. There's a lot of guys that do that.
*  Well, the crowd work is like it's like local material. It's a cheat code. Right.
*  When people think that you're coming up with it on the spot,
*  they think this guy's brilliant. Yeah.
*  Well, the only the part I object to is when somebody does something every night
*  spontaneous and then they pretend they stumbled into it and start laughing at
*  themselves. Oh, that's ugly. The fake laugh at yourself.
*  Sometimes you will laugh at yourself. Yes.
*  The audience knows when it's not real. Yeah, they know.
*  They know unless they're retarded.
*  Some people some people don't know, but most people know. Yeah.
*  They then they might go let you get away with it.
*  But when you're laughing at the same the same joke for the 50,000th time.
*  Yeah. No, it's great.
*  It's I mean, it really is a a great thing about modern comedy is that everybody
*  knows you got to keep putting out new hours.
*  That's the great thing about modern comedy. Yeah. With specials.
*  Yes. Well, you've done an interesting thing where you've done these theme shows.
*  Yeah. Now, what led you to want to start doing that?
*  But just you wanted to you had ideas.
*  I wanted to do that way. Like a one man show. Yeah, I did.
*  I remember seeing one man shows when I first started.
*  I saw Eric Boghossian. Do you know him? Yes, I remember him.
*  He did these one man shows and I was like, oh, my God, this guy's the coolest guy.
*  He's being funny, doing these characters.
*  So I wanted to do like that kind of stuff.
*  So I did this stuff in the early 90s, just one man shows on my on my free time,
*  you know, and and then I and I watched Lily Tomlin did one.
*  Whoopi Goldberg did a really good one back then.
*  And I'm watching these one person shows.
*  I was like, I want to do that.
*  And I did this one called Irish Wake about growing up back then.
*  But then I just went back to stand up because stand up is, you know how it is.
*  It's so it keeps you from being
*  out of the loop mentally.
*  And so that you can't because it's just, you know, I just talked to Jerry about it
*  all the time and it's it's like going into the water and just getting hit by a wave
*  because all the theoretical stuff, like even now, here we are talking,
*  stand up this and that. It's all theory.
*  Once you're on stage with a crowd like, ah, ah, ah, you survive it.
*  You know what I mean? Yeah.
*  So it's like, yeah, I'm going to do this.
*  All my strategies. But now you got to, you know, it's a fight.
*  When you watch a guy like Jerry who's been doing it forever,
*  who's such a polished pro and having a tough spot. Yeah. It's weird.
*  It's weird to see. Be like, oh, yeah, we're all still just comics.
*  We're all still comics.
*  It's but that's the beauty of it is that the crowd is just like a wave.
*  They'll give you a couple of minutes.
*  Yeah. If you all look on, Quincy here. Yeah. Hey, he's funny.
*  They give you a couple of minutes.
*  After a while, like, come on.
*  Yeah. They're like the three guys I never heard of were making us laugh.
*  And the guy I know is not what's going on.
*  I paid money to laugh. Exactly.
*  And that's the beauty of it. Yeah.
*  Because whatever you want to say, like we're talking about with Bill.
*  Whatever you want to say, that's great. Yeah.
*  But you still have to make them laugh or it's not definite.
*  By definition, it's not comedy. Right. You may be a philosopher.
*  You may be the most brilliant or Ted Dawkins, they say today.
*  But it's not common.
*  That's the importance also of showcase clubs where there's a bunch of comics
*  going up and they're not just there to see you, because the people are just there
*  to see you. They'll laugh at things.
*  It's like they're just a giant fan of whoever it is.
*  You know, Jim Gaffigan.
*  They go to see Jim Gaffigan. Jim Gaffigan is a very funny guy.
*  But they will laugh.
*  They will laugh at him.
*  But Jim Gaffigan will go to these other clubs to work out, too,
*  because you have to do that as well.
*  You got to go to a place where they don't necessarily come to see you.
*  They come to see a show and you're on the show, but you got to perform.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  No, exactly. There are no other art form like that.
*  No, musicians don't have to do that.
*  No, there's no other art form where you need the audience to help you.
*  Right. Yeah. Yeah.
*  You literally need them.
*  That's why this coronavirus is so brutal for me,
*  because without the audience, you're going to ramble on and on.
*  You know what I mean? Yes.
*  You'll go to long setups with little punch lines.
*  You don't even know the audience be like, no, no, no.
*  Get to the joke.
*  Like, you know, I forgot to end this thing.
*  How can I do this for this many years?
*  And forget you need an ending.
*  Did you did you see Cosby at all before he went up going to jail?
*  Did you ever see him live?
*  No, I never saw him live.
*  I mean, I saw him live once when I worked at Great.
*  Well, I was actually working as a security guard when he was there live.
*  But I didn't get to see I wasn't a comic back then.
*  I was 19. I didn't get to see the whole show.
*  I really paid attention to it.
*  But he never worked out.
*  He and he talked about he said, I know what's funny.
*  I know how to how to do funny.
*  Like, I don't need to work out my material.
*  So he would just kind of write.
*  And then he would go up and do these.
*  And from all accounts, like Chris Rock said it and Burr said it.
*  They went to see him.
*  They said it was fucking brilliant. Brilliant. Yeah.
*  And he didn't work out like I would.
*  I would like to see what that was like.
*  I would like to see it, too.
*  Yeah. Jerry Sanfield, Chris Rock.
*  They always said they went to see Bill Cosby and loved it.
*  You know what I mean? Yeah.
*  I mean, I wonder about that.
*  It's a little hero worship, too, right?
*  Like, you know, like how much of it is you're supposed to love it.
*  How much of it you love it because it's great.
*  Yeah, I guess I mean, if they were here, worshiped him.
*  Yeah. Before he got arrested, everybody hero worshiped him.
*  I didn't. You didn't.
*  I never liked it. I didn't like his act that much.
*  I mean, I thought it was one time I I did a big benefit.
*  A big Connie Hall show was after I read after 9-11 and Cosby was on.
*  And it was it was it's an interesting night for two years.
*  But one of them is we he asked to meet me after my set.
*  He was here worshiping me, Joe, in my opinion.
*  But he brought me up because he wanted to meet me because I said.
*  So I go up and I brought my girlfriend at the time.
*  Very, you know, pretty. And.
*  I walked in with her and she had a certain look that I could.
*  And you know, like very exotic looking, too.
*  And, you know, dressed up and Cosby was there in sweatpants, smoking a cigar
*  in Carnegie Hall, which, you know, only certain people get away with.
*  He's in some dressing room, Carnegie Hall with a cigar.
*  And he's talked to me for 20 minutes.
*  He looked at me for about eight seconds of the 20.
*  He was literally looking.
*  We made it a joke, but it was dead serious.
*  But he was looking at her while he was talking to me the whole time.
*  And we're all like laughing like he's in on the joke.
*  But it was so like she thought it was so weird.
*  But the same night, Tom Popper was there with his wife, Cynthia.
*  And Bill Clinton was there, too.
*  It was like a big, you know, right at 9-11.
*  And Clinton was shocked. He walked around the room.
*  He just he was so smart, you know, everything they say about him.
*  But then he's just sort of Tom Popper.
*  He starts flirting with Cynthia right in front of everybody.
*  And we're all laughing.
*  But he's like, hey, I love it.
*  It was one of those nights. Fascinating.
*  In retrospect, right?
*  It was a me to benefit in retrospect.
*  I remember I called Bill Cosby a douchebag on your show
*  when I was on Tough Crowd, because he was ahead of the time.
*  He was being interviewed by Wanda Sykes.
*  Right. And Wanda was interviewing him.
*  He starts chastising her for the way she's talking to him.
*  Right. And he had sunglasses on.
*  I go, that guy's a fucking douchebag.
*  That's and that's great.
*  And I remember thinking like, jeez, who the fuck am I?
*  I call Bill Cosby a douchebag.
*  I mean, this is like, yes.
*  I mean, when was Tough Crowd? What year am I talking about?
*  I think 2003, 2004.
*  Yeah. And I was like, he's a fucking douchebag.
*  That's hilarious. I remember that when he was like, yeah, you got it.
*  Well, I mean, she was just having fun and talking to him.
*  She was just trying to be funny.
*  And he chastised her for the way she was speaking.
*  It was crazy. It was like it was real weird.
*  Like, who the fuck are you to tell her how to talk, especially on TV
*  and especially want everybody loves Wanda.
*  Yeah. Just walking around the crowd. Yeah.
*  And she's just working. She's a comic. Yes.
*  And it wasn't nothing she did was offensive.
*  It was just her talking.
*  And I remember being on the show and then I remember leaving going,
*  she's actually like, Bill Cosby, a douchebag.
*  Like, probably I probably shouldn't do that.
*  I feel like a lot of people left the show saying something like that about.
*  How was the show?
*  That show would not be possible today. No.
*  I mean, it really was like a podcast in a lot of ways.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It really was.
*  It's a fucking great show, though. Thanks. It was a great show. Thanks.
*  It really was. And you were the perfect host for it, too, because you were
*  loose enough and light enough with everything
*  that you can kind of keep the glue together. Yeah.
*  I mean, I took as much abuse as anybody on. Oh, yeah.
*  But it was it was a rare moment where like in perfect name to tough crowd
*  was a perfect name for it.
*  Has there ever been a talk about bringing that back? Oh, God.
*  Yeah. Everybody talks about it. But I'm like, where?
*  You know what I mean? What about as a podcast?
*  People say that. I don't know.
*  I'm not. I mean, because
*  first of all, I resented at the time that I was like,
*  they didn't want it. You know what I mean? Like, right.
*  Who knows what I'm presenting?
*  I'm fighting against something that does.
*  It's not even part of the podcast world. Right.
*  And but then I was just like, I don't know.
*  Then I'm going to you know, I mean, getting everybody together.
*  And, you know, people's careers would fall left and right if we did it.
*  Oh, yeah. I mean, anybody on there,
*  would they be able to really even speak honestly today?
*  Kind of. You kind of you got to have a career
*  that's pretty locked in already.
*  Or you got to be on the on the come up where you got nothing to lose.
*  It's the guys that are on a television show that are fucked.
*  Yeah. Like the guys who get a TV show
*  or you're really worried about losing it. Right.
*  Those guys can't they can't do a show like that.
*  But then you could. Oh, back then we did.
*  But there it is.
*  Colin Quinn, tough crowd. There it is.
*  Look at that. That is that Patrice.
*  Patrice. Oh, my. Oh, he was the star of that fucking show.
*  Well, Norton was great on that show.
*  The Apollo was great on that show.
*  Everybody was great in that.
*  Geraldo. This Geraldo.
*  Geraldo. And I went Geraldo and Leary went at it.
*  That was one of the great moments of that show.
*  Ten years. Geraldo's dead two days ago.
*  Yeah. Him and Leary. That was that was a good one.
*  And Lenny Clark was there.
*  It's just a great setup.
*  Like the way you had it, it was just a great setup.
*  Patrice literally.
*  It was basically his show, as you can see from that footage.
*  I was a guest. He was the host. Little chubby Jimmy.
*  Look at Jimmy.
*  I know he really looks like a fat fool.
*  But.
*  It's a great fucking show, man.
*  Yeah. How many episodes did you guys wind up doing?
*  200, I think. Wow.
*  220 or something.
*  I have no.
*  Can we get you to do it as a podcast?
*  I don't know, because you think guys like me, guys like
*  established comics would do it and it would be wild.
*  You could still do it.
*  It can still be done as a podcast.
*  It gets because like you have a guy like Joey Diaz on.
*  He doesn't give a fuck. Right.
*  Right. You can have those guys and they will talk freely.
*  Yeah. And people would love it.
*  Oh, my God. They would love it.
*  Yeah. It might.
*  I don't know. I mean, over the years, obviously, people have brought it up to me.
*  And I was like, now, because he could never do on the name be free to know.
*  But I got a better one.
*  The original name, which everybody talked me off of,
*  which is the expression really more than tough crowd.
*  Tough room. Ooh.
*  And I think I do want the name. Yeah.
*  Anyway, either way, tough room is better.
*  Tough room is a podcast. Tough room. Why not?
*  I don't know. Maybe.
*  Look, how many guys in New York would do it? A lot.
*  Yes. Easy. Yeah.
*  Norton would do it for sure. 100 percent.
*  Well, he wouldn't be invited on, but you're right.
*  You brought up the one name
*  of someone that's not on the show.
*  There's plenty of comics that would do it.
*  Joey Diaz is in Jersey now.
*  Oh, yeah. A lot of people. He's out there in the East Coast.
*  Yeah, he got the fuck out.
*  Most people are leaving.
*  L.A. is just a sinking ship.
*  Yeah, everybody's leaving.
*  Yeah, it's sad. It is.
*  But it's also good things move on.
*  Like I said, comedy, I'm not even kidding.
*  What if it becomes this, you know, he outdoor thing?
*  Everyone's going to move down south.
*  It could be an outdoor thing, but I think more than anything,
*  it could be a thing where you just I think they're going to have
*  some sort of a treatment for covid sooner or later.
*  And it's just a matter of like, look, the reason why L.A.
*  was L.A. was because everybody came out there to do TV and movies.
*  Right. And then they wound up doing comedy as well.
*  And they did comedy while they were doing TV and movies.
*  But it was always when I started in the 90s in L.A., it was a means to an end.
*  Like when I came out there, I came out there to do a television show.
*  And there was a lot of people that were doing stand up,
*  hoping they would get a TV show.
*  I came out there with a TV show, right, hoping to get passed
*  as a paid regular at the store.
*  And then once I was there, I was like, this is weird because like,
*  I don't really want to I was doing TV for money.
*  And every time a new TV project came up, I was like, OK.
*  But really, I had this dream.
*  My dream was like, I would really love if I could just do stand up.
*  Like I'm doing all this stuff so I can make it like Stanhope said it best.
*  He goes, basically, we're doing TV to make sure we have an audience
*  so that we could do stand up. Absolutely.
*  But now that doesn't exist anymore.
*  Nobody gives a fuck about TV. Nobody cares.
*  For a lot of comics, if you get a TV show, it's like, oh, poor guy.
*  You got a show. It's like now you're now you're right.
*  You're going to get less money.
*  You can't say what you want. You can't talk wild.
*  And you never know when your schedule, you can't go on the road. Right. Right.
*  And you have to deal with all these weird politics of sets now.
*  Yeah. It's like every set has to be diverse.
*  You have to like the casting is weird. It's all fake.
*  It's like, you know, you're not casting the best people.
*  You have to make sure you have an Asian character or this character.
*  Where where where's your gay representation? Right.
*  It's just it's if it's a if it's a if it's a urban gang,
*  they have to all look like Greg Kinnear.
*  But it's just nowadays you don't need that Hollywood environment anymore.
*  It's actually an impediment because it comes with executives
*  and it comes with agents and it comes with all these all these people
*  that can get their greasy hands on the formula and fuck it up.
*  They're going to tell you what to do and what not to do.
*  They're going to pull you aside.
*  They're going to give you shitty advice.
*  That their creative input is going to be dogshit.
*  Well, a place like this, Colin Quinn, out here in Texas, you don't have that.
*  I know. I know. I love it.
*  You going to move here? I don't know.
*  I don't know. I'm such I mean, I do love it.
*  I love the idea of moving here.
*  And I love I love it.
*  I'm trying to get everybody to move here.
*  I know half half the goal of having people on this podcast.
*  Yeah, well, I'd like to, you know, if I move here, I'm going to do it.
*  I'll be one of the I want to be one of the early ones.
*  I don't want to be one of the guys that comes in like, oh,
*  now he's jumping in the bandwagon. Fifth year. Right. Yeah.
*  No, I don't want to.
*  If I do it, it'll have to be in the next year because I can't be one of these guys
*  that's, you know, coming in late.
*  Well, you're going to help me design the club, right?
*  Maybe I come down as the designer slash manager of the club.
*  And well, maybe I secretly booked the club and people go,
*  who's the prick that's booking this club? Right.
*  You never know. Like you leave your your thing.
*  Both. You don't have a purse.
*  Yeah. You can't have a single person that people can call to get booked.
*  Or I've always felt even as much as I love comedians and I love comedians.
*  So my favorite people, I always feel sorry for bookers
*  because having to deal with us, people don't understand the mental disorder.
*  You have to have to be a successful community, which is you have to think
*  if I was up there right now, no matter who is up there, I do good, too.
*  I'm as funny as anybody.
*  And if you don't think that you can't last.
*  It's the sad thing is people that think that or no one else thinks that.
*  The other comics know they're not good. Yeah.
*  And they're like, I don't get the respect I deserve.
*  Like, no, but you do.
*  Here's the thing about comedy.
*  Everybody gets the respect they deserve. Yeah.
*  They all do. Anybody who says, you know, I didn't, you know, they made
*  they made it seem like I had to earn their respect.
*  You do. Yeah. You do have to earn their respect.
*  Yeah. And you get what you deserve in this.
*  This is a meritocracy.
*  It's the closest thing to a meritocracy that could exist.
*  Yeah. And I agree. It is out of any job in the world.
*  It's a close thing to a meritocracy.
*  Whenever you see a comic saying, I'm not getting the respect I deserve.
*  You're like, oh, no, that's not true. Yeah.
*  You do get what you deserve.
*  You know, it's all the because when people are murderers, everybody,
*  everybody bows down.
*  Everybody that guy's fucking great or she's amazing. Right.
*  Everybody does it. Well, unless they will hacks his hacks.
*  It's hacks at murder. Yeah.
*  But this hack said I'll never follow. Right.
*  That's the killers.
*  And I I bow down to the fact that they can be that they can do that,
*  even though I hate them for it.
*  But I'll say I give them a little bit of credit.
*  I know what you're saying. I know what you're saying.
*  Like they figured out a way to juke the system. Yes.
*  But in terms of like a great comic, right, a comic
*  that the audience likes that we all respect.
*  Whoever you with a guy, girl, gay, straight, absolutely.
*  White, black. Oh, yeah.
*  No one gives a fuck. Are you a killer? Yeah. Are you a killer?
*  That's right. Yeah.
*  And if you're not a killer and you think you are, it's a rough road. Yeah.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  I don't get the respect I deserve from this club, but you do know.
*  Yeah, but you do. Yeah.
*  If you were laying it down every night, they would all be like, God damn,
*  he's killing it. But this is what I'm saying.
*  Bookers, everybody
*  thinks they should be at that place right then. Yep.
*  Everybody thinks you should be on stage all the time. Yeah.
*  So to be a Booker, you can't you're going to make a lot of enemies. Yeah. Yeah.
*  And then there's people that think that they should be like,
*  there should be a certain amount of women. Right.
*  There should be more women on this lineup. Right. No, there shouldn't.
*  If they're funny, they should be. Oh, yeah.
*  But I look, I've always said and I still maintain this day,
*  I think it's a difficult road for a woman. I think there's women.
*  There's a lot of men that don't want to hear women talk about politics.
*  There's a lot of men who don't want to hear women
*  tell them things that maybe they don't know or say comedy in a way
*  like they're explaining things to the men.
*  There's a lot of men are sexist. I think it's harder. Sure.
*  Harder for them to talk about sex. They like.
*  Christopher Hitchens had a whole article he wrote in Vanity Fair about this
*  back in the day was very controversial. It was called Women Aren't Funny.
*  And all these women are really upset at him.
*  But he was basically saying they were saying he was saying if you want to be
*  a woman and be comedy and be a comedian, you kind of have to adopt male
*  characteristics. You have to act like a slut or act like a guy or be butch.
*  Well, I don't agree. Not true.
*  But it's not true because he's not a comedian.
*  No, it's not true.
*  But what is true is it's harder.
*  It's a harder path for a woman.
*  You have to be. Yes, it is. Yeah.
*  And you have to be undeniable.
*  A dying. You have to be a dominant personality.
*  You know, I'm saying like a Roseanne, like Roseanne came out and she was not playing.
*  I'm going to you know, I mean, like you have to have that energy, I guess.
*  Or Sarah Silverman, right?
*  She's figured out her path through it.
*  She was cute. But, you know, it was like her.
*  She would shock you with her takes on things.
*  Well, it was like well crafted.
*  Yes. She was almost like a different, totally different.
*  But like Sam Kenison and the fact that you'd be like, oh, this person's saying this.
*  And then you're like, whoa, whoa, whoa.
*  You know, it was like a joke.
*  Yeah. And she was pretty.
*  So it was like throw you off. She was charming.
*  Yes. Yeah. Yeah.
*  And but Roseanne was interesting in the same way.
*  Kenison was interesting because she became that person after she had a brain injury.
*  What? Yeah. She had hit by a car just like Kenison.
*  I didn't know either one of them got hit by a car before they did stand up.
*  Yeah. Their personalities changed.
*  It's really interesting. They both got really hurt bad.
*  And when you get really bad brain injuries, one of the things that happens
*  is you become ridiculously impulsive and wild and oftentimes violent.
*  Like that was the thing with Kenison.
*  Like his brother wrote in the book, my brother Sam. Right.
*  His brother Bill wrote a book about Sam and what Sam was like before the accident.
*  And then after the accident, he was hit by like, I think he was hit by a pickup truck,
*  but like really fucked up, like brain injury.
*  And then he became a different person.
*  Like he was like quiet and reserved and then just became wild and uncontrollable.
*  Same thing with Roseanne.
*  She went to a mental institute for nine months after she was hit by a car.
*  How funny is that that people have to get hit by a truck?
*  That's what does that say about us?
*  What does it say? We're fucked.
*  Yeah. What does it really say?
*  Yeah. Well, because I believe in in the same different vein,
*  but the same psychologically, I believe you have to be at a place
*  where you just it's almost like an existential crisis.
*  Yeah. We're like, I don't care if I bomb.
*  I don't care about I don't I don't place enough value
*  in this planet that I give a shit.
*  I'm going up and I'm talking about what I want to talk about.
*  Yeah. It's almost like a a level of depression.
*  It's not a it goes beyond where you're just like, I don't care.
*  I really don't care.
*  Well, because people care about this public speaking so much
*  that there has to be something with us that's off where we're like,
*  I don't care.
*  Or you have to develop it over time.
*  You have to develop that callousness about the way people feel about you.
*  Eventually. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Or you got to get so good that you can know you know that even though
*  it's so terrifying to bomb, you could slip through those waters
*  and ride the wave of success.
*  Well, I would always help people starting when they when they ask,
*  even when they don't ask, I tell them, but
*  is you can the audience can hate you, but they can never feel sorry for you.
*  The one thing you're not allowed to have in comedy, in my opinion,
*  is the one thing you're not allowed to indulge in is you can't ever be uncomfortable.
*  Right. You can be anything. You can be an asshole.
*  You can be a psycho. You can be offensive.
*  You can never be uncomfortable. You're not allowed to be.
*  Isn't it weird that you could feel it?
*  Yeah, you feel it when someone's uncomfortable.
*  You're not allowed if somebody if you paid somebody to come in right now
*  and do a set for us three, they're not allowed to be like,
*  well, it's a weird set up.
*  They can they can say this set up sucks.
*  You pay me for this.
*  They can attack us and we'll probably love. Right.
*  But they can't be uncomfortable. Right.
*  You're paid to not be uncomfortable. Right. No matter what. Yeah.
*  You can't be ashamed. You can't be uncomfortable.
*  Anything else could be.
*  It is such a strange art form.
*  It's like they feel you.
*  They feel how you feel, even if the words come out perfect
*  with the perfect timing, they feel how you feel and they won't laugh
*  if you if you seem uncomfortable. Yes.
*  Yeah, it's it's it's like alchemical or something.
*  It's just it is.
*  It's and it's such a it's such a value.
*  I just always hate this, even though it's true.
*  People decide how they feel about you.
*  The first 10 seconds ago.
*  What the fuck is that? Yeah.
*  Judged me 10 seconds.
*  But the truth is, when somebody comes on stage
*  and they they don't make eye contact like with the crowd,
*  like they're like either looking down or looking above. Yes.
*  Right away, the whole crowd knows.
*  And they're like, what's this part?
*  Oh, they uncomfortable.
*  You want them? Why are you being a comedian? Get off stage.
*  Yeah. You have to be like, I don't give a shit.
*  Just like with the heckler, like people had tried that.
*  Hey, how the heckler?
*  It's like, no, no.
*  You we're living vicariously through in the audience.
*  The asshole at work that we can't say that to,
*  because we'll get a fight or get our ass kicked.
*  You have to say that to.
*  Yep. You know. Yeah.
*  Even if you don't say the greatest thing,
*  doesn't have to be the most clever thing in the world.
*  But it has to be basically, fuck you.
*  You fucking idiot.
*  You got to address it.
*  Come in here, try to fucking ruin it.
*  God, fuck this.
*  People love it because they can live vicariously through that.
*  You know, well, it's such a classic person, too.
*  Yeah. The heckler is such a classic person,
*  the person that thinks their opinion is more important than the entire audience.
*  Yeah. You're going to stand up and put a stop to it, that their ego
*  allows them to literally yell out to the person with the microphone.
*  Yeah. Nice shirt.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  It's so. Yeah.
*  That was another beautiful thing about the store that was terrible,
*  but also beautiful.
*  There was no crowd control.
*  Oh, yeah. No one.
*  No one took care of the crowd.
*  No. You had to develop the ability to handle shit.
*  Yeah. When things are going sideways, no one stopped anybody.
*  No one kicked anybody out. No.
*  And then eventually they did like in the, you know,
*  like the new version of the store, like 2014 on.
*  When I came back, they would fucking clean it out, man.
*  They wouldn't they wouldn't let anybody like heckle anymore.
*  And I think this is interesting.
*  It's like these young guys coming up.
*  This is good, but it's also bad.
*  Yes. You got to learn how to handle this chaos.
*  And if you would go somewhere else, one of the things
*  you would go on the road and if you go on the road and people would heckle you,
*  you're like, look, do you think I'm not used to this?
*  I get heckled every night. Yes.
*  It's so it's such a normal part of the experience.
*  It has to be a normal part of the experience.
*  I agree, because there's nothing even as a guy has been in forever.
*  When somebody when you watch a comedian, somebody heckles them
*  and you see their faces like, yeah, what?
*  Like they're startled startled by it.
*  Yes. What you want to see is like, OK, asshole number six thousand in my life.
*  Listen to me, you fuck.
*  You don't want to want to be like that outraged.
*  You want to just be like, oh, you fuck it.
*  You like it's part of the thing, you know? Exactly. Exactly.
*  Is that great Bill Hicks set where he's doing that with him?
*  You know, the recording member was like yelling at the whole crowd like, oh, yeah.
*  Oh, you think it just reads in the right act.
*  You just tell he's been doing it forever.
*  Yeah, there was a lady yelled at him and he goes, he goes, oh, I'm a cunt.
*  He goes, I got a I got a pussy so I get carte blanche.
*  I heard a recording of Lenny Bruce from 1959.
*  There was this guy, Hal Wilno, who just died, and he had all these old
*  great recordings of music and everything.
*  But he had this Lenny Bruce recording from 1959.
*  And he just let me listen to it once.
*  And it was Lenny Bruce at a club going, just stop listening to me.
*  Here's what bothers me.
*  They always put you people at that table, too.
*  He goes, you're always at that fucking for for, you know, for top.
*  And and you could tell there's a couple of couples.
*  He goes, you're two couples that want to, you know, you think you're clay, you're drunk.
*  He goes, and after the show, you're going to come up and go, we were helping you.
*  And I was saying that was in 1959.
*  And that crazy because that is what they say.
*  Yeah, we were helping you.
*  We yelled at you. We didn't yell out.
*  You wouldn't even have a show.
*  Yeah. If you wouldn't if you didn't show up tonight, I would have been screwed.
*  I wouldn't have a show.
*  It's funny that people actually do think that, though.
*  It's like a comedy is kind of like a form of hypnosis.
*  That's what I always say.
*  Like when a guy is on stage killing, like if you're on stage and you're killing
*  and I'm sitting there watching, even though I know I'm a comic, right.
*  I let you think for me.
*  You're thinking for me.
*  So you're saying things and I'm just I'm empty.
*  I'm on I'm on the ride with you.
*  Right. Just letting you think for me.
*  Yeah. And the whole audience does it to get like it's such a weird art form
*  where you were tapping into these states of mind
*  that aren't really available to other people.
*  This the state of mind where there's a person on stage and they're they're
*  they're crafting an experience and everyone else in the audience
*  is sort of going along with it if it's going well.
*  And you it's accentuated by the people next to you who are also laughing at it.
*  I know. And speaking of covid, that's what makes you nervous.
*  You're like, shit, people have to be next to you.
*  Yeah. To really to really make it work for an hour.
*  Yeah. You know, I think we're going to look past this.
*  I think they're going to come up with some sort of a treatment or something.
*  Within two years, we're going to at the very least have a
*  a real appreciation for what it's like to lose this.
*  Well, yes. And I think that Austin Comedy Club
*  is I'm a little too big to just run one club.
*  So how many are you going to run?
*  Well, I mean, a chain of southern clubs. OK.
*  You know, where else? Where else? Nashville.
*  Yeah, I've watched probably 50 episodes of Bar Rescue like most people.
*  So I understand what to do when I go into the place.
*  I understand the culture.
*  Yeah. Not Nashville, because they have Zanies.
*  That's the I'll respect a real institution like Zanies.
*  Maybe you could be comedy club rescue and come in with like
*  you have to have a hook, like a polka dot suit or something crazy.
*  All right.
*  I was like, I didn't like it.
*  Then I was like, yeah, I want to.
*  Maybe a blue velvet.
*  So we open it.
*  How about a chain of like where this where the ceiling
*  like in case COVID or something comes back with retractable ceiling
*  so you can have a skylight come the sky like. Oh, OK.
*  It's going to be expensive, but I'm sure it's a lot cheaper than I think.
*  Outside only works in the sun.
*  The thing about their saying about being outside of the only good thing
*  about outside outside is the circulation.
*  Like people aren't breathing in your face.
*  Like the air is not trapped.
*  So the real way that outside works is like UV light and sun
*  is supposed to kill COVID.
*  Well, I'm going to say something.
*  I don't care if people get sick from COVID.
*  I'm just I want to market it so people think they're safe.
*  I don't really give a shit.
*  I pay their cover. How about a fan?
*  This is a goddamn business.
*  Blows all the bad air away.
*  You know, what do you the guy that's working for, you know,
*  R.J. Reynolds in 1950. Hey, listen, cigarettes are bad.
*  Do you think you would live outside of New York City ever, though?
*  Seriously? I mean, I seem like you're inexorably tied to that city.
*  I mean, I feel like I am, but I'm like I said, a lot of my family is moving.
*  A lot of people I know are moving to the suburbs in the past six months, seven months.
*  And sometimes I'm like, yeah, this is it's kind of there's something
*  there's something not there in New York sometimes where I'm like,
*  it's not it's not how I used to feel about New York.
*  Let's just put it that way.
*  Maybe it's me, but I think it's the city.
*  How long did you go without doing stand up?
*  How long did I go during the COVID?
*  Oh, four months, five months.
*  And then what was your first show?
*  Was the was the one with the cars at the parking lot one?
*  That was the first one. Yeah.
*  The first one was a recording. Yeah.
*  Really? Christa Stefano was on there, if you know him.
*  And he goes, yeah, this is great.
*  We used to work our acts out.
*  Now you're like, I work it out on HBO Max.
*  Wow. So you didn't warm up for it at all.
*  You just went up and did it. Yeah. Wow.
*  I didn't warm up. But like, you know, I listened to my tapes and shoot.
*  Yeah. That's kind of crazy. It was crazy.
*  But it's, you know, stand up is it
*  after you've been doing it for that long, you kind of, you know,
*  you can still bomb, but it's a little different.
*  Plus the crowds, you're not doing an hour.
*  If I was doing an hour, it's a different ballgame.
*  I did the Houston improv
*  and I did a weekend there after I think I did in July. So.
*  Four months, five months, whatever it was, four months in, it was weird.
*  Me, Tony Hinchcliffe and Brian Moses.
*  And it was so strange.
*  It was like, but it felt so good.
*  And doing an hour is a different ballgame.
*  It was headlining. I mean, I was doing.
*  I realize what headlining. Yeah. Yeah.
*  I mean, they pay to see you. It's a different.
*  I was lucky, though, that I actually had already worked out this hour
*  over a year or so. So it was a real hour.
*  I had recordings. I could listen to recordings. I had all my notes.
*  I go over my notes.
*  The first show is like, can I do this?
*  And then once I did it, I was like, I remember all this shit.
*  And the second I got might have fucked up a few taglines or something like that.
*  But by the end of the weekend, it was like a real show. I was rolling.
*  So did you how many times you listen to yourself before you went?
*  Oh, a lot. A lot. Me too.
*  I always play games.
*  I don't either. I record all my sets and I listen to them.
*  Usually I would listen to them.
*  I would drive home from the store. I would listen to them on the way home.
*  But this is the difference between people that really want to last.
*  If you if you don't respect it, you have to respect it enough to go, hey,
*  guess what? These people in Houston paid to see. Yes.
*  I'm going to do my best. It might not be perfect.
*  It's going to be the best. I put all my effort in.
*  Yeah. Then you really you know, you're doing it.
*  You might be a little clumsy if you haven't done stand up in five months,
*  but you are going to do the work that's required to get it done.
*  The best thing. You know that you care. That's right.
*  Yeah. The worst is when someone pays to see you and you see the person on stage
*  with like a notebook and like, what else? What else?
*  And they don't give a fuck. What else?
*  Oh, it's the worst.
*  It's the worst because it's that feeling that you don't have a sense of urgency
*  that these people are paid to hear you talk. Yeah.
*  A lot of people, it's like a little defense mechanism for them, like,
*  yeah, I don't give a fuck. It's just a show. Like
*  I always called the Joe DiMaggio principle.
*  Like when I saw this article once where Joe DiMaggio was,
*  he's like 40 years old or something. He was already in the Hall of Fame.
*  And he slid into the third base and there's his kids had, you know, you play so hard.
*  Like, why are you doing this?
*  Like you're already in the Hall of Fame and this and that.
*  And he goes, because somewhere out there, there's someone who hasn't seen Joe DiMaggio play.
*  And I don't want to let him down. Yeah, it's great.
*  I remember reading that and going, that is a great way to look at it.
*  That's a great way to look at it.
*  Like if people are paying to see you, they're paying money.
*  Do you feel like he used that line on Marilyn Monroe?
*  He's probably like, I don't know, Marilyn, but, you know, I figure somebody's
*  just like, what a nice guy.
*  Cut to an hour later.
*  Well, his thing was always kind of sad, right?
*  Like she left him and she was banging all these other guys.
*  And they said that even after his after her death,
*  he would always show up at her grave and leave flowers.
*  That's sad shit. Yeah. Yeah.
*  But I also already treated like shit, didn't he?
*  Like smacker or something. Did he?
*  I could be making up some horror.
*  I'm slandering the name of the great American hero.
*  I'm calling Joe DiMaggio a wife beater based on something I may or may not have read.
*  I don't know. Maybe I feel like you're right.
*  He just feel like he is Italian.
*  I feel. Yeah. Well, that's part of it.
*  And I feel like he beat her.
*  And then Arthur Miller emotionally abused her.
*  And the Kennedys killed her.
*  And Kenny. Well, yeah, that most likely that kind of stuff.
*  You do wonder, you know, I wonder, you know, if I had a hundred thousand dollars on a bet.
*  Yes or no. Red or black.
*  I'm going with they killed her.
*  It certainly was a strange one, wasn't it?
*  Well, she was apparently she had loose lips and she fucked both of them.
*  And she was drinking and like, I fucked this.
*  And I fucked Bobby.
*  I was the most Jack. Yeah.
*  But it was like, yeah. Yeah.
*  But here's what I don't understand. If they killed her.
*  They had the mob do it for him, right?
*  Somebody. Yeah.
*  Because but the mob hated them.
*  So why would they do it for them?
*  Well, it doesn't necessarily have to be the mob.
*  I mean, you think Hillary Clinton's using the mob to whack all those people? No.
*  But there is this people out there that will kill people for you, Colin.
*  Yeah, I guess they want 100 percent.
*  Yeah, they exist. Yeah.
*  And they don't have a problem with it because they've killed people before.
*  It's not that hard.
*  It's it's shockingly easy to get someone to kill somebody for you.
*  Yeah, I guess for, you know, for money, why not?
*  If you're a president of the United States and you got some lady
*  who won't shut the fuck up about blowing you in the Rose Garden.
*  Well, whatever nowadays, though, it's a lot harder.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Because everything gets exposed on social media.
*  But I mean, yeah, back in those days, you get away with it.
*  I'm sure it to Epstein.
*  I'm sure being a hit.
*  They killed that guy when he was in prison.
*  Yeah. Well, in prison, it's easier.
*  Well, yeah, they turn off the camera.
*  They turn off all the cameras, but still.
*  But if that was in the street, 80 people have cameras.
*  Epstein, Jeff. That's true.
*  Maybe it's easier to kill in prison.
*  I think it is. Yeah.
*  Well, it's just one camera.
*  He's dead. Yeah.
*  I miss him. Everybody's like, Oh, my God.
*  Yeah. The God was this one was asleep and one was just.
*  Yeah. And all the cameras are broken.
*  I don't know what happened. Weird.
*  It's crazy. He broke his own neck.
*  Strange. I guess he really feels bad about having sex with 16 year olds.
*  I know. Yeah.
*  But I mean, the minute that list.
*  Well, what about Jusane Maxwell was going to happen with her?
*  That's a good question, because she doesn't go to.
*  I don't think she goes to trial until I want to say next month.
*  I think she goes to trial this month.
*  Now we're in October.
*  Jamie, when is she supposed to go on trial?
*  You don't hear a word about that, right? No.
*  She's getting the jack.
*  She's in the Jack Ruby cell.
*  I read a fascinating book next year.
*  Next year. What the fuck are they waiting for?
*  I'm trying to figure out what they're waiting for.
*  That is crazy. Next year.
*  When next year?
*  Next December. Yeah.
*  What are they going to do it?
*  Why would they wait?
*  That's so they look, they put Harvey Weinstein right in the court.
*  Why? Why are they waiting for her?
*  That's so strange.
*  Hmm.
*  There was a report recently that Bill Clinton had
*  an intimate dinner with her a couple of years back.
*  Jusane, we got to talk.
*  Yeah. You know, is there a ledger?
*  She was just denied bail recently and current trial date is set for July 12th, 2021.
*  That's a long time.
*  That's a long time.
*  That's the seventh month of July of 2021.
*  And here we are in October.
*  Yeah. That's crazy.
*  That's so much time to kill her.
*  Yeah. Well, I mean, nowadays it would be easy.
*  Just you put COVID on the side of one of the surfaces and wait for it to sniff it.
*  Not good enough.
*  What about something to kill her?
*  What about you were saying something about the Kennedy, about Jack Ruby?
*  Oh, yeah. There's a fascinating book called Chaos written by this guy, Tom O'Neill.
*  I had him on the podcast.
*  And it's all about the CIA and the CIA's.
*  Well, it's about the Manson case.
*  But how this guy, Tom O'Neill, who's actually Greg Fitzsimmons' neighbor.
*  It's an amazing book.
*  He researched this book over 20 years.
*  He started writing it.
*  And then as he was writing it, he was writing it as an article.
*  And as he was writing the article, he kept uncovering more and more and more information.
*  And he connected the Manson family to the CIA operatives that would give people LSD
*  and they would run these experiments on people.
*  And they think that they use the Manson family to discredit the hippie movement
*  and to experiment with what they could do with LSD.
*  And they did it with him while he was in prison.
*  And the guy that was involved in this CIA LSD operation, this is all heavily documented,
*  was the same guy who went to visit Oswald, excuse me, Jack Ruby when he was in jail
*  after he killed Oswald and Jack Ruby, like from this guy visiting him in jail,
*  immediately went crazy, was hiding underneath the table,
*  was saying that they're burning Jews in the streets.
*  And like he had a meltdown.
*  And they think this guy dosed Jack Ruby while he was in jail
*  and might have dosed him previous to that to get him to shoot Jack Ruby
*  or to get him to shoot Oswald in the first place.
*  Wow. It's crazy.
*  They connect this CIA MKUltra mind control LSD experiments that they were doing
*  with this guy, what is his name? Jolly? What was it? Jolly West.
*  Jolly West, who is this operative for the CIA,
*  they ran a thing called Operation Midnight Climax
*  where they would run brothels with two-way mirrors
*  and they would hire these hookers to give these Johns LSD.
*  And they would watch to see like how they would react to, you know,
*  they would give them a drink and inside the drink, they would be acid.
*  And these poor guys thought they were going, you know,
*  have some sex with a lovely lady.
*  Poor guys, they get they get sex and they get a free acid trip.
*  I don't know what's so bad about it.
*  It's not bad if you know you're going to have an acid trip.
*  What about the... It's a great book, though.
*  It's called Chaos. Chaos.
*  Because, you know, Gabe Kaplan, you know, he was a comedian and...
*  Poker player. Yeah.
*  And he worked, he told me one time, because, yeah, I worked for Jack Ruby.
*  He worked for the Carousel Club, whatever the name of the club was.
*  He worked in the Dallas.
*  I go, what was he like? He goes, he was a real thug.
*  He goes, he was just like, hey, get out of here.
*  Like, he just shoved me.
*  You know, just it was a real mob.
*  Well, the Dallas Mob.
*  I mean, you read that book about the Dallas Mob and Lyndon Johnson and his and the.
*  No, what was that book?
*  I have it on my phone. But I mean,
*  I mean,
*  it was basically it was like the most compelling argument.
*  I felt like, wow, like the Dallas Mob being involved with whoever they were
*  involved with to go out and to go out and really kill, you know, kill the guy.
*  You know, it completely makes sense.
*  Here it is. Jamie's got it here. Betrayal in Dallas.
*  Yes, that's it.
*  Oh, good is Jamie.
*  Goddamn Jamie. Jamie, you know what?
*  Betrayal in Dallas. I'm glad you didn't get tested.
*  The LBJ, the Pearl Street Mafia and the murder of President Kennedy.
*  Yeah, Pearl. Good stuff.
*  Oh, my God. It's great because it connects
*  the lieutenant governor like who is not going to get reelected.
*  And it was all like LBJ stuff. It was really good.
*  I got to take a picture of that so that I can get it later.
*  So I don't forget.
*  But but but the Manson thing is the Manson thing is crazy.
*  Tom O'Neill documents all the times they let Manson out of jail.
*  They would arrest him while he was on parole.
*  Where clear parole violations.
*  And one of them was that's the book right there.
*  I can't tell you enough good things about it, but they kept releasing him.
*  And one of one of the sheriff's said that it was above my pay grade.
*  Like they told him the CIA came to them and let the guy go.
*  And they wanted him to go out and keep doing all this crazy shit.
*  And one of the reasons why they wanted to do is because they wanted to discredit
*  the antiwar movement like the CIA and the government at the time
*  was involved in a lot of like really shady shit.
*  And one of the reasons why they were doing that was because they were trying to stop
*  what they thought was this subversive movement to try to get us out of Vietnam.
*  Right. Right. And this was a part of it.
*  I mean, the Kennedy thing was a part of it, too, I guess, really.
*  Yeah, you know, for sure.
*  I mean, they just happen to have the happy.
*  I mean, this book I was talking about is more like the Dallas Mafia.
*  But I'm sure the CIA said, hey, if it's going to help us, you know,
*  I mean, they were together in the Bay of Pigs.
*  So why don't we be together?
*  Well, it's really crazy that the video of the Kennedy assassination,
*  the Zapruder film, was actually put on television by a comedian, Dick Gregory.
*  Dick Gregory brought that to Geraldo Rivera's TV show.
*  And I think it was 10 years after the murder.
*  Something might have been 12.
*  Now, like, I've never heard of TV shows like 74.
*  I remember. Yeah.
*  It was back when people had bell bottoms on and shit.
*  And Dick Gregory brought that film.
*  There it is. Good Night America.
*  Seventy five. There it is. Wow.
*  So I say seventy five. Yeah. Yeah. March six. Seventy five.
*  Look how blurry it is. Yeah.
*  Good night. America. Yeah.
*  And so they played the Kennedy.
*  I mean, because Dick Gregory, what a fascinating guy he was. Yeah.
*  Great fucking comic. Great comic.
*  A lot of people don't even know how good he was.
*  Well, Time Life had this car.
*  They had purchased this, you know, after the assassination in 63.
*  And they held on to it all these years.
*  And they played it on television.
*  And I remember Geraldo Rivera telling people this is going to be very disturbing.
*  And you could see him getting shot.
*  And he sees his head going back into the left.
*  And everybody was like, wait, what the fuck is going on?
*  That's the first time.
*  And seeing him grab his neck where he got shot in the front in the next.
*  And they tried to in the autopsy.
*  They they had two different versions of it in Dallas.
*  They said it was an entry wound.
*  And then in Bethesda, Maryland, when they looked at him there, they said,
*  oh, no, that's a tracheotomy.
*  They shot him in the neck, shot him in the back, shot him in the neck,
*  shot him in the head.
*  They were shooting at him from different angles.
*  It was more than one person. Yeah.
*  I guarantee. Yeah. I mean, I don't guarantee.
*  But I'm a lot of my life.
*  Don't think that's that's the weirdest argument
*  when people think that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone.
*  That is one of the weirdest arguments that the weird
*  mental gymnastics that people have to play with themselves
*  to get to the position where they think Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. Yeah.
*  Well, I'd like to see a movie.
*  I mean, JFK was good for what it was, but I'd like to see a movie about
*  all the people that got killed in the aftermath.
*  Oh, a lot of people. That would be a good movie.
*  There's a book called Best Evidence by this guy, David Lifton.
*  And David Lifton was an accountant who was hired to do something
*  with the Kennedy assassination.
*  I forget what he was hired to do, but he went over the entire Warren Commission.
*  And, you know, it's a huge many, you know, many, many, many, many pages. Right.
*  And he found all these inconsistencies and all these things wrong with it
*  and all these things that don't make any sense.
*  And he realized, like, they put this together to try to wrap it up tight
*  and and make it seem like there was an obvious conclusion.
*  But it wasn't an examination, like an objective examination of the assassination.
*  Because in those days, the mob and the CIA were as powerful as any.
*  And they were not playing.
*  They would just tell you, look, man, if you do this, don't do this.
*  They wouldn't even have to tell you what was going to happen.
*  You know what was going to happen.
*  They killed the president.
*  They're like, don't do this.
*  If we kill him, you don't think we'll kill you.
*  And so many of the people that were witnesses wound up dead.
*  So many of the people there's something I was thinking hit list
*  in depth investigation to the mystery.
*  Belzer is Belzer.
*  Belzer is a nut.
*  How funny is that?
*  How funny and he's a conspiracy guy.
*  Oh, he's so deep.
*  But how funny isn't that title of his book, you know,
*  because he lost the testicle of cancer.
*  Did he? His conspiracy book is called One Lone Nut.
*  That's pretty funny.
*  It's pretty funny.
*  He had another book called UFOs, Bigfoot and Flying Saucers, I think.
*  Elvis, Bigfoot and Flying Saucers.
*  That's it. Thank you.
*  That's another book that I read of his that is an all conspiracy theory book.
*  Yeah, no, he's all about conspiracy theories.
*  I had a conversation with I only met him once,
*  but we had a long conversation about UFOs and Bigfoot and aliens.
*  And he's a he that motherfucker believes everything. Right.
*  He's like he's all in.
*  Yeah, some people just predisposed to be. They love them.
*  I think they just you know, is another one like that. Dan Aykroyd.
*  Oh, really? Oh, my God.
*  I had him on the podcast.
*  He believes in everything. Ghosts, psychics, you name it.
*  All that extraterrestrial, all of it.
*  Everything's real.
*  He probably thinks the crystal skulls, all of it, everything.
*  He's all in.
*  Well, I was like, really? It was it was a weird conversation.
*  I was like, like he didn't have any skepticism, but it wasn't like
*  who fucking knows? There was none of that.
*  It was none of that. He was all in, all in, all in on psychics,
*  all in on Bigfoot, all in on UFOs.
*  He was all in.
*  He was the he was the oldest 23 year.
*  He was on SNL. He was 23. Was he really?
*  Yes. He seemed like he was like 40. Yes.
*  But I like this idea.
*  I like this. Yeah.
*  But I like this idea of doing this.
*  All the people that got killed after JFK. Yeah.
*  You know, I mean, nothing.
*  I'm not discrediting Bels's book, but it doesn't look like the kind of thing
*  I was envisioning.
*  I wanted it written by some investigative reporter, not by a stand up.
*  They all got murdered, parked their cars on train tracks,
*  jumped off of buildings on my days off at Austin Comedy.
*  I'm going to drive to Dallas two days a week and start researching for the movie.
*  One thing you do if you do drive around there,
*  there's another thing that drove me crazy.
*  I was like, well, the scope on the rifle didn't even work.
*  Like we talking about, how do you know it didn't work? Right.
*  Like, what does that mean?
*  Because when they got it, it didn't work.
*  If you have a scope on a rifle and you just drop the rifle, that scope doesn't work.
*  Really? Yeah.
*  Like a scope on a rifles of like if you fall.
*  And this happened to me once on a hunting trip.
*  I fell and my rifle was off.
*  And we took it back to the range.
*  It was off by six inches at 100 yards with like on a rest where you just squeeze off rounds.
*  It was it was when you knock a rifle, like if you fall down and the rifle drops,
*  it's going to adjust the scope.
*  And you're shooting a bullet, you know, a couple hundred yards or a hundred yards.
*  Any little wiggle, like if it's an eighth of an inch to the left or the right,
*  you're going to be way off by the time it gets to the target.
*  So when all these people were saying, well, the scope on the rifle didn't even work well.
*  Like, what are you talking? You don't know that.
*  Like they found this thing sitting.
*  He could have dropped it after he shot JFK.
*  I think Lee Harvey Oswald was probably in on it.
*  I think he was probably, you know, he's probably one of them.
*  But I think they definitely like when he said he was a Patsy.
*  Yeah. Like, yeah, most likely.
*  Yeah, yeah. He came in.
*  By the way, what was a better description of the JFK assassination than full metal jacket?
*  Oh, it was a great one. Yeah.
*  Outstanding. Yeah.
*  So that was really beautiful.
*  It was the way he said it.
*  Like, it was just like, hey, guess what? Yeah.
*  Life is life is hard.
*  Here's what I say about this thing.
*  Also, letting prepping these guys to be killers.
*  And that what you're rewarding is someone who's really good at killing.
*  Even if you shot the fucking president.
*  Yeah. It's like, I don't give a shit what happened.
*  I'm just telling you, this guy was a Marine.
*  What is this guy? Emory Lee Emory?
*  Really? Yeah. God damn, he was good.
*  He was so good in that role.
*  Well, didn't they say he was there to advise and then they just hired him?
*  Play that. Let me hear that. Yeah.
*  It's not working. What we got here?
*  Is it no audio in the actual?
*  So sad. This is a professional show here.
*  That was Spotify. Yeah.
*  But look, even the way they shot it, like there's clouds overhead. Yeah.
*  Drury, I bet he loved the fact that it was Drury that day, too.
*  You got it?
*  I don't know who Charles Whitman was.
*  None of you dumbasses know.
*  By the cowboy.
*  Sir, he was that guy who shot all those people from that tower in Austin, Texas, sir.
*  That's affirmative.
*  Charles Whitman killed 12 people from a 28 story
*  observation tower at the University of Texas from distances of up to 400 yards.
*  Anybody know who Lee Harvey Oswald was?
*  Private snowball.
*  Sir, he shot Kennedy, sir.
*  That's right. And do you know how far away he was?
*  Sir, it was pretty far from that book suppository building, sir.
*  All right, knock it off.
*  Two hundred and fifty feet.
*  It was two hundred and fifty feet away and shooting at a moving target.
*  Oswald got off three rounds with an old
*  battalion, both action rifle in only six seconds and scored two hits, including a
*  headshot. Do any of you people know where these individuals learned how to shoot?
*  Private Joker.
*  Sir, in the Marines, sir.
*  And the Marines outstanding.
*  Those individuals showed what one motivated Marine and his rifle can do.
*  And before you ladies leave my island, you will all be able to do the same thing.
*  Oh,
*  that's great dialogue.
*  Kubrick was so good.
*  What one motivated.
*  He's like, doesn't matter what it means in the grand scheme of things.
*  We're Marines.
*  I'm just telling you something for here.
*  Training you.
*  But it was such a great scene, too, because Kubrick is really highlighting,
*  like, what has to go on when you're taking a regular kid and turning him into a killer.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  Like you're really brainwashing.
*  I mean, that was brainwashing.
*  Yeah. Oh, absolutely.
*  Yeah.
*  They all say they all say so good.
*  His movies were so goddamn good.
*  You know, he used to do like complex mathematics in his spare time.
*  He did. Yes.
*  For fun.
*  Well, I don't understand what complex mathematics is, but one time I was in
*  an elevator with Norm MacDonald and we were in the elevator with these guys
*  because Norm MacDonald in an elevator is very, you know, he'll just just.
*  He will literally say the worst thing you can say about somebody and then leave
*  and you're left there with all the people.
*  That's his thing. One of his things.
*  But there's two guys were talking about some complex
*  mathematics in the late 90s at 30 Rock and they're saying these like we
*  I didn't even understand what language it was.
*  It was a really deep mathematic thing.
*  And then Norm MacDonald, who had never brought up math or anything like that to
*  be in his life, goes that and starts speaking to them in this like what sounded
*  like tongues and they're like, oh, you know, but and they start speaking
*  the binary and he goes, and he starts speaking this
*  mathematics talk and then they leave and then he goes to me like, yeah,
*  those guys are nerds or something like that.
*  And I was like, how do you know that?
*  How did you know what they were talking about?
*  How did he know he's he's he's like, oh, you know, he's a nerd, too.
*  He knows something deep like he knows these things sometimes a very smart guy.
*  Really smart. Yeah.
*  Those guys are just, you know, just pretend not to know something.
*  They're like, yeah, that's like and then you're like, well,
*  anybody walks in the room, we just he knows what they're talking about.
*  Yeah, he's a guy that really should have had a podcast a long fucking time ago.
*  And I know he's doing something now.
*  He sent me a text message the other day that he's starting to do a podcast now.
*  Hey, Joe, I'm doing a podcast, doing that thing we talked about.
*  He should have done a lot because he had that show on on Netflix.
*  But yeah, they muzzled them when he went on the Howard Stern show.
*  And he was saying something and he didn't want to say retarded.
*  So he said, you'd have to have Down syndrome.
*  Believe that
*  he thought that would be a better thing to say.
*  But here's the thing about Norm.
*  I'm not I'm still not sure if he thought that would be a better thing to say.
*  Right. You know, he's so smart.
*  He might have been doing it as a double troll.
*  Yeah. No.
*  Norm is capable of the double troll.
*  It's like, yeah, I don't want to say retarded down syndrome.
*  The double troll. Exactly.
*  Yes. He's the master of that stuff.
*  I randomly wound up sitting next to him on planes twice on two different occasions.
*  Just like I go norm, like out of nowhere and sit next to me.
*  And one time he's we're sitting there, we're talking and we're having a good old
*  time and then he's talking about, oh, I quit smoking.
*  He's telling me how he quit smoking and fucking.
*  Yeah, finally quit smoking.
*  And he's telling me all these things.
*  Then when he lands, he literally like can't stop himself, runs into the airport
*  store and buy cigarettes and he's lighting it as he's leaving.
*  I go, I thought you quit. He goes, I did.
*  But all that talking about smoking makes me want one.
*  And he's like, before he even got out the door, he's lighting the cigarette.
*  He just couldn't stop himself.
*  But like he goes, all that talking.
*  He's the one talking about all that talk.
*  He always puts it on you.
*  It's great about it.
*  But it was like this guy talks about smoking.
*  He got me back smoking.
*  But it was so crazy because I was like, that's great, Norm.
*  So great. You quit.
*  And he's like, I want a cigarette.
*  No, he always like, yeah, I mean, I don't drink and I quit drinking.
*  And it was like, oh, really?
*  Did you drink? Oh, yeah, I quit.
*  I finally had to quit.
*  You know, it's hard, but I did.
*  And they're like, oh, because, yeah, because I got fucking wasted last night.
*  And I said, I'm never going to drink again.
*  I was drunk and people like, wait, I think you quit.
*  Yeah, I quit. That's what I'm saying.
*  You know, last night.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like an elaborate, like,
*  so exactly.
*  Well, the gambling, too, he fucking loves gambling.
*  Loves it. Oh, yeah.
*  But that's a thing.
*  Like a lot of these great comics are like really impulsive.
*  Yeah. It's like something about like the ability to say some of the crazy shit
*  that he says, it's you have to have this this like hot wire.
*  Yeah. It's just like, yeah, you just want to touch it.
*  Ah, yep.
*  Oh, no, he's he's one for the books.
*  Yeah.
*  Look at the conspiracy theory thing is an interesting.
*  It's an interesting little obsession that a lot of people have.
*  Yeah. Like the wanting to uncover these secrets, the wanting to to know,
*  get to the bottom of things, find out how it all works.
*  Who killed Epstein? Who killed Kennedy?
*  Right. Yeah.
*  Because while the Kennedy one is so it really what's so amazing, too,
*  is you see the country change because almost like subconsciously the whole
*  country knew that this was something else.
*  That was kind of the beginning of the destruction and downfall.
*  Now, you know, maybe I'm 57 fucking years ago, too.
*  That's what's crazy.
*  And there's still yeah, there's still mystery.
*  And it's like they got away with it.
*  Whoever did it got away with it.
*  Did it is long gone.
*  Yeah. This idea that everybody gets caught for things like not not everything is
*  an episode of Law and Order.
*  No. And they took all those.
*  Anytime they interview those mob guys, you know, they all say that stuff.
*  You know what I mean? They also.
*  Well, I heard this. I heard that.
*  I don't know. But this is what I heard.
*  Yeah. You know, and I'm sure it's, you know, it's a badge of honor to go,
*  yeah, I know what's happening, but still, you know.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, that was the other weird thing about New York for years and years and years.
*  Is that New York was essentially run by the mob.
*  And Giuliani helped clean that up, too.
*  Oh, yeah. He busted that.
*  I mean, he he helped clean it up in the 80s.
*  Yeah. He took he did that commission case.
*  You know, crazy how this one guy, Giuliani, was responsible for a lot
*  of the improvement in New York City. Yeah, a lot.
*  Oh, yeah. Sometimes it takes one guy like that.
*  He was like the Beaufort Pusser of New York City.
*  The because the yeah, like taking that taking the fish market down was I was
*  everybody was going he's going to get killed.
*  Really? When he went after the when he became a when he explained to people the
*  whole like the mob ran like like Joe saying sanitation, like even things like I
*  was in the restaurant union. So I didn't know, you know, I know.
*  I just think my dude, I'm like an idiot.
*  And then but like all they ran the restaurant.
*  But then when you run the restaurant
*  you don't just run the bar tenders and the waiters.
*  You run the linen supply like the mob was linen supply and the liquor distributors.
*  I call the mob kids when they weren't, you know, when they were just related
*  to somebody to be driving the liquor trucks.
*  And I was all it was, you know, and the food, the meat.
*  And, you know, remember they had the famous thing with Frank Perdue and chicken and
*  some so they really ran like, you know, they'd run an industry.
*  But there's like 20 jobs that are close to that industry where they're involved.
*  You know, and and a lot of guys had no show jobs and also so Joe's and I had a buddy
*  the Javitson. Exactly. You just said it.
*  I had a friend of mine who had a no show job at the Javitson.
*  Oh, yeah. I knew a few people who worked over the Javitson.
*  Look at Giuliani back then.
*  Right. Right. Yeah.
*  And they said the mafia put an eight hundred thousand dollar bounty on his head.
*  Sure. Amazing.
*  They didn't kill him.
*  What is it's amazing that they didn't.
*  Yeah, I guess I guess there was still a few of the old timers that like we don't do.
*  You know what I mean?
*  We still have a thing about the United States that we don't kill them doing their job.
*  I guess, you know, I guess.
*  But it was interesting to try.
*  They just couldn't get to maybe.
*  Yeah. But it was also that law that was a
*  you know, that guy that it all came from that Rico law.
*  There was some professor just came up with this law and somebody in the DA's office.
*  Somebody goes, that's a great we could use that law.
*  I forget how it worked. That was an interesting story.
*  Racketeering. Yeah.
*  It was just some guy that had this concept of a law, but he wasn't.
*  It was like upstate New York or something.
*  You know what I mean? And that's how they got them all.
*  And that's how they ended up taking.
*  I mean, they're still around, obviously.
*  I don't know.
*  You ever hear that guy, Michael Franchesi, you know, that is.
*  I've seen him being interviewed.
*  Yeah, fascinating. Charismatic guy.
*  Well, it's fascinating that he's just out there running around.
*  Yeah, but I guess he didn't write anybody out or something.
*  I was just like, you know, that generation is gone.
*  So they're probably just like, oh, the hell with it.
*  But, you know, what the fuck was the guy's name?
*  The hit man for Forgotty that.
*  Oh, Sammy the Bull. Sammy the Bull Gravano.
*  Right. Yeah.
*  He's out, too.
*  Sammy the Bull.
*  People have interviewed him, too, like long interviews, long form interviews.
*  They said, talked to him about, you know, I mean, he's a murderer.
*  Just out there wandering around.
*  Yeah.
*  And even got arrested later in his life for selling ecstasy.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, he was trying to get, you know, he's trying to keep young.
*  He said it was this hit man, Sammy the Bull Gravano, is now a social media star
*  promoting his own podcast and showing off his cozy new family life in Arizona.
*  35 years after turning on the Gambino family and John Gotti.
*  Wow. He's seventy five.
*  And he's just starting his. He's like, Norm, he's just starting the podcast.
*  They should do a podcast together. Look at him there.
*  Two guys that should have done one. He looks great.
*  He does look good. He looks great.
*  He's seventy five. He looks fucking great.
*  Well, they always said about him was he would go to the gym.
*  The other guys would go out.
*  He wouldn't stay out late at night.
*  You know, that's kind of crazy.
*  And he's doing a podcast just like Hillary Clinton.
*  Yeah. A couple of murderers doing podcasts.
*  Yeah.
*  Look how good he looks, though. That's so weird.
*  Joe, it doesn't look that good. I don't know why you keep saying.
*  Go back to that. Go back to that picture.
*  Come on.
*  If I look that good at seventy five.
*  Come on.
*  Look at that. He looks fucking good there.
*  You got to admit for a seventy five year old guy.
*  Yeah. I mean, he looks
*  using the same microphones we use, Jamie. Coincidence?
*  He looks 65.
*  No, they're very good.
*  He looks good.
*  Just because he's showing a smile like that.
*  He's about 62.
*  He looks about 62.
*  Thirteen years younger than he really is.
*  That's what I say for that picture.
*  Yeah.
*  You think his podcast any good?
*  Yeah. Would you be a guest?
*  I bet it's a I don't know.
*  You know, I don't go on that many.
*  I don't like going to every podcast.
*  How many have you been on?
*  Plus, what would he ask me? Let me ask.
*  You know, these mob guys.
*  They're not the best. They're not the best comedy.
*  Maybe he is. Maybe him and Michael Franchesi could tell stories.
*  Well, Franchesi seems more like, you know, like he was like, you know,
*  yeah, more like a guy like we would understand.
*  He is a very charismatic guy.
*  Yes. Yeah.
*  But, um, who knows?
*  Sam and the Bull might be, you know what I mean?
*  He's got that street. He's got that street intelligence.
*  How many guys are in jail for life from selling pot?
*  They're watching these guys doing these podcasts.
*  They've killed nine people.
*  What the fuck kind of shit is this?
*  What kind of lawyer did I have?
*  The lawyers like, listen, where's the 100 million?
*  The bad guys.
*  Franchesi, the 100 million missing.
*  He's got 100 million buried somewhere.
*  He's got a nice.
*  See, he looks like a former mob boss.
*  Look at that nice suit he's wearing.
*  Yes. Really well dressed.
*  And how did he how is he out?
*  How much time did he have to do?
*  I don't know, but he did.
*  I know he's in jail, but, um,
*  but he wasn't in there for murder.
*  He was in there for some kind of gasoline.
*  There's a big gasoline thing in the 80s.
*  I don't know how they did it, but it was one of those, you know,
*  things with the Russian mob.
*  I think he was involved with them and so.
*  Yeah.
*  So billions of gallons of gas,
*  the family would collect the state and local gas taxes, but keep the money instead.
*  At the same time, they were often selling the gas at lower prices
*  than at legitimate gas stations.
*  The mid 1980s Fortune magazine listed Franchesi as number 18 on its list of top
*  50 wealthiest and most powerful gangsters in the world.
*  That can't be good for you.
*  He made billions of dollars over the years, not only for himself,
*  but for the five families as well by 1984.
*  His greatest net worth was a staggering
*  20 billion dollars, making him one of the richest gangsters of all time.
*  Wait a minute.
*  Nobody's worth.
*  Nobody's worth 20 billion.
*  Nobody is worth 20 billion dollars in 1984.
*  Says he was.
*  What? Wikipedia's line.
*  Yeah.
*  Even Bill Gates wasn't worth 20 billion dollars in 1985.
*  Franchesi was indicted on 14 counts of racketeering, counterfeiting,
*  counterfeiting and extortion extortion and the gasoline bootleg racket.
*  1986 Franchesi pleaded guilty on two counts.
*  He was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison with 14 million in restitution
*  payments. The guy's worth 20 billion.
*  That ain't shit.
*  That's where the 100 billion, 100 million is.
*  So what is he doing now?
*  First of all, he has 20 billion.
*  Why is he? Why is only 100 million buried?
*  I would have buried 10 billion.
*  Good question.
*  Keep scrolling down that page.
*  Try to find the 20 billion.
*  What does it say at the bottom?
*  I want to find out what happened.
*  That was me.
*  When did he get out?
*  He's a motivational speaker now.
*  This is how you steal.
*  What is he got out in 89?
*  I got re-sentenced for violating his parole terms.
*  What did he do to get arrested for tax fraud in L.A.
*  Sent back to New York.
*  He started making the balance of the court
*  order restitution payments earlier that year.
*  Prosecutors also said Franchesi was not
*  considered by the government to be a cooperating witness.
*  That's why he's alive.
*  He was released in 94.
*  Wow.
*  Wow.
*  Interesting.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  So he made an autobiography.
*  He sounds like a fucking hustler, right?
*  He's been interviewed by Jim Rohn.
*  He's obviously a smart guy.
*  He persuaded New York Yankees players who owed money to the Colombo Loan Sharks
*  to fix baseball games for betting purposes.
*  Holy shit.
*  2003, Franchesi published Blood Covenant and updated and expanded Life Story.
*  He's out now because I mean, he's out out there.
*  For 25 years.
*  But I mean, he's out there doing things.
*  I saw him being interviewed by somebody recently on YouTube.
*  Yeah.
*  Because I'm sure, you know, like you said,
*  he didn't if he didn't cooperate and most of those guys are dead anyway.
*  Wait a minute.
*  They contacted me.
*  Yeah, really recently, I got a request to have him on.
*  Instead, bring him on.
*  I don't know if I want him to know where we are.
*  Good point.
*  Just in case you piss him off.
*  Yeah, there he is.
*  OK, he's been viewed.
*  No, he's yeah.
*  But that value attainment guy, that guy does a very good show.
*  He's on on YouTube.
*  Yes, he's he's very good.
*  Yeah, he's very good.
*  You've seen him.
*  Yeah, he's got a bunch of YouTube show.
*  Look how confident and comfortable that guy is.
*  Out of jail.
*  Looking good.
*  Nice little pocket scarf.
*  Yeah, gentlemen.
*  Like it looks like a real mobster.
*  Yeah.
*  I wonder if he's at the Palm Shoals Club that night.
*  I never know.
*  When I was friends with Fitzsimmons,
*  Fitzsimmons lived in Little Italy and he lived right above the social club
*  where John Gotti and and all those guys used to go.
*  He lived right there.
*  I went to visit him.
*  I was like, Jesus, Greg, like he was right there.
*  Yeah, he like he he he rented this place from like this old Italian couple.
*  Oh, that's really.
*  Yeah, he was right there.
*  Like right now you see those guys walking down the street, walking to the social club.
*  Oh, my God.
*  They probably had him checked out,
*  making sure he wasn't, you know, guy like him could be a federal agent.
*  You know, but this is Simmons has that look.
*  If they saw his act, they'd know there's no way it's too funny.
*  It's also like the those days like when
*  the mob ran New York, it's like the mob ran Vegas.
*  Like everybody has his romantic notions of those days.
*  But again, it's just like gritty New York City.
*  Sure. As long as they weren't fucking you over.
*  Exactly. Yeah.
*  It's all fun until you're trying to, you know, get paid like that.
*  Great Richard Pryor routine. Remember that one?
*  What was that?
*  We're trying to get paid by the mob.
*  You guys just laugh when he pulls a gun out.
*  The good old days.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  But I mean, but yeah, of course, you miss New York.
*  Whatever flavor, you know, that's what you miss is whatever that other
*  intangible thing was. Yeah.
*  Madness. But it did get like you said, Times Square cleaned up.
*  It was the worst Times Square was horrible.
*  I mean, I hated time.
*  Everybody hated Times Square.
*  And then it got cleaned up and right away we're like, hey, it looks like Disneyland.
*  It did get to be like a big Applebee's.
*  Like we were saying, it really did get real.
*  It became like a like just real chain.
*  Yes, chain restaurants.
*  I feel like that was one of the downfalls was chains, but they're the only ones that could do.
*  And I mean, like small business owners weren't going to be in, you know,
*  they weren't able to afford the rents.
*  Yeah. And the small business owners were all point stores before that.
*  Well, that was also when you got there, like Caroline's changed.
*  Yes. Caroline's is right on Broadway.
*  And I remember Caroline's at one point, Tom was like, you guys,
*  none of you people are from here.
*  Like Caroline's became like this tourist trap.
*  Right. You know?
*  Yes. Like if you want like if you did
*  Gotham, you got New York City people.
*  But if you did Caroline's, you were getting like all tourists.
*  Yeah, it was weird. They're all from Kansas and shit.
*  Yeah. First time in New York.
*  Well, people would say that if you want to
*  a good test of your act to see if it would work nationally was Caroline's.
*  That's what it became.
*  Yeah. Because like you said, it was really tourists.
*  Yeah. But it wasn't always like that.
*  When I lived in New York, Caroline's was like a real New York club.
*  I know. Yeah.
*  But because they cleaned up Times Square, they cleaned up Caroline's too.
*  Yeah, because people didn't want to go to Times Square in the old days.
*  I mean, the 80s, nobody wants to go to Times Square unless you're up to some
*  devious behavior, there's no point to be in there.
*  Is Dangerfields still open?
*  Dangerfields is exactly the same.
*  How is it possible that it's still open?
*  Well, maybe you ask your buddy.
*  Talk to Fred Chazee.
*  He's selling gas in the back.
*  Dangerfields has not changed in 35 years.
*  I was there like three years ago.
*  I was laughing so hard.
*  I used to love that club.
*  Oh, I love it. You do third because you do you really work out.
*  Oh, nobody was there.
*  Nobody's there. 30 minutes sets.
*  Yeah. Do you remember Bobby, the doorman?
*  Yeah, of course. Bobby.
*  Big old fucking Scottish guy.
*  Powerlifter. Bobby.
*  I saw him pick a man up by his neck.
*  Some guy was heckling.
*  He grabbed the man.
*  But Bobby was an enormous human being.
*  Yeah.
*  Grabbed the man by his neck and lifted him up in the air, carried him out.
*  Like he had one hand on his belt, one hand on his neck,
*  because he was such a tank.
*  He picked the guy up like the guy was an empty suitcase.
*  But even that's an old school technique for bouncing by the belt and the neck.
*  Just.
*  Is that the great? Yeah, Bobby.
*  Yeah, Bobby.
*  He goes, you'd get off stage, even if you killed it.
*  He goes, oh, you tricked him again with that bag of shite for a neck.
*  It was a great place because I knew I knew that Kinnison had performed there
*  and Rodney Dangerfield did those Dangerfield specials there.
*  You know, I mean, it was it was his spot.
*  It was amazing.
*  But you would go there and it was like, why is this place empty?
*  Yeah, I don't understand.
*  Yeah.
*  They made all the money in prom season and I guess I did prom shows there.
*  I did them with Otto and George.
*  Otto and George and I did prom shows.
*  Those are fun.
*  They were wild. They're wild.
*  They never they never rotated the show.
*  They would just put in more people like and they told you to.
*  They told you to never change your act because they wanted people to leave.
*  So
*  folks don't know what prom shows are.
*  Prom shows are you would get there and this is no bullshit.
*  You might do a 7 p.m.
*  show and you might do five shows a night.
*  So your last show might be like two o'clock in the morning.
*  Yeah. And you would leave there.
*  It would be light out.
*  Yep. I mean, it was crazy.
*  It was it really didn't make any sense.
*  Seventeen years old high school kids.
*  And they're they're leaving their prom and they would get them in there on limos
*  and pump them into the club.
*  And the kids were hammered and drunk.
*  Yep.
*  Yeah. I saw a kid go on stage.
*  He took the microphone away from Alou Bell and blew cigar smoke in his face.
*  I was like, Jesus, this is rough.
*  It was a rough show.
*  It was wild, man.
*  And they were so dumb.
*  These kids, they were so stupid.
*  Yeah. Otto and George was on.
*  He was fucking hilarious.
*  And his kids like, I could see his lips moving.
*  His lips are moving.
*  He was mad that you could see the vitriol.
*  Oh, he didn't even care that it was some of the funniest fucking material.
*  So funny.
*  Do you remember when he had a Kennedy head?
*  Did you ever see when Otto and George had a Kennedy?
*  No.
*  He you know, George the dummy, he had rigged this thing up where George's head
*  would flap back and it would like expose his brain.
*  And he was working on this thing.
*  We would have like a Kennedy head.
*  And he said he goes, yeah, I want to get it so it squirts blood,
*  so I can get blood to squirt out of his head.
*  I mean, it was really I mean, I guess they're all like that,
*  but he is such a sick relationship with that goddamn George.
*  Oh, it was weird.
*  It was like an episode of The Twilight Zone.
*  It really was. Yeah, it was.
*  Yeah. A couple of people told stories about the time they'd be out and,
*  you know, somebody would say something and then Otto would just go crazy
*  and attack them for verbally abusing the dummy.
*  Well, a Puerto Rican guy stabbed the dummy on stage one day.
*  That's right.
*  I don't remember where that was, but I remember the story.
*  I remember the story.
*  He would sometimes have to check on the dummy, like go like open the trunk.
*  I got to check on George.
*  Yeah.
*  He was with a girl one time.
*  I forget that story.
*  But it was something with the girl.
*  And she said something about the dummy goes, he stays with me.
*  And he went crazy and she ran out of the house because she's a psycho.
*  I really blame her.
*  Remember that episode, The Twilight Zone, where the guy's done talking to him?
*  Yes. Yes.
*  Yeah, there's something about dummy acts.
*  There's some Duncan Trussell used to have this dummy and someone stole it.
*  His dummy was Little Hobo and Little Hobo.
*  The act in the act, the dummy was his grandfather's dummy and his grandfather
*  died and his grandfather's dying wish was that Duncan would bring Little Hobo
*  on stage one last time before he buried him with his grandpa.
*  So he'd have the dummy on stage and then the dummy would start talking to him.
*  He's like, wait a minute.
*  How the fuck are you talking?
*  It was like this crazy thing where the dummy would take him over and he would
*  play Pink Floyd and he would sing along.
*  There it is.
*  That's Duncan and Little Hobo.
*  And people did.
*  I took him with me to the UK and they did not know what to fucking expect.
*  Wish you were here.
*  So he would play that song, Pink Floyd song, Wish You Were Here.
*  And him and the dummy would be singing at the same time, two different voices,
*  because he had like it synced up.
*  He had like a whole setup with recordings and everything.
*  It was amazing. That's great.
*  Living in a fishbowl year after year.
*  And his eyes would roll back in his head and the dummy would be singing.
*  It was amazing.
*  It was amazing.
*  Do people believe it?
*  No, they would love it.
*  It was so good.
*  It was such a good routine.
*  And then someone fucking stole Little Hobo.
*  Someone stole it.
*  And so he had to get a new Little Hobo.
*  And the new Little Hobo was even creepier.
*  He hasn't done it forever.
*  I would love for him to do that routine.
*  But what? But would that be his closer?
*  Yeah. Oh, yeah.
*  You couldn't follow Little Hobo.
*  Is it in there?
*  Give me some volume.
*  We got a problem with our system.
*  I just thought of it.
*  I have to mute like five different things.
*  One last chance on stage and dedicate a song to my grandfather.
*  Is that OK with you guys if I do that?
*  That's not wish you were here.
*  Oh, oh, oh, oh.
*  Oh, that was that was that was when someone was getting married.
*  That fucking Satanist with his name Stanton Lavey.
*  Anton Lavey.
*  Yeah, I took a photo with that guy and
*  nuts online are convinced that that's the evidence that I am a Satanist
*  because the guy took it.
*  He was doing like the devil.
*  Right. And it was he was getting married and Duncan performed at his wedding.
*  And I had to go because it was the craziest fucking shit ever.
*  Duncan was there and they hired him to do his little hobo routine at this guy's
*  satanic wedding so he couldn't use wish you were here.
*  He had to use like, you know, we're more into this kind of like heavy metal.
*  No, no, he did wish you were here.
*  That was that was the program.
*  Yeah, because, yeah, it's hard.
*  It's hard to take a Satanist seriously when he does this.
*  The devil horns. Yeah, you know, but he was
*  the father did go for that kind of stuff.
*  I think he was the grandson or the son of a fame of Anton Lavey.
*  I forget what it was.
*  Grandson.
*  But but their idea of what Satanism is a little different.
*  Like, you know, you think, oh, he worships the devil.
*  Their Satanism was like hedonism.
*  Really what it was like was like giving
*  into your carnal instincts and just living for the moment, doing whatever you
*  wanted to do, but I don't necessarily think now I sound like a Satanist.
*  The grandson. That's what the grandson said.
*  The son of the grandson.
*  What a Satan apologists.
*  They were trying to explain to me.
*  I'm like, so you believe in the devil.
*  You worship the devil.
*  Like, what is this?
*  Well, they just it's like, you know, the grandfather probably was a real deal.
*  I think it was just they're being silly.
*  It's like Dylan versus Jacob Dylan.
*  Jacob Dylan's talented.
*  But, you know, Bob, is it just it's a different, you know, different kind of talent.
*  Yeah, Jacob's like pop.
*  He's got great songs.
*  Yeah.
*  But he's not like Anton Lavey.
*  Where did that guy where the fuck did Jacob Dylan go?
*  I don't know.
*  I met him back in the day when I was filming Fear Factor.
*  His kids were like Fear Factor fans, right?
*  And they came to watch one of the episodes.
*  I met Kenny G that way, too.
*  You did.
*  They came to the episode.
*  Yeah, they came to watch it.
*  The film.
*  The episodes were like outside.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  They came to watch.
*  Yeah. They came to watch the people eat dicks and stuff.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  There's fucking.
*  What is this?
*  It's the evolution of.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  That's two little hobos.
*  It was a wild night.
*  Oh, OK.
*  So he he did some experimental work.
*  I see that. That was like that painter.
*  I forget his name, but it's like, yeah, I see what he's doing.
*  He had different phases of his career.
*  Well, that's the problem.
*  When you have a closer like that, then you just you just you can't really get
*  inspired to keep working because you're like, I mean, this clothes is going to change.
*  It was weird to follow.
*  Because I brought him with me on the road.
*  Oh, my God.
*  You should have made him come back up and do it at the end.
*  No, it was awesome.
*  It was fun. It was fun.
*  That's so funny.
*  So Colin, what happens with you now?
*  Where do you go? Where do you go from here?
*  That's the question.
*  You need to do stand up again.
*  Where do we all go from here?
*  Well, maybe I don't know.
*  Like legitimately.
*  Oh, you thought about it.
*  Where am I going to? I don't know.
*  I mean, I write, you know, I'm right.
*  I write every day.
*  I'm writing scripts, writing books, I'm doing all that stuff.
*  You write every day. Yeah.
*  Do you sit down at a specific time and do it or?
*  No, I don't have that discipline, you know, but I make sure I write, you know,
*  but I'm like, I'm sure like every time I write like five days in a row and I'll be
*  like, I'm a beast, I'm really I'm a disciplined person.
*  And then the next day I'll just be like, I just start eating and, you know,
*  like any like any Narcos offshoot show, any show that's related in any way
*  to Narcos is the greatest show to me on Netflix.
*  Why do you like Narcos?
*  I just love all those shows.
*  I love Fowder.
*  You ever watch that one?
*  What's that? The Israeli one?
*  No, Fowder.
*  That's another Netflix.
*  I only watched the first two seasons of Narcos.
*  Once it wasn't Pablo Escobar anymore, I kind of lost.
*  Was that guy not the best?
*  Well, they did it in Mexico. It was great, too.
*  I heard nobody was as good as that guy to play in Pablo Escobar.
*  He's incredible.
*  Because most evil, like even what I expected to see Pablo Escobar was like this
*  guy that's like, and he's just playing this other thing.
*  This dull kind of banality of evil guy who's just like looking and then just,
*  oh, boy, was he an actor.
*  I believed it, though.
*  Me too. That's what I mean.
*  All in. All in.
*  When he confronts those cops on the bridge.
*  Yes.
*  And he's like, silver or lead.
*  It's your choice.
*  And they're like, oh, take the silver.
*  Oh, shit.
*  The fuck.
*  Yeah, that's a great.
*  It's just, again, like I got a huge photo
*  of Pablo Escobar in the old studio.
*  Huge of his mugshot was big smiling face.
*  Yeah.
*  And people would see it in the photos
*  because I take pictures with the guests in front of the werewolf with this Pablo
*  Escobar photo and people get mad.
*  They're like, you're celebrating this guy.
*  Like he was terrible to Colombia.
*  Like for me as an outsider who loved that Narco shows, like look at this chaos.
*  This fucking guy who controlled Colombia for so many years, made so much money
*  selling coke.
*  But for the people that had to deal with it, it's the same as like the romantic
*  notions of Times Square.
*  Exactly.
*  It's like all and even me who knows better that photo with that huge mugshot.
*  We had like a five foot version of that at our podcast studio in LA.
*  That's funny because that shot and he probably loves that shot and probably hates
*  that other shot was as fat as a house.
*  That can't be him.
*  With the wife.
*  Yeah, that's not him.
*  That's him.
*  All those pictures are.
*  He let himself go full apart.
*  He's just doing coke and drinking.
*  I mean, what a party that guy led until the end.
*  I mean, he never really got the hair under control.
*  All that money.
*  You should wear a hat.
*  What kind of hat?
*  Yeah. How about that in front of the White House?
*  Wild.
*  It's weird when you go by the White House, how close it is to the street.
*  Yeah, I know.
*  It's confusing.
*  It's crazy.
*  How has nobody fucking shot that place full of holes?
*  No, they probably, the bedroom is probably in the back.
*  Well, even if it was still.
*  It's weird how close it is because back then, you had muskets.
*  It wasn't.
*  I'd like the bedroom up front, wouldn't you?
*  So you can look out and say, hey, people don't realize that presidents
*  looking at you as you live wild.
*  You live on the edge.
*  Yeah, right there.
*  Let's live in the back of the White House.
*  That's why you're never going to be president.
*  That's one of the reasons you might be able to be president.
*  You know a lot about politics, probably more than any comic I know.
*  To Dave Smith.
*  I feel like I feel like I would be a good president.
*  But that's that's the first step.
*  You have to be to lose narcissistic enough.
*  That's why I think that book.
*  You were a good president.
*  Yeah. To think I could do this.
*  I have two copies of that narcissism book if you want it.
*  I like the idea better than we say in the green room just to watch the fury.
*  And then we film.
*  I mean, Joe, I hope we can have some cameras in this thing.
*  We film the anger in their faces when they say he's gave this book to me.
*  I feel like you're honestly considering moving here.
*  Yeah, well, I do love I do love the idea of it.
*  Do you really feel like legitimately all bullshit aside, you would move here?
*  I don't know. Ron White lives here.
*  I don't know if I would move here.
*  Do you know Ron White?
*  Sure.
*  He's here.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know Ron White well enough where it would influence my move.
*  I can introduce you to.
*  I mean, I know him.
*  It's not get drunk.
*  I don't think he'll swing you at my feet.
*  No, Ron White's lifestyle and my lifestyle would not be.
*  Yeah. You could just hang out while he drinks.
*  I'll know I'd rather.
*  No, I'd rather do.
*  I'd rather watch you do like like whatever violent stuff,
*  you know, like throwing spears.
*  I don't know what you're doing on the ranch, but shit like that is more interesting
*  to me. OK, you know, I mean, like all that.
*  I'm sure you got like archery.
*  I'm sure you get all kind of fun stuff to do.
*  My old studio, I had an inside range at a 45 yard indoor range.
*  You did. Oh, yeah.
*  Yeah. I had a rubber elk that shoot.
*  I shoot arrows into.
*  Are you going to get all kinds of stuff like that?
*  Of course. Yeah, 100 percent.
*  It's kind of cool. Yeah.
*  Yeah. The next place where we have a studio will 100 percent have a range.
*  Oh, I think you meant in the house.
*  I have it in my house, too. Right.
*  Yeah. Right. No, I have it in my house.
*  But I mean, the next studio, I'll have a range.
*  I like to do it after shows. It clears my mind.
*  It's good. You practice archery.
*  Yeah. Once. Really?
*  I tried it. It's fun.
*  It's fun. Just something about hitting a target.
*  It's like something about letting it go.
*  Yeah. It's like seeing that arrow hit its mark.
*  Yes. Cleansing for the mind.
*  I feel like that was I feel like there I feel like the invention of guns
*  took a lot of the purity out of war.
*  You know what I mean? Right.
*  Yeah. In the old days.
*  But even archers really think about it.
*  You're fighting with sword.
*  You're used to a certain and suddenly all these asshole archers that are
*  thousands of yards back just, you know, release the archers.
*  And then well, the craziest shit was catapults.
*  Right. Yeah.
*  This launch a ball covered flaming tar flying at you.
*  That's how they took it.
*  Constantinople. I was watching this thing on that.
*  I was like, man, those goddamn catapults.
*  They didn't expect them, you know,
*  and they just flaming for they just took it down.
*  They were like, what is this?
*  So when I do open up a club out here, I'm going to I'm going to send out the signal.
*  I'm going to let you know.
*  But honestly, I would love it if you came by at least and worked.
*  Of course I would.
*  And I will test everybody now that we got the rapid testing.
*  We can get results in 15 minutes.
*  I think we could do a whole crowd in an hour.
*  I think if you have a good idea
*  and tell people to get there at seven.
*  Yes.
*  Two hundred people.
*  You could do it inside an hour easy.
*  Get a staff of nurses.
*  Everybody's masked up until you get tested.
*  Wouldn't be that hard to do.
*  I mean, yeah, if even if you even have to by then.
*  But I mean, I love the idea.
*  Yeah. And people want to get there early.
*  Plus, it'll get people there early.
*  Nothing worse than a bunch of latecomers.
*  Exactly.
*  Then when they come inside, they can have a drink once they pass.
*  Yeah.
*  You can take your fucking mask off and live like a person.
*  Yeah. You're inside.
*  You don't have to worry.
*  Everybody's been cleared.
*  Everybody's been tested.
*  I love it.
*  I love it, too.
*  I love the fact that right now I'm clear.
*  You're clear.
*  You know it.
*  I know it feels great.
*  It does feel great.
*  Today, I think was my,
*  would I say 37 test?
*  I think today is my 37 test.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, I think it can be done.
*  I just want them to come up with some sort of a treatment where we could just
*  get, but I am going to fucking appreciate things now.
*  I mean, I do appreciate things, but I'm really going to appreciate standup again.
*  When we get back to it, you're going to savor it.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  Because sometimes it gets to the point where you're like, I want to do good.
*  It's not that you don't enjoy it.
*  You can't help but enjoy it if you're a standup, but you're not say you're like
*  trying to get to the goal.
*  I want to kill instead of the whole journey of like, like sometimes I'll do an
*  hour and I'm like, I feel great afterwards.
*  I want to feel great during it, too.
*  What if we lured you here by producing
*  Tough Room, producing and promoting Tough Room?
*  I don't know.
*  When you think about it, I'll think about it for sure.
*  Think it really well, because if you did it as a podcast, I think it would be
*  fucking giant. I really think it'd be giant.
*  I think if we take the time and really
*  think about it and organize really good guests like organized guys like Joey Diaz,
*  guys like Greg Fitzsimmons, funny fucking people, have them come in.
*  They're going to do stand up at the place.
*  Yes, they'll do stand up at the place and do it just like you did.
*  Tough crowd. We have subjects in the news.
*  You bring it up and you have a table full of great comics talking shit like a podcast.
*  Yeah.
*  I'll think about it for sure.
*  Thank you.
*  I will. I will. All right.
*  That's great. Listen, man, I'm glad you made it here.
*  Thank you. It was an honor.
*  It was a pleasure. It was really.
*  We do it again. We'll do it. Absolutely.
*  OK, we'll do it again.
*  And when the club opens, I want you to be there like one of the first weeks.
*  Please. Great. I would love it.
*  All right. Yeah, I love it.
*  All right.
*  Do you have social media? Do you have all that jazz?
*  Yeah, Twitter. But I mean, my book is I even promoted my book.
*  Oh, tell everybody about your book.
*  My book is called Overstated.
*  It just came out.
*  It's a roast of the 50 states, basically.
*  So it's basically talking about the United States right now.
*  And we've all been to I've been to 47.
*  I'm in the 50, maybe even 50.
*  I've been to 47. I haven't.
*  I've been to the Dakotas and Wyoming.
*  I was just to say that I haven't been to the Dakotas and Wyoming.
*  Wow.
*  That's exactly what I was going to say.
*  I've been to Alaska and Hawaii.
*  There it is. Overstated Coast to Coast roast of the 50 states.
*  I haven't been to
*  I guess I've been everywhere else.
*  I kind of think.
*  Nope. Never been to New Mexico either.
*  Yeah.
*  I think I drove through when I was a little kid, but that's it.
*  I don't think I've been anywhere.
*  Yeah, I did shows in New Mexico and we went to the hotel.
*  I was like, oh, I like it here in Albuquerque.
*  I'm lying there in the room.
*  I'm like, this is nice.
*  New Mexico.
*  It's like a drive by next door.
*  It was a nice hotel.
*  Albuquerque.
*  That's a wild west.
*  That's Navajo country.
*  Yeah.
*  Tap, tap, tap.
*  Remember Johnny Tapia?
*  Yes, I do.
*  That fucking big.
*  What was the the mother?
*  Virgin Mary.
*  Yeah. On his chest.
*  Guadalupe. That's right.
*  Virgin of Guadalupe on his chest.
*  He was a great. He was a bad motherfucker.
*  Yeah, that was awesome.
*  All right.
*  Colin Quinn. You're the best.
*  I appreciate you, brother.
*  Thank you so much.
*  As soon as Austin Comedy Club opens up, you're in.
*  Yes. Goodbye, everybody.
*  See you.
