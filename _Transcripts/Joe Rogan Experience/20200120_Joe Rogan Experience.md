# Joe Rogan Experience #1415 - Bari Weiss
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [January 20, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL-YwrjKqZU)
*  3 2 1
*  Hello Barry
*  Double double guns good to see it. Great to see you too. So I'm enjoying my turmeric you are right superfood
*  It's good layered Hamilton's on the side right layered Hamilton and Gwyneth Paltrow
*  No, no, don't ever done the tumor. No, no, no one is a world champion athlete
*  One of the greatest surfers the world has ever known
*  The other one is a wonderful actress who is Iron Man's girlfriend. There's a difference
*  There's a big difference and you know a major mogul
*  And once you determines what people like me want to purchase by and look like she wants you to put vagina rocks
*  Yes in there right Jade Jade Jade Jones something like that. I
*  Don't know maybe there's a placebo effect that
*  So look we were talking so well before the podcast rolled out that I just wanted to just just start it
*  You know, we don't we don't have to talk about presidential candidates
*  We don't have to talk about all that but we're in a weird time, you know and to speak to what we're talking about before
*  We're just talking about how people are so strange or so much
*  So many people there's a just a big disconnect between what people actually think and what they actually say and I think this is in
*  My life. This is the first time that I've ever really experienced at this at this level
*  There's a hysteria because people are being punished for their real beliefs instead of like having
*  The ability to express themselves and have other people disagree and have some sort of rational discussion
*  There's this is a strange time where you have to tow the status quo
*  You have to tow the line and I'm trying I've been trying to figure out what it is
*  But I think a big part of it is the opposition to Trump
*  I think people's opposition to Trump is so strong that people have lost their minds
*  Yeah, it seems like the people that oppose him they they just want
*  Complete and total compliance with with opposition with with this different way of thinking does that make sense?
*  Yeah
*  It's like the stakes are so high that everyone needs to be on side and an active part of the resistance and if you deviate
*  In any way it shows that you're a squish or that you're actually loyal to the other side
*  And in fact what that side of things is doing is that they're limiting the spectrum of what's allowed to say so so so
*  narrowly that people I think are becoming
*  secretly radicalized because in the other way yes, yes, and honestly like you're great
*  But I think one of the reasons you're so unbelievably popular is because you just say what you think and you bring other people on here
*  Just say what they think and the number of places where that actually happens is unbelievably small and getting smaller
*  It's so strained you get shit for it. That's what's really crazy like you
*  I'm I'm a nice person like my thoughts on these things that I discussed in the show
*  Are well thought out and I only hope to do good like legitimately
*  I mean I mock things and I you know, I'm a comedian but at the end of the day
*  I want everybody to be happy. I really genuinely do I think that's possible
*  I think it's possible in small groups, right? I mean, this is what the analogy I always use
*  It was just the three of us on earth. I think we get along great. We have our disagreements, but there would be no war
*  There's certainly would none the three of us wouldn't kill each other right you mean Jamie
*  I don't think Jamie but
*  Jamie's a good guy, but but my point is like why can't we scale that out?
*  Why can't we all just get along in larger groups?
*  Well, a lot of it is a lack of communication a lot of it is, you know
*  Greed and living this there's so many different reasons why you can't scale that to millions and millions of people but
*  It just seems like there's no no
*  Weirder time where things don't make sense and progress seems to be stalled
*  socially than today and like the way that I think about it lately is I
*  Feel like normalcy is closeted like normal people. I know that have just like very
*  Sensible beliefs are scared to even say those things out loud, right?
*  And I think that that is just a sign of deeply unhealthy culture
*  Like it only contributes to this sort of polarization and
*  Extremes that were that we're seeing
*  Yeah, like you were talking about the denial of the biological differences between males and females like I just
*  This is something that people openly
*  Want to support today they want to pretend that there is no difference
*  Well, it's like you can both believe that there are
*  Two sexes and that there are biological differences between men and women and also believe
*  That if someone asks you to call them by a different pronoun than the one that they used to go by or whatever
*  That you want to respect that person and that life is so hard and why wouldn't you just go along with that?
*  Sure, those are two beliefs that many people I know hold and yet to suggest that
*  gender and sex are only a construct and
*  It's something that people don't feel like they can express right now
*  That it's only a construct
*  I know a lot of people who feel like they can only say that gender and sex are a construct
*  Oh, they're stuck. Okay, they're stuck saying that you were phrasing and sound like the other way
*  I'm saying that like two things are possible at once sure you can believe in
*  biological difference and believe that people should be respected and that you know
*  Someone wants to change their gender and that life becomes much more, you know
*  Sharon's gender is real and also sex differences are real. Yes, and those two things are possible at once
*  Yes. Yes, I think about that a lot, you know with my with my book with the case of someone like
*  Congresswoman Ilhan Omar it's like Ilhan Omar is the subject of
*  Bigotry not least from the president of the United States and yet Ilhan Omar herself has said some things about
*  Jews and
*  Israel that are themselves bigoted both things are true at once and yet we're living in a society where it seems like
*  You can only choose one of those two sides. Yes a binary society as opposed to a nuanced one
*  That's what's weird about today
*  It's like you we're dealing with the same amount of intelligent people
*  But they seem to be shackled in their their ability to express themselves honestly, and so what are they scared of right?
*  repercussions right and those are real right you look at someone I
*  Think that one thing that's overlooked in this when we talk about cancel culture, right and the social ostracism
*  and the actual firings that can happen when you
*  Break with one another orthodoxy is that the people who are
*  Inoculated from it or people that are already extremely successful and can take the risk. It's why Ricky Gervais can be Ricky Gervais
*  It's why JK Rowling can tweet which she tweeted a few months ago and survive it because they've already
*  accumulated enough capital the people that I hear from that are completely screwed by it or people like
*  artists and poets and
*  Tenured professors who aren't famous and no one knows about and are you know having to go with a begging bowl on?
*  Patreon or Venmo or whatever to get support after they've you know made a bad joke or whatever it is yes
*  Yes, that's that is exactly what's happening. Yeah, it's um I mean I'm sure that this is because of social media
*  I'm sure this is the the
*  repercussions of having this new form of communication that people don't wield
*  Responsibly that this these attacks on people you do them much more flippantly than you would if you were across from someone
*  Of course because there's no there's so little
*  Shame on the internet because people are disinhibited. It's like people say things to me on the internet that are I
*  Wouldn't even mention them here. I mean they're so vile
*  They're just they're disgusting and yet
*  I've seen some of these people in real life and they would never even have the courage to approach me on the street
*  What's they're not real expressions when they're when they're doing that they're just they're button-pushing
*  They're throwing rocks at glass and this is a good jump off point for your book on anti-semitism
*  You know I I reached out to you because
*  Any semi-tism you know obviously I'm not Jewish so it's it's something that so he's baffled me
*  I don't hope for you to thank you can I convert?
*  Up to some LA rabbit, but I would have to
*  Have to go through like a lengthy thing like you can't just convert right my uncle thing my uncle Salvatore Salvatore
*  D. Jolando I love it. Yeah, he's alive. Oh, yeah. Yeah, he converted when we were kids that was when I first
*  Found out about Judaism. I was like what is it like I didn't understand what it was you know we were raised Catholic
*  and I was like
*  God I guess I was probably like five or six when he was converting so he had to take all these classes
*  And you know go go through all the stuff that you have to do and
*  Married a woman who's Jewish and she was like crack that whip
*  Jackie she told him what's up, so when but when that was all going down that was the first time I'd ever
*  Question religion because I was like wait wait wait. What is that? What is Judaism and then they explain?
*  I go do they believe in God and yeah, okay, but it's a different God. No, it's the same God
*  Jesus was a Jew Joe yeah, but that's why I was confused
*  I'm like well, what is the difference like why why is there I didn't know there was anything other than Catholic
*  I was five you know yeah, I was baffled and I remember thinking like how many of these fucking things are there?
*  And then I was told there were hundreds. I was like oh Jesus
*  This is a mess and then I went to Catholic school for a year and that really cured me of
*  Oh any any idea of religion being legitimate Catholic school was so brutal
*  Would you learn about the Jews in Catholic school nothing? Uh-huh? Yeah, it wasn't that it was just meanness
*  It was just compliance and and fear and we're gonna make you sit in a closet and on a bed of nails
*  Oh my god, these two whack kids in the head and
*  Nuns, I mean there was a bed of nails. No no no they would threaten you okay
*  Okay, you're gonna have to stay overnight and sleep on a bed of nails
*  And yeah, they would just try to scare you if you cry they'd laugh at you and oh my god the meanest ladies
*  There's very few people whose name I remember from being six years old, but sister Mary Josephine that bitch
*  I'll remember that bitch to the day I die
*  She was so mean like I thought my parents were getting split up when I was little when I was five years old so I
*  Was really enthusiastic about God and religion because I felt like at least in that there's some sort of
*  There's structure. There's something that makes sense and I remember
*  Just being in Catholic school for just a couple of weeks, and I was like well obviously this is horseshit, too
*  You know my parents relationship is horseshit. This is horseshit like what is real in this life?
*  But this it was good for me though. It was very it was good at that time of my life to experience
*  just the just the hypocrisy and the
*  The meanness of it all the lack of love and the disdain for children like the whole thing
*  It was it was an awful situation to find yourself in I'm sorry wasn't that bad nobody?
*  Sexually abused me. I didn't get you know there was nothing horrible
*  No one beat me up, but it was enough of a nightmare where it kind of like made me
*  Legitimately start questioning everything in life. Yeah, so you're raising your daughters with
*  secular yes 100% secular my wife secular too, but we talk about things and the
*  one of the things that I think is important is that like I
*  Tell them if you live your life like God is real. It's better
*  Because you live your life by these universal principles that
*  The core the core good of almost all religions follow treat each other as if they are loved family members
*  Treat people as if they're you
*  Treat treat them as if it's you living another life the golden rule like all those things don't steal don't murder
*  People are created in the image of God and whether or not that God exists if you believe that you'll treat people really well
*  And if you do live a better life
*  And if they treat you like that like you live the world is better the world is a better place
*  And that's that's how we and the other thing that I say well. I think this sorry that's okay
*  But honestly I say honestly no one knows like if you say I know there's a God
*  You're not being honest because you've met unless unless you know something that I don't unless you've died and experienced it and even then
*  We could chalk that up to a host of neuro chemicals that your body releases when it thinks you're thinks you're dying and some of them
*  I've actually taken before so I know what the experience is like and
*  If you if you say there's no God you don't know what you're talking about either
*  You you really don't know if there's no God you no one knows no one knows what even the concept of God is you're talking
*  about
*  thousands of years of trying to decipher experiences and things that are translated from
*  One language to another from different phonetic languages
*  And it just it's very strange to try to tell people that you know something for a fact
*  When you've never experienced it, and this is what we talk about this when I talk to my children
*  I don't say there's no God God's bullshit religions bullshit. Everyone's lying to you
*  I just say no one really knows but it gives people comfort it makes people feel better
*  And then there's a lot of things that are really good about church
*  And one of the things that's really good about church is the community yes
*  I mean this to me connects to the thing that we open by talking about which is
*  Polarization and tribal you know the tribal politics were living in I think you've had Jonathan Haidt on the show and his book
*  The Righteous Mind is brilliant about this that we were evolved to be
*  religious creatures in a certain way and what happens when
*  We lose religion that impulse goes somewhere
*  And I think that impulse has gone into you know politics in the culture war yes
*  You know it's like why are the stakes of that so unbelievably high?
*  Because that is sort of the operating system that people are organizing their life around
*  I think you're 100% right. I think it's the Protestants versus the Catholics, but it's like what what do we do right?
*  Because we're not gonna go back like to convince people that are unconvincible that they're you know I think
*  Fighting for the idea of God is sort of a losing argument in the culture
*  So how do we retain the good things that came from religious structures in a post-god age?
*  I think that's a huge question
*  Well, what are what are people really wary of one of things they're wary of is the recluse right?
*  We're wary. We're wary of the Unabomber
*  We're wary of that that guy who lives in the woods and doesn't the the isolationist who doesn't need anybody else
*  They're by themselves like well that person doesn't follow by the rules of our community
*  Well, what are we comfortable about we're comfortable about friendly neighbors. We're comfortable like hey you need help
*  You know you need me to help dig you out of the snow
*  Do you need this do you need that like that's what we love right because then and we love people that share our values, right?
*  We like to live in a community of shared values because then you like you're all we're all comforting each other
*  We're all saying we're all in this together. We're gonna have hardships
*  We're gonna have good times, but the we'll have more good times
*  We'll be able to get through the hardships if we operate together with similar values
*  Yeah, but we're kind of we're not living in the age of the Unabomber
*  But we're certainly living in an age where people are completely isolated
*  You know everyone on the campaign trail is talking about the diseases of despair and how the lifespan in this country has gone down for the
*  Past three life expectancy has gone down in the past three years because of Trump
*  Because because people are out of work because
*  Because factories are closing because we're going through whatever andreang calls it the fourth industrial revolution because of globalization because like we're living through an
*  Unbelievably trans what I think will be remembered is an unbelievably transformative time and Trump is only one data point
*  Yes, like he's a symptom and he's a catalyst
*  But he's not the whole picture and to see him as the whole picture
*  I think is just like completely missing the moment that we're in well put very well put yeah
*  I think I really think you just nailed it
*  I really think that's a lot of what's going on here, and I think
*  mean what you said but
*  people
*  Enjoying when people can speak their mind when people see someone like Ricky Gervais get up at the Golden Globes
*  Yes, yes
*  We're like Chappelle's like Chappelle's like that to me or Bill Burr's yeah
*  The Chappelle one was so good because if you looked at Rotten Tomatoes right the critics rating of it was something like
*  20% favorable no it was zero
*  It was zero yeah, and then they opened it up to the public, but they only had like five
*  99% you know and it's like we just keep living that out again and again and again
*  And I just wonder like how that resolves itself or maybe it doesn't it does it resolves itself through conversation like this
*  Yeah, that's really what it is with the people are
*  When you have where I come to meet the common man. Yeah, I'm the common man basically
*  I mean when when we talk and people listen to reasonable discussion
*  Then they feel more emboldened to have reasonable discussion of their own maybe perhaps in private
*  Maybe I have to fucking put tin foil over the windows and bolt the door shut and make sure that they can talk on us
*  That's insane. Yeah, it isn't like we're living in the freest society
*  In human history and people are acting like the Stasi is looking over their shoulder yes because it is
*  Stasi yes, yeah, yeah, that's a social media folks
*  No for real look if I wasn't promoting comedy shows and podcasts yeah, like I don't think I'd be on it
*  I would I would definitely be off of it. I mean I'm on it now, but I'm on it like a post it and leave it thing
*  I don't pay attention to the luxury of that. Yes, you know what I mean? Yeah, I don't know
*  I think about like what would it look like if all the journalists at the Washington Post the New York Times and Wall Street Journal
*  We're banned from being on Twitter
*  No for real cuz like what happens right is like it's this circular thing where
*  We all know the landmines right like the things we don't want to touch like the hills
*  We don't want to die on and it's what's scary about the Stasi like atmosphere of it is
*  Like my job is to write opinion columns and commission other people to do that and yet
*  I feel the self censoring even before I've written right where I'm like wait. I don't want to die on that hill
*  I don't want to die on that is that really the battle I want to take on I should probably just stick to this topic instead
*  Of that topic because I know if I do that topic like I know what awaits me
*  Yes, like why am I why would I willingly go to the guillotine? Yes?
*  You know it's like and people pretend like the reputational smears have no cost like they're insane
*  Well, that's what's weird about your position because you're an opinion writer, right?
*  I mean, that's what you do
*  Correct and you're not allowed to give your honest opinion in a lot of people's eyes
*  They want you to be compliant with woke culture
*  and I think one of the reasons that I get in a lot of trouble or I'm
*  Improvocative or whatever the words that go before my name are whenever I mention now
*  Controversial is because I you know, I think more than other people I refuse to follow the rule because what's the point like?
*  We're all gonna be in the ground anyway
*  Like I'm not gonna waste my life following some fake rule determined by random people on the internet
*  No, and like this desire for you to comply
*  I mean this is part of the game that's going on when people don't have control of their own lives
*  they love to control other people's lives and one of the things that happens when you have an opinion that does not follow the
*  You know, whatever the path has been clearly grooved for us to when you you're supposed to have very specific
*  Ideas about these very clearly defined subjects when you deviate from those and people start attacking you
*  There what they're trying to do in many there's a lot of what they're trying to do this
*  It's nuanced
*  But one of the things they're trying to do is they're trying to get you to listen to them so that they have some power
*  They feel powerless in the world and if they can push your button if they can break your glass
*  Then they have some power but they're also trying to
*  Issue a warning. Yeah, right
*  They're issuing a warning to the people in their group saying if you deviate we're gonna do to you what we're doing to her right now
*  Yes, and it's gonna be relentless and you know, and it's just like what's sad about it
*  It's like the number of young people I know who are so talented and you know
*  We're heterodox or just independent minded people like liberals. They
*  choose not to
*  become
*  Public people like they decide not to go into journalism
*  not to do company not to do any number of things because like why would you choose to
*  You know be in that arena if this is what it means
*  You know one of my favorite stories when it went to speak to this is that woman who was in Canada?
*  Who was a trans woman who still has her penis and balls and went to a bunch of different?
*  I don't know about places. You don't know about this
*  No, close down these immigrant waxing places because they wouldn't wax her male genitalia and
*  And
*  Missus it wound up going to court and she wound up losing but these people lost their businesses their businesses get you know
*  Canada's very different than the United States and they have nicer. They're very nice
*  20% nicer, but they also have weird human rights laws like
*  They have you know, this is what Jordan Peterson was rallying against with these compelled speech laws
*  He was explaining in a way that didn't make sense to us because we have freedom of speech in America
*  They don't have freedom of speech in Canada. It's not or in England. Yeah, right. It's different and
*  With this woman when she went to these places and was saying hey, you know
*  You have to wax my my dick and balls and they were like no we do Brazilian wax on women and they're like you're a bigot
*  And then she turned out to be a complete fucking lunatic
*  I mean if you follow her in the news now like assaulting people and all sorts of other stuff
*  but still
*  biologically a man and
*  Has all the parts and they this was this was the line in the sand. This is like, okay
*  Here's your case now. You've got one because this is not just about discrimination against trans woman
*  And this is some new thing. This is the very real possibility that some trans people trans people are human, right?
*  Some trans people are fucking crazy. You got one here here. You got one
*  Now are you gonna treat this like an abusive insane person or you're gonna treat this like trans people?
*  Have these undeniable rights and privilege because of the fact that they've been
*  put in this marginalized position by our society that you have to
*  Look at them in a very specific way and if you deviate at all you will be punished and that's what happened
*  These poor immigrants they lost their business. I completely missed this story. Oh, it's a great story. Jessica. You need I think is
*  Well the Times needs to step up you guys are covering
*  No, we're barely covering those people even I don't
*  Yeah, who do you like for president? Well, I just I was just telling
*  Jamie that I was in I spent New Year's in New Hampshire with Andrew Yang and the Yang gang because I'm writing about him, right?
*  And I have to tell you like I'm really not just saying this the power of the like the what I'm calling like the Rogan effect
*  It was insane
*  Like I went down the line waiting to get into this bar was snowing outside and I just like asked everybody
*  How'd you hear about Andrew Yang like 80% of them was from your podcast. It was really unbelievable
*  I like I like his energy
*  I don't know if I agree with him on like I don't have strong views about
*  Ubi or what he calls the freedom dividend thousand dollars a month. I don't know what I think about that
*  He's like against circumcision. He's like all these views about things
*  Yeah, I don't really know if I agree with him on most of his things against circumcision. You don't agree with that
*  I know really yeah, no, I'm not maybe dicks
*  I'm not like passionate about that. Are you yeah people lose their dicks a lot of kids every year
*  Do you know children die from that? They children die? Yes all the time. It's very common
*  Really? Yes, like multiple children per year lose their penis from an unnecessary
*  Antiquated operation where you cut off their dicks to make it look different
*  Okay, you're cutting skin off of their dick and they wind up getting infected and they lose their dicks
*  It's I mean it doesn't happen all the time, but it happens enough time where you go. This should never happen
*  This is a completely unnecessary operation
*  Robert Baker is this 229 deaths per year from circumcision in the United States Bollinger estimates that apparently
*  Approximately 119 infant boys die from circumcision related each year in the US
*  1.3 percent of all male neonatal deaths from all causes
*  There are several case reports of death in the medical literature
*  Yeah, this it's not simple. You're cutting skin skin is an organ. You're you you have an unnecessary
*  I'm circumcised you have an unnecessary operation that you're doing to an infant and it's decorative
*  And I had a joke about it, and you don't buy any of the studies about how it prevents STDs and no no
*  I don't wash your dick. I
*  Cannot believe we're talking about we should be talking about it
*  Well, why not kids are dying like it's like how many of them have to die before we say this is a
*  ancient
*  ridiculous ritual
*  Doesn't make any sense okay? I've seen the arguments for and against like that
*  It prevents STDs like look you know prevents STDs condoms and abstinence
*  That's what prevents STDs and and in some cases vaccinations
*  This is what prevents STDs this
*  Circumcision is ridiculous doesn't even make any sense okay cannot believe I stumbled into this because I was talking about Andrew Yang
*  We fucked up. I guess I did I didn't know this was like a strongly hell. You're an intactivist is that what they're yes
*  Oh, whatever intactivist. That's a good way. I've never heard that expression, but that's exactly what I am
*  Yeah, don't cut baby dicks. It's real simple when you say it that way people go. Yeah, it sounds gross
*  We say oh circumcision like oh what a wonderful ritual and it's a symbolic of your journey until the fuck out of here
*  Cutting baby dicks. It's it doesn't make any sense. I mean it's not as disgusting as
*  What they do to women's clitorises and in?
*  That makes it possible to like yes
*  It's a different reason for doing it, but it's you're mutilating a kid
*  You're just doing it in a way that it's okay like if you cut a piece of my earlobe off
*  I'm gonna be alright. I don't know I'm from a family of four daughters
*  I have not thought deeply about I I did not know that statistic until you put it up there not good
*  Yeah, most people don't know it and I've talked to people who have had immediate family members who have had horrible illnesses or injuries
*  From circumcision. It's terrible. It's an organ. No, I'm nervous about vaccines. I hope you're for them for vaccines
*  Okay, a hundred percent. Yeah, why would you be nervous? Talk to me about that?
*  I don't know cuz I'm like what am I stumbling into here? Look vaccines are established sign
*  I had dr. Peter Hotez on who is that he's
*  He's out of the University of Texas University Houston is that what he's from
*  But what he's famous for is
*  treating and making people aware of tropical illnesses and okay and and vaccine safety and vaccine health and again and also
*  Just someone who uses education to dispel a lot of these anti-vax
*  rumors and the
*  Anti-vax movement to try to explain like this is why there's so many people. This is why we're so healthy
*  This is why there's no smallpox. This is why we haven't had these fucking horrific diseases
*  Yeah, this is why measles is making a comeback because of ignorance
*  so and because there's this unbelievably strange coalition of like
*  lefty Waldorf
*  family homeschool people with like ultra-orthodox Jews who believes that they're like
*  Remnants of pigs in the vaccine and they're coming together to do what they just did in New Jersey
*  Which is like they were I think New Jersey was close to passing a law to end the religious
*  You know
*  there's religious exemptions for vaccines in a bunch of states still and New Jersey was very close to
*  Which has had a bunch of outbreaks to ending the religious exemption and then you had these like very strange bedfellows
*  Come together and lobby against the law and it lost
*  Which is really upsetting like I do not think there should be a religious exemption for vaccines
*  Yeah, vaccines are a strange one, right? It's like
*  Should you?
*  Force someone to put a chemical into their body. Yes, because it's protecting
*  Yeah, all of our lives, but that is why it's that's why it's an interesting one
*  It's a very unusual one because it's a very rare time
*  Where you're talking about something that if you do put it in someone's body and it is effective
*  It will stop a deadly pandemic from spreading. Yes. So how do we act as a community?
*  How do we act as a culture when it comes to that and then there's also with everything there's people think there's conspiracies with every fucking
*  Thing that ever happens on this earth Conor McGregor just destroyed Donald's roni in 40 seconds
*  There is an entire community of people on right online right now
*  Thinking that that was a setup and that it was a fake fight and that they had planned it all in advance
*  And this is just to make my I mean I'm talking about
*  Volumes of writing I mean people just page after page after page talking about things that don't make sense about the fight
*  Like this is just what people do they look for conspiracies in everything whether it's vaccines or politics or or Jews or Jews
*  Yeah, yeah. Oh presidential candidates though. Yes, or you want to go to everything?
*  It's I don't know. I love Yang's and what I like
*  Cutting off baby. Yes
*  Love his energy like him as a person a lot. He's like he's real, you know
*  He's like most politicians are aliens and he's not and it's so refreshing and yeah, I like him a lot. I also said that
*  Police officers should have a purple belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, which I completely
*  Like I went to look at the policies on his ass like who is this?
*  Super rational he's great. And one of the things that is so like refreshing about him is that
*  Then I don't know if I've been in a room in the past year with so many
*  Former Bernie and for former Trump people which are a lot of his supporters, you know, we're like disaffected
*  disappointed Trump people and then people that supported Bernie in 2016 and
*  There's just I don't know like when you hear him talk
*  The villain of his stump speech is not Donald Trump, even though he hates Donald Trump
*  The villain is Amazon and big pharma and you know automation like the things that are actually
*  Transforming and decimating the country. Yeah, I think it's refreshing but he's like a Paul Revere friend for automation
*  Yeah, he's like hey, this is your fucking jobs are going away. Your jobs are going away. Yeah. Yeah, he's a great guy liked him
*  I don't know. And then I also feel like I've gone on this emotional journey with Biden where at first I'm like
*  Totally like I liked him then I'm like, oh he's old. He's kind of losing it
*  No way he can win and now I feel like I've gone back to maybe like let me put you back on track
*  Cuz he's way too old. It's not just he's too old. He's not coherent. He's falling apart
*  Like hasn't he had a stroke or something? I don't know if he's had a lot of plastic surgery. That's for sure
*  How's he look at his face?
*  Yeah, I'm like younger in the caps and I don't know but but
*  I think the candidate I will be very surprised if the candidate is not Bernie both because of the fundraising and
*  Because of where he is in the polls and because and this is the most fundamental thing
*  the the energy in the country right now is a populist energy and I just don't think that a
*  Moderate like the ones that I like like a clobuchar or a Biden
*  Can capture that the energy of the base? I think it I think that energy is just really with Bernie
*  You have a Democratic Party than I do I think they're gonna fuck up and put Elizabeth Warren in
*  I think I'm just gonna chew her up. Don't you think Trump would okay, but if it's Bernie verse Trump
*  Yes, who wins because I think Trump still wins
*  I think you're always gonna have a hard time when someone's the incumbent, right?
*  you're always gonna have a hard time when someone is the sitting president who is
*  Extremely controversial extremely polarizing, but also we're in a great time economically
*  That's that's hard for people to deviate from it's hard from people to deviate from good
*  Economy when you look at the stock market when you look at
*  Don't have stocks like most people are like working its perception though. It's a perception you look at unemployment
*  Unemployment rates are very low
*  You know
*  there's there's a lot of things that you could point to the standard issues that you point to and
*  Then you deal with all this looniness on the left that Trump is the complete
*  Opposite of if you he's the antithesis middle finger to all of it exactly
*  Yeah, the when I when he got in office
*  I said political correctness just got hit with a missile to the dick
*  That's what it was like when that guy got in office like what the fuck
*  He just want after all that grab the pussy stuff and all that all the craziness
*  Yeah, the fact that he was able to weather that storm and it didn't even seem to shake him
*  I mean like you said you could shoot someone in the middle of Fifth Avenue. I think he actually good
*  Yeah, well as long as the person was a dick the person who shot was a real asshole
*  I get well, you know, we do do we really need that guy? No, we need Trump as president
*  It's gonna be hard. It's gonna be it's always hard to get someone out of office
*  I mean what sunk George HW Bush was Ross Perot and a lot of people forget that Ross Perot this
*  eccentric billionaire got on television and bought an entire half hour of regular prime time television and
*  Put on this display of why you're getting fucked and explain taxes to you and explain
*  So is Mike Bloomberg gonna be the Ross Perot of 2020?
*  No, he's not as charismatic and he's not very well liked and it doesn't make he doesn't make sense
*  I don't think he's wasting his time. I just think he's the opposite of what people want. Yeah, they don't want a billionaire
*  No, no, they don't want that
*  What Bernie stands for is a guy who?
*  You could you could dig up dirt on every single human being that's ever existed if you catch them in their worst moments
*  And you magnify those moments and you cut out everything else and you only display display those worst moments that said
*  You can't find very many with Bernie. He's been insanely consistent his entire life
*  he's basically been saying the same thing been for the same thing his whole life and
*  that in and of itself is a very powerful structure to operate from yeah, and he's addressing the thing that people are
*  Most obsessed with right now, which is economic inequality and he's really consistent on it. Did you see him here? Did you see him?
*  Yeah, of course. He was so normal
*  He's so normal. Did you find him winning though? Like did you like him?
*  I like him a lot a huge division in people
*  I know either they love him or they really really think that he's like rough obnoxious all of that
*  Well, I know you don't like Tulsi, but I love her. I love her. I think she's awesome. I love her
*  I love Bernie and I love Andrew Yang and I talked about Tulsi and Bernie the other day
*  But I forgot to bring up Andrew Yang and I apologize for that. I said everybody else can eat shit
*  I didn't mean Andrew Yang. I really I do like him. I just it was just a mistake
*  What is the Tulsi appeal for you? Well, I think she first of all is
*  someone who's served twice overseas been deployed twice and
*  Understands the actual cost of war worked in you know medical units saw people murdered and shot down and
*  Destroyed by war and she wants none of it. She wants us to have less intervention in
*  Interventionalist foreign policy decisions that affect people's lives and send our young
*  Brothers and sisters over there to get killed. That's one thing. She's a person who served in Congress
*  She understands how it works. She's a very nice friendly person. I believe her when I talked to her
*  She's very genuine, you know, and you know, if you want a woman president, that's that's what you want
*  You want a young woman who has served in Congress who has served overseas has been deployed
*  She makes a lot of sense with a lot of things. She's saying that's what I like about her
*  Got it. Okay, Klobuchar. Ah
*  Zero opinion on her. Okay. Yeah, I like her zero charisma though. Yeah, I haven't been paying attention like
*  There's there's certain look there's only so much time you have in a day and only so many days in your life and
*  Until things start really popping where I have to pay attention to her. I'm just like she
*  But who you can vote for in the primary? I
*  think I
*  Think I'll probably vote for Bernie
*  Interesting. Yeah, cuz I look I think Bernie and Tulsi together would be a fucking devastating combination. I really do
*  I don't know if they'd ever work out together
*  I don't know if that's possible, but I think them together might work that might work that might get enough people to go
*  You know what?
*  This is all just too fucking crazy
*  Let's let's try something different and what do you make of the people that are speculating that Tulsi's gonna run as a third party or?
*  I'm not going okay. I don't think she's going to I don't think she has any plans to do that
*  But that was the worry that you know, she's a Russian Russian asset
*  That was one of things that Hillary Clinton had said that I found that very strange and Hillary Clinton was calling her a Russian asset
*  Like I found it strange that Hillary Clinton said that I do but I you know, I'm not a fan of Hillary Clinton
*  I just I'm not a fan of that whole they're a part of a different world, right?
*  They're a part of a different world where corruption was open and accepted and it was a part of the program
*  You know if you pay attention to the Clinton Foundation
*  You pay attention to the the amount of money that they would get paid to speak to bankers and the fact that they wouldn't release the
*  Transcripts that was the great thing about Bernie during the 2016 election release the transcripts. Let's see those transcripts
*  You know, I watch him. I'm like looking at Larry David
*  It's so strange like I only see Larry David Larry David doesn't fucking amazing job
*  It's like the meld it's very weird
*  Yeah
*  Like I was watching the weekly episode of when the Times endorsed the candidates or the two women and it was like
*  I'm it was very strange. I was like thinking that I'm literally looking at Larry
*  But him as a human being when I was hanging out with him, yeah, I believe in him. I like him
*  I like him a lot
*  Like the like most scandalous thing about him the Daily Mail just like was like Bernie Sanders
*  He requests his junior suites in his hotels to be 65 degrees and he asks his staff to collect
*  Honeypackets like this is like for his tea
*  That's all they got on him yeah, it's no I mean the thing to get on him on is like, you know his
*  Apologetics for Soviet Union for Nicaragua. I mean his foreign policy stuff
*  It's just a disaster and that's what the depth that is what Trump will crush him on
*  I mean Trump wants Bernie to be the candidate you think so. Yes, I think you don't think he wants Warren. I mean
*  Warren would be great too cuz then he has Pocahontas
*  Yeah, but like but I'd love the fact they said that it's racist when he calls her Pocahontas
*  It's racist like it's a fucking Disney movie. Well a lot of people
*  Yeah, but also I mean the moment that I you know gave up on Elizabeth Warren's
*  Political judgment is when she decided to publicly go through
*  The DNA the 23 and me or whatever it was to prove that she was in fact partially Native American
*  It was like just dude back off from she had to she had to know she did not Trump is gonna attack her on it
*  Forever now he's gonna talk her on it forever. No matter what but now at least it's off the table
*  She showed the slightest sliver of
*  Native-american Joe it's not off the table
*  You think that if Elizabeth Warren's not the candidate that's not gonna be what he hits her with every single time for sure
*  Yeah, but it would be more on the table if she had never taken the DNA test. He would be oh for sure
*  Yes, yes, because it would be this this hidden thing like no no, no, he knows he knows I'm lying about my ancestry
*  It's a big thing to lie about because if you look if you lie about being Dutch
*  Okay, it's like, you know, it's kind of a cool ethnicity, but it's not that but you lie about being Native American
*  It's different because like they're one of the most maligned and repressed
*  peoples ever in in recorded history
*  I mean they were wiped off the face of the map and stuck into these little pockets of land that don't have strong natural
*  Resources, I mean I've been I'm on my fifth book in the last three months on Native American
*  Wow, yeah, I became obsessed what got you upset Empire of the Summer Moon
*  Okay, it's a book on the Comanches and it is fucking incredible
*  It's incredible when you realize like that this was going on in this country just 150 years ago
*  And that for hundreds of years the Comanches just dominated the West
*  They dominated the plains and until they invented a gun that could shoot more than one bullet
*  The the white men were fucked the Comanches would just dominate them because they could shoot arrow after arrow and they were just
*  Ferocious people they didn't know artwork. No beadwork. They just they just made teepees like
*  Really? They weren't they didn't have like
*  illustrious like works of art and
*  Beautiful what the Comanches were a war people. Yeah, they they raided they hunted
*  They ate mostly meat all they ate was meat. They barely they didn't farm. They didn't do any farming
*  They just roamed around and killed buffalo and just
*  Dominated the entire Western half of this country for hundreds and hundreds of years because they were the first ones to figure out how to
*  Ride horses. They were the first ones to not just figure out how to ride horses, but to raise horses animal husbandry
*  They they figured out how to accumulate large
*  Stables of horses and ride them better than anybody could
*  Need to read this. It's fucking amazing. It's amazing. It's so good. It's such a good book and
*  Horrific, do you see the woman out there that's on the wall that outside the Native American woman? That's breastfeeding woman a baby
*  Oh my god, I thought you're talking about a real woman a painting
*  There's a no it's a photograph of Cynthia Ann Parker Cynthia Ann Parker was she was abducted by the Comanches when she was nine years old
*  And then became accepted as a part of the tribe and then went on to be the wife of the major chief
*  One of the major Comanche chiefs and then was kidnapped back by the United States when she was 30
*  but she didn't want to be in the United States because her whole lot or kick by
*  Whenever the pioneers whatever the fuck they would call them the Americans. That's her right there. That's the photograph so far
*  How did you get in like what started your interest in this? I read a book by my friend Stephen Rinella
*  Called the American Buffalo and it's the the history of the bison and the United States and the Native Americans
*  That would travel with the bison and all these different tribes that would they basically
*  Coexisted with the bison just moving with the bison as they migrated and hunting the bison and I was just like what a strange
*  thing that these people live in this Stone Age but
*  Fantastic way with all these myths and legends and stories and so much magic in their life
*  And then all that's gone all that's gone and now we just like so when Elizabeth Warren
*  Piece of metal. Yeah, so when Elizabeth Warren lies about being that
*  Yeah, like that's a big deal because they're one of the most
*  mythical cultures one of the most magical cultures in a lot of ways because look they did horrific things to each other
*  There's no doubt about the Comanches were fucking ruthless to each other to other Native American tribes. They they went on war constantly
*  They were raiding each other constantly kidnapping abducting murdering
*  I mean there was this there's no like this idea of Native Americans being like a peaceable. Yeah horse shit 100% horse shit
*  that's not how they lived, but
*  the way they lived was I
*  Don't want to say admirable but
*  fascinating
*  fascinating and powerful and
*  And they had their very strict rules and codes of operating
*  That were very unlike the Western world and they were
*  Invaded they were invaded and dominated and killed off by disease and then ultimately
*  I mean there was they were shooting buffalo just to starve the Indians out
*  I mean, there's a lot of crazy shit that went down
*  So when she comes out and says, you know, oh, I'm I grew up Native American the fuck you did
*  The fuck you did and the more books I read now
*  I'm on black elk speaks
*  Which is my favorite one so far because black elk speaks is an actual man named black elk
*  Who is a Oglala Sioux medicine man a Lakota medicine man who in the 1930s?
*  Told his story. So he was alive when he was there when Custer was murdered. Wow
*  Yeah, he was he was there when the the Sioux were forced into reservations
*  He's telling the whole story of them going from living this nomadic life to being forced in these reservation reservations and starving and alcohol
*  Ism and all the the chaos that came with it
*  So and this one is the this one's the best because it's literally his words so you get a direct translation
*  He's talking to his son. His son is talking to the author and the book was written in the 1930s
*  Do you spend any time on reservations? No, I have and other than Indian casinos doing stand-up. Yeah. Yeah
*  I mean, well, we're working on that right now
*  We're reaching out to a couple different Native American groups to try to find a good representative
*  Representative to come in and talk about what you know, their grandparents and the stories that they had heard. Yeah
*  It's um, it's a crazy subject and it's to me
*  Look pretending you're anything is not good but pretending you're Native American to me is like whoa
*  That's because that's one where everybody it's there's like a spirituality aspect to Native Americans. It's implied
*  Like you say you're Native American people like oh that kind of fucking knows things, you know, you're allowed to have feathers
*  You can have an unironic dreamcatcher on your wall, you know, it's different. It's different
*  It's one thing that like cosplay is yeah, I totally get that. Yeah, totally. Yeah, it's
*  It's it's a weird one, you know
*  And you know, maybe someone lied to her people people get the wrong information all the time from their great-grandparents
*  And you know people they get and also the thing about Cynthia and Parker, right Cynthia and Parker was zero percent
*  Native American, but she was 100 percent Indian. She still was a Native American because she's a
*  Abducted when she was nine and lived their life. She wanted to go back
*  Yeah, I mean that's that like she threw in her lot with them
*  Yes, and that made her them well
*  She didn't like the Western world when she was forced to live in cities and live in towns and she fucking hated it
*  And you get her words
*  You know when when when she's describing the difference like the Comanche world was filled with magic and gods the water was a god
*  The sky was a god everything was there was magic like you would there was rituals
*  They would do to protect themselves in combat and all these things made life
*  Fantastic this the hunting of the buffalo and the nomadic way of life and then all of a sudden to be
*  Locked into these buildings and wearing these clothes and stuck within these rituals that the white men would
*  She didn't want to have any part of that
*  So even though like, you know
*  If someone was Cynthia and Parker's if she had sex with a white man and made a white baby
*  That is not a Native American baby, but it kind of is, you know, I mean in terms of culture
*  She's she was 100 percent all-in Comanche when they eventually abducted her back. Mm-hmm
*  Amazing stuff. So fuck Elizabeth Warren
*  Fuck fuck that crazy
*  Native American talk me again, no disrespect to mrs. Warren. Maybe someone lied to her. Maybe someone lied her
*  Maybe she didn't know she was one two thousandth Native American. I don't know. I also just think I
*  Don't know she's she's an expert and and she's clearly
*  Manipulative no, I was gonna say really smart and has like she knows what she's talking about
*  I just don't think I just don't think that she
*  Sells to the American people in this moment. I just don't I don't see it. Yeah, I really don't well that shit
*  She pulled on Bernie what you saying that he had pulled her aside and in private and said a woman can never be president. Okay
*  Okay, tell me how you saw that moment
*  Well, the CNN moment was very interesting, right?
*  When she walked up to him in this very public way and said I think you just called me a liar on national TV
*  He was like, oh
*  You want to get into this you see the video where someone put the curb your enthusiasm
*  And it's like the intro music to curb it's incredible it's perfect that's funny cuz Tom Steyer standing there like
*  Yeah, I don't think I think it was a ploy. I don't buy it
*  He's been her ally forever. And to me it shows a sign of great disloyalty and great
*  Dishonesty like the way she did it she did it as it's a ploy like
*  Ideally her and him could be allies and she could be but only one person can win, right?
*  But maybe she wins and he's her running mate like some that is a hundred percent possible, right?
*  So if you're all in the DNC together, you should be allies, right? He's a powerful force in the Democratic Party
*  She's a powerful force in the Democratic Party
*  Why you attack each other and why you attack each other with some bullshit story from like many years ago where he said that a
*  Woman is never gonna win. I think what happened I I don't know. This is one thing where I can give them both a generous read
*  I think it's very possible that they had it the kind of conversation that people like you and I have all the time
*  Which is can a woman win?
*  the presidency of the United States and I think Bernie gave an answer that probably let a lot of people give in those conversations, which is
*  Maybe not maybe the American people are too sexist to elect a woman like that's possible
*  Yes
*  She you know and he meant that in an observational way not at any judgment on who she is or the
*  Capability of a woman to be president and she heard it in the negative way of a woman can be president
*  Yes, that is possible. That is possible. I agree that she that this was absolutely a
*  Strategy on her part that backfires. That's why it's gross
*  Not a question, but I also think that you know, I have those conversations every day can a woman be president?
*  Yes, people really misogynistic sure
*  Well, they have these ideas about what a president is and a president is an older male
*  Who is you know, well spoken and educated who understand? Yeah, there's many factors
*  Yeah, like that's why Pete Buttigieg has no chance to short. Yeah, well and and a lot of other there's a lot of other things
*  Also a fucking mayor right now and you would aren't you working?
*  I don't know man and Yang is like are you saying no government like lack of government experience
*  Are you saying no no no no no no he has a job that he's not doing right?
*  He's out there running for president like Andrew Yang is not he's not a mayor somewhere where he's ignoring his constituents
*  He's not ignoring his city South Bend, Indiana. They're freaking out. They're like, what the fuck are you doing man?
*  You're supposed to be the mayor. Well, that's on New Yorkers felt about Bill de Blasio
*  Which is like our feckless mayor is now running for president. I mean that word feckless is one way I never use
*  Oh good, you gotta use it. It's a great word feckless. He is it is it's ridiculous who called someone called
*  Someone a feckless cunt. Who the hell was that? I don't know. God damn it
*  I was I forget who it was someone on the show. Maybe Samantha B called someone a feckless cunt. Oh my god
*  It wasn't a Trump. It was Samantha B. Yeah, I was like Jesus
*  But she was feckless and then cunt I was like
*  She came hard she went hard
*  Came at her hard yeah, I'm not good with language sometimes but the
*  The the Warren thing that was the real problem with it was that it was obviously calculated
*  It didn't it when people are talking if someone said look if he was like a closet misogynist. No, obviously he's not
*  Obviously he's not but I also think that he had a conversation with her where he said that a woman can't win
*  And I don't think that maybe or maybe not. I don't think she's making that up
*  Sure, she could sure she could be making it up. Of course she could I don't think that she is and I think what Bernie
*  Meant was not anything
*  Sexist or misogynist I say sometimes I ask out loud to my friends
*  I don't know if a woman can win for president. Well, Hillary won the popular vote
*  Can win yes, they can win. Yes, the the idea that they can is nonsense
*  But it's also talk right if you and I were just sitting around having a cup of coffee and we're just talking we just talk
*  And then I went and weaponized that against you say this is a statement
*  I'm like that's not what I'm I I don't know what the fuck I'm saying right now
*  I write when I'm talking I don't know what my next word is going to be right?
*  Everyone knows that we all know that when we're talking
*  It's one thing if you're reading a speech or if you have like a very clear doctrine that you like this is my this is
*  My idea of the world. Let me let I've thought this through very carefully. I've written it down and I'd like to share it with you
*  This is my okay
*  Well, then I'm gonna hold you to that and then if you change that opinion
*  I'd like you to tell me why you changed it and tell me why you why you were wrong
*  But that's different should talk if talk like fuck a woman can't win a woman can't win a woman can't win
*  A woman can't win maybe that's what he said, you know, maybe he was upset and then she's like he privately told me a woman
*  Can never be present. He's like that's not what I said and he's all let's not do this now
*  Let's not do this. Oh, you want to do this now?
*  We do you must watch the clip with the curb music. It's so good. It was just oh god. It was amazing
*  Oh is Bernie Jewish. Are you kidding? That sounds like it?
*  Of course Bernie's Jewish. I pay so little attention to people's religion. Oh, but Bernie embodies
*  The Brooklyn Jew. Oh, it certainly does. This is the name Bernie and then Sanders. Bernie Sanders. Yes. He's not religious
*  Do you think going back to your book? Do you think going back to my book? We haven't started on it, but sure
*  We touched it. We touched it a couple times. We touched it a couple times
*  Do you think that that could be an issue?
*  No, I don't I think I think it might be
*  No, I just don't see that being an issue with him
*  I mean, it's not a fundamental part of his identity
*  Unlike Elizabeth Warren's Native American roots. He's not running on it. He you know, he's he says he's a proud Jew, but he's not
*  Religious really at all. I just don't I don't see it. I don't see it. You don't see it being an issue
*  I think he'll maybe use it as a way of I
*  Think one of the things that people are gonna say about Bernie
*  especially from the right is they're gonna attack him on his foreign policy credentials and they're gonna say that he is
*  Not gonna be a good ally of Israel not serious on foreign policy
*  Not hawkish and they'll point to the fact that some of his surrogates are extremely problematic people like Linda Sarsour
*  And I think in that sense Bernie's Jewishness will be important because I think he'll use it to say but I'm Jewish
*  You know like how dare you accuse me of X Y & Z thing, right?
*  But I don't think it's good
*  Like if you're I think you're asking is it disqualifying for people and I don't see it that way at all
*  Yeah, I was saying would it be a factor that some people don't want a Jewish president. I
*  See it being more of a factor with someone like a Mike Bloomberg
*  That's like do you want a Jewish billionaire like that plays into a lot of stereotypes billionaires are a religion into its own to their own
*  But in some ways the way people what I mean by that is like people look at them like a different thing
*  Yeah, like oh, they're Mormons. Oh, they're billionaires. You know what I mean? Totally. It's like a billionaire
*  Like that's a category someone has accumulated at least a thousand million dollars. What the fuck? Yeah, who are those aliens?
*  Like the way you said that yeah, yeah, I don't I don't think it's gonna be a defining factor for Bernie
*  I don't mmm, but I don't know but again, I also think Trump is gonna win. Yeah
*  Let's talk about your book. Okay, unless you want more. No, I so want to talk about my book. I have to be very
*  No worries no worries
*  Does it matter that uh for the will be here? Don't worry. Don't worry. We're good
*  We're good that Bernie Elizabeth Warren stuff was started
*  I believe as a report on CNN the day before they hosted that debate as
*  Just maybe a way to drum up ratings, which it did work. So ratings were higher than like the previous two or three
*  Yeah, but like people love controversy man. People love it. They get excited
*  Look half of this stuff is so goddamn boring and so hard to follow when someone calls you a liar and no
*  I'm not a liar like yes now we got something now. We got something juicy
*  We could sink our teeth into I was also gonna ask you if you saw any of the curb stuff from last night. No
*  It was great, yeah
*  He's wearing a MAGA hat
*  Just to get rid of people so you have to like eat lunch with them and
*  They realized it would work
*  He's genius man. I'd like to get him in here. I love him. I love Larry David
*  I mean, he's the really one of the big reasons why Seinfeld was so successful was such a great show
*  He's uh, he's a special character. You know that guy really does fucking drive a Prius apparently
*  He's probably worth 500 million dollars. Yeah driving a fucking Prius money with Jerry and he has the
*  Yeah, Jerry has got probably
*  200 cars and
*  Larry David drives a fucking Prius. He might have a Tesla now. He might have changed it up
*  I know it was great though Bridget Phetis. He made a little cameo in it. Really? Yeah. Yeah, Bridget was it
*  No shit. Oh, that's awesome. Good for her. Good for her. Yeah, he's special
*  You know that that show is special and it's like Jeff Garland on it and everything
*  It's like it's so perfect all of them together accused of being Weinstein the whole time
*  It's great what do you think about Weinstein using that Walker? Well, get the fuck out of here bitch. You could walk
*  I'm seeing them use that walker like that looks so fake you get extra like lawyer time or something, right?
*  If you're if you're disabled, yeah, if you're disabled in court or something. I don't know
*  Maybe if you're being held. Well, what is it? What what all the sudden happened to him? Did he fall?
*  He needs surgery of some sort but it's new right?
*  It's back hurts. Yeah, but it seems greasy doesn't it seem great. Yeah for sure. That's definitely a move
*  Yeah, someone told him to do it's a greasy move. Yeah, it's like I see what you're doing. Shut the shut the door, please
*  We're just talking about a Harvey Weinstein's Walker, I don't buy it not a fucking second, right?
*  Like oh sympathy. Yeah, we got to talk about that too
*  That yeah
*  Yeah, he didn't help Jewish relations
*  At all. No, it's fucking the Israeli flag painted mosque, you know all that stuff
*  Remind me Israeli flag painting. Yeah, I thought it was Greek the temple. No the temple. Yeah temple. That's right
*  Yeah, you didn't see his temple temples paint the colors of the Israeli flag
*  But those are also the colors of the Greek flag good point, but he's not Greek I
*  Don't know what question was
*  Did he work for the Mossad did he work for the American government like who did you know?
*  Can we just agree that he was murdered?
*  I
*  If you had if you had all your chips on the table, yes, Barry
*  We're gonna do there are too many coincidences to make it plausible that Jeffrey Epstein
*  Like the video we could go down the line. I'm sure you guys are like Jeffrey Epstein
*  It's something that I followed not as closely as you have
*  That I followed it makes me incredibly suspicious of the official story remind me after the show
*  To tell you off the air some crazy shit. Why don't you tell me now?
*  Yeah, can't why cuz I'll tell you after the show and you'll understand
*  Okay, I'm excited. But yeah, the thing is so it's so bizarre and it's like they're hoping that the news cycle somehow another buries it
*  And then just like oh he's gone. He's gone. Let's get to my Iran is a problem. We're going to war
*  It is problem, but yeah, it's almost like we've stopped talking about Jeffrey Epstein, but he's clearly been murdered
*  He clearly was the guy who was in some way shape or form a part of a gigantic
*  Ring where you would get underage girls to these pedophiles or
*  Public figures who were interested in having sex with 16 year old girls. Oh, well, that's the part that's known
*  Yes, that's public right, right? Like we know he was a pedophile. Yeah, we know that
*  there was some kind of pure curing that was happening for
*  famous
*  Wealthy public men. Yes in his circles. We know that Bill Clinton was on his plane
*  I don't know. You probably know that 26 times not a lot of times. There you go. I mean six times. Come on
*  What's the big deal? Come on, we know Trump knew I mean like yeah
*  That's the part we know but the part I want to know is who was he actually working for?
*  Yes, why did he have that home? Yes, how was he so wealthy when there was no
*  Hey
*  That's right. The other painting of Clinton in his house
*  Oh my god wearing a dress but just stop and think about what kind of guy he's like, he's basically saying Clinton's my bitch
*  I'm gonna get a painting of him in a dress and I'm gonna put it in my house
*  Like do you think he made Clinton dress like that at some point in time?
*  Like what did Clinton do that for fun? The thing is is it was like
*  For it I was God keep him alive let him such a sick picture
*  How did they not let I mean, but it was completely no, I mean no one knows who who he really worked for right?
*  No, no one knows no one knows that no
*  Someone must but what I was gonna say is like, you know
*  I've talked to enough people that knew him met him went to parties at his house and said like
*  Everyone knew this about him. It was like a Harvey Weinstein thing
*  You know in the sense of the the young women
*  Yeah, you know, you know in the sense that everyone knew about Bill Cosby that came into contact
*  Yeah, like there were things that were just very agreed to never speak about right? It's like
*  It's just absolutely sick. I was up when the story broke about him
*  Hanging himself. I was obsessed for like a few days, but then I had to move on other course
*  That's how the world is a big place. That's what they're getting beaten in the streets
*  Yeah, but it's also like there actually are things that are more important to me than the story of Jeffrey Epstein
*  Right, and I hope that there's some investigative journalist
*  Digging into the truth of what happened there. I wonder how much there is to dig
*  I mean how much dirt is there that you could actually get a shovel into
*  What are you talking about? We like it. Don't you think there's a time? I'm sure but I think it's the girls who were the victims
*  Yes, and then the men who were shot in their fucking mouths, right except for Prince Andrew
*  Which was like that was everybody should everybody should go to jail just after that. Oh my god, everybody
*  He knows everybody get in jail. Well, the Royals are falling apart man. Yeah, I know Prince Harry's moving on
*  They're like becoming like Instagram influencers. I don't understand this probably more money
*  Things well isn't being a royal basically being an Instagram influencer sure but it's like I don't know
*  This is this is a strategy question of if you really want like progress and all the things that he talked about
*  I could make the argument that yeah, you're part of this crazy ridiculous retrograde institution
*  But you can probably do more good in that role than you can I don't know like living in Canada
*  Well, Canada doesn't want them coming over there apparently
*  They're not gonna let them because apparently if you're a part of a royal family
*  You're not allowed to actually live in Canada. What? Yeah. Yeah, there was some something that they were there
*  Pull up Prince Harry. It might be illegal that for Prince Harry to move to Canada seems
*  Yeah, I think it's the idea is you don't want a monarch moving into this, you know, Canada is a colony of
*  England but they have their independence
*  So the idea would if a royal from England moved into Canada, it's probably some ancient fucking rule
*  But they would be able to set up shop and start running Canada because they have power over the Prime Minister
*  I get it in theory. I just haven't heard of it. Yeah, I mean in like season two of the crown
*  I mean, I gotta like catch up. Yeah, so good. Well
*  It's all weird. Um, how do we get on that? I don't know. Oh, I know cuz Epstein. Yes and Prince Andrew
*  Yeah, that's right. We started with Epstein being really bad for and and and gis gis lane. How do you say lane?
*  Gis lane, nobody knows I don't know how to say anything, but I think it's glane
*  Like her whole thing like that whole photo op at the in-and-out reading that CIA. I mean, yeah people death CIA
*  It's so good. It's crazy. Oh good. It's crazy. And where's she? I don't know. She's a base in Antarctica right now
*  Fishing for penguins, but the whole thing is crazy. It really is. I don't think there are penguins in Antarctica, right?
*  They're in the other pole either way the the whole thing is
*  It's gonna go away and we all kind of know it's gonna go away and that's one of the most disturbing aspects of this case
*  Like that they did murder this guy they did erase the film of his first
*  Suicide attempt. Oh, so we erased it. Sorry, they erased the film of that and then the cameras weren't working on the second one
*  It's like everything and the security guards fell asleep
*  Yeah, like yeah, they were not on duty or something over the problem is right like you can see
*  the world moving on as a kind of or the world the press is a
*  Conspiracy or you can just like the way I see it is
*  There are so many things to cover in the world and the press is been so gutted that we need to decide like yeah
*  Is it more important to cover like Sula money than Jeffrey Epstein? Right? Yeah, it is. Yes, you know, right, right
*  So it's not like I don't see it as malevolent in the way that you do
*  Maybe because I'm inside of it and I just see the way that it functions and like no, I don't see it as malevolent
*  It is inevitable that but yeah, it's not like once Epstein died the world's gonna pause you know
*  Hey, let's have no more news so we can sort this out that doesn't you know, it doesn't work that way
*  I don't think it's malevolent
*  I just think it's just a function of life in general and just the insane amount of
*  Information that we have access to and the same insane news cycle that we're operating under now and everything gets buried
*  including
*  Obvious murder. Yeah. Yeah, have you had like who is the world's leading?
*  Leading Jeffrey Epstein expert
*  My crazy friend, yeah, I don't know I don't know who is I don't well Eric Weinstein is yes
*  Definitely really into this. Yes. He knows a lot and he met him
*  He doesn't he met him and you know, Eric loves cloak and dagger stuff. And so he
*  He told me right away. I was an actor. He was like this guy's full of shit. He doesn't know anything about finance
*  He's like this guy's not some financial wizard has made billions of dollars. He's like it's not that's not who he is
*  Yeah, like he's acting he said when he met him he had a young girl that he was sitting
*  That was sitting on his lap. Oh my and while the girl was sitting on his lap
*  The girl was like 21 years old and he would just kept jiggling his knee like bouncing her up and down
*  So her tits were jiggling while they were talking
*  Yeah, like what imagine imagine having a conversation with a guy
*  Yeah, and he's got a girl sitting he wants to talk about like real stuff
*  And he's got a young girl sitting on his lap and he just keeps
*  Bouncing his knee up and down and her boobs are bouncing around
*  Why did all of these respectable people keep like going to parties at his house even after he'd been arrested for prostitution?
*  Which is really that's a very good question. Like that's really the sickness
*  Yes, right the people that went after he was arrested like how that happened
*  Well, I think because the way Eric describes it Eric thinks that there are people in these look
*  These are enormously high profile people that have very buttoned down
*  Respectable positions in life where you really can't can't get wild, right? But they're also they're also still men
*  All right. So he thinks that there are people that provide
*  Services and I'm definitely paraphrasing how Eric described it to me
*  Yeah, because he'd have like 20 different like coinages
*  But he thinks that there's people that procure these
*  Experiences for people that find it very difficult to get buck wild and so they would do it
*  And this is probably why you had fuck Island right fly them out this crazy Island and it'd be easier to get away with it out there
*  Hey, we're no one's out here. We're in the middle of nowhere
*  Every fucking picture has eyeballs that are cameras and your phone you know, you know, I mean, it's it's a crazy story
*  But of course, that's just practically true, right?
*  Like if you're an Elon Musk or someone at that level like a public figure Eric Schmidt or whatever
*  you're not gonna like what are you gonna do go on like tinder or Raya know you're gonna rely on like a
*  Guy yeah wrangler. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's a second Sasha Baron Cohen says he turned over disturbing
*  Who is America footage to the FBI? Oh, right? That's right
*  I don't exposed a pedophile ring in Vegas. Okay when he was undercover. Yeah, we're gonna go down. I love him, too
*  He's so wonderful, but I don't know. I didn't I missed this. Yeah
*  But wait was it exposed what happened? Well, they just turned it over to the FBI into it at all. Really?
*  They didn't look into it. No, it was a real-world story
*  He's playing a fake billionaire character and asked for something like that
*  Yeah, and someone said they could help him and he turned that video over and nothing happened
*  Well, yeah, I don't know what that is. It could have been that the guy was like, yeah, I can help you
*  I'll help you by calling the fucking cops. Like we don't you don't really know what the guy said
*  I mean unless we can watch the footage they have the footage or it's gone
*  Yeah, who knows but that's what you should have him. Have you had him on? No, I'd love to love him. He's awesome
*  He's awesome. Ali G in the house. You ever see that the UK film the old-school UK film
*  All of it is hilarious. Most people don't know about that film. That film is fucking hilarious. He is
*  Well, throw the Jews down the well, I mean that was
*  Just pivoting just
*  Get away with stuff because he's Jewish you can get away with that
*  Yeah, so do down the well so my country can be free. I mean I was like watching this I'm like wow
*  It's characters bad. They're so good. I didn't love his new show as much whatever it was. This is what's called
*  He played like a funny there was like a Jewish like a self-defense Mossad instructor that was like getting you know, I
*  Was fun. There were some parts that were funny, but it wasn't didn't he interview OJ in the new one
*  Yeah, that's the very very very and was he was not even know
*  He was that same billionaire character and he was trying to get him to I want to stuff
*  It was great was a great way to end it didn't shoot with Regan already get him to admit to it
*  Remember when she got him she was he was gonna write that book like if I did it. Yeah
*  Yeah, remember that yeah, somebody gave me a copy of that and I just found it in my office
*  It's signed by OJ Simpson
*  Well, there he is, that's right, that's right
*  Come on now
*  Yeah, anyway
*  We should probably talk about your book. Let's do it. Yeah, let's do it
*  The way it opens is very so we should tell people that you are really transitioning. Yes. Why not?
*  No, I love it. We should tell you you're from Pittsburgh. Yeah, and
*  You did your bat mitzvah
*  At the temple where the Pittsburgh shooter. Yeah, and so that was
*  Like just tell people sure so I grew up in Squirrel Hill
*  Which is like pretty much down the street from mr. Rogers like it was quite literally mr. Rogers neighborhood
*  He's from there and
*  Was amazing place to grow up. I
*  became about mitzvah in
*  2007 and
*  It happened at tree of life
*  I actually was a member of a different synagogue called Beth Shalom
*  But there had been this fire and so all of the kids who were becoming a bar about mitzvah that year did it a tree of
*  life
*  And you know in the same way that people think about 9-eleven as a date
*  I think about also October 27 2018 because that morning I was in Arizona
*  To give a speech to a group and I looked at my phone around 10 in the morning to like my family
*  WhatsApp chat and my youngest sister had just said there's a shooter tree of life and
*  My thought immediately went to my dad because my dad is kind of what we think of is like a promiscuous Jew
*  Like he goes to different synagogues. He you know pays membership dues at various ones
*  he likes the sermons at one and the you know, the
*  the scotch at another and I
*  Thought that there was a good possibility that he was there
*  Thank God he was not there. But my mom wrote back, you know, we're gonna know people there
*  My dad knew most of the people 11 people were killed. It was the most
*  Lethal anti-semitic attack in all of American history
*  I knew several of the people that were killed
*  And I ended up I was supposed to actually go to Israel the next day on a reporting trip to report on this fascinating
*  Archaeological dig but I ended up putting that trip off doing that story later and just spending the week
*  to see
*  What happened what happens to a community when when something like this goes down because like
*  We read about mass shootings all the time, right so much so that they become kind of an abstraction and I
*  You know, I don't report on this stuff. So I had never borne witness to what unfolds
*  And it was it was a really transformative week and I write this in the book
*  But I feel like in retrospect I had spent my life on a kind of holiday from history
*  both because I was you know, I'm a Jew of the post-war era which is to say
*  The I'm part of the luckiest diaspora in all of Jewish history
*  Like the Jews since the end of World War two in this country have had it better than we've ever had it ever before
*  and all of the kind of
*  Mythology about what America could be the idea that it's a shining city on a hill the idea that it's a new Jerusalem
*  Like I was raised on those ideas and even though
*  antisemitic things happened to me like speaking of Catholic school
*  like I would wait for the school bus to my Jewish day school with my sister and there was this Catholic school bus that would
*  Drive by and they would scream, you know kikes and dirty Jews and wear your horns
*  And I remember in high school people someone telling me to pick up pennies like things happened
*  but it all kind of like didn't register it really rolled off my back because I
*  Saw those as like vestiges from an earlier and uglier time
*  like something that those people should be embarrassed about not something that said anything about me and
*  You know even after Pittsburgh though, I was kind of like
*  You could still delude yourself into thinking like this is a one-off. It shouldn't change
*  you know the fundamental Jewish American assessment of our
*  Experience here and our place of belonging here
*  But then six months later to the to the day there's another white supremacist attack on a synagogue in Poway, California
*  and then we've had you know, I we've had this rash of
*  Violent antisemitic attacks happening in the New York area, which I hope will talk about
*  But you know
*  It's weird because I grew up in a very political family like my mom. My dad's a political conservative
*  My mom's a liberal were obsessed with politics
*  We were always talking about politics and and we're always talking about like Jews, right?
*  Like we're really proudly Jewish family
*  And so it wasn't that I thought antisemitism had died like I was, you know
*  I watched antisemitism as it was sort of resurging in countries like France and England in Western Europe
*  But I sort of looked at all of that with with some level of distance and maybe even a little condescension
*  Like we're sort of inoculated from that disease in America America singular
*  America is sort of separate from the tragedy of so much of Jewish history
*  And I have to say that like it sounds naive, but I was sort of shocked to see it
*  That it's here too, you know and that we haven't escaped from it
*  And I mean that that awakening happened a little bit before Pittsburgh, which is it happened
*  I think it was April 2017 you'll correct me. When was the Charlottesville March?
*  Remember the unite the right March
*  Jamie'll find out
*  But I remember being shocked right when those people were marching and they were shouting blood and soil like Blunden Buden
*  Which is a Nazi slogan and the Jew will not replace us exactly right and the Jew will not replace us and when I heard the Jew
*  Yeah, sorry August 2017 when I heard the Jew like the Jews will not replace us, right?
*  I heard it in like the plain meaning of that phrase like
*  The Jew is not going to take my job. The Jew is not gonna like take my job in the corner office or whatever
*  But in fact, it was like a reflection of this replacement theory ideology
*  Which is that brown people and black people and Muslims and immigrants are coming to replace our white civilization
*  And the the the Jews job is basically to pass as a white person
*  But in fact do the bidding of these people that we deem to be not pure. Where does that come from?
*  That is a
*  deeply deeply ancient
*  anti-semitic
*  Conspiracy theory, right? It's the idea of let's go back to the New Testament
*  Let's go back to to Jesus right what happens in that story?
*  The story there is that the Jews go to Pontius Pilate and say, you know
*  Like this person's unacceptable to us and in the mythology of that story the Jews get
*  What was then the most powerful empire in the world the Roman Empire?
*  To do their bidding and you have this line in the book of Matthew that is so so
*  I mean the the bloodiness of this line cannot be
*  Quantified where he says, you know his blood be on us and on our children which goes
*  You know down through the centuries to justify the killing of of Jews of you know untold numbers of Jews
*  but the idea of the Jew as sort of like the wily manipulator as the Jew as having
*  proximity to power not being in power but being able to sort of be the puppet master pulling the levers of power you
*  See that play out in lots of different iterations through time, right? You see it
*  I'm trying to think about useful examples for your listeners, but but that is sort of the trope, right and
*  It is an ancient one, but it's being utilized in really new ways
*  So it's not literally that the Jew is going to replace us
*  That is that the Jew who the Jew in a way is sort of like the greatest trick
*  The devil has ever played and this is the language of Eric Ward who wrote this amazing essay called skin in the game
*  And he talks he's in he's a black anti-racist activist and he talks about figuring out how
*  Antisemitism is kind of the linchpin of white supremacy because the Jew appears to be white
*  But in fact, he's not white
*  I mean, this is all based on this lie that race is not a social that race is not a construct, right? It's
*  Which it is, but they're saying that the Jew is not white, but he appears to be white
*  But he appears to be white
*  But in fact, he's loyal to these people who are coming to sully America
*  And so when you have someone like congressman Steve King saying we can't replace our civilization with someone else's babies
*  Like what does that mean? What is that idea?
*  It is so deeply anti-american because the idea of America right is the idea that
*  Americaness is not about bloodline
*  Americaness is about a shared set of values and ideas and fealty to those ideas
*  So the idea that someone else's bit what does that mean?
*  You know, it doesn't make any sense because this entire country is based on immigrants
*  Of course and you know as we talked about with the Native Americans, I mean you want to we have replaced our country
*  I mean we've taken over their country. It was theirs first what we're talking about with
*  Antisemitism one of the reasons why it's always been so confusing to me is because it seems to be this
*  there there's a lot of
*  These white supremacists that
*  They they lean in that door. They lean towards
*  Antisemitism first like almost it's almost more acceptable
*  It's almost more like they think they can get away with it. They'll find more support online. It's like if you say
*  Online in a lot of these
*  Forums like if you say hey, we got to get rid of all these black people
*  You're you're gonna there's gonna be so many more red flags
*  then if you say
*  we have to get rid of Jews, mm-hmm like that that doesn't I don't understand that one because I
*  it's
*  when people look different from you if you are an
*  Asian person who is racist against black people or a black person who's racist against white people or if someone's different than you that at least
*  Racism is racism is always disgusting. It's always horrific and ignorant, but at least I can kind of
*  See how you could be tricked into thinking that way I don't understand
*  Antisemitism and I said, it is it is it is not just a normal bigotry, right? It's a conspiracy theory
*  it's a way of understanding and making sense of the world, especially in times of
*  economic and social upheaval the reason that
*  Antisemitism is resurgent right now is because I'm not justifying it
*  but it's because we're in going back to our earlier conversation a time where people are
*  Disoriented they're disaffected. They're confused. They're shortchanged and they're looking for an easy answer. So looking for a scapegoat
*  Yes, but there's no lines that point to Jews. This is what's so confusing to me. It's like
*  There's no there's no there's no clear thing. Do you know what I'm saying? Well, it's
*  You have to wrap your mind around the idea which is a huge huge huge idea
*  That antisemitism is built into the scaffolding of Western civilization
*  Period it's never going away. It's like think about it like an intellectual disease
*  That's built into the foundations of the civilization that we live in and in times where that civilization or that's our given society is
*  healthy
*  Antisemitism along with xenophobia and racism and all kinds of other bigotry are sort of kept in check in when the society becomes
*  Unhealthy and we're living in a deeply unhealthy society in many different ways right now
*  Antisemitism is something that people reach for right?
*  It's like if you want to understand like the Nazi rise to power
*  You kind of can't understand it without looking to the fact that there was you know
*  An incredible economic depression in Germany and there was a scapegoat and if you look it's not to justify it
*  But if you look throughout history, right look at the bubonic plague the bubonic plague came because of rats
*  To the European continent that were brought on ships from Crimea
*  But people did not at the time
*  They looked why who did they blame they blame the Jews?
*  The Jews were dying at a lesser rate than their non-jewish neighbors
*  Probably because of religious rituals that Jews have like washing your hands before you break bread and say a blessing
*  Dunking in the ritual bath before the Sabbath and all of these other things that probably kept them more
*  Protected against the plague than their neighbors, but rather than looking into it and saying oh
*  Maybe they're doing something right and something we should mimic their neighbors said kill the Jews
*  They're literally like throw the Jews down the well and it led to you know massive pogroms
*  Killing Jews for and the claim was that the Jews literally poisoned the drinking water throughout Europe
*  So it's like it's this irrational hatred
*  But it is so so deep because it goes back to the most important myth that Western civilization is built on and that is the Christian
*  story
*  Jewish people are it's it's does that make any sense?
*  Yes, it makes a lot of sense, but the fact that it still continues
*  It doesn't make any sense the reason it's very hard to talk about this is because it's so enormous
*  it's like accepting the fact that
*  It's like you have to accept as a foundational principle that
*  This is baked into the world that we live in and we're never gonna cure it and it's never gonna go completely away
*  The best thing that we can do is build healthy cultures that protect certain
*  Virtues like liberty like freedom of the individual like religious liberty all the things like it's not a coincidence that America has been so good
*  It's because so many of the ideas that protect minorities and religious minorities like Jews
*  Were sort of for all of their fault for all of the founders faults, right?
*  And they had many including owning people but you know, George Washington in his he writes this letter to the first
*  Jewish community of this country in Rhode Island and he says something that was then incredibly radical
*  Which is pathetic that it was but he says, you know Jews in America are not just gonna be tolerated
*  They're gonna possess the same
*  The same
*  Citizenship as everyone else that at the time was a radical departure from history in the Islamic world
*  The Jews had always lived as Demis as second-class citizens and in the Christian world it was worse
*  I mean what people forget right is like right now radical Islam when it comes to the religions is the greatest threat to Jews
*  But for most of its history Islam was much more tolerant of Jews than Christianity was which is something that's kind of like
*  Has gotten lost to history the phrase it's never going to go away
*  Yeah bothers the shit out of me, but I'm being honest with you
*  You don't think that it's possible that we can evolve past where we're at now. Yeah in a utopian idea
*  Yes
*  But I just in the utopia if you scale where human beings used to be a hundred two hundred years from now
*  And you scale it up a hundred two hundred years from now, we're clearly moving
*  I mean, I think one of the reasons why all the social justice were shit is going on right now
*  I think it's good. I think there's good signs
*  The sign is that all these things are moving to stamp out racism to stamp out sexism stamp out misogyny and
*  And homophobia and all those things that we know are a real problem in culture and society
*  It's the over correction the overreaction the virtue signaling that's driving people nuts
*  But the trend is all moving towards an area where any rational
*  Reasonable person thinks this is a good thing. It's a good thing to not be sexist. It's a good thing to not be homophobic
*  It's a good thing to not be racist. It's all moving in that direction. It's just doing so in this chaotic virtue signaling
*  very
*  obviously sort of
*  Manufactured way
*  I hope you're right. I think I am but but the thing that's strange again about this particular pathology is that
*  Some of the most anti-semitic countries in the world are countries with no Jews, right?
*  Like Egypt has less than 20 Jews, you know 20 20. Do you know them? No
*  There's one in Afghanistan Jesus one person get out one. Who are you? Hey Jew in Afghanistan, bro
*  He's there there were two until recently and of course they weren't talking to each other hop on a yak
*  Fucking make your way over the mountain
*  But the point is like Egypt's one of the most anti-semitic countries in the world and there are no Jews there
*  How do you explain that? Yeah, this doesn't make any sense
*  Jews
*  Jewish people are very unusual in that they are a culture a race
*  And a religion a peoplehood a peoplehood a tribe. Yes
*  Like our categories don't fit modernity. Yeah, that's what's so confusing about us. Yes, right like we
*  Presaged all of those categories that you just laid out which is what makes us so hard to categorize
*  The only thing that mirrors it in some in some way is Muslims in some way Muslims
*  They vary wide wildly in terms of how they look in terms of what part of the world they're from
*  But they think of themselves as Muslims and I think of themselves as Christian yes, but it's not as
*  Tribal it's it's a minor
*  I mean, it's not a lot not a lot of difference but enough difference that you could categorize it in a different way
*  But the difference right is you can't be an atheist Christian or an atheist Muslim, right?
*  You can be an atheist Jew. That's where there's a million of them. Oh, my best friend Ari Shafir is an atheist you it's it's a strange
*  group and do you think that because of that because
*  When when people are so loyal to their own people, which is one thing that I actually admire about Jewish people
*  I think it's it's
*  Would be nice if more people were like that that they are
*  Profoundly pro-Jewish. There's not a lot of apathetic Jews towards Judaism or towards the tribe
*  I should say well, there's a reason for that
*  You know when you ask the nor an average American how many Jews they think are in America in the world you get like
*  This enormous number where less than 2% of the population in America and there's something like 13 million of us in the entire world
*  Less than 2% Yes, isn't that the same as transgender people? I don't know
*  My expert on that, you know, but I don't know about I just know about crazy stories in the news
*  Whenever a guy wants to get his balls waxed and has a business closed down because of it
*  But that just that this do you think that that might have something to do with it that this know what people?
*  For whatever reason when they see someone who is in this sort of I mean
*  I don't want to use the word isolated because they're not really Jewish folks in America are not really isolated
*  Unless maybe like a cynics you could say they're very in a very
*  established community in Brooklyn and in other parts of the country, but that maybe people look at this
*  Community this Trump and they think they don't give a fuck about us. They only care about Jewish folks
*  They might think that and that would be an anti-semitic idea
*  you know in the same way like there's this really strange idea that people think that Jews cause anti-semitism
*  right like when the
*  Evil man who walked into the Walmart in El Paso
*  Talked about a Hispanic invasion and then went into that Walmart and killed I think upwards of 20 people no one thought
*  Maybe he's right. Maybe there is a Hispanic invasion. Maybe that was like somehow
*  Justified because he saw them as insular or isolated or looking out for each other
*  Do you know what I mean? Like that would be a crazy idea, right?
*  And yet when it comes to the Jews people are like well, you know, they wear their funny hats
*  Well, you know they seem to you know be looking out for one another
*  I mean like but do you think there were that kind of rationalizations after the tree of life horrific massacre?
*  Do you think that people are saying that like hey, they wear their funny hats
*  They look people just looked at it like this is horrible. This is disgusting in that case
*  Yes, but not in the case of what's been going on in Brooklyn there
*  We keep hearing things like this is the result of communal friction as if you know disputes
*  Overzoning laws cause someone to pick up a machete the size of a broomstick walk into a rabbi's house and hack people up
*  That was the story that I emailed you about. Yeah
*  You see what I'm saying so like the case of tree of life, let's take that that's like a very
*  That's like a clean case in the sense of these are innocent mostly elderly to two of the brothers who I knew who were killed
*  Or mentally disabled, okay, it was the people that show up to services on time, which is a certain kind of person and
*  You have this white supremacist who says all Jews must die he's totally unequivocal about it
*  He and he goes in and he tries to do that
*  so you have just a case of someone who any reasonable person sees as evil which is this neo-nazi and
*  People who any reasonable person see is totally innocent which is you know?
*  Jews in prayer was the guy the shooter killed
*  No, he's he's standing trial. He's standing. Yeah, did and there were and and he actually embodied this thing
*  Sorry, should I stop? No, I just what the question was like do they when they have something like that do they?
*  extensively
*  Interview him and try to figure out what the fuck brought him to that
*  I mean is he schizophrenic is he well a lot of the people like the guy in the Muncie case that we're gonna talk about
*  The machete guy he showed signs of mental illness
*  I think that Robert Bowers in Pittsburgh also did but you know
*  But then so did Dylann Roof the guy that killed however many people he killed at the Black Church Church in
*  Charleston, South Carolina, but he was also a white supremacist. It's like these hateful ideologies
*  Often they draw people that are deranged or young or somehow on the fringes of society
*  The with a guy in Pittsburgh he was deep into this replacement theory ideology
*  The reason that he selected Tree of Life as his synagogue is because Tree of Life the previous weekend had
*  Participated in this program called National Refugee Shabbat or Sabbath. It was celebrating the idea of
*  Welcoming the stranger which is a fundamental Jewish value
*  Do not oppress a stranger because you were strangers in the land of Egypt and he said specifically
*  That you know highest the group that was organizing this National Refugee Shabbat
*  It stands for Hebrew immigrant aid society
*  It started in the 1800s as a way of resettling Eastern European Jews who were fleeing pogroms in Eastern Europe
*  Now works to resettle refugees including Jews all over the world and he specifically selected Tree of Life
*  Because of that because he said the Jews are bringing in the dirty immigrants into this society
*  so he was like kind of the perfect embodiment of
*  White supremacist replacement theory ideas in
*  Brooklyn it's much harder cases because it's much harder for people to talk about
*  Because how do you talk about the fact that in many of these cases and a lot of them have been caught on CCTV
*  You know that it's a young black man
*  Attacking a Hasidic guy walking down the street and who's visibly Jewish
*  it's much harder to talk about when someone is
*  Someone who we talk about as being rightly as being from a group that is himself
*  Victimized a poor black kid in Brooklyn is then going on to victimize another minority group
*  It's just much harder when the attacker is not a white supremacist to talk about it
*  That that is a strange one the Hasidic one is a strange one
*  But in some ways I think it's easier for ignorant people to look at them as the other because the way they clearly distinctly dress
*  They dress so much different
*  It's almost like if you had Amish people move in and they stuck to themselves and they lived in one sort of community
*  I think they would probably experience a similar level of hatred
*  But then you add into it this sort of acceptance of anti-semitism in a lot of communities
*  It's like it's ramped up, but there's this myth that the Jewish communities of Brooklyn are interlopers
*  They've been there for more than a hundred years
*  They've been in Crown Heights and Borough Park than before Caribbean's before lots of other communities the mythology like the interloper mythology
*  Yeah, the interloper the cultural vulture the evil landlord like these are themselves expressions of the anti-semitic idea
*  Yeah, and people don't even realize it
*  Well, I think there's also a genuine jealousy in the accomplishments and achievements of Jewish people
*  You know, I mean if you look at Nobel Prize winners from from Europe in particular
*  I mean how many of them are European Jews? It's fucking stunning
*  You know, it's stunning when you look at the amount of lawyers
*  Just joke around about my Jewish lawyer, you know, I mean it's like a standard thing
*  You think of doctors and how many successful and educated people are Jewish?
*  And that's one of the things you actually touch touch on in in your book you you were talking about I mean, it's
*  how
*  but then why successful Jewish people have become in this country and
*  There's got to be some sort of a resentment for that as well, especially by again
*  We're talking about mentally deranged people people with like severe some of them are mentally deranged
*  But some of them are young some of them are that's what's really difficult impressionable. Yeah. Yeah, it's like
*  The the disease is sort of like unleashed, you know, it's like Dylann Roof was mentally ill, but he chose a black church
*  He didn't choose, you know a white Mormon church, right? It's like the guy in Muncie
*  He was mentally ill by all accounts, but he googled, you know
*  Like why did Hitler hate the Jews and he googled various synagogues? Yeah, I mean the really and you know
*  Do you remember last time I was on here the Covington video? Remember the Covington Catholic kids that had just come out, right?
*  Do you remember in the video there were those two or three black men who were members of this?
*  Sect the black Hebrew Israelites the Hebrew Israelites and everyone kind of laughed them off is like ha ha
*  They're just this obnoxious weird sect. Well, they their ideology, right?
*  The idea that the Jews are not the real Jews that were pretenders to the faith that the Jews are behind the slave trade
*  That the Jews are subhuman vermin. That was the ideology that informed this recent attack in Jersey City
*  I don't know if you followed that one
*  That was the one where it was a couple and they were driving or they they wanted to target police officers and Jews
*  And they targeted officers and Jews. Yes. Yes, they hated pigs and they hated Jews
*  that's what they there were diary entries and Google searches and
*  Think I mean sounds horrible to say but they I went the next day to Jersey City to see
*  To see the aftermath of it and they had targeted specifically this kosher grocery store and they ended up killing I think four people
*  But literally this right above the grocery store to the left
*  It's a grocery store and then a synagogue and above the synagogue is a school where there were like 50 young children and thank God
*  They weren't murdered then they fight comes to light a few
*  Feel like a week ago that they had a bomb in the u-haul that had the range of five football fields that they wanted to deploy
*  I mean and everyone was laughing. Ah, like look at these crazy people that believe this crazy ideology
*  well
*  this crazy ideology is moving people to do very very violent things and
*  There are things that haven't even made the news, you know, like
*  You know if we believe this idea right that the that this what's going on in Brooklyn is the result of communal friction
*  Well, how does that explain my friend's father-in-law who was walking on the Upper East Side wearing a yarmulke on his head and gets
*  The shit kicked out of him. How does that explain my friend Avram who is a progressive Jew wears a rainbow?
*  Yarmulke is on the subway and he has he's had several interactions with this group who scream at him hold one of them held
*  Up a picture of Louis Farrakhan saying you're not a real Jew. You're a faggot all of these horrible things. This is like
*  Creeping in everywhere. I had a friend on the Lower East Side that was visibly Jewish not wearing a black hat wearing a yarmulke
*  But looked like you were me got punched. This was like two years ago by a black Israel
*  He was just a random guy but that's no not all of these are black Israelites
*  what I'm saying is that there's this kind of inchoate hate that's like
*  been unleashed and
*  That's the thing that's most disturbing like if you look at the Anti-Defamation League statistics
*  Only a small percentage of hate crimes committed against Jews something like 15% last year were committed by white supremacists
*  They're among the most violent and the most visible but who's the rest of them?
*  That's actually more alarming to me the fact that it's like coming from all of these different directions
*  And how do you contain it once it's been unleashed?
*  When you think about these social media sites
*  Yeah, gab was one where this guy who shot up the tree of life was a member of and is is this
*  like I'm not a I'm clearly not a proponent of censorship, but
*  Do people do you think they get radicalized in these?
*  When you get to a forum where there's no restrictions whatsoever on
*  language or ideology or behavior
*  You could say whatever you want as long as it's long as you're not saying something
*  You know, I mean gab has rules like you can't do things that are illegal
*  You can't threaten someone you can't put up their address
*  But you could say a lot of really fucked up shit and they're not gonna they're not gonna police you
*  Do you think that these places that do allow free speech that there's a catch-22 to it in some ways?
*  It's great to be able to express yourself freely
*  But in other ways you can get radicalized and they can they can it can lead to a lot of people forming
*  These groups where they support each other in these fucked up ideas. Yeah, I'll say two things
*  One of the reasons that I feel so strongly about keeping the
*  spectrum of acceptable opinions
*  So like as wide as possible is because I think that the narrower it shrinks
*  Like we're talking about normal ideas being closeted
*  Then people go into these underground layers online and they become radicalized right because they're like that
*  You know the elites are in the mainstream media or whoever. They're not telling the truth. They're lying to me
*  So there's this secret world and this secret world has all of these actually bigoted ideas
*  Do you know what I mean? Yes, so do I think that it is a catch-22? Yeah. Yes
*  I mean the whole thing about the world we're living in is that you no longer have to like find a KKK meeting
*  You don't have to find a jihadist preacher. You don't have to find you know, go down the line
*  You just have to find a reddit chat or a 4chan chat or something on gab.com
*  And you find your little online village like it no longer requires a real person or real interaction
*  Right and there's no stakes because there's no shame because you can just be totally anonymous in these forums
*  right, so I just like I I think that social media is
*  Supercharging this in a way that like we can't even grasp and it's very hard for those of us like me and you who want to protect
*  free speech and liberty
*  To think about how to deal with it
*  You're right
*  How do you deal with that like when you have something like the Christchurch shooter who was live streaming this and making?
*  references to you know
*  What what did what I think he referenced the tree of life?
*  I don't remember reference PewDiePie as well like yeah, I mean he was like it's like all in elaborate troll
*  That's what's crazy. It's like he's shitposting and murdering at the same time. Yeah, and
*  What is the I mean there's no in my eyes, there's no clear solution to that
*  I don't want to restrict free speech. I certainly don't want you don't want to cause people
*  But you also don't want someone to be free to yes live stream killing people on a platform, right?
*  But how could you I mean they're they're managing at scale
*  How could you possibly know when someone's live streaming that they're about to go and kill people?
*  Right when the guys never killed anybody before and then all of a sudden
*  He's got this camera on and he walks in the synagogue and he starts shooting no, it's my thought it was a mosque
*  Oh, that's right. It was a mosque with him was two mosques. He killed like 52 people. Yeah, I mean it's all insane what?
*  How do you?
*  How do we manage that? I mean, what what do we do? What do we do in that certain?
*  There's no in my mind. There's no clear answer here. There's not a clear answer, but I think that
*  Look the idea that a private company should be obligated to
*  Stream someone killing someone or let's even go like take it less stakes than that call Jews kikes
*  Why should why should a private company say yes to that? It's degrading what the platform is, right?
*  Yeah, that makes sense. That makes sense. The question is where does that line get drawn?
*  You know, this is this is the real problem
*  I mean, there's people that get kicked off of certain social media sites for just not representing woke culturally for instance
*  Megan Markle knows I don't know. What is her name?
*  Megan Murphy that woman who got kicked off of
*  Twitter because she said a man is never a woman and she got kicked off for life. Totally, but this is what I mean about
*  when
*  reasonable opinions
*  When when the spectrum of what is reasonable becomes so narrow
*  people
*  Radicalize and they go to these bigoted ideas. Yes, and it's an enormous like it's like why do we need a healthy conversation about?
*  immigration and it's like in the the conversation about immigration is I think
*  Very very limited in what people say and you know what they what what is acceptable like it's like open borders or xenophobia
*  Right, you know and there has to be kind of reasonable middle and way to talk about it. Yes, because if not people
*  Self-radicalize that's just I just see that happening again and again and again on so many different topics
*  Yeah, the immigration angle is a perfect example that I mean should be
*  Absolutely possible for hard-working people to make it to America and do better
*  it also should be possible for us to keep gang members and cartel members from crossing the border freely and
*  Shooting people and killing people and selling drugs in our communities and all the things that we're scared of when it comes to the open border
*  policy idea
*  The the thing about the the social media thing in a lot of ways. It's this new experiment, right?
*  There's something that we've never had before like if you like you're saying about a KKK meeting
*  You used to have to go to one, right?
*  And now you don't know you just have to go to Stormfront or wherever, you know
*  Whatever website you can find that supports your ideas and this is
*  This is a new challenge and there's a new challenge that hasn't really been mapped out nor has it been I
*  Don't know if it's been
*  rationally
*  Dissected in terms of like if we do this this could happen if we don't do this this could happen
*  Which is is a or B better. Well, how do we stop a or or B from happening?
*  How do we somehow or another educate and improve how do we reach out to a lot of these people that are going to get
*  radicalized and offer them some sort of a positive community as
*  As a possible alternative because this is what a lot of this stuff is a lot of these people that get radicalized one things
*  It happens is you don't have anyone that cares about you or supports you
*  But you find people that are very strongly believe in an idea
*  They believe in an idea an awful idea so much so that they're willing to kill people for that idea and then you find
*  A bunch of them and then they reinforce each other's beliefs
*  Totally with these positive affirmations and and they're essentially they're signaling to them
*  They're virtue signaling to these horrible people that they also agree with a lot of these ideas
*  And then you go out and you do something you act like the guy in Charlottesville that ran over that girl
*  This these these horrific acts are almost they're encouraged and supported by these tight-knit groups of people
*  That all they're all
*  They're all fucked up and fucked up people find each other and hurt people hurt people right so they find this category of people
*  There's this group of people whether it's online or whether they actually have to go to a KKK meaning
*  But and they find support this is a group that somehow another gets them
*  But what's I think one of the things that's alarming about our politics right now is like things that were just
*  Regarded up until like five years ago as the kind of lunatic fringe have made their way into mainstream politics like Steve
*  Steve Bannon
*  proudly declared himself like and Breitbart as
*  The platform of the alt-right and then Steve Bannon was sitting down the hall from the president of the United States
*  What was the alt-right in the beginning though?
*  See the alt-right became something in the public eye in the beginning. I thought the alt-right was like young
*  Republicans that were a little different, you know
*  No, no, no not now for sure
*  But I mean in the beginning my perceptions of the alt-right in the beginning was like what I thought Milo
*  Yiannopoulos was when he first burst down to the scene sort of like
*  you know a
*  guy who's
*  It's a whole thing that Milo is revealed right is like it was an ironic posture that revealed like if you're joking about
*  You know fags and kikes you're still saying the thing
*  Well, he's gay and he's Jewish and so the idea was that he could get away with these things
*  Provocateur was the word I was looking for that's essentially what he's doing and he's using that to
*  Build social currency right that social currency is
*  Developing this large group of people that follow him and talk to him and he thinks that there's some merit to his idea
*  so he finds some sort of
*  justification for having these
*  Provocative conversations in this stance where he's saying these things and a big proponent of free speech and all these things are happening all the same
*  Time that's what I thought the alt-right was initially what I thought the alt-right was initially was people that wanted a new younger more
*  more
*  Current take on what a Republican is and then it became racist and then it became
*  You know all the things that we think of it now in terms of like public perceptions
*  Yeah came like you know, I was themselves art right now who even says they're all right. I mean, it's almost like such
*  Pejorative like the label has become so toxic
*  but the
*  Don't misunderstand the fading of the label for the power of the movement
*  It's just become kind of more normal Republican now
*  Alt-right ideas have been subsumed by the Trumpist Republican Party to some extent like which ideas I mean
*  Look like
*  The idea that some Americans are less American than others
*  That is certainly an alt-right idea that I think is extremely dangerous
*  I mean you saw it when here's here's a great example when Trump went after the squad
*  Okay as and remember when he said that they should go back to the totally broken crime infested places that they came from ha ha ha
*  Those people were three of them were born in America one is a naturalized US citizen
*  The idea there right as I heard it and maybe I'm hearing something you're not that
*  Some Americans because of their skin color or their ideas sort of have provisional
*  Belonging here for me is a very very it's more than a dog whistle
*  But something that is deeply un-American and deeply bigoted if he had said that about one person who had come here from somewhere else
*  It was awful and was criticizing America
*  Then that would been a more valid statement and that would be like
*  Ilion Omar is not from America initially
*  No, Ilion Omar no, but and I can't stand her ideas
*  But she's a naturalized citizen who was sworn to uphold the values of the Constitution
*  Yes, she's just as American as me or Donald Trump or you no, I agree and I also
*  Agree that this idea like go back to where you were that sucks is
*  The response to someone criticizing the way things are here is pretty ridiculous
*  You don't have to go back to where it sucks you're here and you're a United States citizen
*  You just think that this place should be better. Yes, and you can disagree with their ideas, but that I that
*  Concept right that you're not entirely of a place right?
*  That is something that has been used against Jews forever the idea that you're not fully
*  Iraqi because you're Jewish or you're not fully American because you're Jewish or you're not fully French because you're Jewish
*  Like the idea of provisional belonging is something that is that I'm extremely sensitive to so it's a toxic tribalism
*  That's attached to the concept the alt-right ideas. Well, but then the alt-right ideas like
*  There's I mean look at who Steve Bannon has made common cause with right people like Nigel Farage people like Marine Le Pen
*  I mean there was a really good documentary about Steve Bannon where he's meeting with people who really are not just like
*  Normal conservatives was Marine Le Pen Marine Le Pen. What is her party's name in France? She is a
*  deeply xenophobic
*  politician in France whose father
*  Was profoundly anti-semitic. She claims that he's that she's not
*  But she's someone that you know, you say her name in any Jewish community and she's president of the National Front just that name
*  National Front that sounds like storm front. It's really not
*  Marion and Pirene the French politician lawyer serving as president national rally political party since 2011 with a brief interruption
*  2017 she's been the member of the national doesn't say what she does doesn't say
*  Okay
*  Anyway, so back to her and or Jews or
*  You were I mean just like I
*  Don't know I see
*  Ideas getting expressed like there there are people that Tucker Carlson has had on his show who are like a vowed white
*  Nationalists like who recently can you Google that Jamie? There was a guy that he had on the other day
*  Or even even these whistles right of like there's a way to criticize
*  Did you find it sorry
*  There's a way to criticize no, I lost my train of thought no worries
*  There's
*  There's a certain here goes listen Tucker Carlson's guests who have links to white nationalism
*  But he's he agreed with these people has he argued against their ideas
*  Roger Stone Roger Stones white nationalist no his links to white nationalism
*  No, there was something more recently wasn't the first white nationalist Tucker Carlson as I said, okay that was 2018 anyway
*  It's I don't know
*  I mean are you not alarmed by the turn that you see in the Republican Party towards sort of like I
*  Don't know the Trump is cult
*  Well, I think one thing the Republican Party has done
*  That's wise if you want to keep a solidified team is that they haven't come out against him
*  and they've supported him and there's very little dissent and
*  This is this is a good idea if you want your team to win, right?
*  And there was a lot of people who were kind of never Trumpers who soften their stance once they realize the power of his presidency
*  That he's really there sometimes dominant sometimes Trumpers. Yeah. Yeah, I'm alarmed. I'm alarmed by
*  People I'm alarmed whenever there's not where this outward
*  there's an outward lack of compassion and when there's an outward disdain for the other because
*  Essentially this country is all the other the whole thing. That's all we have is the other
*  I mean, that's that's the whole thing. Well in the whole thing that
*  Yeah, yeah, I mean there's just
*  Trump is just beyond the sort of like he said various things that are like he was speaking to a Jewish group and he talked
*  About your prime minister. I mean he said so many things that are ridiculous
*  But the big big thing that he's guilty of is he is like dismantled the guardrails of
*  the keep society decent and civil and normal and like once you dismantle those things like it's very easy to
*  Reverse not very easy, but you can reverse policies
*  What's much harder to reverse is a culture and he has just been gleefully making war on?
*  What I think of is very very important cultural norms
*  like
*  Like not attacking the weakest people in our culture like not attacking gold star families
*  Like I mean he has attacked he has denigrated like the most heroic and the weakest people at our culture at every possible turn
*  Yeah, the gold star family thing was very disturbing and weird how it just kind of went away
*  I mean it didn't go that was I remember that moment
*  Remember when he people forget this when he said about
*  Judge Alonso curiel who was born in this country that he couldn't give a fair hearing to Trump University because he was born in Mexico
*  I
*  Mean this is an American. Yes, this one was this years ago. It was during the candidacy really was it?
*  Yeah, we just can wow Jesus Christ. Yeah, that was didn't he say something about loyal Jews. You're a Democrat as well
*  Oh, yeah
*  That the Jews Jews are disloyal because they don't vote Republican because look at all the great things he's done for Israel
*  Yeah, that if you're a loyal Jew to Israel, you would vote Republican
*  Yeah, or that the Jews who don't vote for him or disloyal. I mean
*  Yeah, that was you know, that was a high point but I mean just
*  The main like I feel like I haven't given you a satisfying answer about anti-semitism itself
*  I think the way to think about it
*  Do you remember this it's too jarring to read
*  Indiana born federal judge who president Donald Trump once said could not be impartial because he was Mexican
*  Cleared a major obstacle standing in the way of Trump's long promised border wall with Mexico. Right? So I hear that and I'm like, oh
*  That's hmm. Yeah
*  Yeah
*  crazy
*  It's all feeding this idea that like there are some people who are more American than others that are more belonging than others
*  Yes, and I think that idea is despicable right reinforces his tribe, right?
*  And that's one thing that Donald Trump has clearly done is calculate
*  Cultivate rather a tribe, you know, here's a tribe. I mean they have a fucking they have a hat
*  Yeah, right. They have a slogan and it's a weird slogan because it seems so positive
*  Make America great again that seems positive
*  But it's not like if you if you see like people punch you if you have that hat on so crazy
*  We've gotten to a point in society that something that's a positive statement like make America great again
*  Is so polarizing that people will be violent towards you and feel like they need to
*  They feel like they need to let like you're the enemy. Mm-hmm. Well, this is again
*  When it comes to the idea of the tribe, you know, there's there's positive aspects of tribalism, right?
*  It's positive aspects of community. There's positive aspects of people supporting each other
*  And then there's negative aspects the
*  Tribalism that we're experiencing in this country politically is very it's very toxic and we all we're all aware of it and the tribalism that we're
*  Experiencing ideologically is very toxic where there is no nuance and you're not, you know, you're either with us or against us. Yeah, and I
*  Think there's some parallels to anti-semitism. There's some
*  Yeah, yeah
*  No, I was gonna say that like that is a culture the whole culture you just described is one that's deeply unhealthy for
*  Jews or any difference really and
*  Yeah, it's just not a coincidence
*  Percentage of Jewish people also that that that club that tribe rather it's
*  Even though there's millions of Jews. There's hundreds of millions of non-jews
*  Yes, but it's also we're a tribe that anyone like I said you can join us yes, you know
*  It's not a lot of work though. Sure, but
*  Yes, you can you join the Mormons like you declare the faith you put on the undergarments your Mormon
*  But if you join the Muslims, they're allowed to kill you if you leave
*  Yes
*  Apostasy, yeah, but I don't yeah, that's the look I mean it is or it isn't I met this amazing guy last night who
*  We were talking about he grew up in Egypt Hussein Abu Bakr is his name
*  He's really incredible grew up in Egypt and was you know, he was like I was swimming in anti-semitism
*  I just didn't even know it wasn't normal like the mosque I went to the school
*  I went to it was like the Jews were the super villain and
*  The whole message was like become a superhero and go and kill and defeat the Jews and he was like I went to a normal
*  mosque normal school. This is what I was taught and I never met a Jew in my life and
*  He gets arrested during the Arab Spring because he starts learning Hebrew online he's really
*  Curious about who the Jews are and he gets arrested. I think they're suspicious that he's a Zionist spy
*  Anyway, he ends up getting asylum. He lives here in LA. He got arrested for learning Hebrew. Oh, yeah
*  Whoa. Oh, yeah, you think I can like just go visit each I mean no, these are so if you wanted to visit the pyramids
*  You'd be fucked I don't know well, I might specifically be fucked because I have like a public profile as a Jew, right?
*  You don't want to go looking online for my name in some of these forums it's like really scary but um, do you look at it?
*  No, no
*  There are people who look at it for me and tell me what I need to like be aware of
*  And you know like every synagogue every synagogue I speak to it's like people don't realize it
*  I went to a synagogue Friday night in LA like there's armed guards at every synagogue and Jewish function that I go to now
*  it's like going through TSA to go to
*  Like imagine that if most Americans had to do that when they went into church
*  Like we would think that's insane
*  But that is the state of affairs for Jews and Jews that I know hide evidence of their identity everywhere
*  They go
*  I there was a woman who wrote me who was reading my book on the subway in New York and was like
*  I'm nervous to be seen reading a book with this title in public and like hit it
*  But I understand why because it's it's become so regular and everyone else just is
*  Living their normal life and we're like sounding the alarm here because if there's one thing the Jews have gotten really good at it's like
*  We have an instinct for danger
*  Like that is something that we have cultivated over years of being
*  Discriminated against persecuted against nearly wiped off the map in Europe like we
*  Understand and we smell danger sometimes before other people
*  Do you think that anti-semitism is more prominent on the East Coast than the West Coast? I think that's a good question
*  There are just more Jews on the East Coast a lot of Jews out here. There are yeah, there are I
*  Don't know. I don't live out here. So I'm not sure I also think it's different right like there are different kinds of anti-semitism
*  Like the kind that we've talked about that comes on the far right
*  Expresses itself one way and there's also anti-semitism that comes
*  Smuggled into the mainstream through the political left that comes cloaked in language
*  That is very seductive like the language of social justice and progress and if the right claims that the Jews are
*  you know
*  Fake white people the far left claims that the Jews are handmaidens to white supremacy
*  So whiteness plays like a really really key role in the way that anti-semitism functions, right and here let me explain it this way
*  Anti-semitism is a shape-shifting conspiracy theory except that right and that is how under Nazism
*  Jews are the race contaminators how under communism we are the arch-capitalists, right?
*  How under the idea of white supremacy? We are these fake white people, right?
*  We appear to be white people
*  but we're actually doing the bidding of these groups who
*  white supremacists view to be lesser than black people brown people Muslims immigrants and how on the far left the
*  Jews are seen as sort of the great
*  What is the greatest evil right now to the far left whiteness and white privilege and Jews are seen as sort of?
*  Handmaidens to that why because of our success because many of us are of Eastern European descent 85% of
*  American Jews are of Ashkenazi, which is of Eastern European descent. So we pass as white so we have white privilege
*  And so in the intersectional view of the world, right which reverses the caste system that we've been living in until now where you have
*  Someone like John Hamm at the very top and black transgender disabled people at the very bottom
*  Well, the intersectional worldview comes around and reverses that and says no
*  John Hamm and cisgendered white men like Joe Rogan are now at the very bottom and at the very top
*  Are the transgender black disabled person?
*  And so where are the Jews in that new intersectional caste system of the world?
*  We're kind of like right above John Hamm
*  We're right near him because we have we enjoy all of the sort of privileges that he enjoys
*  It's a crazy thing
*  But that's sort of where we are the handmaidens to white privilege or white supremacy is very strange
*  That's a very strange one and the anti is really sentiment. Yes
*  Yeah, no, I understand what you're saying and well I see it with people where they openly express disdain for Jewish people
*  I've seen it from a lot of people that you would call
*  Activists, you know of varying religious
*  Identities you mean left-wing activists. Yes. Yeah. Yeah, it's like I think of it very crudely
*  If racism is the sin that's sort of acceptable on the far-right hating Jews is the sin that's acceptable on the far-left
*  The far left because of support for Israel they believe that Israel is
*  dominating Palestine and that Hezbollah is
*  Misunderstood and then there's there's all these different sentiments that get expressed
*  Openly in these left circles. Mm-hmm. That's right
*  They and they're telling you know, they're basically propagating they're repeating without even realizing it this Soviet propaganda line
*  Which is that Zionism is racism
*  Which is an unbelievable thing to say because the majority of Jews who live in Israel are Jews of North African and Middle Eastern
*  Descent they are non white people. They are Arabs. They are Arab Jews
*  And yet you have the far left basically exporting
*  parochial domestic American racial politics onto a foreign conflict in place that they know absolutely nothing about
*  You know, these people are delusional they think that like
*  All of the conflict in the Middle East would be resolved if only we took care of this one tiny conflict between
*  this tiny group of people
*  And their neighbors were in fact
*  it's like a tiny local conflict in this huge drama of the Middle East of which there are a zillion players and you know
*  The Jews of Israel are only one tiny part of it
*  The the Zionist thing is define the difference between Jewish Jewish and Zionist, okay
*  Zionist is the idea of that the Jews have a right to national self-determination
*  the Jewish
*  Shake you going. Yeah
*  The Jewish longing to return to the land of Israel is something that's like inescapable if you read the Bible, right?
*  Like it's all over there the whole idea of and you can discount it discount God whatever the fact is is that
*  the Jews are a people that were
*  birthed sort of in this land which we now call the land of Israel and
*  They somehow and they were expelled by the Romans around two thousand years ago
*  And then they came back to that land, right?
*  It's it's like they defied the logic of history in doing that because by all rights
*  They were an indigenous group to that land. They were kicked out and expelled and then they went back two thousand years later like it's a crazy
*  Extraordinary story. So leave that to one part
*  Zionism the way that I and the way that I I think is the simplest definition is the belief in the Jewish right to self-determination
*  And it's the Jewish liberation movement and so in the night
*  Let's go back to like pre 1948 which is the year that the state of Israel is established and you have Jews in
*  You know Poland and all of these other places debating like what is the way that we can solve our constant?
*  Like the systemic oppression that we are constantly enduring and there were all of these different responses to that problem
*  One argument was the socialist argument, you know if we or the you know
*  The anti-capitalist argument if the problem is capitalism and if only we defeat capitalism
*  Anti-semitism will go away some argued that total assimilation was the right way to solve it
*  We just need to kind of disappear as Jews
*  That's the only way we'll be fully accepted and another group
*  you know which was not even the most popular group is this idea of we need to be able to determine our own fate and
*  We will never be fully accepted the only way that we can determine our own fate is
*  If is this idea of us having our own state and our own army where we can protect ourselves
*  And that is ultimately the idea that sort of wins out
*  So when you're having a debate about you know when people say today, they're an anti-zionist
*  Yeah, the reason that that is so problematic is they're not making that argument in 1920s Eastern Europe
*  When the state doesn't exist it's one thing to be an anti-zionist in theory, right?
*  It's the same the analogy
*  I like to make is if we're a couple and we want to have a baby and we're debating
*  Should we have the baby? Can we afford the baby? Where are we gonna send the baby to school all this stuff?
*  That's a totally moral argument to make
*  You can't make that argument of should we have the baby after the baby is born. The baby is born. It exists Israel exists
*  It's a place. It's not an idea. It's not an abstraction
*  It is a place that contains the largest Jewish community on planet Earth
*  And so when people say that Israel doesn't have a right to exist, it's like what are you talking about? It exists
*  So what do you want? What so I asked the person that makes the anti-zionist argument?
*  What do you imagine will happen?
*  Like are you do you think that you're advocating for a genocide right away or like you have to have no sense of?
*  Middle-eastern history or politics to make the argument that you can be a minority in that region without
*  Protection we know what that looks like that looks like the story of the azidis
*  It looks like the story of the Kurds the story of the Zoroastrians the story frankly of Christians who are gonna be
*  Completely expelled from the Middle East within the next decade, which is a story no one talks about
*  So the anti-zionist sentiment when people start talking about Zionists what they're essentially talking about is Israel just exists
*  They're anti-israel existing correct and Jeremy Corbyn made this very plain where he actually said the words
*  The BBC has a bias towards believing that Israel has a right to exist. He said that yes
*  Yes
*  So he's on and he's on the left like he's on the he epitomizes the the sort of
*  Anti Zionism which bleeds into anti-semitism of the far left meaning let me put it this way
*  Anti-zionism has become such a plank of like normative political progressivism
*  that if you're an 18 year old and you go onto a college campus and you're like
*  During the you know orientation week you're signing up for like legalizing pot club and better rights for cafeteria workers
*  Oh, and by the way, you know the boycott divestment sanctions movement against Israel
*  Which is an anti-zionist movement. You're not an anti-semite. You don't hate Jews
*  You're just kind of like swimming along with progressive waters because that's how successful this movement has been
*  But if you step back and you're like wait, hold on
*  There's a political movement gaining popularity in the West that was in fact embodied in the person of Jeremy Corbyn and what became of his
*  Labor Party that believes that there's only one state in the world that doesn't have a right to exist
*  Like that's crazy. I can't believe he actually said that he did do it
*  He said a lot of things apparently I'm trying to find he definitely said it
*  He's a ridiculous person. One of my favorite things that he said was I mean, he's what is he like fucking 60
*  He's like my pronouns are he him like shut the fuck up
*  Like I see what you're doing. I know what you're doing
*  Crushed yeah, yeah, I think the thing to like the analogy I make is like America has done horrible things
*  We have you know, the example everyone loves right now is children in cages at the border
*  Yeah, it's a disgusting immoral thing that we're doing but no one goes from that horrible policy to say
*  America shouldn't exist and we should just meld into Canada or Mexico, right?
*  And by the way, they're saying that they're making that argument in a context where they are literally surrounded by neighbors who want to
*  murder as many Jews and Jewish Israelis as possible like
*  It's it's an immoral art it's it's a like it's it's an argument that I really can't wrap my mind around like how people get away with making it
*  Well, it's a strange concept to even say that it doesn't have the right to exist when it does exist, correct
*  But so I could see how you could say
*  What does he say Jeremy Corbyn accused of anti-semitism over shocking 2011 video when she questions
*  Israel's right to exist and says the BBC is biased in favor of the Jewish state
*  Questions are right to exist
*  See I could see how someone could say that there is evidence that some Israeli
*  Israeli soldiers have done horrific things to Palestinian people. Of course they have. Yes, of course they have. Yes
*  I will never deny that and I could see how you could look at the where Palestine is
*  The state of the Palestinian people and saying there has to be a better way for them
*  It has to be a better civilization for them. It has to it has to improve. These are human beings
*  They have it has to be a better
*  just a better
*  Situation. I mean, they're not even recognized as a true
*  State or as a true country by a lot of people I could see that
*  See I believe that
*  Yes, I'm sure you do
*  Yes, I believe that because that's important to distinguish right? Yes
*  I believe that because I'm a human being and I believe that also because I'm a Zionist
*  I don't want the state of Israel and the state of that's supposed to be embodying Jewish ideas to be
*  Occupying in other people like that is a state like that is horrible. What can be done about?
*  Well, here's the problem, right?
*  We saw what happened in the Israeli pullout from the Gaza Strip
*  It pulled out completely all of the settlements from the Gaza Strip. There's not a single Jew left there
*  It's completely eudenrein
*  And yet Hamas is still sending tons of rockets from the Gaza Strip into Israel
*  The occupation there is ended. It's over and that's still going on
*  And so then you have to ask yourself like does the average Palestinian?
*  Like I believe that the average Palestinian I've spent time in the West Bank talking to
*  Palestinians whose lives are
*  Emiserated by the by the Israeli occupation like they just want to live a normal life
*  You know and yet they are being held hostage. I spoke to this
*  Young mother in Gaza who fled and she said to me on the phone. We're being sort of
*  Emiserated twice, you know once was by Israel and now by our own leaders by Hamas
*  Right, these are like kleptocratic authoritarian regimes that hate women that hate gay people
*  I mean, it's horrible like life under these
*  Regimes is absolutely horrible. So the problem is Israel then sees what happens in Gaza and they're like, okay
*  We're in this situation where we want to be a liberal democracy and yet we're you know occupying another people
*  It's an it's a untenable situation if you want to be a liberal democracy to occupy another people
*  The problem is is literally geographically if they pull out of the West Bank
*  They will likely have another situation like they had in Gaza
*  And now all of a sudden not only do you have rockets going to the south of the country in places like stay road from Gaza
*  You have rockets capable of reaching tel aviv and the population centers of israel. So what do you do?
*  What do you do? I don't know. Does anyone know?
*  I do not have a rational course. No
*  Really no, I mean I think I think one of the the places we've arrived to write is like
*  What does palestinian nationalism really seek?
*  western liberals like me
*  want or for years
*  I told myself and I think this was certainly like the view of lots of experts that what palestinian nationalism really wanted was
*  a palestinian state
*  Palestinians just want self-determination like everyone else in the world and I am absolutely on board with that
*  the problem is is that
*  Their leaders and then you look at some of these polls and the numbers are really disturbing and they say no the goal is not
*  Having our own state alongside israel. The goal is
*  Erasing israel. The goal is for israel not to be there
*  Right, and then you look at the evidence of all of these peace offers that were you know
*  Oslo and camp david and we can go on and on and they were all rejected
*  So it's like is the goal your own land and having a place of your own or is the national or have we told ourselves?
*  And I include myself in this a lie about what palestinian nationalism or at least parts of it seek
*  And that's really really upsetting to confront
*  so the hardcore position from people like from hespila is that
*  Israel is stolen from palestinian people. Yes
*  Yeah
*  And so but hespila remembers in southern lebanon. Yeah, right. That's like, you know, but they're all iranian proxies and
*  Hamas. Oh, yeah
*  Hezbollah all these they're all iranian proxies
*  Hezbollah is an iranian proxy. Yeah, and hamas as well, right?
*  And they're all their position is that israel shouldn't exist. Oh, absolutely
*  They do not want any jewish state between the jordan river and the mediterranean sea
*  They believe that any jewish presence in the middle east is
*  Heretical and that's what they believe. That's probably also
*  Accentuated by our support for israel, right? Because the united states is fully in support of israel militarily
*  politically socially
*  Yeah, I mean
*  That's like saying
*  you know
*  I'm trying to think of the right analogy here. I mean they're they're not like these are
*  These are terrorist groups unless you think terror like terrorism is rational
*  I don't think that anything is accentuated by like I think they would think that about israel whether or not the u.s
*  Was supporting israel, right?
*  Yeah
*  When you see a situation like that where there doesn't seem to be a solution. It's
*  Well, the solution is shrinking the conflict as much as possible, right?
*  I do not believe right now you can resolve the conflict because
*  israelis who have lived through
*  Times where it was normal for buses and cafes to just blow up
*  You know the number of people I know who were touched by the second intifada like I was there during times where you know
*  A cafe would just blow up down the street. So like they have been
*  thoroughly
*  Thoroughly disabused of the idea that
*  I think I think that many of them have given up on the idea that there could be peace in the short term
*  So what can you do right now to make things a little bit better? You can improve
*  the economic life for people for palestinians living in the west bank and you can try and shrink the conflict meaning
*  No settlement expansion and I would say pull out of some of these settlements jewish settlements that are like
*  You know far-flung and that the israeli army is sort of protecting for no reason
*  But I think that's the best case scenario for right now for right now there's a there's a book
*  I think it's called um catch 67 by mika goodman that I would recommend to people
*  That's about how to shrink the conflict and that for now being the best case scenario
*  But again, it's like why does you have to ask yourself like why does everyone in the world obsessed about this particular conflict?
*  Yeah, there's a weird obsession with it
*  Why do you think that is?
*  I think it's inescapable that part of it is an obsession with the jews like there are
*  500,000 palestinians living in lebanon most of whom live in refugee camps and by
*  Official lebanese law are barred from being lawyers from being doctors from being accountants. It's a horrible situation
*  Do you think most people in the world know about the situation of the palestinian immiseration in lebanon?
*  They don't even know palestinians are in lebanon or in jordan. They have no idea
*  the reason is because
*  You know, it's like palestinian lives matter when the people that are hurting them are jews
*  They don't seem to matter when the people that are hurting them are other arabs
*  That's one of the things that I wanted to talk to you about
*  It's that this acceptance of anti-semitism almost globally
*  is
*  unique
*  It's not it's a it's a weird racism or a weird
*  discrimination
*  It's weird. It doesn't it doesn't
*  Parallel with any other sort of discrimination
*  right, it's like
*  People aren't sitting around thinking about how you know
*  Left-handed people or koreans are uniquely evil like they're sitting around thinking about that with regard to the jews
*  But there's going to be a certain amount of population a certain percentage of the population no matter what
*  That's going to hold those beliefs and these have been
*  Passed down for thousands of years. Yes, and the challenge is
*  to keep society as
*  like
*  Healthy as possible to keep those forces at bay
*  Really, I mean it's it's really it's unbelievable the extent to which it's it's become accepted like
*  I'll give you an example like there was um
*  And this is the way that anti-zionism presents itself anti-zionism
*  I think is the modern form one of the modern forms of anti-semitism because what else do you call a movement that says that?
*  The jewish state that already exists does not have a right to exist
*  Like
*  That sounds like oh, that's like a cool theory, but it's like it exists they live there
*  They are surrounded by people that want to murder them
*  So what are you suggesting that it just like goes away?
*  Like the effect of it would be nothing less than unbelievable bloodshed and yet lots of people in this world are going around
*  Calling themselves anti-zionists. Do you think?
*  that they've
*  it seems like
*  Almost a sentiment that gets expressed that hasn't been really examined. Yes
*  so it's a
*  Nothing to do with criticism of israel like people should be able israeli government is full of like
*  Lunatics just like our government just like any other normal country, but it's like israel's not treated like a normal country
*  It's treated in a way like this has these superpowers
*  both superpowers to like affect peace in the middle east and superpowers to like
*  Like a super villain. It's both at once
*  People hate a country that doesn't exist and they love a country that doesn't exist. They project
*  Themselves and their ideas of things onto this place and it's just like a normal country
*  That's where it's it's so strange because that's where there really doesn't seem to be a way out of this
*  Because it's an idea that's not that hasn't been fully explored but has been expressed
*  So frivolously almost
*  well, it's just it's like if you
*  think about think about if there was a
*  movement in the world that suggested that
*  You know the japanese weren't a real people and the and japan does not have a right to exist like think about how crazy
*  That sounds right, but that's a normal thing that a lot of people believe
*  A lot of people that you and I know why did you write the book?
*  What was what was your goal like what was when you when you sat down you decided you're going to write this book how
*  To fight anti-semitism. What what were you thinking?
*  Well, first of all, I wrote I was supposed to write another book that i'm still on the hook for I went and begged my
*  Publisher to do this because after pittsburgh. I just kind of couldn't stop seeing it everywhere. I looked
*  um
*  And honestly like yeah, I think if pittsburgh hadn't happened. I wouldn't have written this first
*  but I just became so passionate about it and
*  so passionate about
*  Here's I think maybe the shortest answer for this
*  When we talk about anti-semitism even you and I like we think about jews
*  Like the jews on the streets of brooklyn or in pittsburgh or in that synagogue in california as being the victims of it
*  But the act and they are but the real bigger victim of it is the surrounding society
*  Okay
*  Like when anti-semitism shows itself in a culture, it means that that culture is
*  extremely broken or in some stage of death
*  And the reason that I think it's so important and the reason I ultimately wrote the book is I want people to understand
*  That the fact that anti-semitism is rising in america says nothing about jews. It says everything about america
*  And where we are right now
*  Like we don't want to become a place where anti-semitism is normalized because guess what societies where anti-semitism become normalized
*  Are societies that no longer exist on the face of the earth
*  I'd like how you described in your book as
*  a symptom like
*  That we all have
*  Certain bacteria or we all have certain viruses
*  But our immune system keeps them at bay when those viruses show themselves. It's a
*  It's a sign that the immune system is weak that the body itself is weak. Yes, that's exactly right
*  Couldn't have said it better. That's how I said it. Yeah, I think that's
*  True and the question right is how do we rebuild back our immune system?
*  and one of the reasons that i'm alarmed by
*  I and I completely understand the populist moment, but i'm also scared of it because
*  um populism often does not end well
*  For jews
*  Or for the political center and I think one of the reasons that we need
*  To like how do we rebuild our immune system? Like those are the sort of things that I suggest in the last chapter of the book
*  um, and I think
*  I just I just hope we can do them because i'm
*  Really really alarmed that we're living in an america in 2020
*  where
*  People I know, you know who wear a jewish star like put it inside their shirt when they walk down the street
*  That's crazy
*  Like that's crazy to me. Imagine if that was a crucifix exactly the same fear
*  Yeah, I mean to say nothing by the way of like
*  jews in france that have you know
*  They've been hiding themselves for a very very long time. That's normal there
*  um
*  You know, I a lot of jews I know are taking shooting lessons
*  I just had a guy reach out to me that was like I read your book. I've read your speeches
*  I think you're great, but none of them are going to help you if someone attacks you on the street
*  Let me teach you like krav maga self-defense. So i'm going to do that. Are you really hell? Yeah, of course I am
*  Krav maga is legit. Yeah, i'm definitely doing it
*  Basically take the best aspects of all martial arts and combine them together striking and grappling self-defense techniques
*  I'm gonna do it. You're gonna get a gun. I can't I live in new york. You can get a gun in new york
*  I think it's hard to get it. Really? Yeah, it's not that hard
*  I have to tell you I hate like the few times that i've gone shooting
*  I hate it
*  Yeah, I really do. Just go with me. It stresses me out. Okay, i'll go with you. You might enjoy it more. Okay, i'll do it

*  You got some like of your mma buddies to put on
*  You know to dress like Hasidic jews and walk around brooklyn in the next few months
*  Like they have they have things to do. They can't go out vigilante style and why superheroes it would go away
*  like seriously, it's like
*  They're these guys are being preyed on because because the people attacking them. No, they're not going to fight back
*  Right. I see what you're saying. What if they go with your bunch of guy the guy just like
*  Rex him. Yeah, you know you get enough of those enough viral videos. Maybe the whole thing will die down
*  Um, that is I think that's a simplistic view
*  Yeah, it doesn't usually work that way works that way in comic books maybe yeah
