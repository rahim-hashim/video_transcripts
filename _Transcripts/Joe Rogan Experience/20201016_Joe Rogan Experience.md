# Joe Rogan Experience #1551 - Paul Saladino
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [October 16, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8tJ-R28HX8)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Train by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day.
*  Listen, man, I've been telling everybody that I eat mostly meat and they look at me like
*  I'm going to die.
*  And it's kind of funny.
*  And I've had these conversations with people and they were like, oh, well, if you eat too
*  much, Jamie, can we get more waters?
*  We only have one water out here.
*  I've been telling these people that I eat only meat and they're like, well, if you eat
*  too much meat, it causes colon cancer, it causes this, it causes that.
*  And one of the things that I say, and it's a talking point that I actually stole from
*  you, is that most plants are inedible, but almost all animals are edible.
*  And when you say that to them, they look at you like, oh, shit.
*  Like if you just go out and eat random plants, you'll get sick as fuck.
*  That's real.
*  So when I tell people I eat mostly meat, they look at me like you're doing something really
*  stupid.
*  Rob Lowe started laughing at me.
*  I said, I have an animal-based diet.
*  Some people are plant-based, I'm animal-based.
*  I love that word.
*  Yeah, animal-based.
*  Just steal what they're saying.
*  And make it better.
*  But what you said, what I've heard you say, that's an accurate way of describing it.
*  Most plants are not edible, but almost every animal is edible.
*  And I think that if people spend time in the wilderness, regardless of the latitude, they'll
*  start to appreciate this.
*  And I've mostly spent time in latitudes that are further from the equator than not.
*  But even at the equator, if you go walking around the woods or the forest or the jungle
*  there and you try to eat leaves or stems or bark, you're going to die.
*  Really freaking fast.
*  Well, how about people who collect mushrooms?
*  Like they make mistakes.
*  So easy.
*  I remember there was a story about a guy in a nursing home and he had went out and picked
*  mushrooms for the people in the nursing home and cooked them up and they all died.
*  This is like because he fucked up.
*  Probably he's an older guy, couldn't see or maybe just forgot what's edible or maybe he
*  was just losing his mind.
*  But the point is most of these things you see are not edible.
*  And if you think about it from the perspective of a plant, it makes more sense.
*  We never do that anthropomorphization and we never think about that.
*  But as I was learning about this and thinking about carnivore diets and animal-based diets,
*  I had to learn a lot of stuff myself.
*  I was trained as a physician.
*  I wasn't trained as an anthropologist and I took ecology in college.
*  But when you look at like what we know about the timeline of life on Earth, 500 plus million
*  years of plant and animal coevolution.
*  And there's a lot of people who have speculated this, that essentially plants evolve, animals
*  evolve, animals start eating plants, plants evolve defenses, animals evolve defenses against
*  the defenses.
*  There's a whole series of enzymatic systems in our liver, the phase one and phase two
*  detoxification system.
*  They're called cytochrome P450 and other reactionary systems in our liver that are meant to detoxify
*  things.
*  And a lot of people speculate and I think this is really reasonable that the majority of
*  the reason we have those is so that we could eat plants from time to time so we didn't
*  starve during our evolution.
*  But there's a real interesting interaction here.
*  This is warfare.
*  This is an arms race.
*  That's 400 million years old between plants and animals.
*  And so what was so interesting for me as I got deeper and deeper into this this idea
*  around can humans exist?
*  Should humans exist?
*  Will humans thrive on a completely animal based diet?
*  You start to realize, wait a minute, why are we imagining that plants are benign?
*  They're beautiful.
*  They're fun to look at, but they are rooted in the ground.
*  They can't run away from us.
*  What's their defense?
*  Well, if you're on the desert, a cacti has got a thorn or a rose has a thorn, a spine.
*  But most of them just have plant defense chemicals.
*  And that's not even conjecture.
*  That's just known botanical science that plants make chemicals broadly called phytoalexins
*  that are meant to dissuade animals, insects, fungi from over consuming them.
*  And so my fear is that we've assumed that plants are good for us.
*  And we see everything with these plant compounds through the lens of these are good for us.
*  How can we prove they're good for us?
*  There's a whole different part of the story.
*  What if we think about it from a plant's perspective?
*  What if these plant chemicals are not good for us?
*  And we're misinterpreting the research and I can talk about why I think we are.
*  And maybe the plants are just making these chemicals to say, Hey, if you eat a lot of me,
*  you're not going to feel good.
*  I'm going to affect your thyroid.
*  I'm going to affect your, your androgens, your sex hormones or whatever.
*  I'm going to make you have diarrhea or nausea or I'm going to kill you.
*  And we've just been thinking more plants, more plants, more plants.
*  When it's like, wait a minute, why are we eating plants in the first place?
*  Yeah.
*  Well, here's, here's a question though.
*  Is it good to eat some of them?
*  Because there's this thing and I know you've discussed this as well.
*  The hormetic response, right?
*  Like where your body responds to these effects that these plants are producing.
*  And it actually, the response by your body is good.
*  The same way the response from a sauna is good.
*  It, your body really doesn't belong in 180 degree temperature, but when you put it in
*  180 degree temperature, it develops these heat shock proteins.
*  And it's actually good.
*  It's good for you to do that for short periods of time.
*  Is that possible with plants that lay maybe some, like I know Dr.
*  Rhonda Patrick is really into broccoli sprouts.
*  And I think for that very particular reason.
*  Yeah.
*  So this is really interesting.
*  And if you think about it differently, it starts to make more sense, I believe, or
*  there's a whole different paradigm, whole different lens through which we can view
*  this.
*  So as I was writing my book, I came up with these terms, environmental
*  hormesis and molecular hormesis.
*  I'll grab your book.
*  Molecular hormesis is broadly termed.
*  Xeno hormesis by some people.
*  Xeno is this Latin term that means alien or foreign.
*  So when you think about these, a lot of in common parlance, people lump together
*  exercise, ketosis, sunlight, sauna with plant compounds.
*  But I think that's, that's not accurate.
*  I don't think we should be doing that.
*  I think we have environmental hormesis and molecular hormesis and they're
*  different things.
*  So I won't debate the plants can be beneficial as medicine, but to use them as
*  food presupposes that molecular hormesis is good for us.
*  And I'll tell you why I don't think it is.
*  So when you go in the sauna or when you are in ketosis or when you're in the sun
*  or when you exercise, you do generate reactive oxygen species, superoxide
*  radicals, and they activate a system in your body called the NRF two system.
*  I can pull up a picture of it in a second.
*  And that turns on genes that are involved in the antioxidant response to
*  manage these free radicals.
*  Life is this elegant dance of electron movement and protons to and other
*  functional groups in chemistry.
*  But the movement of electrons is oxidation and reduction with the loss of
*  electrons being oxidation, the gain of electrons being reduction.
*  And so when we think about oxidative stress, we're talking about molecules,
*  pulling electrons from other molecules, creating free radicals, which is broadly
*  means that there are unpaired electrons.
*  Now these are very reactive molecules that can then create things like lipid
*  peroxides or, you know, free radicals within proteins, which change the
*  confirmation of the protein.
*  And we know these can be damaging for humans.
*  One of the reasons that cigarette smoking is bad for us because it creates a ton
*  of free radicals, lots of oxidative stress, but a little bit of oxidative stress or
*  just the right amount, the Goldilocks amount is necessary for life.
*  We don't want to get rid of all of the oxidative radicals in our body.
*  They're critical signaling molecules at the level of the mitochondria.
*  So this whole movement toward antioxidants and more antioxidant, you
*  know, chemicals is eventually if we snuff out all of the oxidative radicals or all
*  the reactive oxygen species in the human body, we'll be dead.
*  We need these for signaling.
*  So a little bit of oxidative stress is good.
*  Too much stressful creates problems.
*  Not enough stressful creates problems.
*  It's definitely a Goldilocks thing.
*  So when you are in the sauna or you are in the sunlight or you exercise, you will
*  create oxidative stress that oxidative stress turns on NRF to this is essentially
*  a transcription factor that translate locates to the nucleus turns on genes
*  involved in the antioxidant response, things like glutathione, peroxidase,
*  thio redoxin, things like this.
*  They manage those free radicals.
*  And that's just, it's kind of clean, right?
*  You have an input to the system.
*  It turns on a gene.
*  Molecular hormesis is a little different.
*  It's like going to the pharmacy and taking a medicine.
*  But what we never get with plants is the package insert quote unquote, that comes
*  with medications in the pharmacy.
*  If you go to the pharmacy and you get a drug, like synapromatoprolol, a statin
*  drug, even if you get ibuprofen or naproxen, a leave at the pharmacy on the bottle,
*  there's a list of all the side effects.
*  When we use exogenous molecules for humans, we know that they don't really play
*  well with our biochemistry.
*  They're going to do one thing, which may be an intended effect, but then they're
*  going to have other effects elsewhere, which could be damaging.
*  And invariably we see this with medications we take.
*  We know that beta blockers can affect glucose tolerance and they can affect
*  sympathetic signaling in the human body with the nervous system.
*  And we know that lysinepril and drugs like this, which affect the kidneys can have
*  problems with electrolyte balance or other things.
*  They can affect the lungs because they're affecting the way that angiotensin
*  converting enzyme works in the lung.
*  They have side effects.
*  And so my concern is that we're conflating the two and we're forgetting about the
*  side effects that are associated with molecular hormesis.
*  I think that there certainly are studies with molecules like sulforaphane, which is
*  this isothiocyanate compound from broccoli that show that it also triggers
*  NRF2. It triggers this antioxidant response system.
*  But what we aren't told about much is the other side effects of sulforaphane, the
*  so-called package insert that sulforaphane has.
*  And when you look at that, there's a large amount of evidence that this whole class
*  of molecules, isothiocyanates actually have many negative effects on the body.
*  And when you think about it from a plant's perspective, sulforaphane is pretty
*  clearly a toxin. It's a booby trap.
*  So one of the things I like to ask people is how much sulforaphane is in broccoli
*  seeds. And the answer is zero until you chew them.
*  There's no sulforaphane in broccoli or kale or kohlrabi or any of these brassica
*  vegetables till you chew them. And Ron has talked about this.
*  How does that work?
*  There's a precursor molecule called glucoraphanin, which is a glucosinolate.
*  And it's like a booby trap. It's like superglue. You get two things combining.
*  So you get glucoraphanin is the precursor molecule.
*  There's an enzyme called myrosinase in a separate compartment of the cell.
*  When you chew the cell and you break the cell wall, they combine and then out
*  comes sulforaphane. So it's a booby trap.
*  It's like, if you're going to eat me, I'm going to make this molecule.
*  It's going to affect you. It's going to be a pro-oxidant, right?
*  Because if you look at the chemistry of sulforaphane, it actually is a pro-oxidant,
*  meaning it's pulling electrons from other molecules.
*  It's not actually coming into our body and acting as an antioxidant.
*  It's turning on our antioxidant defense system,
*  but it's also doing other negative things in the human body.
*  In the case of isothiocyanates, it's actually been shown to damage DNA,
*  which is a process called clastogenesis,
*  and it inhibits iodine absorption at the level of the thyroid.
*  This is also furifane?
*  Also furifane. Yeah.
*  And there are other molecules like this that are also found in these types of
*  foods, the brassica family of foods, things like goitrin or allyl isothiocyanate.
*  They're all isothiocyanates.
*  So they're widely known to affect iodine chemistry at the level of the thyroid.
*  Have you ever seen people with the big necks in Africa, like the goiters,
*  there's an endemic goiter, get this huge neck.
*  That's hypothyroidism because they're consuming lots of foods that have
*  goitrogenic, that are goitrogenic foods, lots of foods that have similarly
*  isothiocyanate compounds that are inhibiting the absorption or at least the,
*  the utilization of iodine at the level of the thyroid. So there,
*  it's working against the thyroid. So the intent of plants is very clear here.
*  It's saying if you eat too much of me,
*  I'm going to affect your thyroid negatively and that's going to affect every
*  other hormonal system in your body. So yes,
*  so furifane can be beneficial because it turns on our antioxidant response system,
*  but it also has many side effects which are ignored.
*  And we see this pattern over and over and over,
*  and this is what was fascinating.
*  We see this pattern over and over and over with plant molecules.
*  And then if you look at these two, people might say, well,
*  is the risk worth the benefit? And I would argue it's not,
*  or I would argue the benefit is not worth the risk because you can get your NRF
*  two system turned on without those molecules because you can do environmental
*  hormesis. You can go in the sauna, you can exercise, you can fast,
*  you can be in ketosis. There's really good studies.
*  In cold water swimmers in Berlin and their show,
*  they show that cold water exposure.
*  So they go and they swim in cold water for like an hour and they'll show that
*  their glutathione level goes down, meaning that they,
*  their oxidized level of glutathione goes up.
*  The reduced level of glutathione goes down.
*  They're using their endogenous antioxidant molecule. One of them,
*  which is glutathione to mitigate these newly produced oxidative radicals,
*  these free radicals in the human body produced by cold water swimming.
*  And then the next day they'll see their glutathione is a little bit above
*  normal. That's hormesis. That's environmental hormesis. So my argument is,
*  can we really say that plant molecules give us a net benefit?
*  I don't think we can.
*  There's lots of interesting studies here that would argue that we don't really
*  get a net benefit from plant molecules. It's kind of a redundant effect.
*  We can get this NRF two system,
*  this antioxidant response system turned on without them.
*  And then we're getting all of the downstream negative side effects of these
*  plant molecules.
*  Have there been any independent studies that show people taking like broccoli
*  sprouts and then doing it for a prolonged period of time,
*  measuring their system and then doing environmental hormesis and seeing if they
*  measure up.
*  Well, there's actually studies that show they have two groups of people and I
*  can pull these up if you want.
*  There's studies that compare people that essentially know vegetables or low
*  fruits and vegetables to high fruits and vegetables.
*  And then we'll compare them at four, eight or 12 weeks. And at the end,
*  they see no differences in the oxidative stress markers,
*  the inflammatory markers, markers of DNA damage.
*  So it's pretty shaky ground to say that invariably all the studies with fruits
*  and vegetables show that they provide this benefit in the short term.
*  So for a fame can create more antioxidant response.
*  You can get more glutathione, but if you take it out a little bit of time,
*  it doesn't look like there's any difference between people who are eating
*  things like broccoli or Jerusalem artichokes or carrots or cabbage or any of
*  these other vegetables compared to a group that eats none of them.
*  So there's these fruit and vegetable intervention studies,
*  which don't show any differences between these people.
*  That's bananas.
*  So all the people that are thinking that they're doing a good thing for their
*  system by taking these vegetables and fruits that have this,
*  your body has this hermetic response where you can have the exact same response
*  from cold plunge, from sauna, from exercise.
*  You're turning on the exact same system in your body.
*  But what about the vitamins that you're getting from plants? I mean,
*  there are, there are,
*  there are essential nutrients and phytonutrients that you get from plants.
*  What about those?
*  So this is really interesting when you look into it, there are really,
*  this is going to sound extreme when I say it, but I'll back it up.
*  There are no nutrients and plants that you cannot get from animal foods in
*  essentially equivalent or more bio equivalent forms.
*  How come when like cats eat an animal,
*  they go for the guts first and they'll actually eat the grass that's in the
*  guts of the cow. I don't know. Guts of a ruminant.
*  I don't know why they would do that. I guess it's fermented. I don't know.
*  Because if you look at the nutrients in, um, in animal foods, right,
*  there are many nutrients in animal foods that do not occur in plants.
*  And we know this B12, but the list is much bigger.
*  Vitamin K2, choline, carnicing, carnitine, answering,
*  taurine. The list is extremely long,
*  but you can't say the same thing about plants.
*  There are no nutrients that occur in plants that you can't get from animal
*  foods.
*  None vitamin C.
*  You can definitely get vitamin C from animal foods.
*  And you get it from, what do you get from liver, heart, muscle.
*  It all has vitamin C. So in the 1930s,
*  from 1935 to 1942 or 43,
*  they did a series of studies. I think it was in Sheffield, England.
*  I've got the study I can show you.
*  And they had conscientious objectors to the war and they had them take different
*  amounts of vitamin C to see how long it would take to get scurvy and doses as
*  low as 10 milligrams of vitamin C per day could prevent scurvy.
*  They experimented with conscientious objectives. Wow.
*  That's kind of creepy.
*  10 milligrams a day.
*  There it is.
*  Yeah.
*  My experience carried out in Sheffield on conscientious objectors to military
*  service.
*  Wow.
*  Go down to the next page, Jamie.
*  That's kind of creepy.
*  You'll see the doses, but yeah, there was, um,
*  10 milligrams of vitamin C will, will prevent scurvy.
*  Right. But obviously that's not an optimum level for health.
*  Well, we don't know.
*  No.
*  Yeah. Because if you look at the, um,
*  if you look at the, the amount of vitamin C, the, they say,
*  they say there that between the 70 milligram group and the 10 milligram group,
*  there was no difference in clinical outcomes.
*  The prevailing thinking is a 10 milligrams is not enough for optimal health,
*  but we don't actually know there are roles of vitamin C beyond the formation of
*  collagen, which is the main thing that gets broken when we see scurvy,
*  or at least that's the physical manifestations.
*  You get bleeding gums, your teeth fall out.
*  This is all collagenous tissue.
*  The connective tissue in the human body starts to break down because you can't
*  hydroxylate proline residues on the collagen molecule.
*  But when you look at it beyond that, there's actually some pretty good studies.
*  I'll see if I can find one.
*  Definitely got one in here.
*  Um, that shows that if you look at people eating,
*  they did another experiment with excess fruits and vegetables,
*  and they had one group that had small amounts of fruits and vegetables.
*  And now we're going to skip up to 70 milligrams.
*  So it's a little bit more than 10.
*  There's no experiments with like long-term 10 milligrams of vitamin C per day,
*  but there's an experiment that compares 70 milligrams of vitamin C per day from
*  low fruits and vegetables to 270 milligrams of fruits and vegetable,
*  270 milligrams of vitamin C from fruits and vegetables.
*  And there were no clinical differences in those outcomes in those people.
*  So one group has low fruits and vegetables.
*  One group has high fruits and vegetables.
*  And how long is the study?
*  I think it was eight weeks. I'll pull it up.
*  Is that long enough to see a detrimental effect or a positive net benefit?
*  Well, I think that if you're thinking about things in terms of oxidative stress,
*  that happens pretty quickly. You would definitely, I think,
*  begin to see increased DNA damage.
*  We measure it with this marker called eight hydroxy, two D oxy guanosine,
*  lipid peroxides, inflammation. I think you would see it.
*  You start to see it pretty quickly when you get lower levels of vitamin C,
*  the higher vitamin C group with more fruits and vegetables certainly had a
*  higher level of vitamin C in their blood,
*  but they didn't have any differences in terms of those markers.
*  So this one is what about the benefits of vitamin C in fighting off,
*  uh, colds and infections? Right. The, um,
*  so the interventional studies with that have generally failed.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  But the consensus wisdom is that like if you have a virus, right,
*  take vitamin C, take vitamin C. Yeah, I'll show you this one.
*  So if you go to the vitamin C folder, Jamie,
*  and then you go to the vitamin C from an evolutionary perspective study,
*  you'll see a list of all the interventional studies with vitamin C
*  scroll down to the
*  table two.
*  So one more table down that one.
*  So you'll see these are interventional studies with vitamin C and, um,
*  there's an RCT there for, um, the common cold.
*  It's a meta analysis actually, which, uh, 11,306 participants.
*  And there was no effect on the incidence of the common cold.
*  So this gets into the interesting conversation about epidemiology.
*  And I know, you know about this,
*  the way that epidemiology is so misleading for us.
*  And if you look at the association of vitamin C in the blood,
*  there's an association with better outcomes.
*  But when we do interventional studies, we don't see it. And with,
*  in this table, you can see no effect on mortality,
*  no effect on the incidence of the common cold,
*  no effect on cardiovascular events and essentially no decrease in systolic
*  blood pressure with intervention.
*  No effect, no incidences,
*  no effect on the incidences of the common cold.
*  But what about once someone has a cold?
*  That was like when emergency and all these different vitamin C supplements,
*  this is what they're always claiming is that taking it while you have the cold
*  is what's going to reduce the duration of the disease.
*  Concluded that vitamin C supplementation has no effect on the incidence of the
*  common cold. However,
*  a modest reduction of symptoms was consistently found in reviewed studies.
*  Yeah. So maybe.
*  So good while you have it.
*  Maybe while you have it.
*  So if you have something then jack up the dose.
*  Yeah.
*  Vitamin C is a complex one because there are many things which can lower vitamin
*  C as well.
*  So metabolic dysfunction decreases levels of vitamin C in our body.
*  So the playing field is not always level, right?
*  Okay. So if you have a cold,
*  your vitamin C level is going to be lower.
*  Could be lower. Right.
*  Or if you have a baseline of unhealth,
*  something that's been super relevant with the current COVID conversation.
*  If you have a baseline of ill health or baseline of metabolic disease,
*  baseline of metabolic dysfunction,
*  sometimes synonymous with insulin resistance per a given vitamin C intake,
*  there's lower levels of vitamin C in the body.
*  So if you look at animal foods, like if you eat nose to tail,
*  if you're eating a couple ounces of liver per day and some meat per day and
*  other organs, you can get pretty close to 70 milligrams of vitamin C a day,
*  which is basically the RDA.
*  I think the RDA might be 70 or 90 milligrams of vitamin C.
*  This expression nose to tail. A lot of people don't know what we're talking
*  about is organ meats. Yeah. Yeah.
*  As eating organ meats. Cause most people,
*  when they think of eating animal products,
*  they think of just eating tissue, muscle tissue.
*  And you know, it's so funny.
*  I recently was hanging out with Steve Ronella and he was telling me
*  historically the trappers like these fur trappers, maybe in the 1800s,
*  at some point along the way,
*  we'd lost this ancestral knowledge that eating organs is so important
*  and that all indigenous cultures do it.
*  And they savor the organs really above all other things.
*  And they distribute them among the tribe and these trappers went out and they
*  started to just not, they get tired to get sick from just eating the muscle meat.
*  And they had to start incorporating organs in their diet.
*  It was a historical reference. I'm not sure where he read it, but yeah,
*  if you look at the way that indigenous cultures do this and you look at the way
*  that other animals do this as well, they don't waste anything.
*  Particularly we've talked about it many times, the podcast wolves,
*  the alpha wolf will eat the liver and the other wolves have to stand by.
*  And there's a crazy documentary about a guy who lived with wolves.
*  And one of the ways he tricked these wolves and thinking that he was the alpha
*  was he would have an animal and he would put a liver in the animal.
*  So they would bring a carcass and he would be growling at them while he ate the
*  liver. And they were like, wow, I guess this guy's the fucking boss.
*  He's eating the liver.
*  If you eat liver, you get to be an alpha male or an alpha female.
*  Well, it was, it was weird that he knew.
*  And that this is just the wolves know in their pack mentality that the
*  alpha is the one that gets the most nutritious piece of the animal.
*  And there are even organs beyond the liver that are uniquely nutritious.
*  The heart is prized. I mean, the spleen, the pancreas,
*  these are things we don't eat much as Westernized humans,
*  but kidneys are prized. I mean,
*  so there was this really interesting Arctic explorer, Villamar Steffensen.
*  Have you heard of his adventures in early 1900s? Yeah.
*  So he wrote the fat of the land, not by bread alone. And he, he had quotes.
*  I think I have a quote from him here in the, let's see,
*  I think it's in the anthropology. So he would say that the,
*  actually it's in the Nose to Tail folder, Jamie, if you're looking for that,
*  there's a screenshot there. So he would say that,
*  while meat of any kind is in great demand,
*  it is interesting to note the following are the favorite cuts,
*  the brisket of the beef with the fat and the cartilages.
*  So these indigenous cultures in the, in the Arctic would,
*  they would favor things with fat and connective tissue,
*  the skin and subcutaneous fat of the warthog, pigskin,
*  hogs head and brains. And number four is the liver of any animal.
*  Look at that pigskin is never saved for rawhide and leather.
*  It's too valuable as food and is eaten after singeing off the hair and a
*  prolonged boiling. Plump cow skin is similarly eaten.
*  A lean cow skin will be saved for rawhide and leather.
*  The hogs head brains and fat are both delicacies.
*  The liver of any animal,
*  the hands and feet of monkey because of the fat content.
*  Whoa.
*  So they tend to favor the fat and the organs.
*  Bro, they're eating monkey hands. Should we really listen to them?
*  I never had monkey. You ever had brain?
*  I've had calves brain. What'd you think? When I was a child, I don't remember.
*  It was a long time ago, but my uncle Vinny used to, uh, they used to,
*  I guess it was calves brain or lambs brain. I don't remember,
*  but I remember they would grill it. And, uh,
*  I found it so strange that we're eating it.
*  I wish I could remember if I liked it or not, but I also like,
*  I was probably six, you know,
*  and I don't know if I had a sensibility towards different,
*  you know, interesting, like I enjoy liver now. I actually like it.
*  I enjoy heart. I eat it. I like some things that other people,
*  I like sea urchin.
*  I like things that people might find weird because of the texture alone.
*  So I don't know if I felt that way when I was little.
*  Liver is amazing.
*  I know you had the guys from Black Rifle on and they were saying that when they
*  were taking the desiccated organ supplements, they had a rush of energy.
*  But I kind of have this thing that I like to do with people where I have them eat
*  raw liver. And it's really cool to see how it turns their brain on.
*  The baseline nutrition depends, you know,
*  we'll determine how much of a buzz they get, but of course,
*  there's always food contamination issues.
*  With bile, like we slice the liver and squirt the bile on it.
*  I haven't, I'm hopefully going to hunt this year and I want to do that with the
*  gallbladder.
*  But I think that it's so interesting to see that they would savor the things that
*  were salty. There was a little bit of salt in the gallbladder. And yeah,
*  I've heard of indigenous cultures using the gallbladder as a condiment.
*  I think Ronella did that on one of his shows where he cut raw liver and ate it
*  with the gallbladder. That's got to be a strong flavor.
*  I'll report back. I've eaten a lot of the animal, but I've never eaten the gall,
*  the gall fluid. So I've never eaten the, you know, the bile.
*  The Comanche used to love to do that with buffalo liver.
*  They would take the buffalo liver raw and warm right from the fresh kill and
*  squirt gallbladder on it. I mean, it can't be that,
*  I would say it can't be that bad,
*  but then you hear about like the people in Iceland,
*  they eat that pickled shark that Anthony Bourdain told me was the single most
*  disgusting thing he's ever eaten in his life. And they love it. It's like a delicacy.
*  Well, I've eaten warm liver out of a deer. So I hunted in,
*  is this Ronella doing it? Oh, okay.
*  So he is, that's the gallbladder. He's cutting open or he's tearing open.
*  I should say he's taken out. Look at that.
*  All the grass and everything in there. Isn't that crazy?
*  It doesn't look appetizing.
*  Not at all. No, is that what that is right there?
*  I mean, if it's, if it's, if it's the gallbladder, that's the bile.
*  What's all that grass? I don't know if it's grass or just bile. It could be just
*  coagulating bile. Yeah, let's give them some volume.
*  And all their food goes from your crop, which is a little holding tank.
*  Oh, that's a bird. Down to the gizzard. So this must be a turkey. Oh, it's turkey.
*  Edible organs. Okay. Oh, it's a gizzard. Yeah. Okay.
*  That makes sense. I've had gizzards from chickens before, you know, my family,
*  I'm Italian as you are. Right? Yeah. Yeah. We, uh,
*  we ate a lot of gizzards when I was a kid. I don't know why. Um,
*  see if you find the edible organs thing. That's, that's wild turkey.
*  See if you can find, um, Ronella eats raw liver with,
*  uh, bile. Have you ever had, have you ever had raw liver? I have not. Joe,
*  we could do it. Yeah. I brought some. You did? Go get it. Let's eat it.
*  It's right here. I'll eat some raw liver. Jamie's going to throw up. Look at him.
*  He already started making noises.
*  He already started making noises. You already had milk.
*  What does that have to do with this? Milk's a bad choice. Milk's a bad choice.
*  So grab a piece. Yeah. Okay. Here we go. Raw liver, raw liver.
*  What kind of liver is this? It's cows liver. So this is from grass fed grass
*  finished, regeneratively raised cows from white oak pastures in Georgia.
*  It's quite chewy. So what's supposed to be the action?
*  It doesn't taste much different than cook liver.
*  I think that the, in the tribe,
*  so there's a interesting tribe in Africa called the new air tribe and liver is so
*  sacred that they couldn't even touch it with human hands.
*  I don't know how they got it from the animal to people's mouths, but they would,
*  they would eat it. A lot of cultures eat it raw.
*  They'll just cut it up and eat it raw.
*  I think that the idea is you lose a little bit of nutrients when you cook it,
*  not much, but you lose a little bit.
*  So I've always been fascinated by how many of this is such a nutrient rich organ.
*  How much of it can I actually preserve in terms of nutrients?
*  And do I feel differently when I eat it raw? And there's, you know,
*  there's a lot of interesting nutrients in liver that aren't well represented in
*  the muscle meat, which we were talking about.
*  So muscle meat's a great source of B12 and zinc and iron and other things.
*  But so in the nose to tail folder, Jamie,
*  there's a graphic from my book that compares this one. I was guessing,
*  well, look at that. Yeah. Those cool ass cave paintings. Those, I,
*  I find that so fascinating. Those cave, cave art, cave paintings.
*  Price also added the notion that liver is truly a prize food for indigenous
*  people regarding an African tribe known as the, how do you say that? New Air.
*  New Air. He stated, I learned that they have a belief,
*  which to them is their religion,
*  namely that every man and woman has a soul which resides in the liver and that
*  a man's character and physical growth depends upon how well he feels,
*  feeds that soul by eating the livers of animals.
*  The liver is so sacred that it may not be touched by human hands. Now,
*  if that's the case, how do you explain Bert Kreischer?
*  Cause that motherfucker's liver is overworked, pickled even.
*  Maybe delicious. Maybe. Yeah. He probably has like foie gras, right?
*  Human foie gras liver is totally overfed,
*  completely fatty. That's not what you want. That's not alcohol.
*  Well, no foie gras is probably, I don't know that I'd be excited about eating
*  foie gras. They're like overfeeding the ducks, right? So good though.
*  It is probably it's a, it's a diseased liver. We can admit that.
*  People are like, wow, you shouldn't do that.
*  The weird thing about it is the ducks go to the feeding pipe. They go to it.
*  They want it to happen. Like in our eyes,
*  like this forced feeding is a terrible thing,
*  but they actually gravitate towards that pipe. It's a very twit.
*  Look, I'm not in favor of doing weird shit to animals like that.
*  I'm not in favor of giving them food. They're not supposed to eat.
*  I'm not in favor of overfeeding or force feeding them,
*  but I just find it odd that they go to that pipe. Like there's a,
*  you ever seen how they do it? I wonder what's in it.
*  I wonder what they feed them. Pretty sure it's grains. I'm pretty sure.
*  That's what it is. Like see if you can find them, uh,
*  ducks getting fed grains for fog.
*  Yeah. I wonder if they do anything to the grains to make them overeat it,
*  because there are lots of studies in rodents.
*  Sometimes you can use rodents that are genetically predisposed to become obese.
*  But if you alter the food and we know this with humans,
*  you can alter food in some ways to make it more palatable and to kind of short
*  circuit this tidy.
*  These ducks are not into it. This guy's grabbing them by the neck,
*  but this is a different setup. This is,
*  this is a handmade one like or a handheld one and they're just pumping it in
*  there. The video that I saw like this.
*  Yeah. Well, I'm sure it's the way I saw it,
*  it was like there was a pipe in the center of the room,
*  force feeding ducks at Hudson Valley, fog,
*  while go up that feeding ducks for fog walks. This,
*  I think this is probably one where they, uh,
*  yeah, see it's the, it's weird cause you're grabbing the duck.
*  They're not going to be into that no matter what you do.
*  And you're making them open their mouth. It just seems gross. Yeah, it is.
*  Here's what's weird about it. Is that any grosser than things that are legal?
*  You know, cause there's a lot of stuff that's legal that we do to animals.
*  Like when do we decide what's legal and what's not legal?
*  Because factory farming should be fucking completely illegal and it's legal in
*  California.
*  You can get factory fed animals and you could buy them left and right.
*  What you can't get is fog walk anymore. And I'm like, well, listen guys,
*  you got, you're not making any sense.
*  Like this is one small moment of this duck's day where they're feeding them and
*  they're, they're shoving a tube in his mouth and overfeeding them.
*  The life of a pig that you eat for bacon is a terrible tortured life and you're
*  okay with that.
*  You're just not okay with this fucking duck getting extra grain pumped down its
*  mouth. Meanwhile, they just live in a normal life other than that.
*  And feed lots. I mean, I think I agree with you completely.
*  Factory farming is a scourge and it should, I don't know why we keep doing it.
*  I think there's a lot of corn and soy subsidies that are supported by it and
*  it's really unfortunate,
*  but there's a lot of really interesting discussion about the sustainability of
*  grass fed grass finished meat and this regenerative agriculture concept.
*  But is it sustainable in at scale though?
*  Like could you still have Jack in the box if you had grass fed grass finished
*  meat? I think we can both agree that grass fed grass finished meat is healthier
*  to consume, but the disagreement comes like Bourdain again,
*  rest his soul would say he prefers grass,
*  grain fed cows because he finds the meat to be more delicious and tender.
*  He liked it better as a chef. And you know,
*  that's that's a culinary choice. Like he, as an artist creating food,
*  he preferred an animal that was, you know, like people like Wagyu, you know,
*  they like that kind of, I think that's, that's a fucking dying animal, man.
*  I agree with you there. I mean, if you look at the way that cattle are factory
*  farmed,
*  the reason they have all that intramuscular fat is because they are less
*  metabolically healthy than their grass fed grass finished cohorts.
*  The sustainability or the scalability argument is so important to consider.
*  So when I think about this, I think about it from a couple of perspectives,
*  there's the land use perspective,
*  but there's also just the actual mathematics of it that 99
*  ish percentage of cows that we eat that are grain finished had 85% of their
*  life on grass. They don't, they're not raised from calves in the factory farm.
*  So then I think like, wait a minute, we haven't,
*  we're already raising all of our cattle on grass for 85% of their lives.
*  We're just sending them to factory farms at the end.
*  And I think it's a consumer driven thing.
*  It's people who want that type of meat or they're not familiar with the gamy
*  flavor or texture, or they want it to be intramuscular fat.
*  They want it to have more marbling. And then the other,
*  the other aspect is the actual land use.
*  And then when you think about how much land is used to grow corn and soy,
*  and then if we get rid of all the corn and soy that goes to animals and feed
*  lots, we can graze cattle there. And then there's actually,
*  I believe it's called the conservation reserve program.
*  The federal government pays farmers to let their lands lay fallow for
*  decades.
*  There's hundreds of thousands of acres in the United States that are not being
*  farmed because they were monocropped to basic,
*  they were monocropped so badly that they had no nutrients.
*  They can't grow plants on it. So when I think what everyone is missing,
*  well, not the people in the regenerative agriculture space, not you,
*  but I think that the mainstream is missing the fact that in order to regenerate
*  land, in order to make land healthy, you put animals on the land.
*  That's why the center of the country where there were millions of bison and elk
*  and antelope and deer and pronghorn had the richest soil anywhere until we
*  monocropped it. And then we deplete the nutrients. It's a net negative.
*  It's just a, it's just a sink. We're just pulling nutrients out.
*  But when you talk to the folks at white oak pastures in Georgia or other
*  regenerative farms, and you look at the soil, it's incredible that when animals
*  live on the soil in an ecosystem, it puts nutrients back into the soil.
*  The soil is like the color of coffee grounds.
*  So I was in Georgia recently at Bluffton at white oak doing photographs for a
*  cookbook I'm writing and Will Harris, who's a colleague of Joel Salatin.
*  I know you've had Joel on the podcast. Yeah. Love him. Yeah.
*  And so Will has a two jars in his, in,
*  in one of the churches on his property in Bluffton and one jar is soil from his
*  farm and it's the color of coffee grounds. It's like 5% soil carbon.
*  The other jar is from 25 yards away on his neighbor's pasture growing cotton or
*  soy. It's, it's, it's like a, it's like the color of this wood table.
*  It's a light Brown. They're completely different.
*  And if you look at the soil content of carbon, it's 0.5%.
*  So you have 10 X the amount of carbon in the soil when it's farmed regeneratively.
*  They've been doing regenerative agriculture there for 20 years and you can see this
*  steady increase in the amount of soil carbon. I'll pull it up.
*  There's a graphic from this in my book.
*  Well, it just completely makes sense because manure is fertilizer.
*  Animals eat the grass. They make manure.
*  The manure is fertilizer worms and bugs live under the manure.
*  There's an entire ecosystem that evolves around these animals living the way
*  they've lived for hundreds of thousands, if not millions of years.
*  It makes sense that it all works together synergistically to feed the soil and to
*  provide nutrients for the very animals.
*  And those animals will die on that land and they will rot and they will provide
*  even more fertilizer.
*  And then other animals will live off of them and live in that area.
*  And they too will die and they will shit all over the place and piss all over the
*  place and they will feed the soil. And this is a system.
*  And we fucked that system up by growing corn.
*  We fucked that system up by growing a million acres of soybeans,
*  like whatever the fuck we do. Why are we eating those things? Well,
*  it seems like we thought it was a great idea during world war one and world war
*  two because they needed food.
*  The reason why all this like subsidies of farmers happened is not that,
*  you know, the agriculture business is evil and the government is in bed with them.
*  What happened was during the first and second world war,
*  there was a need for surplus food.
*  There was a need for food because there was back then there was a very real
*  concern for supplies, for troops, for supplies for the United States.
*  I mean, we were at war. I mean,
*  a crazy war that I don't think today in our 2020 version of war,
*  which always happens in some remote far away land,
*  and it's always a domination by the United States.
*  I don't think we really understand the desperate and terrifying times when they
*  were, you know, asking people to donate metal and rubber. I mean, it was,
*  it was a crazy time and the government stepped in and said,
*  we are going to pay farmers to grow corn. We need food.
*  And so they subsidized these farmers to grow all this food.
*  Now it's become a different animal because now they're subsidizing people to
*  grow corn that is mostly in a lot of cases,
*  like I have a friend who has a farm and they grow it for livestock.
*  They have a huge area that they grow corn and it's all by the way,
*  Monsanto corn, right? They're spraying that fucking roundup on it, which is,
*  you know, glyphosate is terrible for you.
*  And I had a podcast about that recently about environmental chemicals and how
*  bad they are for you.
*  And then how that stuff actually can be in the meat and can in
*  turn get into your system and provide you with all sorts of problems.
*  And this is why there is, there's subsidizing of farmers.
*  I mean, it's also cause we need farmers. We need to keep them healthy.
*  And this is just not the way to do it though. This is not,
*  if we could just get people off the tit of corn,
*  get people off the tit of these mono crop, you know,
*  mono crop agriculture, we would be a healthier country.
*  If we can have these giant areas where people can grow all kinds of
*  things like, like polyphase farms, the way Joel Salatin runs things,
*  he moves all of his animals around. He, he, he lets all of his, his pigs,
*  they live like wild pigs.
*  They just eat acorns and nuts and all these different things.
*  And he supplements them sometimes and, and,
*  and he has incredible soil like the other farm you're describing and incredibly
*  healthy animals.
*  That's the way it should be. And I love that you said that it's just,
*  we have this dependence on soy and corn based economies now.
*  And I love that the regenerative agriculture movement is starting and that
*  peeps slowly, slowly.
*  There are more farms that are shifting and shifting and shifting before the
*  podcast. I was telling you about a ranch in Fredericksburg called Rome ranch.
*  And they're, they're really cool. They have, they raised bison.
*  And if you look at the ground, so when I was out at Rome,
*  I stood like a couple of feet from a Buffalo or a bison. I don't know.
*  Was there a fence in between you and the bison? Why are you doing that, man?
*  Once you watch videos, don't you watch YouTube? It was just this,
*  it was this universal moment.
*  Bro, this is a great video of a bison charging another bison and launching it
*  into the air. Think about how big, what is a bison weight? Like 2000 pounds.
*  It was intense. It was just kind of like this. We had this bond.
*  Those are amazing animals. Beautiful animals. They're so amazing.
*  And if you look at the ground at Rome ranch, this is Fredericksburg, Texas.
*  This is land that was monocropped. I believe this is land that used to be fertile
*  in Southern Texas that was destroyed. Okay. And then actually,
*  you know, they're starting to regenerate it. They've been regenerative,
*  I think for three or five years and they start to get more grass growing on a
*  piece of soil. So if you look at a square foot,
*  Hold up, scroll that down there with the hunt.
*  How are you going to hunt something you can stand right next to?
*  They have access out there.
*  Oh, okay. That's a different area. They will not let you stand next to them.
*  They will let you stand next to the axis here. Oh,
*  they won't let you stand at the axis, but you can stand next to the bison.
*  I'm saying access deer will not let you stand next to them.
*  Also they have access to your hunts there.
*  So this is only like an hour plus from here. Oh, they have archery hunts there too.
*  Absolutely.
*  Yeah, it's a great spot.
*  But if you look at the ground and you look at a square foot of the ground at
*  Rome ranch, you can see that on the pastures that the bison are in,
*  maybe only 30 or 40% of that earth is growing grass.
*  But you know that in the future, if you, you know, move it out 20 years,
*  like, like white oak pasture says done when I was in Georgia, every inch,
*  every millimeter of that ground is growing grass. It's like thick grass, right?
*  And that's feeding the cattle in a much more rich way.
*  And so that's what regenerative agriculture is about.
*  We should go there and we should make a video of us going there and talking to
*  them about that and throw it up on YouTube.
*  I think that would be really interesting. I'd love to see how they,
*  I'm not going to get near the bison though. I'm,
*  I'm going to learn my lesson from other people. Well,
*  we go out there with like,
*  we go out there with Katie and Taylor who,
*  who own the farm and take care of it.
*  And there's people out there who you work with the bison and they know which
*  animals are more aggressive.
*  Fuck all that, man. What if you make a mistake? Oh, I thought it was Mike.
*  That's Bill. Bill's crazy. Don't go near Bill.
*  The head of the Buffalo, the head of the bison was the size of my torso.
*  It was moving, man. I was like, wow,
*  I like experiences that make me feel small.
*  Yeah. Well that will do it, man.
*  You know, backcountry skiing or being on the Pacific crest trail or any of the
*  stuff.
*  This whole area used to be overrun with bison, which is really crazy.
*  I mean, this is where the Comanche lived and that was their primary food.
*  Yeah. The Comanche were an animal based culture, which is really interesting.
*  It's that book Empire of the Summer Moon, right?
*  Yes. Yes. Fantastic book. But they,
*  they really didn't eat much else. They ate a little bit of berries here and there,
*  but most of what their diet was, was meat. And that they also had,
*  there was a benefit to that in terms of the way they could travel because they
*  could go without food longer than people that were mostly carbohydrate based.
*  The carbohydrate based guys would like the soldiers would crash and the
*  Comanches could keep going because their body would just go into ketosis and
*  they would live off fat.
*  It was a natural like shift back and forth between eating meat and eating fat
*  and eating organs to not eating for a while.
*  And so few humans in 2020 have gone for more than
*  18 hours without eating food.
*  Yeah.
*  Very few of us in how many decades we've lived or have utilized
*  the fat burning systems in our body. You know,
*  you can use glucose or fructose or sugars.
*  You can use carbohydrates and you can do glycolysis,
*  but there's a whole other system where you can either use fat that's coming in or
*  use fat from your body in beta oxidation and ketones move the, you know,
*  the fat basically precursor molecules around your body.
*  And when we get adapted to that, we have this extra engine. We have two engines.
*  We're both hybrid and gas.
*  But if we go long enough without ever using the hybrid, you know,
*  fat burning engine, we kind of lose it, but you can get it back pretty quickly.
*  It's kind of interesting today that there are a lot of people that are interested
*  in intermittent fasting or, you know,
*  having a very specific feeding window and they are,
*  they are seeing benefits of that.
*  And I was reading some article recently that was saying there's it's a study
*  shows that there's no weight loss benefit to intermittent fasting. And I'm like,
*  who made that study and who were you studying? And how is that everybody that I
*  know that's done in his last weight, like, what are you talking about? Like,
*  how, what is that study about and who,
*  why would someone be even interested in promoting that?
*  So much of what gets done in the nutrition community in research is a lot
*  of fucker. And the devil's in the details, right? What were they feeding them?
*  What was the ratio of oils in the food? What,
*  what were they doing for intermittent fasting?
*  Were they intermittent fasting with junk food?
*  Were they intermittent fasting with standard American diet food?
*  I think it's pretty clear there's a lot of compelling data in both,
*  at least in animal models.
*  And I believe in human models too that having a feeding window and having time
*  when your body shifts from quote carbohydrate burning or using the glycogen
*  sword in your liver to making ketones,
*  even on a daily basis that cycling is beneficial for humans.
*  You're flipping back and forth between anabolic and catabolic pathways.
*  At a broad level, you're looking at systems like mTOR,
*  the mammalian target of rapamycin and kinase. They're, they're,
*  they're balancing systems. This is a, I mean, they're,
*  they're kind of this seesaw.
*  And we know that when you have amp kinase at a very broad level,
*  when you have more of this ketogenic physiology, when you,
*  when you exhaust the glycogen in your liver,
*  you turn on these autophagy mechanisms.
*  You do the cellular house cleaning and that's beneficial for humans.
*  Our ancestors would certainly have done that.
*  Please explain that to people, the cellular house cleaning, the, the, the,
*  your body actually does get rid of some damaged cells,
*  damaged cells and damaged proteins within cells and damaged mitochondria.
*  So within the cell, there are these quote powerhouse factories,
*  which are probably ancient bacteria, you know,
*  billions of years ago that combined with a single celled organism.
*  And we became eukaryotic with a membrane bound nucleus and a
*  membrane bound organelle called mitochondria,
*  which produces ATP for the body. And so within the body,
*  there are all these organelles within ourselves. And some of them,
*  the job of that organelle is to basically be the trash compactor.
*  Old proteins are ubiquitated and they're moved to organ,
*  to the organelles that recycle them. And so you do this cellular house cleaning,
*  but, and it seems to happen more when you're in this state of ketosis or
*  when you're not using the glucose from,
*  or when you're not in sort of an anabolic physiology.
*  And so you can see that with our ancestral, their ancestors,
*  we would have switched back and forth.
*  We wouldn't have been successful in hunts every day.
*  We would have had some hunts that were successful in some gathering sessions,
*  which were successful and others which weren't. And when they're not successful,
*  you're, you're fasting. And so that's a, that's a beneficial thing. I mean,
*  and I think that that,
*  that intermittent cellular house cleaning is an ancestral pattern that we would
*  do well to, to a spouse, to mirror.
*  Like, so your body doesn't have any food to digest. So it's like, look,
*  let's do some cleaning up. We got a bunch of junk laying around the attic.
*  Let's sweep it up. But if we're doing the standard American thing,
*  which is to eat constantly and snack throughout the day,
*  and then can't wait to have dinner and then can't wait to have breakfast and
*  can't wait to have lunch. And your, your body never really gets a break.
*  It's always digesting.
*  It's always digesting. I mean,
*  it would be so interesting to look at the,
*  the Western population of the American population and see how many of them
*  actually exhaust liver glycogen overnight.
*  How many people actually wake up with ketones in their blood?
*  I think it would be a fraction.
*  I think the majority of people never get rid of their liver glycogen,
*  never actually flip. And to be fair,
*  I actually don't think we should always be in ketosis either.
*  I think that that can present some challenges to the human physiology and that
*  intermittent, you know,
*  inclusion of carbohydrates can be beneficial for humans. And this is a cycle.
*  It's a circle like many things are in our life and our ancestors,
*  in spite of the fact that they favored meat and organs,
*  they certainly would have had carbohydrates from time to time when they were
*  available. So that's this, this balance.
*  I think that personally when the people I've worked with and in the reading that
*  I've done, everything I've learned,
*  it's it works better to be cyclic ketosis rather than persistent ketosis all the
*  time, though ketogenic physiology, I think is intrinsic to humans.
*  It's beneficial, super healthy.
*  And a lot of people find massive benefits from it.
*  Well, ketosis,
*  particularly for people that have epilepsy or,
*  and for seals that work on those rebreather's, you know, um,
*  they found that being in ketosis can keep them from having seizures,
*  which is really kind of fascinating. It changes the neural physiology. Yeah.
*  Well for children, children that have epilepsy,
*  they found a great benefit in being in ketosis. It just,
*  it makes sense that your body would fare best on the things that it evolved with.
*  The things that it evolved with are mostly animals, fish and fruits.
*  I agree with you.
*  Whatever you could mean, you know, obviously you don't get fruit all year round.
*  You get it in a specific time when the fruit falls from the tree,
*  but animals were available 365 days a year.
*  And that's most likely what a lot of people ate.
*  And if you look at hunter gatherer tribes, that's what we see there.
*  And it's so interesting to me that they have a preference for animal foods.
*  A lot of them will eat tubers occasionally.
*  There's actually a pretty cool study.
*  I think you'll find it in the anthropology folder, Jamie,
*  or that it's termed Hadza fallback foods. It's the fourth one there.
*  And this is such a cool study.
*  I really want to go spend time with the Hadza next year. David Cho did.
*  I heard him on the podcast. That is one of the most intense things that I've ever
*  heard described on the podcast when he was talking about them hunting baboons,
*  because the area where they live has been so depleted of game that they're,
*  they're reduced to baboon hunting, you know?
*  And he was like, it's really crazy and really dark when, you know,
*  you see a baboon got hit by an arrow and they grab the arrow,
*  like with their hands, like yikes.
*  That story was poignant for sure.
*  That's too deep for me. It was intense.
*  But when I heard that conversation with David Cho,
*  a couple of things stood out for me.
*  And one of them was that when he asked them,
*  what was the best day of your life? They,
*  all the people he asked said it was the day that I killed the biggest animal and
*  fed the tribe. Yes.
*  It wasn't the day that I found this huge patch of berries or I got,
*  I dug the biggest tuber.
*  It was the day that I killed the biggest animal and fed the tribe.
*  And the other thing that they communicated to him was that the animals that they
*  hunt now are different, that they can't hunt the same animals,
*  which has probably changed their food patterns in modern day.
*  And that he even said this on the podcast that they're,
*  they were sort of describing to him, there used to be big animals everywhere.
*  And you can imagine what it was like for the Comanche as they came to the
*  plains and they were hers thousands of Buffalo.
*  Like there is no scarcity of food.
*  There is a ton of big animals and these animals are not even big relative to
*  what might've been here when they were mega fauna, you know,
*  tens of thousands of years ago.
*  But you just think about the way that currently living hunter gatherers might
*  have changed their, their food stuffs to survive.
*  And if you had woolly mammoth all the time, man,
*  I think you're probably going to eat some honey if you can find it,
*  but honey and woolly mammoth sounds like a good diet to me. I mean, that's a,
*  that's a huge smorgasbord.
*  I want to get into the honey thing, but I also want to talk about what is,
*  what is it called? I always screw up the word. Is it glucogenesis?
*  Like what is it called when your body converts protein into glycogen?
*  Gluconeogenesis.
*  Gluconeogenesis. Okay. So that is what occurs.
*  If you just eat nothing but meat, you will develop some glucose.
*  You have to, you have to, in ketosis, your body will do gluconeogenesis.
*  And your body does this without, you don't need any carbohydrates.
*  You don't need any carbohydrates to do it. It will use,
*  there are certain amino acids that are gluconeogenic.
*  The backbone of a fat molecule is glycerol. That's gluconeogenic lactate.
*  There are acetate. There are other molecules that can make glucose.
*  We have a backup system to make glucose because there are tissues in the body
*  that require glucose.
*  And this is why if you eat only meat,
*  you will get knocked out of ketosis if you have too much protein.
*  Yeah. Which may not necessarily be a bad thing. It's just, it's human physiology.
*  It's pretty fascinating though that your body has, knows how to do that.
*  It doesn't convert it. Yeah. Yeah. Because you, you would die otherwise.
*  If we didn't make glucose from protein and glycerol backbones and other
*  substrate, we would die. We need glucose.
*  One of the things that I found when I did a total animal diet for a month is my
*  energy level was really sustained throughout the day.
*  It was very even and I found it to be very unusual.
*  Like there was no difference between me at 11 AM versus me at 7 PM.
*  It was a flat line throughout the day.
*  And I cannot say that about any other diet that I've ever been on.
*  There's been these ups and downs and especially when I'm eating just normal,
*  whatever, whatever I feel like eating cheeseburger, have a bowl of spaghetti,
*  whatever I'm thinking about, you know, whatever I feel like eating.
*  When I do that, there's horrible crashes like,
*  and the way I feel after meals is so different.
*  The way I feel after meals when I was on the carnivore diet, which again,
*  admittedly I only did really strictly for a month.
*  Like now I'm on the carnivore diet until I go out to dinner and then I eat
*  whatever the fuck I want. Like last night I had sushi.
*  But for the most part during that month,
*  I had like real amazing energy and a lot of clarity and I felt extra aggressive,
*  which was weird.
*  And I don't know if that was just because I felt better and that's just my nature
*  and I'm not tired, but not aggressive in a bad way, but aggressive.
*  Like I was quicker to like mock things like, fuck that. I was quick.
*  I was, I had more energy and it was more fun to make fun of things too.
*  I had more energy to exercise. I had more,
*  more ambition to do things. It was very weird.
*  And I was thinking like there's without a doubt,
*  some sort of physiological change to my body that's happening while I'm on this.
*  And I lost a lot of weight too. I lost 12 pounds in a month,
*  which I thought was pretty extraordinary.
*  That's a, that's a very large amount of weight to lose in a month.
*  And I heard you also say your vitiligo got better. Yes, it did. Yeah.
*  That is amazing. That's really cool.
*  Spikes started filling in, which is really strange.
*  Because I first got interested in the carnivore diet because of autoimmunity
*  and the way that just the hypothesis could some of these plant toxins that we
*  were kind of talking about earlier,
*  could these be triggering immunologic reactions in humans? And we know they do.
*  Gluten is a plant lectin and it certainly triggers an immunologic reaction in
*  the small intestine.
*  Could that model be at play on a bigger scale for people with vitiligo?
*  I had eczema and asthma, which is an autoimmune condition.
*  What about autoimmune thyroid disease? What about psychiatric illness,
*  which I believe is autoimmune as well?
*  I think there's probably quite a few of them that are now when you said you had
*  eczema and asthma.
*  Was that cured with the carnivore diet or is it in remission?
*  Like, I think that's just syntax, right? Of course.
*  So I have not had any flares of eczema since I've been eating a carnivore or
*  carnivore ish diet for the last two years,
*  except one time when I reincorporated some plants back in my diet and an
*  experiment with squash. So I'll get eczema on like my wrists.
*  So you got it just from taking squash. Yeah, the squash.
*  And it kicked it back in. It kicked it back in a little bit.
*  Nothing for two years. And then you have squash and then it kicks in.
*  It had a little bit of eczema on my lower back.
*  And then you stopped eating squash. It goes away. Wow.
*  And there are, I mean,
*  squash is one of the foods that I would think is fairly ancestrally consistent
*  and fairly less offensive to humans because in the book, I don't,
*  the book is not meant to convince everyone to stop eating all plants.
*  The book is really meant to do a couple of things.
*  It's meant to help people understand that animal meat and organs are the foods
*  that we've been eating throughout our evolution.
*  They're wrongly vilified today and we can talk about why with the epidemiology
*  and they should be a part of any,
*  they're an integral part of any healthy human diet.
*  And then I created kind of a spectrum of plant toxicity,
*  thinking about hunter gatherer tribes and which parts of plants they favor and
*  which parts of plants they discard. And then thirdly,
*  I think it's important to understand what we talked about processed vegetable
*  oils and processed sugars, hugely bad for humans,
*  but I'm really interested in carnivore and carnivore ish type diets so that
*  it can, the most number of people can benefit.
*  Now what about fruit? What,
*  when you say you eat a carnivore ish diet, I know you incorporate honey,
*  but do you eat any fruit?
*  I've experimented with it and I, so for about a year and three quarters,
*  I had just meat and organs and fat and I was in ketosis all the time,
*  depending how much protein I had. And then I had some thoughts about, well,
*  what does, what does my blood sugar look like when I do this? I got a CGM.
*  I got one of these continuous glucose monitors and I started,
*  I started incorporating carbohydrates first as an experiment.
*  And what I noticed was that with sort of these less toxic carbohydrates or what,
*  what I think of as more ancestrally consistent sources of carbohydrates,
*  I felt even better. The XM didn't come back with honey. I had occasional fruit.
*  I found that I couldn't overeat fruit. I couldn't, if I ate too much fruit,
*  I felt bloated and kind of just farty and didn't feel good.
*  Fruit seems to have this built-in mechanism where we can only eat so much of it.
*  Honey is, you know, I can eat a moderate amount and feel just fine,
*  but the inclusion of those carbohydrates actually made me feel a little better.
*  I slept a little better with long-term ketosis for myself.
*  And what I've observed for some people, perhaps not all with long-term ketosis,
*  electrolyte deficiencies, a lot of times develop. People get cramps,
*  they get palpitations. And we know that when ketogenic physiology happens,
*  our body partitions electrolytes differently. Sodium, you know,
*  sodium retention in the kidneys different.
*  And then when sodium becomes a little bit funky,
*  our body wastes a little magnesium, a little potassium.
*  And so that started to kind of make sense to me. I thought,
*  Oh, maybe it doesn't have to be as dogmatic as full meat and organs.
*  Maybe we can, you know, maybe more people would benefit.
*  If we think about this more like our ancestors, right?
*  More like the Hadza eating berries or Boa Bob or Bayo Bob, and then honey,
*  occasionally.
*  And you can always look at your blood sugar with a CGM or other metrics.
*  What was fascinating. And I actually have my, all my blood work,
*  if you want to see it or any of my continuous glucose monitor readings,
*  but you can see this is all in the lab work or the blood work folder, Jamie.
*  And there at the bottom, there's those three images of my blood sugar.
*  And there's a few other ones,
*  but you can see that with, with honey and, and mead and organs,
*  don't really have much of a change in the blood sugar at all. It's pretty,
*  pretty mild most of the time. And it stays very consistent.
*  Honey has a lot of really unique properties too, doesn't it?
*  There's, there's a certain honey. I want to say it's from New Zealand.
*  My wife was just talking to me about it the other day. Yes.
*  That actually helps people heal better.
*  I think a lot of honeys do that actually. Now,
*  Manuka has a very good publicist. I haven't seen any, I think it might,
*  I think super expensive. Yeah. I think a lot of honeys can help with that.
*  But if you look at the literature on honey, there's studies.
*  So when I first thought about honey,
*  I thought this is going to cause dental cavities and I'm good friends with a
*  periodontist incidentally, a periodontist who has an advanced leukemia,
*  who's on a carnivore diet and doing really well.
*  But he was pointing me to a bunch of evidence that honey has been used to
*  treat oral candida to treat it actually,
*  can have activity against cariogenic bacteria in the mouth.
*  They use it to treat oral mucusitis. It's incredible.
*  These compounds in honey look very different than the associations that we have
*  with sugar and periodontal disease is really just processed sugar.
*  Probably. Yeah, there might be something different about honey.
*  And then if you look in rats, again, we're moving to an animal model,
*  when you give rats a lot of fructose, they don't do good, right? Rats have,
*  nor do we, right? Nor to humans, nor to humans,
*  but moderate amounts humans seem to do okay with like fruit amounts,
*  but massive amounts in rats or moderate amounts in rats do,
*  don't do well because rats do their biochemistry a little differently.
*  They convert fructose to fat.
*  And do they give it to them in fructose corn syrup or do they give it to them
*  and actual fruit? It's in their feed. So they add to the feed.
*  They add fructose and I think it might actually be sucrose as glucose and
*  fructose. Yeah. Which is essentially the same as high fructose corn syrup,
*  it just has to do with what the ratios are of the glucose and the fructose.
*  And if you look at rats given honey versus rats given sugar,
*  they have different outcomes. Really? Yeah. Yeah. That's in the honey folder,
*  Jamie, the honey rats protective.
*  So there's something about the consumption of honey that's actually net
*  beneficial.
*  Well, it seems to mitigate the oxidative stress.
*  So if you look at the bottom there,
*  see where it says compared with those fed fructose. Yeah.
*  Interesting. Well, it tastes good too.
*  Honey is delicious.
*  It doesn't taste like you're doing anything wrong.
*  Like when I eat a piece of chocolate cake, it tastes great,
*  but it tastes like I'm fucking up. You know what I'm saying? Yeah.
*  I don't know if that's psychological or what,
*  but when I have honey with my tea, like it's delicious and it feels like I crave
*  it. Like I'm enjoying it. Like it's doing something for me. I like it.
*  Hopefully in the future, when I get to go spend time with the Hadza,
*  I'll be able to eat in the cone like they do. But in the,
*  in the anthropology folder, Jamie, there's a study, the Hadza fallback foods,
*  the Hadza, both the men and the women in the Hadza tribe rate honey as their
*  favorite food. And the men say meat is their second.
*  The women say meat, baobab and berries are all.
*  So if you go down to the third or the fourth page, you'll see this graphic.
*  Baobab.
*  What is that?
*  B-A-O-B-O-B. So you see that's the,
*  the black bar is how many people like honey, right?
*  And the next bar is meat and then baobab, berries and tubers.
*  So both males and females, they don't, they don't really like tubers a lot.
*  They'll dig them as a fallback food.
*  And actually the title of this paper is Hadza fallback foods.
*  But at the end of the paper, they say there's this observed behavior that if
*  there's a lot of meat in the camp,
*  the women will stop digging tubers for two to three days.
*  Baobab is this tree in Tanzania that has this fruit. I've never had it,
*  but it has this kind of dry, this dry fruit pulp on the outside of the seeds.
*  Maybe you can find a picture of baobab, Jamie, but yeah,
*  that's interesting stuff, but they all love honey in the Hadza tribe.
*  And the, that's it. Wow. Yeah. It's a really cool looking tree.
*  Freaky tree. If I saw that, I'd be like, that's a trap. That's not a real tree.
*  That one in the upper left hand corner, like that looks really different.
*  I'd be like, dude, that is not a tree. Some there's someone in there.
*  They're going to grab you when you walk by.
*  That almost looks like the tree from that tree in the princess bride. Yes.
*  Look at this guy. He's climbing into a hole in the tree.
*  The Hadza have this special acts they use. And if they, if they see,
*  wow, those are crazy. Yeah. That's the weirdest tree. Look,
*  it's for folks that are just listening. They're really fat and wide.
*  And then the top of these tiny little branches, Jamie, go to the left side,
*  the left of the other images that you were looking at and go drop down into the
*  lower right hand corner. That one, the bulbous one, it looks like an onion.
*  Look at that thing. That is so crazy. Amazing.
*  Apparently this tree is common and the fruit are fairly prevalent.
*  Interesting. Baobab. Baobab. I think that's how you pronounce it.
*  But if you look at, and if you look at tooth decay in the Hadza,
*  there's some interesting findings. The women actually that are in that eat
*  indigenous in each ancestrally don't really have significant tooth decay.
*  The men have higher rates of tooth decay and we don't know whether that's because
*  they're eating more honey or because they also smoke tobacco and marijuana and
*  tobacco and marijuana are certainly associated with dental cavities or
*  periodontitis. So there's been some concern about that, but at least in myself,
*  I haven't seen anything.
*  And I've actually talked to a number of dentists who have said, no,
*  honey is protective in the mouth, which goes against everything we think.
*  But there are studies that look at the pH of the mouth. So I'm not a dentist.
*  I'm a medical doctor. But when I've been educated by dentists,
*  tooth decay appears to happen when the pH of the mouth drops,
*  when we eat sugar or something that's fermentable or in the setting,
*  probably a fat soluble vitamin deficiency, the pH of the mouth drops.
*  And the back, the cariogenic bacteria are able to thrive. Well,
*  if you look at the pH of the mouth, when you eat honey,
*  it drops and then it rebounds more quickly. So it's interesting.
*  Is there something in the honey that prevents that?
*  It's certainly an ancestrally consistent food.
*  If you look at where honey is available in the world,
*  it's eaten everywhere it's available.
*  It just makes sense. I mean, you see animals eat it.
*  You see bears eat it. Of course, you know,
*  the famous for those letting bees bite them while they just sting them,
*  while they eat their honey. Yeah. What's,
*  there's things about high fructose corn syrup that makes it particularly
*  damaging to the body. What are those things?
*  So fructose and glucose are different molecules and fructose and glucose have
*  different biochemistry in glucose biochemistry. There's a stop gap.
*  There's a rate limiting enzyme called phosphofructokinase,
*  meaning that if you try and overeat glucose,
*  your body's going to put the brakes on it and not do glycolysis,
*  which is the process by which you turn glucose that you're eating into energy.
*  Right. There's no break on fructose.
*  So fructose bypasses phosphofructokinase and can essentially
*  move down the shared glycolytic pathway into the formation of the
*  glycerol backbone and triglycerides,
*  which are essentially fats without any, without any breaks.
*  So the problem is not high fructose corn syrup itself.
*  It's that you can eat it in without, without stopping, right?
*  That you can get massive amounts of it and they're calorically bereft.
*  So if you were to eat, if you, if I were to give you,
*  if you look at isocaloric studies of fructose,
*  there's no evidence that they,
*  that fructose increases uric acid or blood pressure or weight gain.
*  Isocaloric.
*  But when anything with high fructose corn syrup is going to be so enticing,
*  is going to short circuit your satiety mechanisms so much that you're just going
*  to overeat it in a way that fruit doesn't do. Right? Like we said,
*  you fruit has this stopgap. It kind of has this break on it. You're like,
*  Oh, I can't eat any more fruit.
*  That's another thing that I noticed about doing the carnivore diet for that one
*  month was that satiety when you're only eating meat,
*  you don't eat as much. You just don't. I mean, it's, it's, it's a,
*  you could call it, it's not just an elimination diet, but it is,
*  it's in many ways it's you're reducing calories just because you're just not as
*  hungry and you eat to satisfaction.
*  But overall the calorie consumption is much less than if you were eating it
*  along with like a macaroni and cheese or,
*  you know, cream corn or bread or all these other things you would keep eating.
*  Like if you have a steak and you only eat this 18 ounce ribeye,
*  you will, you're, you're only going to eat a certain amount. I mean,
*  maybe you'll eat the whole thing,
*  but maybe you'll get like three quarters away and you'd be like, I'm good.
*  But if you've got mashed potatoes and gravy and bread,
*  you'll just keep fucking eating. And it's weird. It's weird.
*  Your body just wants to stuff more stuff into your mouth.
*  There are different satiety mechanisms,
*  I think happening at the level of the hypothalamus in the brain when you're just
*  eating protein and fat versus protein and fat and carbohydrates.
*  And there's nuance there as well.
*  I there's some really interesting evidence that polyunsaturated fatty acids
*  probably hijack these satiety mechanisms as well.
*  And that linoleic acid specifically and other omega sixes can have negative
*  consequences at the level of the brain.
*  And you don't get that satiety response to turn off. But yeah,
*  I agree with you every once in a while on strict carnivore diets,
*  people can't eat enough because of this. And they,
*  and they do benefit from including some carbohydrates in their diet.
*  And I think, you know, our ancestors have done that occasionally, but again,
*  I do think that for humans to thrive,
*  we should not fear meat and organs and you make that the center of your diet.
*  And like you're saying,
*  I think that there is a benefit to a carnivore ish diet just like you.
*  How many people are going to eat just meat and organs for their whole life?
*  A some devoted few, and they're definitely going to benefit.
*  But I think that the number is 10 to 20 to 100 X who might benefit from
*  understanding that meat and organs are valuable, incorrectly vilified,
*  and that there's a spectrum of plant toxicity. And that expands it.
*  Because when I tell people that I eat meat and organs and fat,
*  they look at me really funny.
*  But if I tell them that occasionally I eat an avocado or some raspberries or
*  some blueberries or some honey, their eyes kind of, the gears start turning.
*  They're like, maybe I could do that. And it starts to look like,
*  I would say a re-imagined version of a paleolithic diet,
*  because that's what we're essentially asking.
*  What is the species appropriate human diet?
*  What is the genetic congruence between our environment and our genetics in
*  2020?
*  I believe we're really still programmed to eat like our ancestors and that we
*  still thrive doing this,
*  but it can be a little bit more broad for people than just a strict carnivore
*  diet for those that will, will espouse that, you know, if I say, Hey,
*  well what about avocado? So in the book, in chapter 12,
*  I talk about this spectrum of plant toxicity.
*  And if you think about it from a plant's perspective,
*  there are parts of a plant that it wants you to eat usually like the fruit and a
*  lot of parts of the plant that it doesn't want you to eat.
*  And it doesn't want you to eat its leaves.
*  Why would the plant want you to eat its leaves?
*  It doesn't want you to eat its seeds.
*  Those are the reproductive parts of a plant.
*  Right. So if you chew the seeds, that's where this,
*  you were talking about these negative compounds that only happen when you chew
*  certain seeds like apple seeds.
*  Apple seeds have amygdalin. It's a cyanogenic glycoside. And yes, you can,
*  there there's enough.
*  It actually can release cyanide moieties in the human body. It's frankly toxic.
*  Apples do not want you to eat the seed,
*  but they don't mind if you swallow them and shit them out,
*  shit them out in a nice pile of fertilizer, right?
*  Which is how they wind up growing.
*  How they grow. And it's the same with all the stone fruits. So all the stone fruits,
*  peaches, plums, even almonds, they have this cyanogenic glycoside,
*  amygdalin and they're toxic like apricot kernels. The FDA,
*  I think had to at least step in or the USDA had to step in and have manufacturers
*  remove apricot kernels from trail mix. There was a big,
*  there was a big fervor about the Hunza a couple of years ago, maybe a decade ago.
*  And there was this,
*  this widely promulgated false notion that they were having this longevity benefit
*  from this amygdalin in the apricot kernels.
*  And it was really potentially dangerous for humans. So they're,
*  they ended up with these apricot kernels, the apricot seed in trail mix.
*  And the USDA or the FDA had to step in and say, no, no, no, you can't do that.
*  That has a toxic compound and almonds were very toxic and we kind of bred it out
*  of them. So a lot of the foods we eat today are sort of,
*  we're stripping the toxins away from the plants, but the intentions were clear.
*  It was one of those goofy vegan doctors who looks like shit was on this podcast
*  and he was talking about how he got really,
*  really sick because he picked these berries elderberry. Yes.
*  I've seen the video. Elderberries completely toxic raw.
*  How the fuck are you giving nutrition advice where you don't even know that this
*  is a toxic berry?
*  And so some berries are toxic, but if you think about fruit,
*  more fruit is edible than not. Right. But yeah, I thought that was hilarious.
*  He's talking about drooling.
*  I want to make much his name. I'm sure he's a nice person.
*  And I think he's doing, he's trying to do well.
*  I think he's just trapped in an ideological paradigm. He's like in this,
*  he's locked into this world and applauded and that's where he gets his love from.
*  And if you leave that world by God,
*  I've seen people do it and they get attacked in the most vicious and horrific
*  ways.
*  When their body is falling apart and they incorporate salmon and all of a sudden
*  they start getting erections and they start feeling better.
*  People will attack them. It's like,
*  I understand where these people are coming from in terms of them not wanting to
*  do harm. I understand it. I, I, I, I see their perspective,
*  but the vicious ways they attack people that leave that,
*  that I'm going to call it a cult because it's kind of like a cult. It's,
*  it's a dietary choice. It's a lifestyle choice, but it's very,
*  it's, it's an ideology as well. There's just,
*  there's parts to it. But that poor guy looks like dog shit.
*  He looks so bad.
*  And for him to be espousing this as a method of achieving health and wellness,
*  you're like, come on, man, do you have a fucking mirror in your house?
*  I want to do like a bloated. It's like crazy. It's crazy.
*  He's got his barrel chest. He's no muscle at all. He's like,
*  his neck is barely holding his head up. It's so strange.
*  It's just like my guy and there are very healthy vegans by the way. I mean,
*  the ones that do it right. Like my friend, Rick roll. He looks fantastic.
*  He's great. He runs ultra marathons. I've friends that are athletes that are
*  vegans. They figure out how to do it right. I think some people can pull it off,
*  but some people that are like in the community that are giving advice,
*  like they're, they look like shit.
*  Looking horribly with the people with the vegans that are thriving.
*  I always wonder how good would you be if you ate meat?
*  I know. Well, maybe not. I wonder. I mean,
*  I think that there are some people whose ancestors developed in certain parts of
*  the world where maybe meat was scarce. I mean, this is a hypothesis.
*  It was just a theory,
*  but I think that it's very likely that there are places that are rich in edible
*  plants and not very rich in wildlife.
*  It's possible. So the story that I hear,
*  and I I've done a podcast with rich, I'm not friends with him,
*  but I did a podcast on the minimalist where we had like kind of a friendly
*  debate. How did you guys, how did that go? I didn't listen to that.
*  It was pretty good because the guys, the minimalists are so cool and it was very
*  civil, but I, I, I wasn't, it wasn't bad. It was okay.
*  I'd love to talk to him more, but rich, rich isn't a scientist, right?
*  He's a very nice guy. He's a super nice guy, but not a scientist.
*  So the best version of veganism,
*  he's not trying to convert anybody.
*  He's just talking about his own personal experiences and,
*  and they've been net positive for him.
*  And the story that I've heard, and I don't want to put any words in Rich's mouth,
*  but the story that I've heard from him and other vegans is, is valid,
*  but it is often, I was eating a diet of junk food. I was,
*  I was drinking a lot and I did this intentional choice,
*  which is fricking amazing. I would give anybody a high five.
*  I think anyone deserves congratulations for making any intentional choice in
*  their diet.
*  I just want to provide information to help them make the best choice.
*  And so I think that they've made intentional choices.
*  They've cut out processed seed oils, they've cut out, you know,
*  processed food and they feel better. And my question is,
*  have you done the other thing? Have you eaten meat in Oregon?
*  Have you eaten buffalo that's bison that's grazed on like
*  really healthy ground with real good grass?
*  Have you eaten raw liver, Rich Roll?
*  Maybe don't give him that.
*  That'll get you high.
*  I don't think he got me high. It was okay. It was edible,
*  but there was a point in time where if I was queasy when I would,
*  the texture of that, when I was chewing on it, I was like,
*  if I was of a weaker constitution, we might've had an issue.
*  But you're stronger now. So check this out. You'll appreciate this.
*  So in the evolution folder, Jamie, I don't know if the study will be great to
*  pull up, but there's a study in there, the vegetarian ERP brain study.
*  So they've done studies with, with vegetarians and vegans and omnivores,
*  looking at the EEG.
*  So looking at the electroencephalogram and looking at the way the brain responds
*  at a neocortical and a more basic level.
*  And so the bottom thing there is kind of a complex statement, but they,
*  you see what they say.
*  The finding suggests that vegetarians aversion toward non-vegetarian food
*  prevails at the subjective level.
*  And it's consistent with personal beliefs, but at the neural level,
*  the intrinsic motivational salience of animal food remains.
*  So that means that in the deeper brain, they still crave meat.
*  Well, they eat it when they get drunk.
*  Exactly. There's such a high proportion of them that eat it when they get drunk.
*  What is the number?
*  I think it's 30 to 40%.
*  Joe, let's find it. I love this statistic.
*  It's a weird statistic, right? Because who's answering these?
*  I always wonder like who's, who are you asking?
*  Like there's so many people that never get asked. Yeah.
*  Like how many people that are vegetarians that get drunk and eat meat and you
*  never ask them.
*  And how many people stay strong and they stick to their diet when they get
*  drunk? What does it, what does it say?
*  Let's see proportion of vegetarians,
*  percentage of vegetarians that eat meat when drunk.
*  It's a big number.
*  I think it's, I remember reading it in the high thirties. Yeah,
*  it's a big number.
*  Yeah. And that's the ones that are willing to admit it.
*  That's the other thing about that thing. It's like, you just got to like,
*  there was one girl who got in real trouble because someone photographed her
*  eating fish, right? Wasn't it like a fish taco or something like that?
*  I don't know exactly, but I've heard the stories. Yeah. Yeah.
*  34% of those 37, 37 eaten meat when drunk and 34%
*  of those admitted to slipping every time they're hammered.
*  Just 22% answered. They only dropped their standards rarely.
*  Well that means they all do it then. They're all liars.
*  Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's, it's in our brain, right? It's in our brain.
*  And I, like you, I respect people making an intentional choice.
*  And I certainly a better choice than the standard American diet of shitty,
*  absolute sugar and processed vegetables. Yeah. Yeah.
*  It's, um, that's a subject that we should get into processed vegetable oils,
*  that this is a fairly recent thing in terms of the human diet over the past,
*  uh, hundred years or so.
*  And there's a direct correlation between incorporating these processed,
*  seed oils and terrible health results.
*  It's a fascinating story, Joe,
*  because if you look at how healthy we are in 2020, um,
*  it's pretty abysmal. So Jamie in the folder, metabolic health IR,
*  at the bottom there's a series of graphics that really illustrate this well.
*  I think it'll be really cool for everybody to see. So my friend,
*  Jeff knobs, let me borrow these graphics from his blog.
*  So start with the one on the row below that Jamie, um, the red one,
*  it's just the row below. That's like the chronic disease.
*  Oh, you don't see the row. So this is screenshot, uh,
*  10 18.58. There we go.
*  So if we look at chronic disease prevalence in America, it's clearly rising. Um,
*  it's a scary thought. So what is causing that? Right?
*  That is a massive spike. Look at that from 1940 to 2020.
*  I mean, it is just like a fucking skateboard ramp.
*  It is a skateboard ramp. What is causing that? And you know, a lot of people,
*  the prevailing narrative today is we eat too much and we're too sedentary.
*  And I think that's a gross oversimplification because if you look at the data,
*  we smoke less now. So in 1955,
*  there were 45% of people who smoked and today there's 14% of people that smoke.
*  We now have essentially the same cancer prevalence that we had, um,
*  you know, 20 years ago, more of us exercise in 2018,
*  54% of people reported exercise relative to 1995,
*  44% and more Americans are quote eating healthy in 2018.
*  There's 59% of Americans adhering to healthier eating. And yet, if you,
*  if you look at rates of obesity, so this is the screenshot that is 10,
*  1940, Jamie, look at the percentage of obesity in America.
*  But that's just nuts that so many more people smoke and yet there's less people
*  smoke. I mean, so many more people smoke in 1940, but yet there was less cancer.
*  Yeah. Look at obesity.
*  That's just obesity. If you look at obesity and overweight, it's over 70%.
*  These are just arbitrary.
*  This is just from the seventies, just the seventies to today.
*  So what is going on? What is going on? We're exercising more, smoking less,
*  rates of cancer are the same. We drink essentially the same amount of alcohol.
*  And that's where the story gets to be really interesting. And this isn't,
*  none of this is causal. None of this is, um, you know, interventional studies.
*  These are just kind of detective work. So look at the 10 dot 18 dot 41, Jamie,
*  that's diabetes prevalence. It's tells the exact same story. It's just,
*  it's scary. So something is going on and we kind of have to say,
*  we kind of have to be as a medical community,
*  we have to be honest and say, look at diabetes.
*  And that's formally diagnosed diabetes with hemoglobin,
*  A1C and fasting glucose.
*  Like these are people who are very far on the spectrum of metabolic dysfunction.
*  Again, it's, it's skyrocketed. Um, and so what's going on here.
*  And so now Jamie, if you go to 10 dot 16 dot 56,
*  that was the first one you brought up, we can look, and this is just,
*  this is detective work,
*  but we can start to make inferences or guesses at least based on trends and
*  calories from major food groups. This is actually a pretty cool graphic.
*  So the top line there, the green one is grains. It goes up a little bit,
*  but since 1995 it's gone down.
*  You can even look at sugars and sweeteners. Again, they go up a little bit,
*  but in the last 20 years they've gone down and the consumption of meat has gone
*  up. So we'll, we'll consider meat as a probable driver,
*  but look at that red line in the middle. We see what that line is.
*  That's vegetable oil, man. And then if you dig into that meat as a driver,
*  this is the 10 dot 18 dot 34. Jamie,
*  look at the total meat consumption by type. Um, that one.
*  So what are we eating more of? It's not red meat,
*  the type that that's getting vilified. We're eating more chicken.
*  So you might say, Oh, red meat is driving the problem. No,
*  we're eating less red meat than we did. And clearly that doesn't quite a bit,
*  quite a bit less red meat.
*  If you look at the middle between 1970 and 1980,
*  the spike to what we have now in 2020, that's a, that's a significant drop.
*  Yeah. And then if you go back to one of those other ones, Jamie,
*  the 10 dot 18 dot 26, you can see Americans are eating less saturated fat,
*  cholesterol and sodium, because those are all things that, that get vilified.
*  Right. And I don't believe saturated fat is a villain at all.
*  Saturated fat is incredibly healthy for humans when it's from well-sourced
*  animals, but we're eating less saturated fat. That's the blue line,
*  or just essentially exactly the same. So these are not driving it.
*  Red meat is not driving it.
*  Nobody thinks chicken is driving the chronic disease epidemic.
*  And then you look at a 10 dot 18 dot 19, we're eating more plant foods.
*  I'm not saying that plant foods are driving this,
*  but that doesn't look like we're going in there. You know,
*  like that's certainly not, you know, and the real driver here,
*  I suspect is the last one, Jamie, 10 dot 18 dot Oh nine.
*  If you look at the consumption of vegetable oil by, um,
*  by Americans in since 1910,
*  and that is a staggering amount.
*  You don't want to skateboard that ramp. That's Tony Hawk.
*  Yeah, that's Tony Hawk. That's Tony Hawk. Look at that, man.
*  And you can see soybean is the main one, but canola, sunflower, cotton seed,
*  peanut and other, this is completely evolutionarily inconsistent.
*  This is completely.
*  Disynchronous with our evolution.
*  We would never have been grinding soybeans up into oil.
*  We didn't have the ability to do this.
*  And then you can get into all of the reasons this might be doing this. But,
*  you know, as I kind of dug into this, it gets a little bit deep in the weeds,
*  but at a molecular level, these polyunsaturated fats,
*  they act differently in our body and we don't fully have this figured out.
*  But at the level of our mitochondria,
*  it does look like these polyunsaturated fats,
*  this linoleic acid rich vegetable oil is signaling things differently.
*  And I'm, I think it's really,
*  there's a lot of compelling evidence to suggest that linoleic acid is driving a
*  dipocyte hypertrophy, meaning fat cells are getting bigger.
*  And there's fat cells can do two things. They can get bigger or they can divide.
*  When fat cells get big and they don't divide,
*  they eventually start leaking out inflammatory mediators,
*  leaking out free fatty acids.
*  And so what you see is you start to see this,
*  this interesting set of data that points to the fact that maybe all these excess
*  linoleic acid is driving our fat cells to get really big,
*  but isn't allowing them to divide the way they're supposed to.
*  You can imagine evolutionarily that as winter is coming,
*  we might've had a few more seeds,
*  which are foods in nature that have linoleic acid,
*  but nothing like our consumption today.
*  So maybe it was advantageous to get a little bit more linoleic acid when things
*  might be scarce in the winter in, you know, northerly climes.
*  Maybe there's an evolutionary mechanism here,
*  but the potential is that every single day,
*  all of us in the Western world, if we're eating excess vegetable oils,
*  excess polyunsaturated fat, specifically linoleic acid,
*  we are driving a signal to our adipocytes that winter is coming.
*  Get fat, stay fat.
*  Whoa.
*  So it's just this evolutionary inconsistency and it's not rocket science.
*  It's like, wait a minute,
*  just stop eating those oils and really stop consuming animals fed corn and
*  soy, especially pigs and tur,
*  and monogastric animals like chickens.
*  Ruminants are unique because they have a rumen.
*  Ruminants can take polyunsaturated fats and put and make them into saturated
*  fats. Humans can't do this.
*  Monogastric animals, humans, chickens, pigs, they can't do that.
*  Anything, any polyunsaturated fat you give a pig is ending up in its fat.
*  Any polyunsaturated fat that you or I eat is ending up in our fat tissue.
*  We don't, we need a small amount,
*  but there's an evolutionary amount that I think has always been seen.
*  If we look at cultures of indigenous people,
*  they all have two to 3% of their calories as linoleic acid.
*  You look at how much is the source of that usually, usually animal fat.
*  There's about 1.6 to 1.8% animal fat in a grass fed cow.
*  And to be fair in a grain fed cow, it's not a whole lot more.
*  There's about 2% linoleic acid in the fat of a, of a ruminant animal,
*  a deer, a cow, a bison. But if you look at chicken, they're up at 23,
*  24% pork, 15 to 16% because they're fed porn and soy.
*  Like you said earlier, if you let a pig, like if you're out hunting hogs,
*  that, that hog is going to have a fat, you know,
*  maybe five to 6% linoleic acid and you can totally, it totally changes.
*  You know, chicken, the same research has been done showing that chickens in the
*  wild, I don't know what a wild chicken looks like, but like wild flightless
*  birds, their fat looks different than when they're fed corn and soy.
*  Not surprisingly because monogastric animals, chickens, turkey, duck,
*  pork, you know, pigs, humans, we store the polyunsaturated fat.
*  So I think this is a really interesting hypothesis.
*  We don't have enough data to say this, but man, it's so compelling.
*  And you know, the other side of the equation is certainly high fructose corn
*  syrup is not helping anything,
*  but I think it's important for people to understand that that might not be the
*  only villain and that a lot of people might get rid of the sugar,
*  but then continue eating processed food or hummus with canola oil or, you know,
*  chips from the store that are cooked in soybean oil and not understand it.
*  And this could be driving a lot of the disease that we're seeing in a really
*  subtle way.
*  It's fascinating because the narrative has always been unsaturated fats are
*  good.
*  Saturated fats are bad.
*  And a lot of this came from those studies that were sort of,
*  uh,
*  they were kind of hijacked by the sugar industry.
*  And this is,
*  this has been proven and this is something that is not that widely known.
*  Cause a lot of people aren't aware of it.
*  Still,
*  there was a time where the sugar industry bribed off scientists to pass the
*  blame off on saturated fat for heart disease.
*  Look it up.
*  Jamie,
*  it's in the New York times.
*  Look up sugar industry pay,
*  you know,
*  not that much either.
*  It was,
*  they paid him like 50 grand and in that,
*  in those bribes,
*  they literally ruin the American diet and because the narrative gets it,
*  like most people work all day.
*  They have kids,
*  they have hobbies,
*  they have friends,
*  how the sugar industry shifted blame to fat.
*  Yeah,
*  this is from 2016.
*  This is a four year old.
*  It's not even that old.
*  Well,
*  yeah,
*  not that old that,
*  that this happened.
*  Yeah,
*  they discovered,
*  they discovered it.
*  But this was the actual studies were from,
*  what was the sixties?
*  I think so.
*  Yeah.
*  This is the 1967 review of sugar,
*  fat and heart disease.
*  The studies using the review were handpicked by the sugar group and the article,
*  which was published in the prestigious New England journal of medicine,
*  minimize the link between sugar and heart health and cast aspersions on the
*  role of saturated fat.
*  So that scared everybody and got everybody to eat in margarine and margarine is
*  fucking terrible for you.
*  Vegetable oil.
*  Yeah.
*  And now people know what's really good for you is grass-fed,
*  butter.
*  The grass-fed butter is actually not bad for you at all.
*  Sue it.
*  Yeah.
*  Animal fat.
*  Have you had Sue it?
*  I haven't.
*  I heard you talk about it.
*  Kidney fat and it's particularly high in serious.
*  Good.
*  It's kind of waxy.
*  I think that you'd eat it if you were in the wilderness,
*  but you might not eat it other times.
*  He's growing again.
*  You want some of that raw liver,
*  bro?
*  Jamie,
*  we got some raw liver for you.
*  You said that it was going to give you a thing.
*  A hundred percent.
*  I would regurgitate.
*  Promise you.
*  But it didn't.
*  It would though.
*  But it didn't to me.
*  I could tell.
*  How about slice you off a nice little slice?
*  Just a little tiny piece.
*  It needs salt.
*  A little char.
*  Oh, char.
*  Okay.
*  We could do that for you.
*  We can make it happen.
*  We need a little Traeger in here.
*  I brought you guys some desiccated organs too.
*  Maybe desiccated organs are more Jamie style.
*  I take those.
*  I take pill form because I'm not going to get into my diet every single day.
*  So I take a bunch.
*  I know you have a company, but I was actually taking a different company stuff.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, you know, I thought about that, that a lot of people, when I talk about spleen
*  and kidney and pancreas, people do like what I'm never eating that.
*  Right.
*  But I wanted like my mom and my sister to have desiccated organs.
*  And when you put them in a freeze dryer, you can freeze dry them at like 38 degrees,
*  preserve most of the nutrients, put them in a capsule.
*  It's amazing.
*  And yours is heart and soil, heart and soil, heart and soil supplements.
*  And I'm sure that is that available on Amazon.
*  It's available on Amazon or there's a website people can go to for heart and soil too.
*  Yeah.
*  I buy everything on Amazon.
*  It's just so easy.
*  I'm so addicted to only clicking once.
*  I know, I know.
*  Well, I'm pretty sure in Austin, we'll get you hooked up if you want some joke.
*  Okay.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  But it's so cool to be able to put organs in there.
*  We start with like liver, but we have a beef organs that has pancreas, liver,
*  kidney, heart and spleen.
*  That's really cool.
*  There's unique benefits to all these different organs.
*  How much is lost in the transition between it being raw and in a natural form
*  and then put into pills?
*  Not a lot because it's freeze dried.
*  So you think about, you still save some if you dehydrated 140, but in a freeze
*  dryer, they lower the pressure and then they pull out the water at a low pressure.
*  It's essentially sublimation where you can go from solid to gas without going
*  through liquid, so you preserve as much as possible, like a pretty good amount
*  stays in there.
*  So maybe you lose a certain percentage of that and you could make that up with
*  volume, probably volume.
*  Yeah.
*  Volume.
*  And it's just, what's so cool is, you know, when you hear about these
*  desiccated organs, you think that's not going to work.
*  And then you get, I get hundreds of emails from people who are like, I took
*  your organ pills and I feel better.
*  I'm like, is this for real?
*  You know?
*  And it's just so cool.
*  Like my mom takes it.
*  My dad takes it.
*  My sister takes it.
*  She like opens it in the food for my niece and nephew.
*  She like puts it in their avocado or applesauce or mix it in a ground beef.
*  And I just think that's cool, you know, and people feel different.
*  We've got all kinds of different stuff people can check out, but there's
*  different things.
*  Have you thought about selling it in a spoonable like a powder so
*  that you can add it to whatever?
*  People don't want to taste it.
*  No.
*  No, they don't want to taste it.
*  The capsules are amazing because you can just take them and they're portable.
*  Maybe if people really want the powder, we'd make it.
*  But I think the capsules are better for people and it's portable and it's easy.
*  And you can condense, you know, an ounce of Oregon into, you know, a
*  reasonable amount of pills.
*  It's real food.
*  So there's no additives or preservatives or anything in there.
*  So it doesn't get that you'd have to take six to eight pills to get an
*  ounce of Oregon's, but that's a good amount of Oregon's.
*  Is that what you recommend on your, on the bottle?
*  Yeah.
*  Six to eight capsules of each.
*  And so if you are really gung ho about Oregon's like get the fresh stuff.
*  If you can, I want people to eat fresh liver and fresh heart and fresh pancreas.
*  I don't know if you want them to eat it the way I just say it, but if, but if
*  people can't do that, I just thought this is a cool thing that I can do that.
*  I believe Jamie's shaking his head.
*  He's just made for me.
*  I think.
*  Yeah.
*  The pills are gonna get some for you right now.
*  Jamie, hold on.
*  Is it going to help him?
*  You think immediately?
*  Jamie, you should try to eat the raw liver just once.
*  We'll get you a bucket.
*  It's not that I've not, like I've tried it and I know that the
*  response that's going to happen.
*  You've had raw liver before.
*  I've tried all sorts of like weird shit.
*  I worked in a restaurant for 10 years.
*  So like, I wasn't afraid to try it.
*  Right.
*  But like I, once I tried it and I was like, okay, this doesn't for me.
*  And yours are all from grass fed animals.
*  Yeah.
*  They're all grass fed grass finished animals from New Zealand.
*  And we're actually working really hard to develop a regenerative chain in the US.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  So that's in the pipeline.
*  Trying to do that with those folks at the, is it hope ranch?
*  Is that what you're saying?
*  Uh, white oak pastures and the one.
*  What's the one that's in?
*  Rome.
*  Rome.
*  Ranch.
*  Yeah.
*  How many should he take?
*  Like two or three or you want a water bro?
*  I got a water over here.
*  Okay.
*  All right.
*  All right.
*  That's a lot.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  We're going to talk to you in about an hour and 20 minutes, which is exactly how
*  long it takes mushrooms to kick in.
*  I'll do a six.
*  Six.
*  Okay.
*  Should I do eight?
*  Dude, do eight.
*  Do eight.
*  Go full.
*  You're fucking savage.
*  Come on.
*  Get after it.
*  Now, how much liver do you think I just ate there?
*  About an ounce.
*  About an ounce.
*  Yeah.
*  So that's about what you can get in those 68.
*  Pills.
*  Yeah.
*  If you, if it was a pure liver pill.
*  So this one is a beef organs pill.
*  So there's a little less, it's a little like a fifth of an ounce of every organ
*  because it's liver, heart, pancreas and spleen.
*  But what is your diet consist of?
*  Like, what is a daily, daily meal?
*  Like what do you eat on a regular basis?
*  So I eat twice a day.
*  I like to do intermittent fasting, but I like to do it earlier in the day.
*  So I like to eat my dinner quote at three or four o'clock and I eat
*  breakfast at eight or nine.
*  So I've got like an 18 hour eating window, 16 to 18 hour eating window, most
*  days.
*  And I, why do you do it that way?
*  Because I think there's some evidence or at least I think there's a little bit
*  of evidence, at least in diabetics.
*  And then personally, I've experienced better sleep when I finished eating
*  dinner earlier, melatonin and insulin do have a little bit of a contradictory
*  effect.
*  You know, if you eat late at night, is the insulin spike going to affect your
*  body's ability to release melatonin from the hypothalamus and actually initiate
*  sleep.
*  It's like, are you supposed to be eating right before you go to sleep?
*  I'm not sure.
*  I just thought, ah, it's easier to sleep if I eat earlier in the day.
*  What do you do if you're on a dinner date?
*  Oh, in that case, I'll, I'll eat later in the day.
*  I'll make an exception.
*  I'll make an exception, but, um, yeah.
*  So when I have total control over my, my, yeah, it's morning and I eat two meals
*  a day.
*  I don't really find that I need more than that.
*  And you exercise.
*  So when do you exercise?
*  I I've actually started doing a lot of the Pavel Sauceline grease, the groove
*  stuff.
*  Okay.
*  So I've got a little gym outside my house.
*  It's outdoors and I'll just go out probably three or four times a day and do
*  pull-ups, do some kettlebell swings, hit the punching bag for 10 or 15 minutes.
*  Multiple times.
*  If I do multiple, if I do like a big exercise, it could be any time stuck on
*  your thumb there.
*  Amazing.
*  It's like when you walk out of the bathroom and you have like a toilet paper on
*  cotton from your bottle.
*  So, uh, I do a lot of that Pavel stuff too.
*  I enjoy working out that way.
*  I think there's some real benefit to these long part.
*  Like sometimes I'll lift weights for two hours.
*  And the reason why I do it is I have these giant gaps in between my sets.
*  And then, you know, I drink a electrolyte drink, a drink liquid IV and watch some
*  fights and I it's a casual workout.
*  And then, but I'm still getting a lot of reps and a lot of work done, but after
*  the day is done, I feel great.
*  I don't feel completely crushed because I'm not trying to get my endurance in
*  that way.
*  I get my cardio in through other methods.
*  So that is just really just strength training.
*  And I've, I've actually gotten some good benefits from doing it that way.
*  I love the idea that he said when he was on your show.
*  You want to feel better after you work out than when you started.
*  Yeah, that's kind of cool.
*  And again, it's an ancestrally consistent, like, right.
*  Unless you were running away from a hippopotamus, you know, or a wild cow,
*  which we talked about before the podcast or something like you're, are you going
*  to like crush yourself?
*  That doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
*  Right.
*  The only way Tom makes sense, I think, is like endurance training.
*  Yeah.
*  There's some, like you have to kind of push your threshold.
*  Yeah.
*  When you're hunting, like persistence hunting or anything, you know, I mean,
*  David show was talking about that.
*  He was just running after the odds and he couldn't keep up and they were running
*  and running and running.
*  And you can imagine a long, you know, but I also wonder how fast they run.
*  So there's lots to learn there.
*  You know, I don't think they're sprinting or running six minute miles, maybe, but
*  maybe there's kind of like cruising along like ultra marathon pace.
*  I used to run ultras, but not anymore.
*  Did you really?
*  Yeah.
*  It was intense.
*  When did you stop doing that?
*  Uh, a number of years ago, it was too much for me.
*  It was like, this is, this is a lot.
*  It was, cause you know, you're running an ultra, you're like racing, you're
*  trying to go really hard.
*  I like long distance hiking though.
*  So when I was younger, I threw hike to the Pacific crest trail, which is one of
*  the coolest things I've ever done.
*  And I love that.
*  I love just like walking 30 miles a day more than I like running 30 miles a day.
*  Well, it's, it's interesting to me that there are people that thrive doing that
*  that they can do it.
*  Like my friend, Cameron Haynes, that fucking dude can run a marathon a day.
*  He does it all the time.
*  What is this staying fit?
*  Isn't a new year's resolution for these hunter gatherers.
*  Oh, that's the hot zone.
*  2017, they did a study where they strapped, uh, heart rate monitors on 200 or so,
*  198 different odds of men and women and track them to see what their
*  cardiovascular fitness was probably off the charts.
*  Um, their findings here.
*  Examination of blood pressure, cholesterol, and other biomarkers showed no evidence of
*  risk risk factors for cardiovascular disease.
*  Yeah.
*  They're probably super fit.
*  I mean, it makes sense.
*  It's kind of that low level activity throughout the day.
*  It just feels good for your brain too.
*  And I'll be at home working writing or answering emails or something.
*  And I don't want to do that for three hours.
*  I want to like do it for 45 minutes or an hour, get up, do some pull-ups, go outside,
*  breathe some air, go see the natural world, go outside barefoot and move around.
*  This is something that I want to discuss too.
*  Cardiovascular disease and heart attacks, the difference between the rate of
*  cardiovascular disease and heart attacks today versus like the early 1900s.
*  There's a giant spike, a big change.
*  Same as those other graphs.
*  We could, it would be essentially the same, the same reflection on the graph.
*  It would be an up angle that you would not want to skate, you know?
*  And it, and again, it's the question of what is driving this?
*  What is driving this?
*  Because we were eating more saturated fat in 1900.
*  We were eating way more saturated fat in 1800 or 1840.
*  And the only oils we used were animal fats, which are not entirely saturated.
*  They're about half mono and half saturated, half mono and saturated,
*  half saturated with a very small amount of polyunsaturated.
*  So to say that it's, to say that it's saturated fat driving this doesn't
*  make a whole lot of sense.
*  Again, this is just correlation, but there's no, there's not even a correlation there.
*  The correlation is with vegetable oil.
*  And if you get into this research, it's complex, but it's pretty darn striking.
*  If you look at linoleic acid, so, and you look at the molecule, it's polyunsaturated.
*  So it's a long chain carbon and polyunsaturation means it has
*  double bonds between the carbons.
*  And those double bonds can be oxidized.
*  Remember we talked about oxidation earlier and this
*  little formation of a lipid peroxides.
*  Well, those molecules, polyunsaturated fats, and even mono unsaturated fat,
*  any unsaturation point in a carbon skeleton molecule, like a chain, long
*  chain fatty acid is going to make it susceptible to oxidation and then
*  lipid peroxides, which are lipids that have had an electron stolen from that
*  double bond, then those are more susceptible to those are more reactive
*  with other lipids and they create these lipid peroxide reactions.
*  And then you're getting oxidative stress from the lipids.
*  And if you look at, so we should back up for a moment.
*  It goes back to what we were talking about earlier.
*  The reason, one of the reasons saturated fat has been thought of as bad for so
*  long is because it raises LDL, but if LDL is not de novo causing atherosclerosis,
*  then we have a whole different equation.
*  Well, let's, let's get into that because this is one of the big questions that I
*  got when I told people I was going to eat an animal only diet for a month.
*  They're like, what about your cholesterol?
*  What are you going to do about your, and I'll be like, and I try to tell them
*  that dietary cholesterol does not raise cholesterol in your blood lipids.
*  And they just glaze over and they're like, well, you know, you're taking
*  in a lot of cholesterol and it's just, most people don't have the time to
*  research this or to get into the weeds and to try to shift their perception
*  about what cholesterol is about the, the benefits of cholesterol, the necessity
*  of cholesterol for the human diet, for production of hormones.
*  So let's get into that LDL and HDL.
*  What is the difference?
*  So LDL is low density lipoprotein and it's formed from VLDL after it becomes
*  IDL, which is intermediate density lipoprotein.
*  So when you eat fat in your diet, it is generally in triglycerides form,
*  which is packaged into molecules called chylomicrons, which move from
*  the intestines to the liver in the liver cholesterol, which is actually a
*  steroid backbone molecule is packaged with triglycerides into a VLDL, a very
*  low density lipoprotein particle.
*  It's like a bus.
*  It moves triglycerides and cholesterol around the body because they're
*  nutrients, because they're essential for human life, because like you said,
*  hormones are made from a cholesterol backbone.
*  And if you did not have cholesterol, you would be very sick and die.
*  There's a genetic condition called Smith-Lemley-Oppitt syndrome, which is a,
*  a mutation in one of the enzymes that makes cholesterol.
*  It's pretty far down in the pathway, but a lot of these kids die in utero.
*  Those that are born have severe retardation, both mental and physical.
*  They're extremely resistant.
*  They're extremely susceptible to infections and they have a lot of
*  problems with sleep and diabetes and other issues because they don't make
*  cholesterol, they have extremely low LDL because they can't make cholesterol
*  in the liver and probably in peripheral tissues either.
*  And so the way we treat these kids is with egg yolks.
*  We just give them tons and tons of dietary cholesterol and hopes that that
*  will be some sort of a supplement that they can use to make LDL as their LDL
*  goes up, they do better.
*  They're never going to have a normal life, but there are so many studies
*  that point to the value of low density lipoprotein.
*  And if we just think about it evolutionarily, why would nature, why
*  would evolution have designed a particle that kills us within our body that at
*  the same time, defends us from infection.
*  So there are good studies in animal models that show that if you knock out
*  the LDL receptor in mice and rats, the levels of LDL in the blood drop a lot.
*  And those mice and rats are protected against infections so they can infuse
*  bacteria, gram-negative bacteria into those rats and the higher levels of
*  LDL are protective in those studies.
*  And the same thing has been true in human.
*  You can look for this correlation.
*  So this is epidemiology.
*  At some point we should definitely talk about why that's not, why epidemiology
*  can be so misleading, but higher levels of cholesterol are correlated with lower
*  admission to the hospital for infectious complications.
*  And we definitely see in animal models and essentially with humans with the
*  Smith-Lemley-Opitz genetic model, that lower levels of cholesterol predisposed
*  to infection because LDL, lower levels of serum cholesterol, meaning low density
*  lipoprotein, predisposed to infection because that low density lipoprotein
*  particle is part of the immune system.
*  And so is HDL.
*  So HDL is high density lipoprotein.
*  It leaves the liver as kind of an empty bus.
*  LDL leaves the liver as VLDL, a full bus drops off people along the way, becomes a
*  less full bus.
*  VLDL becomes LDL.
*  HDL is an empty bus that goes along the body, picking things up and then returning
*  to the liver.
*  But HDL and LDL both have roles in the immune system.
*  So why do we think that a molecule, a lipoprotein particle that serves an
*  indispensable role in human biochemistry or at least human physiology is killing us?
*  That's just the first step.
*  Can I stop you there?
*  What is the standard model?
*  Like what do people believe?
*  Like if you asked a doctor that doesn't have a lot of nutrition training about
*  HDL and LDL, what would they tell you?
*  At a very high level, they would say HDL is good.
*  LDL is bad.
*  You want less LDL and you want more HDL.
*  Why would they say that?
*  Because there's something called the lipid hypothesis.
*  And the lipid hypothesis is that essentially in a concentration dependent
*  manner, LDL ends up in the arterial wall.
*  Okay.
*  This is the lipid hypothesis.
*  I disagree with this.
*  I think it's an incomplete hypothesis.
*  And so they would say, if you have more LDL, it's just going to kind of leak into
*  your arterial wall because it naturally gets taken up.
*  And as more LDL ends up in your artery wall, you get more atherosclerosis and more plaque.
*  What's the root of this hypothesis?
*  It's a lot of epidemiology, Mendelian randomizations and genome wide association
*  studies.
*  So this is really interesting.
*  We should dig into this.
*  So if you look at, um, if you look at basic epidemiology, so let's just
*  think about epidemiology.
*  You've talked about this on the show before, but I want to define this for people.
*  So epidemiology is essentially an observational study.
*  There's no experiment done.
*  They're giving people surveys and they're either following them moving forward,
*  prospective, or they're looking back at what they've done in the past.
*  A retrospective study.
*  And so epidemiology can generate correlations, but we cannot draw
*  causative inference from that data.
*  We can have a correlation, which we then test with an interventional study.
*  LDL is kind of tusks with tough to test with an interventional study, but there's
*  some really cool stuff here that starts to break it down.
*  If you look at overall cohorts of people.
*  So if you look at the Framingham study, for instance, and you look at LDL on the
*  X axis and incidence of cardiovascular disease on the Y axis, actually have two
*  graphs of this that I'll show you.
*  That'll make, that'll make it really, um, helpful to break it down.
*  Um, so if you look at those two and you don't do anything to, this
*  isn't the lipids and CVD folder, Jamie, you see that CAC LDL only graphic.
*  So if you look at this, this is the basic data from Framingham.
*  Okay.
*  This is correlation.
*  This is epidemiology, increasing risk of cardiovascular disease on the, on the
*  Y axis, LDL on the X axis.
*  Okay.
*  So it's things like this that make people say, Oh yeah, LDL it's probably
*  causing atherosclerosis, which is the formation of plaque within the arterial wall.
*  But go to the other one, Jamie, CAC LDL HDL.
*  So this is the exact same data stratified by a third variable.
*  And this is what is never considered with LDL.
*  In my opinion, the lipid hypothesis is flawed because it's incomplete.
*  It misses the third variable or fourth variable in this, in this stratification.
*  We've looked at HDL.
*  We've looked at the quote, good cholesterol, which we really don't know a
*  whole lot about probably on immune participant, but HDL levels do correlate
*  with metabolic health synonymous with insulin resistance.
*  So what can we say about these people?
*  This is the exact same data that I've split into four, four lines here.
*  Those with the lowest level of HDL are the most metabolically unhealthy.
*  These are the most obese, the most likely to have coronary, the most likely to have
*  diabetes, the most likely to have insulin resistance.
*  You can see they have a pretty good risk of a relative risk of cardiovascular
*  disease as LDL increases, but look at the bottom, look at the people who are
*  most insulin sensitive, there's essentially no correlation or the correlation is
*  massively different between people with a high HDL, good metabolic health and
*  LDL increasing.
*  Does that make sense?
*  Sword.
*  It says increasing LDL is very little increase in the cardiovascular
*  disease risk with high HDL.
*  Yeah.
*  So as you increase your LDL, as long as you have high HDL, increasing
*  LDL has very little risk, very little cardiac risk.
*  And we see that over and over and over.
*  In studies just have high LDL and low HDL.
*  Then you probably have diabetes.
*  And in that case you have, then you're in trouble.
*  So the issue is not LDL it's low HDL.
*  Well, the issue, a low HDL is reflective of an underlying pathology, which is
*  metabolic dysfunction and or insulin resistance.
*  The issue is insulin resistance, metabolic dysfunction.
*  So we're using HDL level as a proxy for metabolic health here.
*  What is an optimal ratio of LDL to HDL?
*  Yes.
*  I actually, it's, it's tricky because there's a whole group of people now.
*  Right.
*  So I have a good friend, Dave Feldman, who's doing, he's an engineer, super smart
*  guy, doing a lot of really cool work on this.
*  And they're actually about to start a study with lean mass hyper responders
*  within the space, the carnivore ketogenic space.
*  There are people who begin eating this way and they see their LDL go up significantly.
*  So some people don't see LDL rise, but I did.
*  I have a pretty high quote LDL.
*  And so within the space, there's a lot of people with high LDLs who look like me.
*  Pretty fit, active, don't have chest pain.
*  Don't believe I have cardiovascular disease.
*  We can talk about my blood work and what I've done to confirm that.
*  But there's a whole group of people called lean mass hyper responders.
*  And Dave's hypothesis, which I agree with completely is that elevated LDL,
*  alone is too simplistic a metric.
*  Mainstream medicine gets hyper focused on LDL or more specifically APO-B, which is
*  a proxy again for the number of LDL particles.
*  That's too simplistic because I think there's context here.
*  And the context is that I don't believe there's sufficient evidence to say that
*  high LDL in somebody that's metabolically healthy is the same as high LDL in
*  somebody that's metabolically unhealthy.
*  There's a third variable.
*  We have to think about multiple variables because there's a context.
*  And it makes sense, right?
*  There are other things that are like this.
*  Uric acid is a good example too.
*  Incidentally, both LDL and uric acid rise when humans fast.
*  So if you stop eating, your LDL is going to go up.
*  And that's been demonstrated multiple times in studies.
*  Fasting raises LDL.
*  They've even shown this in hibernating bears.
*  Hibernating bears see, have a rise in LDL, but they don't develop atherosclerosis
*  over the course of their hibernation period.
*  There's actually a screenshot at the bottom in the lipid CVD folder, Jamie, and
*  I'll pull up, there's another study here with the hibernating bear study.
*  It's pretty fascinating.
*  The bears athero hibernation.
*  And so we see this over and over in humans that fasting raises LDL, fasting
*  raises uric acid, but fasting people who fast, people who do ketogenic diets,
*  they don't get gout.
*  They don't get atherosclerosis in quite the same way, or at least that's
*  the hypothesis.
*  Certainly bears don't.
*  And we have strange that fasting would raise LDL.
*  It does until you think about LDL as a nutrient, a nutrient carrier.
*  So Dave is developing something called the lipid energy model.
*  And I want to give him all credit for this.
*  I've actually got a set of slides that'll probably make it clear when I talk about,
*  but Dave's hypothesis is that if you are burning mostly fat as energy, and even
*  somebody that eats some carbohydrates can be burning mostly fat as energy, you are
*  going to be moving more LDL in your blood to move that fat around.
*  And we certainly know that interventions can do that.
*  And it makes sense when you fast, you're depleting liver glycogen, your ketones are
*  going up and you are burning fat.
*  You're not burning as much glucose.
*  You're burning more fat.
*  Your free fatty acids are going to go up.
*  Your, your LDL is going to go up.
*  And so you kind of scratch your head there.
*  At least I did and looked at this and thought, are you telling me that in
*  something that would happen routinely for humans fasting, like we talked about
*  intermittent fasting, unsuccessful hunts, that's killing us in a way that's
*  causing atherosclerosis.
*  That doesn't make any sense.
*  And it certainly doesn't happen in bears and other hibernating mammals.
*  So LDL will rise in response to fasting.
*  LDL seems to rise in response to what we choose to burn as our primary fuel.
*  Now there's still, we're still kind of trying to figure this out.
*  Dave's had, he just texted me this morning.
*  He's like, I've got all this really great data.
*  He's almost ready to share it.
*  It's super interesting stuff, but the whole idea of what LDL is doing in the
*  human body, I think has been misconstrued and misunderstood.
*  Again, the lipid hypothesis would say the more LDL, the more atherosclerosis.
*  Well, if that's the case, if, and it's kind of tied into that model is the
*  notion that LDL must cause atherosclerosis de novo or in and of itself,
*  because if more LDL equals atherosclerosis, then LDL is causing atherosclerosis.
*  I don't think anyone who subscribes to the lipid energy model is going to debate
*  that. But if LDL causes atherosclerosis de novo, why don't we get atherosclerosis
*  in veins? Why do we only get atherosclerosis in arteries?
*  There's the same amount of LDL throughout our body, veins and arteries are a
*  contiguous system.
*  And so why are we developing plaque in arteries, but not veins?
*  And that's, we never see plaque in veins unless they are transplanted into the
*  arterial system.
*  So there's clearly more things going on.
*  And in the case of arteries versus veins, the prevailing hypothesis is that it's
*  endothelial damage.
*  So the inside of a, the inside of a blood vessel is the endothelium and something
*  has to damage the endothelium for this to happen.
*  It seems in higher pressure systems, the arteries seem to damage the endothelium
*  and this network of glycoproteins on the surface of the endothelium called the
*  glycocalyx. And that doesn't happen in veins.
*  They're lower pressure. At least this is one hypothesis, but for LDL to cause
*  atherosclerosis in and of itself, it just doesn't seem to be, it doesn't seem to
*  work. And studies like that with Framingham make me think there's a third
*  variable. So if you look at the general population, sure, you might see a
*  correlation between LDL and cardiovascular disease.
*  But if you look at it a little more precisely or a little more carefully,
*  you start to separate out those who are metabolically healthy, which granted is
*  the minority from those who are metabolically unwell.
*  If the majority of people in our society are metabolically unwell, of course,
*  it looks like there's a correlation.
*  But what about this group over here?
*  You and me who are metabolically healthy, if our LDL goes up, is that going to
*  cause atherosclerosis?
*  I think the evidence for that is paltry at best and is not there.
*  And I think that we are eating a diet that we believe to be ancestrally
*  consistent. Why would that kill us? Right.
*  And so one of the things that I've done, so I have an elevated LDL.
*  I will freely admit that. My HDL is also very high.
*  I have all my labs if you want to see them.
*  What would happen? Can I just stop you here?
*  What would happen if you went into a cardiologist?
*  Like if you went into a cardiologist, you said, Doc, I'm feeling great, but don't
*  tell them shit to say, but I just like to get my blood work done.
*  Get it. Get a little checkup. Tell me what you think I should do.
*  They would fall out of their chair when they saw my lipids. They would say that.
*  Is it? What is the number?
*  It's high. So and the re and so the the LDL
*  has been above 300 for 300 milligrams per deciliter, which is essentially a
*  density measure for all two years that I have done a carnivore diet before that.
*  I don't have familial hypercholesterolemia though,
*  but my LDL is as high as people with homozygous that you say you don't have.
*  What was that?
*  Familial hypercholesterolemia.
*  That means it's not your family. It's not a genetic thing.
*  There are, there's about 2000 plus genetic polymorphisms that actually result in a
*  high LDL independent of diet, right? And they change lipid metabolism.
*  Okay. So this is really important. The problem, a lot of people,
*  a lot of proponents of the lipid hypothesis would say,
*  look at people with familial hypercholesterolemia.
*  They get accelerated atherosclerosis.
*  The problem is that in order to get an elevated LDL,
*  you had to disorder normal lipid metabolism within the framework of healthy.
*  That is non-disordered lipid metabolism.
*  There's no evidence that elevated LDL leads to atherosclerosis.
*  So in my case, my most recent LDL was very high.
*  It was 533 milligrams per deciliter.
*  What's normal?
*  Uh, less than a hundred or around a hundred.
*  So a hundred is preferred.
*  Preferred by the mainstream cardiologist, right? Now, again, I can pull up labs.
*  Are there any cardiologists that agree with you? There are. Okay. Yeah.
*  I've had a number of them on my podcast.
*  There's definitely cardiologists who do not subscribe to the lipid hypothesis.
*  Certainly the majority do.
*  And any mainstream doctors who are hearing this are just wanting to throw
*  daggers at me right now.
*  It seems like there's a,
*  that's got to be very controversial if you're a cardiologist that follows your
*  line of thinking.
*  Yeah, I think it is,
*  but I think it's gaining traction because what often happens is people will do
*  that. They'll go into their cardiologist and they'll,
*  and the cardiologist look at them and say, Frank, you look great.
*  You've lost 20 pounds. Your diabetes is better.
*  I mean nothing but margin bike.
*  Right? No, but then they'll say, let's say, and they'll say, great.
*  And they say, doc, I feel good. And they says, Oh wait,
*  but your LDL is too high. You got to change anything. And then they won't,
*  they won't tell me anything. And they'll say, Oh, I'm eating meat. Oh,
*  you got to change that.
*  Whatever you did that cured your diabetes, cause all this weight loss.
*  That couldn't, that's,
*  that's bad for you because your LDL has gone high because we have this myopic
*  LDL centric perspective that excludes the contextual variables,
*  metabolic dysfunction, metabolic health, insulin sensitivity, insulin resistance.
*  How did that gain such prevalence? Like why, why is that so,
*  why is that so universally agreed upon by so many cardiologists?
*  I think it's because, um, it's hard to say.
*  So before I went to medical school,
*  I was actually a physician assistant and I worked in cardiology for four years.
*  And I think it's a lot of what we are taught in medicine is all we know,
*  right? We're taught this is the model. And if you look at it, there are,
*  there is evidence, there is correlational evidence that shows the lower,
*  the LDL, the lower the incidence of heart disease,
*  but it misses the context.
*  And if you start to put in the contextual variables, the model breaks down.
*  And so I think it's just, it's been parroted over and over and over.
*  And the prevailing thinking is just, this is what it is. This is what it is.
*  But there certainly are cardiologists.
*  I've had three or four cardiologists on my podcast that don't,
*  don't subscribe to this model. And there's a lot of them out there.
*  A lot of my friends and colleagues in the medical world are skeptical of this
*  model.
*  So I'll finish my story because I talked about my super high LDL.
*  Before we get to that, these doctors that don't prescribe to that model,
*  it seems to me that if you're going to step outside the mainstream,
*  it's kind of a precarious route.
*  And would they be hesitant to do so if you're dealing with
*  non-metabolically healthy people?
*  So would they make the distinction like, Hey, I'm looking at you, Paul,
*  you look very fit. You're, you're lean. You exercise. You look,
*  you look great. Your LDL is high. Your HDL is high,
*  but all the other biomarkers are excellent.
*  Or would they look at a guy who's fat, who doesn't have a good diet,
*  who's not metabolically healthy, but also has high LDL?
*  Will they treat them differently?
*  Absolutely. Okay.
*  Absolutely. Because these cardiologists are savvy enough to understand context.
*  So if, if, if,
*  if you go to a cardiologist and they don't check fasting insulin or hemoglobin
*  A1C, or put a continuous glucose monitor on you, they're missing the context.
*  And so these are just laboratory markers that give you a sense of your
*  metabolic health. And so absolutely these,
*  these colleagues of mine would treat those people completely differently
*  because it's context, right?
*  The way that I've talked about in the past is just this analogy.
*  If you have dry wood for the winter in your garage,
*  it's not just going to spark a fire, right? Dry wood can be good.
*  You can build things with it. You can build a house with dry wood.
*  LDL can be good in the absence of metabolic dysfunction.
*  It has all these roles. It's protective in the immune system.
*  It moves nutrients around the body.
*  So do you think that it is detrimental in the presence of metabolic dysfunction?
*  It looks that way. Yes. Yes. So it's all about the context.
*  So LDL is getting wrapped in and people have said, LDL is not the arsonist.
*  It's the firefighter who shows up to quell the blaze.
*  And that's kind of a complicated analogy, but you get the idea.
*  Like a policeman shows up at the scene of a crime.
*  Does that mean he committed the crime?
*  Because there is evidence that LDL ends up in atherosclerotic plaque.
*  And so there's both pathology, you know,
*  pathologic evidence and you know, this epidemiology evidence.
*  But when you bring in the contextual variable, it starts to break down.
*  What do you think does cause that plaque then if it's not LDL?
*  It's the fact that in the setting of metabolic dysfunction, the LDL,
*  and this is just my hypothesis, right? I don't think anyone knows this.
*  The LDL perhaps gets retained. So LDL is a lipoprotein.
*  I think it moves in and out of the endothelium into the sub endothelial space freely.
*  And there's something about there's potentially something about the LDL
*  moving into that sub endothelial space, getting retained in that sub endothelial space.
*  So if you were to take a blood vessel and cut it, you know,
*  lengthwise and look down at like a tube, there's multiple layers.
*  Look, I got more foam here. So distracting for Joe.
*  You know, there's multiple layers, right? The innermost layer,
*  if the blood's in here, the innermost layer is the endothelium.
*  Below that is the intima and then the sub mucosal layer and the adventitia.
*  And just below the endothelium are immune cells called macrophages.
*  And what appears to happen with atherosclerosis is that the,
*  the LDL particles get retained in there for some reason.
*  And the macrophages kind of pick them up. They eat them. They endocytose them.
*  They phagocytose them.
*  And so they kind of eat these LDL particles potentially as, you know,
*  they're trying to take care of something that could be problematic.
*  And then they become foam cells.
*  They get full of more and more lipid and that's the beginning of a fatty streak.
*  And again, this is very high level basic stuff. It's not, um,
*  it's a little more complex, but there's something going on.
*  I think at the level of that sub entoma, that endothelium,
*  the sub endothelial space that these macrophages are not responding properly to
*  LDL or the LDL looks damaged.
*  And so now you start to get into ideas of oxidized LDL versus native LDL and
*  what causes LDL to oxidize. Well,
*  there's good evidence that excess linoleic acid in the diet might be doing it.
*  X-X oxidative stress might be doing it. Or at the level of the macrophage,
*  when you have metabolic dysfunction, it's broadly disordered insulin signaling.
*  Is there a correlation between arterial plaque increase
*  and increase in vegetable oils?
*  Yeah. Well, I mean, there's a correlation. Yeah. We could draw the same graphs.
*  Yeah.
*  So what you're saying about LDL and HDL,
*  is this something that you've ever debated with a cardiologist
*  that, you know,
*  follows the mainstream ideas of what is good or bad about HDL and HDL?
*  There's a family doc who's going to come on my podcast soon that I'm planning to
*  debate about it. I think he's open to the ideas, but yeah,
*  it would be interesting to debate these guys.
*  Yeah.
*  I would like to see someone who hardcore disagrees with you on this because I'm
*  too dumb to know who's right.
*  I think it'd be super fun to talk to those guys and, you know,
*  have all the studies up and stuff, but you can find studies.
*  So there are studies and I've got these on the folder again.
*  I'll put all these studies on the website so that people can find all this stuff
*  if they want to dig into it.
*  There are studies that show that the more linoleic acid you eat,
*  the more enriched in linoleic acid your LDL particles become,
*  and then the more oxidized your LDL particles become. And if you decrease LDL,
*  if you decrease linoleic acid, there's a decrease in the oxidation of the LDL
*  particles.
*  So there's a lot of kind of pieces that look like the dots are connecting.
*  It's pretty compelling.
*  So all LDL is not created equal.
*  All LDL is not created equal and even mainstream lipidologists.
*  So I recently heard a podcast between two folks who are pretty prominent in the
*  lipid community. And even they were admitting, and they're, they're proponents.
*  I believe they are proponents. I don't want words in their mouth of the lipid
*  hypothesis.
*  And even they were admitting that the quality of the LDL particle matters.
*  And as soon as you introduce quality of the LDL particle,
*  you introduce that third variable.
*  And what determines the quality of the LDL particle? It's the context.
*  It's our overall metabolic health as humans. And we cannot,
*  and we should not be looking at lab markers or metrics in isolation as humans
*  for, I know that cardiologists are intelligent and well-meaning,
*  but I fear that within the medical establishment,
*  we're just myopically looking at LDL.
*  And I worked in cardiology for four years as a physician assistant before I went
*  back to medical school and did a second resident, did my residency and all this
*  stuff. So like, we're very LDL centric and it's becoming,
*  it's becoming more and more ensconced.
*  Like it's just all about lowering APOB, which essentially means lowering LDL.
*  And I just don't think that's the right thing for people.
*  If someone is not willing to make dietary lifestyle change, yes,
*  you probably should lower APOB. But if,
*  if we are telling people the full truth in my opinion, it is, Hey,
*  your lifestyle is causing this. Do you want to, and here's how you should eat.
*  Now the problem there is that the mainstream medical establishment is so
*  hung up on the fact that saturated fat raises LDL,
*  that they can't possibly recommend the animal foods that people should be
*  eating. So they don't even know what to tell people.
*  They'll tell people eat more vegetable oil, which is the wrong thing.
*  And there are some really good studies.
*  The Minnesota coronary experiment and the Sydney diet heart study were pretty
*  fantastic studies. I've got them both in the notes here. If you want to see them,
*  Chris Ramsden, who is the investigator on both of those,
*  or at least the second publication of both of these is national here in my
*  opinion. But in the Minnesota coronary experiment, they were randomized.
*  It's a randomized interventional trial.
*  And it's a blinded trial where they had one group that was higher saturated fat
*  and one group that was higher polyunsaturated fat and the polyunsaturated
*  fat diet clearly did worse, clearly did worse. More heart disease, more death,
*  more cancer.
*  That's the other thing about polyunsaturated fat is there are a lot of
*  signals for increased cancer.
*  The city diet heart showed exactly the same thing.
*  More polyunsaturated fat, more death, more cardiovascular disease,
*  more cancer. So it's, it's,
*  there's some interventional studies that are pretty hard to ignore,
*  just putting them head to head. And yet, because we are so myopic,
*  because we are so focused on LDL and we don't think about context or metabolic
*  health, how could a physician recommend tallow?
*  Well, just breaking down all the shit that you've said in this podcast is giving
*  people a headache right now. I guarantee you, they're listening to this.
*  And most folks who would just say to me, if I said,
*  I'm eating only meat. Well, what about your cholesterol?
*  They really don't know any of this stuff. So it's,
*  they have a tiny piece of information in their head. Cholesterol equals bad.
*  You put that in their heart attacks, heart disease. You're going to die.
*  You're going to die. You're eating like that. You're going to die.
*  Well, why do I feel so good?
*  Why do you kick so much? Why did you lose weight?
*  Why did your vitiligo get better? Why did you have energy throughout the day?
*  It's weird. It's very weird.
*  Back to your lab results. Your lab results are very high.
*  You have high HDL, high LDL,
*  and low triglycerides. What about arterial plaque? Zero.
*  So now there are a lot of people who would criticize this finding, but I mean,
*  zero, zero. And I'll tell you, so it's with a CAC.
*  So it's a coronary artery calcium score. It's a CT scan of the heart.
*  It's not a perfect test, but it's a pretty darn good test.
*  So Dave and his colleagues are doing a study where they're going to do CTA,
*  which is CT coronary angiogram.
*  And I'm going to try and be a part of that study as well.
*  They're going to take people who are lean mass hyper responders.
*  They just got all the funding for it, I think.
*  And they're going to do CT coronary angiogram one year apart.
*  So what's interesting here, Joe, is that for kids with familial hypercholesterolemia,
*  now again, granted, they're disordered lipid metabolism,
*  disordered lipid metabolism. They're not healthy lipid metabolism, right?
*  So they don't look quite like me. They have a high LDL,
*  but their LDL metabolism doesn't work properly.
*  They develop atherosclerosis within the first few years of their life. Okay.
*  And they have LDL levels that are equivalent to mine. Now,
*  I've had an LDL above 300 for more than two years.
*  I also have a family history of early heart disease and a primary relative.
*  My dad had a heart attack when he was 43. So I'm 43.
*  My dad had a heart attack when he was 43.
*  So I have risk factors for coronary artery disease.
*  What was your dad's diet like and what was his lifestyle like?
*  Oh, I mean, he was, he was an internist. So he was not sleeping well.
*  He was not eating well. He didn't think about this at all. He didn't know.
*  And that's what's so ironic is my dad is such a role model for me, you know,
*  amazing guy. He was texting me,
*  I was excited I was coming on the podcast today and he's such an amazing guy.
*  And he meant so well for his patients.
*  But I just don't think that mainstream medicine thought about this contextual
*  stuff.
*  Is he following your diet?
*  He's not,
*  but he did wear a CGM and I think he's going to try and move his diet in the
*  right direction when he sees what his post-prandial or after eating blood
*  sugars are.
*  What kind of diet is he on?
*  It's getting better and better,
*  but I saw a part of his dietary recall from the folks at Nutrisense,
*  which is the company that does the CGM. And it was,
*  he was eating grass fed meat.
*  He takes the desiccated Oregon supplements and he's eating some white rice.
*  And I think he had like some banana bread.
*  And the thing I keep trying to get him to stop is eating glucerna or vegetable
*  oil because he's eating these weight loss shakes that have soybean oil in them.
*  And you know,
*  I need to see he hasn't shared with me his CGM and I want to be respectful.
*  And if he will share with me his continuous glucose monitoring,
*  we can look at his metabolic health because I'm not going to order blood work
*  from my dad, but I can look at his continuous glucose monitor.
*  Like this is the kind of stuff that really tells you about your metabolic
*  health. There's no way to lie with a continuous glucose monitor.
*  And so I think that he has some room to improve, but it's slow.
*  He helped me like edit the book.
*  I think he was so proud when I wrote the book and just so excited that I was
*  thinking this way.
*  It was so interesting to have this traditionally trained father,
*  this internist read my book and go, Whoa, that's kind of interesting, Paul.
*  I mean, he's reading the chapter on lipids going,
*  this isn't what I learned. Maybe, maybe there's more I should be thinking about.
*  So we've had a lot of conversations and I mean, one of the reasons,
*  the whole reason I think about this stuff, Joe,
*  is because I want people that I care about to be around.
*  And then I want to be able to share that with other people so that they can
*  experience their life better.
*  What are you going to tell him about the diarrhea?
*  The disaster pants.
*  Cause there is a diarrhea that you get from the carnivore diet that I only got
*  for the, for the first like two weeks or so,
*  but my friend Tom's a girl tried it and his words were, it's astonishing.
*  He says, this diarrhea is astonishing. I go, dude, it's no joke.
*  I took some photos of my toilet bowl and it looks like a goblin threw up in
*  there. I mean, just, just black tar. It was crazy.
*  Yeah. So what is that?
*  So there's physiologic changes in the human gut that happen when you stop fiber
*  abruptly. So we don't know entirely,
*  but I think that the most compelling theory that I've heard or been able to
*  come up with is it has to do with bile salts. And you know, you,
*  we talked about the bile earlier in the gallbladder and you know,
*  putting it on liver. So your bile is in your liver on your right upper quadrant.
*  And when you eat meat or fat, your bile contracts,
*  there's hormones, cholecystokinin, you release bile.
*  Bile is a combination of cholesterol, bile salts, bilirubin,
*  and bile salts are supposed to be reabsorbed in your small intestine.
*  So, you know, you have this stomach, a duodenum, a dejunum, an ilium,
*  which is your small intestine.
*  Then you have the iliocecal valve and the large intestine.
*  The large intestine is like the colon, right?
*  And the colon goes up and over and down. And so the,
*  if bile acids end up in the colon, they are cathartic,
*  meaning they will cause diarrhea.
*  And so I think that for the majority of people,
*  if they are going to do a transition from a fiber full diet to a zero fiber or
*  a lower fiber diet, you want to do it slowly.
*  Because I think that in the small intestine,
*  the small intestine needs to catch up and reabsorb these bile acids.
*  If the bile acids move through the iliocecal valve into the colon,
*  they'll cause diarrhea. And so your body takes time.
*  And so I think what happened in your case, cause I was following it closely.
*  I was texting Mark Bell. I was texting Mark Bell. I was like,
*  Joe's having diarrhea. See, I mean, if he just send him this information,
*  maybe it'll help him, you know?
*  And what can you do to mitigate it?
*  You would, you would want to train, you would want to go slowly on the fiber.
*  So when I work with people and they get the diarrhea,
*  I have them add back avocado or something with a little bit of fiber to help,
*  because the fiber will bind up the bile acids a little bit. But in your case,
*  it sounded like what happened was something adjusted and eventually stopped.
*  And my suspicion is that the small intestine eventually catches up and says,
*  Hey, there's more bile acids. I'm going to reabsorb them.
*  They don't end up in the colon.
*  It was a dangerous two weeks. It was very,
*  a little bit of avocado would have gone a long way, I think, for you.
*  I got through some podcasts where I was like, boy,
*  I barely made it out of there.
*  I saw some of those where I ran out of the room.
*  Like clenching my butt cheeks, like I'm trying to make a diamond,
*  ran out of the room.
*  And so again, that's why I think there's a lot of ways to do this. You know,
*  it's not that I don't think the only way to benefit from the things we're
*  talking about is to go a hundred percent carnivore. I think it's, you know,
*  understand that meat and organs are critically important.
*  Understand there's toxicity of plant foods on a spectrum. And if,
*  if a little bit of fiber helps you get through that, do that, you know?
*  And if a little bit of fiber doesn't bother you, don't do it.
*  But for a lot of people,
*  the complete elimination of fiber in their diets really helpful.
*  It's a really amazing thing how many people say less gas, less bloating,
*  even less constipation when they remove fiber. So,
*  but a little bit of fiber can go a long way in that sort of transitional
*  disaster pants phase.
*  The common perception of fiber is that it's essential
*  and that it cleans out your body and that to live without fiber,
*  you're going to get constipated. You're going to have all these problems.
*  Why is that not true?
*  There's so the fiber is such an interesting thing. So it's, it's,
*  none of it's true. If you actually look at the medical literature,
*  there's no evidence that fiber improves constipation.
*  So fiber can give you bigger poops, but there's good meta analysis.
*  There's interventional studies that show that fiber doesn't relieve the other
*  symptoms of constipation, which are pain, difficulty with passage, bleeding,
*  constipation sucks. Nobody wants that,
*  but fiber will give you bigger poops that are usually more painful to pass.
*  And fiber also causes a ton of gas and bloating for people.
*  There's a really fascinating study from 2012.
*  It's an interventional study with fiber and they had three groups of people.
*  I think it's 60 people. They divide them into three groups of 20,
*  and they all had idiopathic constipation.
*  So the doctor doesn't know why you're backed up. One group fiber as normal,
*  one group moderate fiber, one group zero fiber, which group did the best?
*  Zero fiber. How many people resolved idiopathic constipation?
*  A hundred percent. What? A hundred percent.
*  Jamie, it's in the constipation. Zero fiber. Jamie,
*  it's in the constipation folder. What is the cause of constipation?
*  It's complicated. I don't think it's the fiber constipation. Oh,
*  not the meta. It's the, uh, let's see,
*  stopping fiber constipation in the constipation folder. Yeah.
*  So you see.
*  Stopping or reducing dietary fiber intake reduces constipation.
*  It's associated symptoms. That's bananas.
*  So constipation is probably multifactorial. Um,
*  it probably has to do with dysbiosis, the overgrowth of the wrong type of
*  organisms. I think it's potentially inflammatory in the gut, but in,
*  in these, this interventional study, it completely reversed it in these people.
*  Well, when I was drinking kale shakes for a while, I was drinking kale shakes.
*  In the morning. And it has similar effect to, uh,
*  the carnivore diet in the first two weeks. Like it just, woo.
*  It opened up the canyon and, uh,
*  lubed up the old water slide and things are just flying out of me.
*  Maybe not a good thing. Well, I think it was also,
*  I was doing it with MCT oil and I was,
*  I was adding fruits and all sorts of other stuff to the kale shake,
*  but I thought I was doing the right thing and I was feeling pretty good while
*  I was doing it, but, um, not,
*  absolutely not as good as I did when I went to the carnivore diet. I just,
*  I think I was getting this burst of carbohydrates and sugars and nutrients
*  and, uh, and also I was feeling good.
*  I was thinking because the poop was coming out so easy and quickly,
*  I was like, this has gotta be good. It's cleaning out the old pipes.
*  Cause that's what you want, right? You just want to clean them out.
*  But I mean, that's what I was thinking of my thought process was like all that
*  fibrous plant materials, just scraping them, scrubbing them,
*  like a little tarwars. That's not how it works at all.
*  There's so much interesting stuff about fiber, but I'll tell you, you know,
*  I was a vegan. I was a raw vegan, um,
*  for seven months when I was a physician assistant.
*  And I want to take this opportunity to apologize to the people I shared an
*  office with because I was such an old factory nightmare.
*  Oh, you farted so bad, Joe.
*  Well you're, you're breaking down and fermenting all these things inside your gut.
*  Right? It was just every, I mean, people couldn't even be around me.
*  You couldn't hold it in.
*  Oh, I see. There's only so many farts you can hold in
*  before your intestines explode, man. They're that bad. They're that bad.
*  I mean, I always hoped, you know,
*  that if you just hold your farts and they would come out as burps and it never
*  worked and never worked. And then when I was a vegan,
*  I lost 25 pounds of muscle mass and all kinds of other issues.
*  25 pounds from where you are now. Yeah. Wow. You must've been very, very thin.
*  Very skinny. So I'm 170 to 175 now and I was around 140.
*  So even maybe 30 pounds, 30 pounds of muscle mass.
*  How did you feel? Not great.
*  And you did it for health because you thought it was a good thing to do.
*  Yeah. So it was the beginning of my medical career.
*  It was probably 15 years ago. I hadn't read the literature.
*  And the ideas are interesting, right? Right. The ideas are interesting.
*  Meat causes problems. This is a pure diet. It's not cooked.
*  It's what our ancestors have eaten, except these are the far too back ancestors.
*  Yeah. There's a lot of people that think that going, you know,
*  air quotes, plant based is the move for heart health for,
*  for, you know, to, to be a healthy person. And my friend, CT Fletcher, he, uh,
*  is a powerlifter and he, um, had a terrible diet at one point in time.
*  It wound up having a heart disease and it runs in his family.
*  And he had to get a heart transplant. Yeah.
*  And so now he has a heart transplant and he has a new heart and he's exercising
*  again and he's gone completely plant based. And, uh,
*  he thinks it's a good thing for his health and for his body. And, you know,
*  he used to be a guy who ate a lot of cheeseburgers and McDonald's shakes and
*  stuff and just wasn't really eating that healthy. Um,
*  and now just kind of completely changed his diet.
*  And I don't have the knowledge to tell him that that's not the
*  way to make your heart healthy. What would you say to CT?
*  I would,
*  I think that the first thing is I'm glad that he's making an intentional choice
*  with his diet. Like you said earlier,
*  what he's doing now is probably better than the standard American diet.
*  Yes.
*  If you are very careful about supplementation and you think about creatine and
*  carnitine and choline and vitamin K2 and B12 and bioavailable proteins,
*  I mean, you could sustain yourself on a vegan diet. In my opinion,
*  I don't think he's doing that. He's a very disciplined man.
*  Yeah. I don't think, I don't think it's optimal, but I don't,
*  I would also encourage him not to ignore the evidence on polyunsaturated fatty
*  acids and to be sure that with his transplanted heart,
*  um, that he is, that,
*  that he's carefully watching it and looking at the right metrics and really
*  looking at the right measures,
*  which may give him some indication of atherosclerosis progression.
*  So if somebody were to do a vegan diet with no vegetable oils,
*  they might be able to do okay,
*  given they were getting a lot of calories and have protein enough of these
*  nutrients and we're supplementing with the right things.
*  But I fear that a lot of vegans are going to think canola oil. That's great.
*  That's vegan or soybean oil. That's great. And where they're going to eat,
*  you know, these plant-based garbage burgers,
*  which are full of this vegetable oil.
*  We got to get to that. Yeah, that we have to get to, but.
*  And it's just not, and it's not, it's not a, a precise enough approach.
*  And I hope he's working with a cardiologist. So I would,
*  I would respect his choice a hundred percent if he's doing good. That's amazing.
*  But there's a lot of nuance there. And there are a lot of nutrients,
*  like I mentioned earlier in the podcast that are not found in plant foods that
*  are only in animal foods. We'll give him some of these. He probably won't take them.
*  Maybe he would. Maybe he would take the pills.
*  But if you could get him to just completely objectively learn and not
*  disrespect his choice to become plant-based,
*  what would you say would be the optimal thing for someone to do?
*  Having recovered from heart failure and a heart transplant, what would,
*  what would you recommend?
*  This is for CT or just anyone.
*  Anyone let's just have CT listen to this because I'm going to send it to them.
*  Right. But anyone in that particular, anyone without any ideology,
*  what would you say would be the optimal thing to eat?
*  Eat like your ancestors. Eat like the Hadza, you know, not your doctor.
*  So eat like eat, eat meat and organs as a center of your diet from well-raised
*  animals, Rome ranch, white oak pastures, poly face farms.
*  Don't fear the Oregon meats. Don't fear red meat. I really think, I mean,
*  there's tons of stuff in the book about why this information's bad.
*  Know which plants are the most toxic,
*  eliminate the most toxic plants and eliminate vegetable oils and processed
*  sugars like the plague. And, you know, I think if you do that,
*  you're going to thrive and I think you're going to feel really good. Now,
*  we're at a crossroads, Joe, you know,
*  like the mainstream medical establishment doesn't agree with this and I'm fully
*  ready and I think this is going to become my life's work. You know, it's just,
*  it's, it's really exciting to be in this pace and say, Hey,
*  I think these ideas are wrong and they need to be refined.
*  And I think that more people will benefit if we refine these ideas.
*  I think people are suffering because of incorrect information foist upon us for
*  the last 70 years by the mainstream medical establishment.
*  Well, it's fascinating when people follow along with the mainstream ideas
*  and like professional athletes, they watch game changers and they go, well,
*  that's it. I'm going to go plant-based and they're getting injured and they're
*  not recovering well. And they have on all these issues,
*  psychiatric issues, mood instability. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, this is a,
*  it's a real concern. And when you bring it up, people go, Oh,
*  here you go again with all your bullshit propaganda.
*  And it's been proven. Haven't you watched the documentary? Yeah, I watched it.
*  I watched it. I've talked to experts. I'm not impressed by any of this. You know,
*  I think you can do it.
*  I think you can be healthy and you can live off a vegan diet the way you said
*  before, but I don't believe it's the optimal way to do it. I just don't.
*  I don't think it is for humans.
*  I think people like to think it's the optimal way to do it because it makes them
*  feel better ethically and morally that they don't,
*  that they're not responsible for the death of animals,
*  even though they absolutely are.
*  And I think that's where we need to shift the perspective.
*  I think that vegan diets have become popular because they're a meme,
*  because they've become an identity.
*  And that identity is something that we all identify with as humans,
*  being a kinder person, a kinder person, an empathetic person.
*  But the reality is that the actual practice of a vegan diet is nothing like
*  that. Nothing like that. There's an, there's an Instagram handle.
*  I think it's so true.
*  Carnivore is vegan and it's such a, it's not my handle. It's somebody else's handle.
*  That's so true. If we're actually talking about empathy,
*  talk about the least amount of suffering.
*  You raise one animal in an ecosystem that is cycle.
*  That's the way it's been going for thousands, millions of years.
*  Maybe even take that animal ethically by hunting it.
*  Maybe even spend time in the wilderness while you're hunting an animal.
*  Maybe you spend time with people while you're hunting animal. And I'll tell you,
*  so I've hunted twice in my life, Joan,
*  I'm going to hunt this season with a bow and I've hunted twice before the bow.
*  Both times that I killed an animal,
*  walking up to that animal was one of the most spiritual experiences in my life.
*  It was just this strike like responsibility.
*  It's very psychedelic.
*  Be a responsible human. You took this life, right?
*  I think that as humans,
*  it's okay to be a part of the cycle of life and death and we will all die and we
*  will all go back to the earth. At some point,
*  these atoms that I am renting will return to the earth.
*  And so I think that it's okay to take life respectfully in a hunted way,
*  but if more people did this, and this is not necessarily scalable in 2020,
*  but I think if more people did this, it's like a sacrament.
*  And I don't mean that in any sacrilegious way, but it was just like,
*  it was the one of the most clarifying things I've ever done to remind me,
*  be a good person. Here is the universal bounty to you.
*  And I hope this doesn't sound too woo woo, but it was my personal experience.
*  Like here is the universal bounty to you in this moment.
*  Like you better be a good person because you are so fortunate to have this
*  nutritious food here. It's just very striking. I think it would,
*  I think it would change.
*  And that's completely different than the vegan ideation that that were being
*  harmful to animals or were being disrespectful. It was like, wow,
*  it was almost like that animal gave me the gift. Like be a better human.
*  Well,
*  I had this thought before I started hunting that I was either going to become a
*  vegetarian or is going to become a hunter.
*  I had seen a lot of those documentaries and those videos online about
*  factory farming and it's a, it's appalling. It's disgusting. It makes you sad.
*  It makes you sickened. And I was trying to figure out what can I do?
*  Like would I be capable of killing an animal? I never killed an animal before.
*  And then after I did, I went hunting with Steve Rinell on his television show.
*  I shot a mule deer. We ate it over a fire. And I said right away,
*  I'm doing this from now on. This is what I'm doing. Cause it resonated.
*  It made sense. It felt good. It was a very difficult thing to do.
*  It took days and days of hiking many,
*  many miles in the mountains to find a mule deer and to shoot it and then to haul
*  it out of there and then to cut it up and eat it and cook it or cook it and eat
*  it. It was, it was, it was, it's a weird word, spiritual,
*  but it is a spiritual experience because it,
*  it connected you with the life that sustains you.
*  Like you were there.
*  I looked at that animal when I squeezed that trigger off and watched it drop.
*  And then when we were cutting it and hauling it out and eating the liver and
*  eating the heart and cooking meat over the fire,
*  immediately it all made sense to me. I was like, okay,
*  this feels so much different than buying meat in a store.
*  When I take a piece of elk meat, I shot an elk last week in
*  Utah. When I take a piece of elk meat two weeks ago and I put that on the
*  Traeger, I season it and I put it there and I cook it and then I'm eating it.
*  I'm feeding it to my family. I have a connection to that meat.
*  I looked in the eyes of that elk. When I released that arrow,
*  I watched it drop 15 seconds later. I felt the relief.
*  I felt the happiness and I felt the gratitude
*  that this animal is going to be how I get my meat and hundreds of pounds of
*  meat. I'm going to give it to my friends. I give it to your tribe. Yeah. I,
*  I love it. I love, I love all of it about,
*  and the people that I've met through this pursuit have been some of the best
*  people I've ever met in my life. Some of the nicest, most disciplined, most warm,
*  friendly, loving people. They're not animal haters. They're not cruel people.
*  They're people who understand where their food comes from and it's a different
*  connection to food.
*  The hunters have a different idea of life and death than the average person who's
*  shielded by it,
*  who's using their credit card to pay for a supermarket hit man to make cheese
*  burgers for them. And that's, that's not the way to go.
*  And I know that it's not sustainable for everybody to do it. Like you said in 2020,
*  but there's a lot of things that everybody,
*  not everybody becomes a black belt in jujitsu, right?
*  Not everybody becomes a race car driver. Not everybody becomes a doctor.
*  It's fucking hard to do. There's a lot of shit that's hard to do.
*  Like I'm not saying you have to do it,
*  but for a person who chooses to have a connection, it is available for you.
*  But the price of entry is difficult.
*  It's hard to learn how to do it properly.
*  It's really hard to learn how to do it with a bow. It's,
*  it requires a lot of physical exertion.
*  There's a lot of workouts that I do all throughout the year,
*  specifically my cardio workouts that I'm doing so that I have endurance in the
*  mountains. That's why I do it.
*  Cause I've been exhausted trying to make it up a hill,
*  especially my friend cam Haynes hunting with that fucking guy.
*  Just trying to follow him, just trying to walk behind him, forget about running.
*  I I'm doing it because I understand that come the moment of truth,
*  like you have to be at your best and it's not easy.
*  But if you don't want to do that, you can get meat from sustainable farms.
*  You can get meat from places like poly face farms, butcher box,
*  which is a great company. That's one of the sponsors of my podcast. All of their,
*  all their meat is grass fed grass finished from sustainable places that are
*  ethically raised animals. You can get that food. You can,
*  you can get it the right way. You don't have to hunt it,
*  but if you want to hunt it, that's available too.
*  Most people are not going to have the time or even the desire to do it,
*  but it can be done. But I don't like that argument where people say, well,
*  it's not sustainable for everybody. Well,
*  neither is most things that are hard to do.
*  Most things that are hard to do, you're not going to do. You know,
*  most people are not going to win the CrossFit games.
*  Does that mean we should stop the CrossFit games? Well, it's not sustainable.
*  Most people can't do it.
*  What does that mean we should stop marathons?
*  Cause most people aren't going to run a marathon.
*  There's hard things to do that are very rewarding.
*  And most of those things come with like there's,
*  there's a immense satisfaction in completing them.
*  And this is where hunting is different than any other source of
*  gathering food because it is, it's a discipline.
*  It's in many ways an athletic pursuit.
*  And then it also sustains you and sustains your family.
*  And it's a very different connection with food.
*  And I think it's a spiritual pursuit. And like you said, every time you eat,
*  you have a story. You remembered like every time you eat that elk that you got
*  with a bow, you're probably going to remember that time in the wilderness and
*  think about if that was all the food you ate, every food had a story like that.
*  How are you going to live your life in a different way?
*  And so one of the things that's been so interesting for me recently is realizing
*  that the carnivore diet and thinking about animal-based diets was just a
*  stepping stone. It was kind of the, on the entree to think about a broader concept
*  about the way that we as humans have forgotten that there's this broad amnesia.
*  And I've thought about this and kind of called it the remembering,
*  just this idea that it's about more than the way we eat.
*  It's about the way we live on the earth,
*  being in nature and doing things like hunting and getting back to these roots.
*  Like this to me is what gets me really excited that we're starting to think about
*  the way our ancestors ate and an ancestrally consistent diet.
*  But we also need to think about how the heck did they live?
*  And I've heard you talk about this so many times,
*  but social media is such a double edged sword and it is such a,
*  I think a destructive thing. This new documentary out, Social Dilemma.
*  Like we are not communicating with humans in the same way that we used to.
*  We're not over a fire. You know,
*  you got to cook that first meal deal with Steve Rinella over a fire.
*  That's a fricking human connection. That's real.
*  I remember him laughing because he said, so what do you think? And I said,
*  I'm doing this from now on. I go, this is it. I'm a hunter.
*  And he started laughing because he was, it was a satisfaction. It was like,
*  all right. You know,
*  it was like a happy thing where he saw that I was hooked.
*  Welcome to the tribe. Yeah. I was in a hundred percent. And I've been in,
*  that was 2012. I've been in a hundred percent for the last eight years.
*  I think about it all day long, especially now that I've become a bow hunter.
*  Like it's funny,
*  I was with my friend John Dudley and we were at a UFC fight and John was in the
*  crowd right behind me. It was a big fight about to go on. And I said,
*  this is what I'm thinking. I was thinking about archery.
*  That's what I was thinking. I was pulling a bow back and I was,
*  when I'm in my, like if anytime something's boring to me,
*  I think about archery.
*  Someone's talking about something that I'm not really interested in.
*  I'll listen. But in the back of my head, I'm thinking about centering my pin,
*  centering the bubble, drawing back, pulling with the scapula,
*  getting a surprise release. It's like, it's a massive obsession.
*  And there's that's,
*  there's a different spiritual connection to bow hunting, I think,
*  because it is so difficult and it is so physical and that it requires
*  this being in the moment in a way that nothing else does because there's so
*  many moving parts that you have to align correctly in order to execute.
*  Oh, it's amazing. It's one of the hardest things I've ever done.
*  And I just got a new release. I just got one of the thumb releases.
*  And so I'm all over the place now. It's super frustrating. Yeah. But I love,
*  I love that pulling with the scapula and I love that surprising release.
*  Have you ever used a tension-based release like a silverback?
*  This one is a wise choice. So it's, I think it's, yeah. Yeah.
*  The thing about those is you cheat, you hit that button with your thumb. Right.
*  You know, if you had a real good coach, no, I need to talk to John Dudley.
*  Yeah. You should get with Dudley. He would put you on a tension-based release.
*  What people don't understand what we're talking about is it's hard in the moment
*  of truth to, when you're anticipating the shot to not flinch or
*  move. And with archery, it is so important that the shot goes off
*  in a surprise manner.
*  And I'll say this for most people,
*  because there are a lot of people that are extremely good archers that don't do it
*  this way,
*  but they have practiced their way by pulling the trigger and consciously pulling
*  the trigger, what they call a command release.
*  They've practiced it for so long. They could pull it off. My friend,
*  Cam Haynes is one of those people. My friend, Remy Warren,
*  he's another one of those people. There's great archers.
*  There's a guy named Tim Gillingham. He's one of the best archers on earth.
*  He wins world championships and he pulls the trigger.
*  He has a finger trigger and he pulls it and he beats everybody.
*  And he's very well celebrated as one of the best archers in the world.
*  But for the most part, for most people,
*  you're better off having a surprise release.
*  You're better off taking the idea of the shot going off and you just go through
*  the motions of getting to go off, but you really have no idea when it's going to go off.
*  But it's hard to do with the thumb thing. Really a lot of people cheat.
*  They pretend they're doing that. Like, yeah,
*  I'm getting a surprise release and I'm watching my pitch.
*  You're hitting that shit with your thumb. I know what you're doing.
*  I think I'm cheating. I need a good coach. I need a good coach. Yeah.
*  It's hard, man.
*  It's hard, but I love how everything kind of drops away. And I'll tell you, Joe,
*  for people that haven't bow hunted,
*  I've actually never killed an animal with a rifle.
*  So I don't know if it's the same way you can tell me if it is the first time I
*  drew back on an animal. It was like, it was like I got hit with adrenaline.
*  I mean, you know, like your heart is just, it's such like, that's a primal instinct.
*  It's like, Whoa, there's something cool about that. And it's like,
*  everything fades. It's absolute flow state.
*  If you can go through the hard pounding,
*  but it's a special experience when you pull back on an animal.
*  My elk in Utah this year was very unusual in that I had to run
*  to get to the, to the water hole before the elk did.
*  I was in a patch of trees and I was hidden and I heard the elk screaming.
*  And then we knew there was a water hole here and he was trotting down and there
*  was no, I tried a couple of spots,
*  but there was no clean path to shoot through the trees.
*  And I managed to do it quickly and quietly enough so that he didn't see me
*  moving and I was hiding behind trees.
*  But I knew I had to get all the way to the water hole before him.
*  So I had to run and I had to jump over logs.
*  So there's these down trees.
*  I'd hop on top of these trees and jump over them. So I ran about, you know,
*  50, 60 yards until I got to this spot where he was.
*  I really had a sprint and then I had to calm myself down. And I looked at him,
*  I ranged him. I, and I was, I had the bow in my hands.
*  He looks up at me and I drew back as he was looking at me and he was just,
*  cause I'm in full camera with gloves, face mask, head gear, the whole,
*  full Sitka gear. He was like, what the fuck is that? And then, you know,
*  I probably had a second before he realized what I was before he was going to bolt.
*  And I released the arrow right at that moment.
*  So it was intense and it was super adrenaline packed cause I knew I had to run
*  too. So there was all this like, like he's at the water hole. I range him.
*  He steps away from the water hole and then he looks up and as he's looking up,
*  I'm just drawn back.
*  And I think I had a second or two before he was like, Oh,
*  that's a fucking person man dressed up like a tree. But it was so,
*  it was so, it was,
*  it was a moment where if I hadn't prepared properly,
*  I would have never been able to pull it off.
*  If I wasn't physically in shape,
*  I would have never been able to run there and have my heart rate drop down.
*  If I wasn't confident enough in my shooting that I shot so many thousands and
*  thousands and thousands of arrows,
*  I wouldn't have been able to execute because it was a weird shot too.
*  It was downhill 52 yards. It was,
*  it was a lot going on, but I'll never forget that when I eat that food,
*  I think about that animal. Absolutely.
*  It's like such a cool thing to have the story wrapped up in all of it.
*  It's so rich. It's such a different experience than we get as humans.
*  So as I think about the irony of 2020 or even the last century that we have,
*  we've put ourselves in digital worlds to work on computers indoors,
*  to make fake numbers in a bank account or green pieces of paper that allow us to
*  go hike and do the things that we were doing in our whole, I mean,
*  how enjoyable is hiking? How enjoyable is being in the wilderness?
*  How enjoyable is hunting?
*  And just just hiking alone is cleansing, right?
*  Like there's something about being around trees. I don't know what it is.
*  I mean,
*  whether it's the oxygen that you get from them or whether it's just a sig,
*  a signal to your body that this is a natural way to exist, to be in,
*  in wilderness and in nature, it feels good for you.
*  Like to just be walking through and just seeing it,
*  it enriches your soul.
*  There's something about looking at mountains and trees and like a stream that
*  it's this crazy natural beauty,
*  this natural artwork that your,
*  your senses react to this in this incredibly pleasing way. Like,
*  wow. Like I remember we,
*  we came over this ridge and there's a creek below us and this is beautiful green
*  hill and there's a mountain behind it.
*  And then,
*  and I heard this bull elk on the hill above a screen and I'm looking at this
*  and I'm like,
*  this is gorgeous.
*  It's so pretty like everything about it just made my whole body just feel good
*  like,
*  like a drug,
*  like a happy drug cell phone didn't work.
*  You know,
*  there's no signal out there.
*  It's just peaceful,
*  just peaceful,
*  just,
*  just nature the way it was for who knows how many hundreds of thousands of years
*  before people ever even came here.
*  I think that's what the remembering is about.
*  And that it's like,
*  there's something bigger than us and I'm not religious,
*  maybe a little spiritual in nature,
*  but I've had those same experiences on a long run or just being in the
*  wilderness.
*  You're like,
*  there's something here.
*  There's a connection that we have to this,
*  this wild world that we evolve through that we don't,
*  we're just,
*  we're like neutered when we're out here with the concrete and we're looking at
*  buildings and it's,
*  you know,
*  the way we live and it's,
*  there's a lot of great benefits to living in cities and all that stuff,
*  but there's something about it.
*  When you're in a car or you're just,
*  you know,
*  you're sitting at a desk,
*  you're,
*  you're muted.
*  You're muted and neutered both those things.
*  It's like,
*  you're not connected to the wild world.
*  I agree with you completely.
*  And I think that in some ways I suspect that it's built into our consciousness,
*  just like that ERP study that I showed you with meat.
*  And I think there have been similar EEG studies with nature scenery that we
*  just,
*  ultimately we're animals and we,
*  we try to pretend that we're not.
*  And I think that we're trying to become the best animal that we can be the most
*  ethical kind of pathetic animal,
*  but we still,
*  I think that we would do well to consider the fact that if we discard
*  everywhere we've come from,
*  we may end up in a position that's pretty miserable for humans.
*  If we discard wilderness,
*  if we discard what I believe are the most ancestrally consistent foods,
*  if we discard the patterns of human interaction,
*  we're just going to go further down.
*  My fear is that this is inevitable and that what we are going to become is some
*  sort of a symbiotic connect thing where we're,
*  we're part part,
*  we're going to be a cyborg.
*  We're going to be part electronics.
*  We're going to be more immersed in the electronic world than even we are now.
*  And that this trend of becoming addicted to your phones and constantly online
*  and all these different things that we all see with people that this is just a
*  step in this inevitable process.
*  But right now we're not there.
*  So right now that is not enriching to us.
*  It doesn't feel good.
*  This might be what a person is a thousand years from now.
*  It might be out of our control.
*  It might be just the way of entropy,
*  the way the world works,
*  the way of innovation,
*  the way of just the,
*  the just the evolution of the biological thing that is a human being.
*  It might inevitably move in that direction,
*  but it's not that way right now.
*  And if you live that way right now,
*  you'll be miserable.
*  You'll be depressed.
*  You'll be disconnected.
*  And that's why you see all these people that are living online most of the time
*  on Twitter,
*  just fucking arguing and throwing shit at each other,
*  like insane patients.
*  They're like people in a mental institution and they really are mentally
*  unwell.
*  They're,
*  they're in a depressed,
*  crazy,
*  agitated state most of the day,
*  arguing with people.
*  And this is,
*  I would imagine like,
*  I don't know what the number is,
*  but maybe 40% of all interactions on Twitter are people yelling at each other.
*  It's so scary.
*  And I've experienced it firsthand because when you start,
*  I mean,
*  I'm new to this whole thing.
*  You know,
*  like I went to residents,
*  see,
*  I didn't expect this to happen.
*  I got interested in stuff.
*  I started talking about my ideas.
*  And then suddenly you put ideas out there and there are people slinging shit at
*  you all the time.
*  Angry,
*  angry and charlatan calling you a clown or an idiot.
*  It's like,
*  you know,
*  like,
*  would you do that to me in person?
*  I don't think so.
*  Like,
*  I love,
*  I love debating people.
*  I love having respectful conversation.
*  That's what we're about.
*  You know,
*  if I'm wrong,
*  awesome,
*  because then we understood what's right.
*  Good for you.
*  That's ultimately,
*  and I want to live up to that.
*  You know,
*  I think there's,
*  all of us have ego,
*  right?
*  That's the best version of you though.
*  Right?
*  Like when you were confronted with an idea that's contrary to what you believe,
*  you recognize it and you adjust.
*  And I've had to,
*  you know,
*  when I first started with carnivore diet,
*  I thought,
*  okay,
*  all carbohydrates are bad.
*  Even in the last year and a half,
*  I've kind of said,
*  you know what,
*  maybe there's some nuance here.
*  And it's so strange because there's definitely a religiosity in the carnivore
*  community that I don't identify with.
*  And there were people just,
*  you know,
*  hating.
*  Well,
*  there's a lot of people in the carnivore diet that are basically meat eating
*  vegans.
*  I know.
*  And it's,
*  it's a,
*  it's a sad thing.
*  It is weird.
*  Like they,
*  they just have this idea in a way that is it's,
*  they,
*  they've got an identity,
*  you know,
*  and their identity is meat eating.
*  And I don't know if,
*  I don't think that's a good way to sell it.
*  I don't think it is.
*  I think we've got to move past that and say,
*  you know what,
*  it's about human health.
*  It's about people being able to live in the best way possible.
*  And there's a lot of ways to do that.
*  And if these tools are unique,
*  they certainly challenge the mainstream.
*  So I think they're valuable.
*  I think challenging the status quo is,
*  is indispensable because we have to have the dissenting voices.
*  Sometimes the dissenting voices are wrong and sometimes the dissenting voices
*  are right,
*  but we can't silence the dissenting voices and they're valuable.
*  And I think it's,
*  I love the,
*  I love the disruptors.
*  I love disruptive ideas.
*  They challenge us.
*  And,
*  but as a society,
*  we rebel against disruptive ideas.
*  I mean,
*  look at the cancel culture that's happening now.
*  Yeah.
*  And so the carnivore diet and animal-based diets,
*  these are disruptive ideas.
*  And at the same time,
*  I think that could be really helpful,
*  but let's,
*  let's understand.
*  Let's find out.
*  Well,
*  I think when I was younger,
*  I would look at any idea that was contrary to mainstream as likely being
*  incorrect.
*  But then as I've gotten older,
*  I realized like most people are not really paying that much attention.
*  And then when you find out how little,
*  when it comes to nutrition,
*  how little nutrition education doctors receive,
*  so many doctors that are giving you advice.
*  Like I've had doctors say,
*  you don't need to take vitamins,
*  just eat a well-balanced diet.
*  And I'm like,
*  what are you talking about?
*  First of all,
*  you look like shit.
*  Like tell me what a well-balanced diet is.
*  You have a gut.
*  This is a crazy conversation.
*  You look like your shoulders would rip apart if you tried to pick up a piece of
*  weight.
*  I think they would.
*  Yeah.
*  They would herniated this in their back.
*  A lot of people that are just,
*  there's their,
*  their physical condition is so poor and yet they're giving advice about
*  sustaining their physical condition.
*  I'm like,
*  come on,
*  man,
*  you know,
*  you know very little about nutrition.
*  This is crazy that you're giving advice.
*  And then you start to look at people outside the norm,
*  like yourself.
*  And you go,
*  okay,
*  this guy has spent so much time thinking about this stuff.
*  Maybe he's got some insight that other people have not acquired.
*  We hope so.
*  And that's why we have productive,
*  respectful conversations,
*  you know?
*  Yes.
*  And then people can decide because ultimately it's just about everybody
*  understanding what's going to benefit them the most.
*  So I wanted to,
*  before we get going,
*  I wanted to talk about the benefits of like what,
*  when you talk about grass fed grass finished meat,
*  what is the nutritional benefit of that over in terms of like essential fatty
*  acids and nutrient content over animals that are fed grain?
*  So if you look at the absolute nutritional content of grass versus grain,
*  grass finished versus grain finished animals,
*  they're pretty similar.
*  Okay.
*  What's different about grass fed animals in my opinion is what they're not fed,
*  what they're not subjected to.
*  So you remember that the majority of any cows life is spent on a pasture.
*  So most cows are eating grass for the majority of their life.
*  When you bring them to a feed lot,
*  they're K-FOD,
*  you know,
*  they're clustered animals and they're fed grains,
*  concentrated or clustered animal feeding operations.
*  And they're fed grains and cookies and plastic and waste products and the grains
*  can,
*  yeah,
*  they're fed like waste products.
*  They're fed like cookies and garbage.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Why they've had plastic.
*  I think they're just trying to fatten them up.
*  Sometimes it's just in the feast.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  There's a reference in my purpose.
*  I may be mixed in with stuff.
*  They used to be able to feed them incinerator waste.
*  I think they can't feed them incinerator waste anymore,
*  but incinerator waste.
*  Yeah.
*  Like what are they burning in the incinerator?
*  Either other animals or just waste products.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, so they're,
*  you've,
*  they're not,
*  I mean,
*  they're not even feeding the cows.
*  They're not feeding the cows organic grains,
*  first of all.
*  So the cows are full of,
*  here it is,
*  legal plastic content in animal feed could harm human health.
*  What?
*  Small bits of plastic packaging from waste food makes it where the animal feed is
*  a part of the UK's permitted recycling process.
*  Oh, so it's,
*  so they don't,
*  they're not penalized for accidental plastic.
*  So it's,
*  it's allowed.
*  Microplastic.
*  Yeah.
*  It doesn't seem like they're doing it on purpose.
*  Maybe not.
*  Yeah.
*  It's part of it.
*  And so this is what they're showing.
*  Is that their poop?
*  That's their feed.
*  Oh, so those little pieces of blue and shit that's plastic.
*  I think so.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh gross.
*  And so you got to figure the grains that are making that are moldy,
*  right?
*  The grains are sprayed with glyphosate and atrazine,
*  which is a known Xenoestrogen.
*  So it's a,
*  it's a pesticide that turns male frogs into females.
*  It's feminizing.
*  Look at that.
*  Six hundred.
*  Now you're going into Alex Jones territories.
*  The make of the frogs,
*  gay,
*  650,000 tons of unused food from leaves of loaves of bread to Mars bars.
*  I saved from landfills each year in the UK by being turned into animal feed.
*  Whoa.
*  So this is what,
*  this is what grass finished cows are not fed.
*  So it's,
*  you got to figure the fat of a grass fed animal.
*  You got,
*  you talked about this with Frank Von Hippel,
*  Franklin,
*  right?
*  Yes.
*  You know,
*  the poly,
*  the polycyclic aromatic hydrate,
*  no,
*  the persistent organic pollutants,
*  the dioxins.
*  So you've got to imagine that cows eating good grass are going to have less of
*  that in their fat.
*  Yes.
*  It's in the,
*  it's in the soil.
*  So the longer a farm has not been using those,
*  the better,
*  but the cleaner the cow,
*  it's going to have less of that in its fat,
*  less,
*  less of this,
*  less glyphosate,
*  glyphosate water soluble.
*  So it'll probably be in the muscle.
*  Atrazine is fat soluble,
*  but this is the kind of stuff that's never been really looked at.
*  So grass feeding is not as much about the increase in nutrient content,
*  grass fed,
*  grass finished or grain finished.
*  They're both nutrient rich,
*  but the grass finished is going to have less of the bad stuff in the meat and
*  less of the bad stuff in the fat,
*  in my opinion.
*  And it's also a thousand times more ethical and part of an ecosystem,
*  which is the only way humans are going to persist on this planet.
*  What about the essential fatty acid content of grass fed grass finished beef?
*  Is it similar?
*  Pretty freaking similar.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, pretty similar.
*  So is the talk of it being more nutritious?
*  Is it just propaganda or is it just wishful thinking?
*  I think it's probably wishful thinking.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean,
*  I think there are,
*  there's no shortage of reasons to eat grass fed grass finished meat,
*  but they look different.
*  That's what kills me.
*  Like when,
*  if I buy domestic cattle,
*  if I would buy domestic beef and I buy grass fed beef,
*  it looks closer to like what I get from an elk or a bison.
*  It looks like wild game.
*  It's red and dark.
*  Whereas if I buy grain fed,
*  it's like pinkish.
*  Maybe.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean,
*  they might be depleting some nutrients,
*  at least in the studies that I've seen.
*  They're,
*  they're comparable,
*  comparable,
*  but I mean,
*  maybe it's just the quantity that you're eating.
*  Cause I'm,
*  when I look at it,
*  I'm like,
*  well,
*  something's going on.
*  There's,
*  it's a different color.
*  Yeah.
*  And you see the same thing in fish too.
*  I mean,
*  certainly you could imagine there's going to be more carotenoids from the grass.
*  If the cow is finished on grass versus the grains,
*  which are not going to be,
*  you see that was salmon.
*  You know,
*  they have to give salmon these coloring pills.
*  Right.
*  If they're farm raised to get them to make the flesh not,
*  not,
*  you know,
*  not pale.
*  Yeah.
*  Not pale.
*  And sometimes you'll see that with grass fed fat,
*  it's more,
*  it's more orange because it has more carotenoids,
*  but at a basic level,
*  I mean,
*  I do think there are probably nutritional differences,
*  but there's not good literature to support it at this point.
*  And there is literature to support it with wild game in terms of protein
*  content.
*  Yeah.
*  It's far more protein rich.
*  Like a piece of elk is much more protein rich than a piece of beef.
*  You get like ounce per ounce.
*  I think it's almost double.
*  Is that because of the lower fat?
*  Is that because elk is so much more lean?
*  That's a good question.
*  Um,
*  I don't know if the,
*  the fat in a beef steak could be that prevalent where it's 50%.
*  No,
*  it wouldn't be 50%.
*  But by calorie,
*  it's an athlete.
*  I think when you're dealing with a cow,
*  you're dealing with something that's kind of just chilling and eating grass.
*  When you're,
*  if you eat an elk,
*  you're dealing with something that's running from mountain lines and wolves.
*  I mean,
*  it's just a different kind of animal.
*  I love,
*  I mean,
*  I prefer venison and elk when I have it.
*  I love the gamey flavor and everything.
*  So,
*  well,
*  do you know what you're saying?
*  If you eat liver that it gives you like this kind of boost,
*  nothing gives me a boost like elk meat.
*  There's something about that dark red gold,
*  that rich meat that when you eat it,
*  it's just like,
*  whoo,
*  just you feel great.
*  It just,
*  it just like this,
*  it's rewarding to your body.
*  Your body is saying,
*  Oh yeah,
*  yeah,
*  yeah,
*  dude,
*  give me some more of this.
*  This is what we need to recover.
*  This is what we need to rebuild cells.
*  This is what we need to rebuild tissue.
*  It would be super interesting to do some studies on that,
*  you know,
*  to take the elk meat that you've hunted to put it through like gas chromatography,
*  mass spec,
*  do some analyses and look at it compared to like grass fed beef or something.
*  Yeah.
*  See if it's like excess carnitine or maybe some more choline or carnitine or
*  something.
*  I'm sure there's something in there that makes it special.
*  I mean,
*  it's wild.
*  Well,
*  acetylcholine is a nootropic and it's one of the ingredients in alpha brain.
*  Is that the same thing as choline that you're talking about?
*  Or is there a different kind of choline?
*  Choline is a precursor for acetylcholine.
*  So acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter and I think,
*  um,
*  alpha brain has Huberzine A,
*  which is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor.
*  And that makes,
*  that allows more acetylcholine in the synapse.
*  So if you increase acetylcholine in the synapse,
*  it can be a nootropic.
*  Um,
*  absolutely.
*  But choline is a precursor for acetylcholine and phosphatidylcholine,
*  which is the phospholipid that makes up all the cells of our body and the myelin
*  and sheath on neurons.
*  And again,
*  really,
*  really,
*  really hard to get an optimal amount of choline without eating animals.
*  That's why,
*  that's why I'm bringing it up.
*  That's why it's,
*  there's been studies that have connected eating meat to brain function.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Creatine too.
*  Yeah.
*  And this is very controversial because people get up in arms about this.
*  Um,
*  I think it's pretty straightforward.
*  I don't think straight,
*  maybe straightforward scientifically,
*  but I don't think it's kind of,
*  the plant based folks get very,
*  they get their panties in the water about this one in a big way.
*  So Jamie and the folder nutrients at the,
*  there's one called creatine enhanced veggie.
*  Um,
*  there have been interventional studies on,
*  um,
*  vegans and they give them 20 grams of creatine for five days,
*  which is a loading dose and they get smarter.
*  And what are they using for the source of creatine?
*  I think they're just giving them synthetic creatine and how does one make
*  synthetic creatine?
*  I think there are a couple of different ways to make it.
*  Um,
*  we'd have to talk to your manufacturer.
*  So let's say consumed either a placebo or 20 grams of creatine supplement for
*  five days.
*  Creatine supplementation did not influence measures of verbal fluency and
*  vigilance,
*  but in vegetarians rather than those who consume meat,
*  creatine supplements resulted in better memory.
*  Interesting.
*  And there's another study in there.
*  Responsive of dietary style,
*  the supplementation of creatine decrease the variability in the responses to a
*  choice reaction time task.
*  Creatine is a critical nutrient for humans for the human brain.
*  There's another one.
*  Um,
*  also Jamie there,
*  um,
*  this one's even a little bit better study.
*  It's a creatine DRBP.
*  Um,
*  do you see that one?
*  Yeah.
*  So oral creatine,
*  monohydrate supplementation improves brain performance,
*  a double blind placebo controlled crossover trial.
*  I have read that the creatine can be a nootropic.
*  Do you take it or do you just get it from me?
*  Meat.
*  So you,
*  I think that the studies pretty clearly show that if you're eating what I would
*  consider to be an ancestrally appropriate amount of meat,
*  you don't benefit from more.
*  There's a place at which you can saturate your muscles with creatine.
*  It's about five grams a day,
*  which is about the amount of creatine and one pound of meat.
*  A lot of,
*  I eat more than one pound of meat per day,
*  but if you're eating one pound of meat per day,
*  you're probably no need to supplement with creatine supplementing it,
*  increase your muscle strength though.
*  Um,
*  cause that's what a lot of people do.
*  That's what they do it for.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I've done it.
*  It made me kind of fat.
*  Like I gained.
*  Well,
*  it can cause puffy.
*  You can super supplement and you might be able to retain more water.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  But I think if you're eating a pound of meat per day,
*  plus you're probably not going to get a whole lot of performance benefits
*  supplementing with creatine.
*  But they gaining the water though,
*  I think was why people like your muscles are getting larger because of that.
*  I think they felt stronger.
*  Right.
*  In people who are creatine deficient,
*  certainly supplementation is powerful.
*  And again,
*  there's no creatine in plant foods.
*  Right.
*  You can make a small amount of it in your body,
*  but there's a lot of evidence that it's inadequate,
*  but you would recommend if someone is on a plant based diet that they probably
*  should supplement.
*  Absolutely.
*  Absolutely.
*  Yeah,
*  absolutely.
*  And again,
*  there's so many nutrients like this creatine B12,
*  a niacin that are,
*  that are probably essential in the formation of the human brain.
*  You know,
*  we talk about,
*  we didn't talk about it today.
*  Maybe we can,
*  if we have time,
*  um,
*  or offline,
*  you know,
*  if you look at the way the human brain grew,
*  we got all the time in the world.
*  Paul,
*  this isn't the presidential debates.
*  This is the Joe Rogan experience.
*  Well,
*  it's the internet.
*  I love it.
*  You can just go as long as you need to make your point.
*  If you go to the evolution folder,
*  Jamie,
*  there's a brain size change graphic.
*  That's pretty cool.
*  So this is a graphic from my book and you can look at the,
*  the size of the human brain based on the cranial vault size.
*  And this is fascinating.
*  And there's a lot of theories as to why this happened,
*  but some of the most compelling in my opinion are around the advent of hunting
*  in humans.
*  And when you had Bill von Hippolon,
*  so you can see here,
*  um,
*  uh,
*  this is millions of years on the X axis and,
*  uh,
*  the size of the human brain on the Y axis.
*  You have the primate ancestors,
*  australopithecus,
*  homo habilis,
*  homo erectus,
*  fire,
*  and then Neanderthals and then homo sapiens.
*  So something really clearly,
*  this is another,
*  this is another Tony Hawk skate ramp,
*  right?
*  What the heck happened there?
*  Something happened.
*  I think the most compelling ideas are right there that I labeled in the graph
*  that around 2 million years ago,
*  we see the occurrence of stone tools,
*  these bifacial tools,
*  these Ashulean tools and evidence for hunting cut marks on animals,
*  bones,
*  um,
*  and evidence for mass animal graves.
*  So this is really cool.
*  I would postulate that humans becoming hunters,
*  becoming hunters made us human.
*  So,
*  you know,
*  Steve Rinella is like doing the happy dance right now cause he's right.
*  Be hunting animals made us human by providing indispensable nutrients like
*  creatine that were prime releasers or allowed our brains to grow in this
*  special way.
*  It's kind of written into who we are.
*  It's probably a bunch of other coinciding factors too,
*  right?
*  Well,
*  I mean other people hypothesize some people hypothesize fire.
*  The oldest evidence we have for fire is about a million years after you start to
*  see that cranial vault size increase.
*  Um,
*  so that was because of the increase in the nutrients that were bioavailable
*  because of cooking things over fire.
*  Supposedly.
*  But what's interesting is that nutrients and meat are bioavailable,
*  whether it's raw or cooked.
*  Nutrients and plant foods are at least in tubers are more bioavailable when you
*  cook them or at least the calories are.
*  You ever tried to eat a raw sweet potato?
*  I used to do that a lot when I was vegan.
*  No,
*  not a good thing.
*  Is it nasty?
*  Nasty.
*  Not a good thing.
*  I've never tried it.
*  Um,
*  have you ever listened to Terrence McKenna and his discussions about the
*  stone day?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Fascinating idea.
*  I mean,
*  that's a crazy,
*  yeah,
*  crazy theory.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Absolutely possible as well.
*  His brother Dennis makes a very compelling argument for it as well because he
*  goes,
*  his brother Dennis is a scientist and he goes deep into the actual physical
*  changes to the brain and to synapses and to the,
*  the body's ability to produce language that occur while under the influence of
*  psilocybin.
*  And he thinks,
*  he thinks,
*  well,
*  it could be there.
*  Co there were happening at the same time.
*  I mean,
*  this is also,
*  they think that it might've made people better hunters because psilocybin,
*  particularly in low doses increases visual acuity and probably makes you more
*  creative too.
*  Makes you figure out how to hunt better and maybe responsible for the
*  development of tools and other forms of creativity that benefited human beings
*  to evolve and become better hunters.
*  I've done it once.
*  Only once.
*  Only once.
*  Um,
*  interesting.
*  I want to do it again,
*  but I think about it set in setting and kind of respectfully.
*  The first time I did it,
*  um,
*  was a few years ago and so that I'd never done it before in my life.
*  So it's only within the first few years that I tried it the last few years,
*  but my experience was profound and I don't doubt any of that.
*  That's what I experienced.
*  It was clarity.
*  I felt so at home in the natural world.
*  It was incredible.
*  And,
*  um,
*  I was,
*  I was out hiking in Seattle where I was doing,
*  um,
*  my residency and I was with a friend and we were by a lake and it was just me and
*  the wilderness.
*  I was by myself.
*  I was just,
*  I had a different connection with trees and plants and it felt so different.
*  It was just like a door opened to this,
*  this experience of it was like a whole different unique thing.
*  And,
*  um,
*  I was with a friend,
*  he had to go back.
*  He was on call and I said,
*  just leave me here.
*  I just want to say,
*  I never wanted to leave.
*  I felt so at home in the wilderness.
*  And so,
*  you know,
*  I hope that,
*  um,
*  it's probably controversial,
*  maybe not in 2020 for a mainstream physician to say I've used psilocybin,
*  you know,
*  I don't think so anymore.
*  It's now being used in trials for PTSD.
*  And I mean,
*  it's incredibly powerful,
*  which actually gets to an important point that I should make about plants,
*  which is that I don't want anyone to think that I'm,
*  that I'm against plants as medicine.
*  I think there are many plant compounds that are very valuable for humans,
*  medical marijuana,
*  psilocybin,
*  clearly impactful for humans.
*  But there's a real dividing line between that and using plants as food or using
*  plants to make you better every day.
*  So we should just say that.
*  But yeah,
*  I mean,
*  my experience with psilocybin was profound and I think that,
*  uh,
*  it's something that I hope more trials will happen with,
*  with the FDA.
*  But I was so curious,
*  you know,
*  I was reading about it.
*  I knew they were doing studies at Hopkins and they were doing studies NYU.
*  And I thought it's,
*  I almost felt irresponsible as a physician,
*  not knowing what this experience was like.
*  I wanted to,
*  to,
*  to,
*  to chain,
*  to turn off the default mode network.
*  I wanted to see what it was like without ego.
*  And it was,
*  it was an incredible experience.
*  So having had that experience,
*  I don't doubt it.
*  When I was at White Oak Pastures a couple of weeks ago,
*  I was walking through a pasture with cow pies and there were psilocybin,
*  psilocybin growing.
*  And I was like,
*  ah,
*  stoned ape.
*  It just makes sense that they would try it,
*  right?
*  I mean,
*  they flip over cow patties.
*  If you watch primates,
*  they do it to get bugs and grubs and all.
*  It makes sense.
*  They would try the mushrooms.
*  And if they did try it and started tripping and,
*  and found it to be incredibly euphoric and enjoyable,
*  I would imagine they would consume it quite a bit.
*  And what Terrence McKenna's research shows is that it corresponds with a
*  climate change and a decreasing of the rainforest.
*  And it's resending into grasslands and that that would also increase
*  the number of ruminants and these cattle that were these undulates that were
*  leaving these piles of shit.
*  And then these mushrooms would grow on them.
*  I make sense.
*  It totally makes sense.
*  I'd never seen it before.
*  And I was like,
*  that's actually real.
*  Yeah,
*  they do grow.
*  It's a,
*  it's a fascinating theory,
*  you know,
*  but who knows?
*  Listen,
*  man,
*  uh,
*  this was an awesome talk.
*  I really appreciate it.
*  Your book,
*  the carnivore code is available right now.
*  Uh,
*  is there an audio?
*  There's an audio.
*  I read it.
*  I read it.
*  Thank you.
*  I'm so glad you do the reading because most people are going to fuck up half of
*  the words in this thing.
*  It's very complicated.
*  You do a fantastic job of breaking this down though.
*  And the fact that you do this all on memory with no carbohydrates,
*  it's quite amazing.
*  I had a little bit of honey today,
*  but not a lot.
*  I'm definitely,
*  I'm definitely in ketosis right now.
*  And some grass fed bison.
*  All right.
*  Uh,
*  and Oregon,
*  Paul Saladino,
*  uh,
*  the carnivore code.
*  Thank you very much,
*  brother.
*  I really appreciate it.
*  Thanks for having me on brother.
*  It was an honor.
*  It was very fun.
*  Thank you.
*  Bye everybody.
