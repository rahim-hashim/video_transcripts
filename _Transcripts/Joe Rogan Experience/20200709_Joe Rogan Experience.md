# Joe Rogan Experience #1505 - Hannibal Buress
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [July 09, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amyaoTtZaRE)
*  Hello Hannibal, what's happening man? Good to see my friend. Good to see you too. It's been a while last time
*  I saw he was in Thailand. It was in Thailand. Yeah, that was two years two years 2018. Yeah. Yeah, that was random
*  That was very
*  That's so crazy. Yeah, we had dinner hung out in Thailand. I was like, this is wild. Yeah. Yeah at the
*  It was in Chiang Mai. Yeah. Yeah, I was doing Muay Thai. Yeah, that's crazy
*  So you just decided just up and decided I'm gonna go there by myself
*  Yeah for several months just a month. Oh you went for a month. Yeah and train Muay Thai. Yeah, I needed to I
*  Needed a reset after doing tag
*  I wanted to kind of just reset my brain after doing so much press because it was a lot of press and a lot of just
*  You know repetition and so I like I need to go
*  Do something extreme to get into a totally different zone
*  What was that? Have you ever trained Muay Thai before that? No, what was like we took some classes
*  The first day so I went in in Bangkok first. I
*  Went to like a small class. I just went to one and in my camp was in Phuket
*  and so the
*  Is all the all the gyms are outside
*  So to warm up I was drenched in sweat tonight 10 minute warm-up
*  Oh, this is this is good, but it was it was dope man
*  It was just it was it was nice to I stayed on the camp for a little bit
*  so it was it was nice to just have that focus and
*  live there and be there and just
*  Work out and lean into it. It was cool. How into it did you get?
*  Did you ever were you ever like hitting the pads going? I think I should take a fight
*  No, I know take a fight. I but it was it was sometimes where
*  My my kicks I'm bow legging. So my kicks are weird. So like doing a roundhouse. I wouldn't be able to so my elbows
*  Were were decent in my knees and so some of the trainers they call it. They started that was my nickname
*  It was elbow elbow come on elbow, but my kicks will be so weak
*  They will be so weak it just like hit the pad and is it have a pitiful sound
*  It's not a thing that comes easily, especially you know when you're in your 30s and you're just starting to train
*  Like Muay Thai is there's like the to move your legs like that and that kind of dexterity takes a while
*  It's a slow gradual buildup. Yes, the hips have to be
*  Looser and it was just but I'm also bow legging
*  Certain yoga things that I can't do or even sit in Indian style
*  But you seem normal when you're walking around
*  How are you bow because I know some dudes that are really bow legged
*  My walk is a little bit it has a little bit to it and when I run it gets really crazy
*  I don't look how I think I look in my head while I'm walking. I think
*  the music in my head is
*  But my walk is kind of
*  My walk is way weird I look at on camera who is that guy?
*  What causes bow legging this is it a anatomy thing? Is it just an anatomy thing? Yeah
*  Stand up. So yeah, so that my knees don't touch so it's a yeah seem normal. I'm not seeing anything weird
*  It's not crazy, but it's just it it it affects my roundhouse game, you know
*  mmm, I could help you with that I guarantee you I bet some stretches and
*  Some learning how to do it slowly
*  The thing about roundhouse kicks and any kicks in general is people try to do them like fast
*  You really want to learn them slow
*  You want to learn like you got to resist the urge to try to hit things
*  What you really want to do is just go through the motion
*  Just yeah go through the motion just slow and do that for a long period of time like many many many weeks
*  Okay before this guy's child like and then you wind up kicking up and you put all the strain on your ligaments
*  And you're supporting leg because you're not pivoting they fuck themselves and then it's hard to unlearn that
*  See when when you learn something if you learn it wrong like when I used to teach the worst
*  Students were students that learn something wrong you would think like oh
*  I already have five years of karate and this and that and I'm like, oh great. This should be good
*  It was never good. It was the opposite you're better off taking a young kid with no experience at all
*  They can get way better way faster because they don't have any bad habits because as soon as you get nervous
*  Or as soon as you get tired you go right back to your bad habits you go back to your so you have to relearn
*  everything
*  it was a
*  Seeing the kids I went to some of the fights out there and as wild as the kids in in the undercar where you see
*  Seven-year-olds crazy right fighting this is wrong, but I
*  Gotta see the main event too, so I can't leave it's culture
*  It is it is kind of feels wrong, but it's their culture
*  And it's also how a lot of the families make money. I mean they literally send their kid off to the camp
*  But I was I was trying to figure out and so it's part of the culture. It's national sport
*  But it doesn't seem
*  You know you have people it's some some fighters that are legends there
*  There's the equivalent to Mike Tyson or something and you could probably get a private with them for 400 bucks
*  Yep, so what's going on with the model?
*  Over there where it's been a national sport for a while, but it seems like
*  The money isn't there is it's corruption or what happened well
*  First of all it's very inexpensive to go to the fights
*  You know that everything's inexpensive in Thailand, and I mean everybody's wearing flip-flops right it's an interesting place like
*  My friend John Wayne Parr went there when he was a boy
*  He was a young teenager and lived there lived as a monk
*  you know he's a
*  Australian multiple-time world Muay Thai champion, and he he spent like a good deal of his time growing up there and
*  Really embrace the culture and he's like they're just first of all it's the land of smiles like everyone's everyone's friendly like one of the things
*  I noticed they're like people are genuinely very friendly
*  There's very little materialism there people are generally happy with like wearing a pair of shorts
*  It's never cold out so you could wear
*  Shorts and flip-flops, and that's how everybody's walking around and I don't think there's a lot of money in the business
*  You know I think there's a King takes it the King takes it King takes a lot
*  We remember we took a picture in front of the King we did a picture in front
*  I was like I don't know if we should post this like you and me
*  Smiling in front of a picture of the King like you might get in trouble for that
*  There's weird rules over there for the King the King I actually had a bit
*  About him I cut it not cuz I was scared, but just cuz it is it but
*  It's about how he you know you have to stand up
*  During the national anthem and they play it at certain times during the day and they play it before the movies
*  So I went to the movies out there to see Ant-Man 2 and after the previews
*  The King of Thailand's hype video comes on and everybody has to stand up in the movie theater
*  But it was the worst
*  produced
*  It was a terrible
*  Video I seen Instagram fitness models with better videos than the king of stock is like you the king
*  Get some king like production value ain't no top-notch editors
*  I don't think Thailand's known for it's like films. He needs to get on fiber or something
*  I don't work for fiber by the way
*  Lost all the money quibi
*  Was it called is that it quibi? Yeah
*  Maybe get on that I don't know he needs something cuz you the king yeah, you putting your stuff in a Marvel movie
*  See that shit with his mistress
*  He had an official mistress, but she fucked up and she got demoted
*  And so she had a like like bow down in front of him in front of everybody like she was talking shit
*  Like the the mistress probably wanted to be the queen like look at her there. She's like begging for forgiveness
*  Oh, the king makes mistress lie at his feet and
*  Make hers what does it say as he makes her his
*  That was when she was the official concubine
*  Attended by his what they were a wife in all capitals, but then he demoted her
*  This is this is when she became the official concubine and by the way
*  I think that was the first time anybody had an official concubine like a hundred years
*  That's a that's the that's this is the flashiest version of I don't let it hope
*  I
*  Don't let it hope I love you look
*  I'll shame that bitch in front of everybody look lie down at his feet look
*  Fuck you
*  It's weird like the Kings only ball. Yes, you see
*  That's bonkers. He's the only baller
*  The only ball like everyone else is just kind of normal there
*  It's yeah, I'm wearing his wife here. She's the same thing. Oh the wife. I do the same shit Wow
*  And she's pouring tea on her head. What is that? What and other people laying down at a cleaning?
*  very odd a
*  Good for him. They seem to love them over she used to be the
*  She was a former she was a soldier bodyguard
*  Former bodyguard. Okay, you take that weird hat off and come live with me
*  I
*  Did enjoy Thailand though, I enjoyed it a lot it's a good time yeah, I went back
*  last year
*  Did you the same thing who's that guy just for a little bit not the what's going on there the crop top what is this?
*  The Monarch even threatened to sue Facebook over the startling shots taken in 2016 by a passerby who recognized the king
*  Oh, that's the king yoga class
*  Wait a minute
*  So cycle well she she has to wear the crazy hat. I was born he was a mutic. Oh
*  He kicking it. Okay
*  Yeah, there laws over there so
*  People I saw something about someone got put in jail for liking a post making fun of the King's dog
*  Yeah, I saw that too. Yeah, just is
*  So that's just how he likes to rock it he likes tank tops that show his belly button that's cool. It's cultural
*  King yeah, that's some I'm the king. Yeah, he's the king
*  If I was the king of Thailand, I dress like that too fucking
*  Yeah, you can get a lot of trouble for making fun of him over there yeah, yeah guess we're not going back
*  Well, we probably shouldn't for a couple years Cambodia it is
*  Myanmar I want to go see have you ever seen let way do you know what that is? No, that's like if you think
*  Thai-boxing is extreme. They take it another level left way
*  They use headbutts and they they kick you when you're down they do all kinds of crazy shit
*  Kicked wild down is this is it looks it's too intense. It's intense
*  We had David LaDuke who's the the king of let way he came on the podcast. He's a wild man
*  He's a wild man
*  Yeah, I think about oh they're bare-knuckle too
*  Yeah
*  I just want some cardio this is left way look at this. Yes
*  This is how they okay bare knuckles
*  They just it's basically like Muay Thai, but way we're more hardcore like see that you can knee a dude on the when he's on
*  His way down
*  It's just it's way more hardcore
*  It's like one more level of hardcore and headbutts a lot of headbutts
*  Yeah, but they basically use all the techniques of Muay Thai, but they just take it to a totally different level
*  this the second time I went when I went to
*  Colt Samoy
*  in last year and
*  This girl I was seeing she we go to a couple classes and I didn't know she had done Muay Thai before
*  So we were we had a private and she was lighting the bag up with the kicks
*  No
*  And then I get out there my bow-legged kicks
*  Then the train is like come on you do better look at
*  Had she fought before I don't think she fought but she had trained a good amount it was yeah
*  She lit it up but she was one of those people I mean, you know
*  You can't tell people but I'd known a little bit but didn't know that the shit she kept it under wraps. Yeah
*  Was it uncomfortable after that? No, I wasn't uncomfortable. It wasn't uncomfortable, but it was whoa unexpected. I didn't know
*  Yeah, there's something about women that can fight like move. That's a
*  extra
*  Element of danger. Yes, she's a woman who can fuck you like a hot chick who can fuck you up is like
*  That's that's nerve-wracking
*  Yeah, like if you're a woman like a Holly home or like, you know
*  World-champion kickboxer woman like how what kind of man do you date?
*  Like you got a date another savage. Yeah date a fighter. You have to they can't they can't respect regular people
*  They'll fuck you up
*  Unless they separate not a probably unless they dominate you
*  I like to hold you down make you eat their pussy and just grab you by the back of the head
*  Sit fucker. Come on. Shut up. Yeah, I just jogged for 10 miles
*  Drip drip drip. It's probably a lot of guys are into that though, you know
*  Doos are any getting kicked in the balls. They're into all kinds of weird shit
*  You can find somebody out there that's into everything they're getting kicked
*  That one that seems extreme
*  Guys that are in getting kicked in the balls by women no, oh my god, I don't want to show it to you
*  No
*  They they they're in to getting kicked in the balls and getting their ball stomped on by stilettos
*  That's like a whole category of like pain and torture like all those BDSM folks
*  You know, yeah
*  Yeah
*  Yeah, the stomping out seems that's uh, I don't know what would really
*  Lead you to that to that zone of extremes. Look, I love Jim Norton to death
*  But he likes chicks pissing on him and all kinds of crazy shit
*  People are in a weird stuff man people living out there
*  People out there living, you know speaking living. Yeah, I've been hearing some crazy shit about you
*  Well, you and I've been hearing that you are making a move like a very very unusual move
*  To a very strange place. Yeah, it's very unusual for a man from Chicago to just up and take off
*  Yeah, that's I do want to get into that that just reminded me that I bought
*  Some of those flame throwers when they when they were selling them
*  Oh the Elon Musk one I bought them with the intent of reselling them and and then my parents basement. So
*  How many I bought for that's a good investment they're worth a lot of money, yeah, yeah, I gotta
*  Yeah, I gotta go check on them. Okay
*  So with this whole you doing something crazy. I
*  might
*  so COVID and just kind of being cooped up
*  It really made me think about how
*  you know the places that I've lived and what what was keeping me from
*  Living elsewhere and moving
*  Internationally is because oh you need to be here for work
*  It's something you have to be right, you know within a couple hours of these places to either tour or film
*  but now
*  Torrent super weird
*  Are you doing any touring at all?
*  No, what's last time you did stand up?
*  Beginning of
*  March me too and I want to march in Denver two weeks ago. I did Houston. How's that weird?
*  Yeah, we're first show was weird second show was normal second show was a show first show was like I can't believe I'm gonna do
*  Stand up again. Yeah, do you know Moses Brian Moses? Yeah roast battle me Moses and Tony Hinchcliffe. We went to the Houston improv
*  It was awesome. We had a good time
*  It was really fun man
*  It was like the old days but I got weirded out and I was like man
*  I don't want to catch this shit like is this worth it?
*  Like what am I doing and then Houston while we were there they got this thing that they're moving back to stage one
*  So they're they're going back. So they're shutting all the bars down
*  Restaurants were down to 50% capacity
*  And I was like, look, you know, we're not in the crowd the the stage of the you've been to Houston improv
*  Has it moved in years it's been I haven't been in my first time ever. Okay, it's nice
*  Yes, nice place and it's got a high stage so you're above everybody it's not like they're spitting in your face
*  you're above them everyone was wearing masks, so I was like this is probably safe, but
*  Afterwards, you know just odd
*  It was just odd and I was like, I don't want it. I don't want to get sick and most importantly
*  I don't want to get anyone sick, right?
*  So I was like, you know my wife's mom lives down the street from us and I don't you know
*  I mean, it's like what if I got a guest sick?
*  I had a
*  I had a small jam session on my roof
*  on Sunday
*  whereas initially it was supposed to be the band
*  handful of people and then
*  It didn't get crazy. Like everybody was packed. Everybody still kept their space. It was a reasonable setup
*  but with these times it made it intense and I had
*  some
*  Mushroom drink that my friend Babylon had made and so
*  I had a good time. I got on the mic a little bit and that's that but I and it was cool and you know
*  people were vibing everybody was excited to be there bands playing different people and then at
*  One point I started looking around. Yo, did I?
*  Am I creating some type of?
*  super spreader situation like
*  outdoors is maybe
*  15 18 people but I just started being like oh
*  I'm just I'm about to be in the goddamn news for this party and somebody gonna die from being and it was just
*  I had the worst
*  trip
*  Ever because of it because I had never I hadn't had any you know, it was a new spot for me
*  So I hadn't had
*  It was just a it was a lot of sensory overload and just thought spiraling
*  And my friend one of my friends come up. She said you all right and I was just like
*  I was really I was gone. I had to take a walk around the block and it just
*  it was it was
*  Terrible because I did I just create some type of situation where?
*  Somebody could die from a fucking jam session just because I kind of got antsy about you know
*  Wanting to do something, you know
*  And yeah, it was it was rough I had I had uh, that was sunday I had some
*  A couple appearances or calls to do monday
*  Canceled those like no on camera today
*  I'm still pulling it back together. It was it was bonkers man. Yeah, I got back
*  I immediately got tested and when I was clean I was like, that's it
*  Yeah
*  And i'm i'm canceling everything for a while until they come up with some sort of a treatment or until
*  Herd immunity is kicked into the point where you know
*  The virus has dropped down to a very low level of viral load and people aren't getting real sick
*  it's just
*  If everybody was healthy, I would have no worry, right?
*  But I don't want unhealthy people to die or old people to do it. It's it's so complicated man
*  You know, I have a few friends. I have like nine friends that have got it. Yeah
*  And everyone's fine
*  But what if they weren't you know, I mean there's a lot of people that aren't it's scary. It's weird and we were just
*  Jamie and I were just reading this story about uh, is it from the uk?
*  I think it was the mirror
*  Um all these people that they're finding that have very minimal symptoms, but then they have this brain disease
*  Damn, yeah, like some inflammation of the brain
*  And uh, some of them, uh had to be on anti-psychosis medicine one lady
*  What did she saw lions in her fucking house?
*  Yeah, a new study the potentially warrant, uh that warned that potentially deadly brain disorders may be a symptom of covet 19
*  Even in people with otherwise mild disease the research published today by the journal brain looked at 40 adult patients with covet 19 in the uk
*  Finding that they showed symptoms of a wide range of serious brain diseases many of the patients had only mild
*  typical covet 19 symptoms such as fever or respiratory issues and for some their neurological symptoms were the only sign that they were sick
*  155 year old woman with no known
*  Current or historical mental illness was admitted to a hospital with recognized covet 19 symptoms including fever cough and muscle aches
*  She was discharged after two weeks having been treated with oxygen but four days later her husband reported
*  She was confused and behaving strangely. She then experienced hallucinations reporting that lions and monkeys
*  She was seeing lions and monkeys in her house and became delusional and aggressive with her family and hospital staff
*  She was treated with anti-psychotic medication and her symptoms improved over the course of three weeks
*  Although the study did not does not confirm whether she made a full recovery
*  What?
*  Yeah, that's pretty bonkers right there. This fucking disease is bonkers because for some people it ain't shit, right?
*  I know some people that were asymptomatic. They went through the whole thing with nothing
*  They they they had like they tested positive. They didn't feel it. They they they chilled they just
*  Quarantined for two weeks. They got retested. They don't have it anymore. They never felt anything
*  And then I know other people that months later, they can't go up flights of stairs. They're exhausted all the time
*  They keep they got no motivation that just everything feels just the world's like they got a weight vest on everywhere they go
*  Oh man. Yes, fuck this disease. It's it's uh, it's flipped everything
*  upside down man
*  Uh, that's why so i've been thinking about where you going?
*  Uh
*  Think about going to gana for a couple months
*  Oh
*  Show me the outfit come on, man, you know this I actually I got this in uh,
*  I got this in uh in uh, you know, I don't get to go nowhere
*  So you you you know, it's you put on some fly every now and then actually and don't don't show this part
*  Don't show that part
*  Make sure you don't catch that in the camera
*  uh
*  But this is uh, where this is from, uh
*  Singapore
*  A random jacket I got over the holiday. I've been thinking about going to gana just because
*  I took uh african ancestry tests
*  Apparently i'm Ghanaian on my father's side
*  and
*  I think
*  America is going to be
*  It's very annoying now and it's going to be pretty annoying in november
*  So if I can get out here october
*  uh at least for two three months just as an exploratory trip and
*  Get a different perspective to to live from write from work from and just a whole different zone for a bit and really
*  Dive in out there. I think
*  Now is the is the time to just shift it. I love the idea
*  I love it, especially now, right? You just released a special it's available free on youtube right now
*  Yeah, so like what better way to come up with new material than live in gana for a few months right before the world explodes
*  Because it's gonna fucking explode no matter who wins man. I'm nervous to be here. No matter who wins. It's because it's not a
*  Biden is not a
*  It's gonna be weird because it's not something to really cheer even if the plan is for him to pass it off
*  Yeah, and step down that's still weird
*  Yeah, if that's not gonna be that's not smooth
*  To step. Hey, i'm old i'm i won i'm stepping down. That's that's gonna create a whole zone
*  The only way that would ever work is if whoever his running weight was was preferable to him and everybody was excited about it
*  Like someone who you would have voted for anyway, and we don't even know who the running mate is right now
*  I was of today july 8th
*  We don't know who that is
*  But if the running mate is preferable to him and like good he's gonna be a woman good give it to her
*  Let her run it if it's like that. Maybe we'll be okay
*  But he's not even around he's hiding somewhere. He's in a basement
*  I
*  I just am skeptical of him just because he
*  He was vice president as an old guy for eight years
*  That means he was just jealous
*  Just jealous
*  Just jealous look at over one day
*  One day is so that's too weird of that's too weird of a weight. It is weird to make that move
*  at this age
*  It's it should be a cap
*  60
*  For president well, and i'm only saying 60 to be nice
*  It should really be about 50 50 55
*  well
*  When reagan was president, he was the oldest president before trump and then dementia. Yeah, he wound up getting alzheimer's, right?
*  Was it alzheimer's?
*  uh
*  I think dementia i'll just never forget when I was a open micer. It was like 1988
*  There's a guy named jimmy tingle. It was a boston comedy legend
*  He had this joke about reagan on trial because reagan was on trial and they asked him if he ever sold arms to iran
*  And he said he couldn't remember and jimmy ting was like mr president
*  If you ever sell arms to people who hate us
*  Jotted down
*  Just make a note put it on your refrigerator
*  Yeah, you should have some type of reminder. Yeah, he went out and we thought he was bullshitting
*  Like we were like she's just pretending he doesn't remember but then in the end he didn't remember anything
*  Like who knows if you remembered that?
*  Yeah, it's uh that the age thing is
*  it
*  there needs to be
*  uh a sort of cap because why you shouldn't be first of all
*  you're
*  Any ambitions you have in your 70s should be
*  private things like carpentry or
*  music production
*  It should be right any you shouldn't have anything at 70
*  That has to do with the larger populace
*  No, you go knit you go
*  Read and pursue something you wish you did when you were 32. That's not
*  Involving millions of people I say that but then I was I was willing to vote for bernie sanders
*  I was a bernie sanders supporter before he
*  Lost, you know in the primaries. I felt I felt like his policies were interesting
*  Like it'd be an interesting way to shake up the country like let's put focus on
*  on human beings and people and communities instead of just money and
*  foreign interventionist wars, I think bernie has some interesting policies and
*  He should just you know
*  Put them shits on a pdf
*  Is he the only one they can't be that good if he's the only one that could do it
*  No
*  Pass them off and be the advisor on the side, you know, yeah have a you know have you know, just give advice
*  You know guidance
*  Be the wise sage. Mm the wise sage but at that, you know, it's uh
*  The travel is the travel is tough on a young healthy person. It's tough on us exactly
*  Yeah, when I got back from houston I had not done stand up in a long time and I was exhausted on sunday
*  I was like fuck man. I forgot how tiring this shit is multiple
*  flights
*  Getting up in the morning all that shit
*  I am very curious now that this jelaine maxwell guy or lady got arrested
*  You know the jeffrey ebbsdeen's. Yeah confidant
*  What first of all how quick before they kill her?
*  Second of all, if they don't kill her what is she gonna say and who's going down because there's a lot of people going down
*  Is is pretty bonkers. I watched the election
*  You think it'd affect the election 100 100. Yeah, how's that?
*  Well, first of all trump used to hang out with that guy
*  this picture with melania and trump and jeffrey ebbsdeen and galane and
*  Fox news cut out trump
*  They cut the they edited the picture so the trump wasn't in the picture and they're like, well, we made a mistake
*  Like bet you didn't make a mistake. There's the picture
*  They were posing partying together
*  They hung out what?
*  I know at the end of the
*  The doc on netflix. They said that he had
*  All of those tapes and all of those rooms were being taped
*  And so I wonder if she has access to that or did they burn that
*  That's a good question
*  What's up? Yeah, you know he had a picture of bill clinton in a dress in the foyer of his house
*  Damn, it's a crazy picture. Like you are my bitch
*  Because he had clinton flew with him like 26 times
*  Look at that. That's a picture. That's a real picture that was in the foyer of his house

*  And then you came over my house and I got a painting hey hannah ball
*  I want to show you something
*  Is you in a dress if you and I have been partying together and I flew you to some island and we fucked kids together
*  And then you came over my house and there's a painting of you in a dress
*  You'd be like what have I done?
*  Yeah, I just said it's all on fire
*  Just coming with a vest wrapped up with dynamite
*  You know what I don't deserve to live anymore anyway
*  It's so it's so crazy because it's one of those things where
*  You would hear about that from like the craziest conspiracy theorists like bro. There's an island
*  They take all these elites and they have these underage girls on this island. You'd be like
*  Get the fuck out of here with this crazy talk. That is so that's crazy talk and then you find out wait. It's true
*  and they had
*  scientists there and lawyers there and
*  politicians there like
*  What
*  There really was an island like they had the prince
*  What's his name prince? Andrew prince? Andrew was there his
*  His part was was funny because they said no, it's this picture of you. Yeah, that is a picture of me, but
*  I don't remember. Yeah, he was like, I don't hug. I'm a royal royals. Don't hug. He just kept it
*  Yeah, that's me, but
*  I don't I don't know what you
*  Yeah, he's just blank face
*  Lie like that and just keep it. Nope. Just keep it news or what it is what it is
*  Well, why did you see that interview that he did?
*  The full interview I just saw it in the in the doc
*  Well, there's an interview with him. I forget who the woman was it was interviewing him
*  But when you're watching the interview, you're like, holy shit
*  Why did you do this?
*  Like you know that you're guilty and you agreed to do this interview like this isn't even the cops
*  This is like a reporter and you're talking to this reporter and you're clearly full of shit and really nervous
*  This is great. The whole thing's crazy. Yeah, it's old old money white guy confidence
*  But it's also it's royal confidence, right they have they have real well
*  They also have crazy libel laws in the uk
*  Like they can get away with a lot over there because like they could sue you for all kinds of shit and the royal family
*  I'm sure is
*  Extremely litigious
*  This is the whole story is here it is. Jelaine maxwell is allegedly secret video footage of prince andrew. Oh Jesus
*  Pornhub here we come
*  It just seems like we're in a movie man, it's like the the movie just keeps getting crazier and crazier
*  Yeah, you know what i've been doing just to turn my brain off
*  Well putting on that show the floor is lava on netflix and yes sound off
*  Put music on sometimes I put like the super mario theme and it and it lines up and i'll play the death music
*  when they fall into something just to just it's just good to
*  Zone out for a half hour hour and just look at something that is not
*  Intense at all just nonsense low stakes chill
*  Entertainment just escape a little bit like watch people try not to fall in the lava
*  Yeah, my friend rutledge rutledge. He's a host of that. He's a car guy
*  Shout out to rutledge
*  Yeah, uh, my kids love that show. Yeah sound off. It's a good sound off show
*  It's just red water. It's just red you get it. You don't need to hear anything
*  They say I don't care about your backstory. Oh, you're all doctors. What I say, okay, I get it
*  Don't want to I don't know what nobody sound like play some tones
*  And watch floors lava
*  Let it be a yeah meditation is great
*  Yeah, there's like those are the kind of things that are very they're very popular at times like this like we want cartoons almost we want
*  Things that are silly no stakes
*  It because you can it's so much
*  It's so much news and every area has so much news right now
*  So if you want it, you can get it right now because every state has its own individual corona situation
*  So you can kind of get lost in the i'm getting you know
*  lost in the
*  california and
*  Illinois because that's where I am where my family is but then it's everywhere else
*  And then you kind of feel oh, yeah, Atlanta's been open for a while. They're shooting stuff in Atlanta
*  They've been shooting and filming for a month. Oh, what's going on here? What the fuck going on there? So it's just if you
*  I was able to do it earlier
*  And kind of oh
*  Shut off and get off of socials at one point and then
*  Things got more intense to george floy thing and then I got back in the news again like really looking at stuff and
*  and uh
*  And yeah, I need a I need a cleanse
*  I don't think people are supposed to take in the news of the whole world
*  I think it's very bad for you. Yeah, I think because most of the news you're gonna get is the news of things that are dangerous
*  So you're getting things that are dangerous all over the world
*  So it gives you a distorted perception of the current danger around you
*  And it's yeah, you think it's everywhere and it's not and most of it isn't actionable where you use it's news
*  You can take him. Okay. Well, i'm gonna do this right? Nope. It's just you just take it like that's happening
*  Just get scared and or you so
*  Yeah, man, it's uh
*  Yeah, you gotta figure out how to keep it keep it mellow man. I watched uh
*  marble races
*  The marvel olympics they race marbles they race marbles, but the guy
*  The who sells it is the announcer
*  because he just
*  He just
*  He's locked in the entire time. So he's created they created this world
*  Where is these marble and there's different teams the same way nascar a different team
*  And so he talks about it in such a way. He doesn't break at all. You know, nba
*  Announces they veer off this weekend. I was that they know the marble guy he holds the concept together by just
*  You know the marble races the 12 and you know last week he talked about other races last week
*  They got they beat him by 0.3 seconds
*  And how do they race marbles? They just drop them off. Uh, they just roll them. They just roll them. This is it right here
*  Yeah, and they just uh
*  He just says they're cheating like what if someone oils the marbles do they get arrested no humans on camera at all
*  Is this one guy or a couple people off camera marbles in the stands? Look at that last week tonight
*  They just that's new they've gotten big sponsors now. Yeah, that's happened over the past few months
*  But yeah, this video was a million views of marbles. Oh, yeah, you gotta hear the commentary the commentary is what it
*  desperately trying to better
*  Their last outing you don't have to it's like it's real olympics
*  Qualifiers and trials and finals and but there's no people at all and look at the stands. There's marbles in the stands
*  Yeah, we're losing our fucking minds. We're losing our fucking minds, but that's been going since 2016
*  uh
*  Is that's oddly compelling but is longer ones too. It just shows the importance of
*  Execution over ideas are important
*  But execution is really important because that's top-notch execution of what could be a terrible idea in the wrong hands
*  Marble race you give me marbles and it's not gonna be that
*  Yeah, some people are designed to be a commentator for marble races. That's their thing. Look at this one. It's got like a little elevator
*  Escalator takes you to the top conveyor belt. What's that? 1.3 million views on that
*  That is so crazy a bunch of people watching marbles while the world burns
*  Yes, I got a zone out me. Yeah, I get it. I get it
*  So Ghana have you been before? No, I've been to Nigeria and
*  In Kenya, do you know anyone over there? I know a couple folks actually what what really?
*  I told my brother I was thinking about it and he says oh one of my my old friends from work
*  Is from Ghana. Let's all have a call and
*  so we get on the call and then I
*  Think I'm thinking he's gonna say oh restaurant recommendations
*  It's just you know, some type of fluff kind of helpful
*  But but the heat's at the strip trip so serious where okay
*  We're gonna have you meet these people if you want to work on this
*  We're gonna have you do this and you know
*  And so it made me take it so serious where it went from being kind of an idea to I guess I'm doing this
*  Wow, I know it's gonna be kind of
*  Laid out in a real structure way. Well, sometimes it when I've traveled I don't I haven't planned
*  Thoroughly like that. So I think it's uh, it's gonna be exciting man. Just to get in the whole whole different zone
*  I'm still young ish to live in another country. Look you're not married. You don't have kids
*  This is the time to do it. Fuck it. Yeah, why not? You know, and
*  You've been very smart with your money, I know you you invest in real estate
*  So you've got a bunch of shit going on. It's making you money
*  Why not fuck it? Oh, it's a good move. I like it
*  I like the idea just of doing something like that where you completely take yourself out of the normal life
*  Because for a creative person, I think you can run dry like in terms of inspiration
*  Experiences, I mean obviously there's a lot of chaos around us right now
*  There's a lot of things to draw from but something like going to Ghana all of my I've been making
*  I've been making some music and so
*  Is this a show I've been doing called smoking at church. It's got James Earl and
*  Jamil Bruner and it was my first time
*  Being around a group of people in a while that I didn't know when I got invited to the studio
*  Five or six people this is pre my mushroom rooftop party freak out
*  But I get to the studio. It was real nerve-racking like man. It's five people in here. Oh, am I gone?
*  And it was
*  Resocializing again
*  Hello
*  And eventually calm down actually took a shot for the first time and I hadn't drank since beginning of
*  2018
*  but I took a shot just to commemorate being around a group of people again and I was I hadn't drank since then without
*  and so
*  Started making music with them. That's been my one place. I've been going to besides working at my spot
*  I mean, you know hanging out and then just going there at three total places that I be is anybody getting tested
*  No, I think we're just going on the you don't seem like you dying act
*  It's been you know, I think mostly we keep it in get tested
*  Yeah, you want you tested today and get you tested sure. Okay. All right
*  We're sitting here, you know, I'm gonna schedule it right now
*  So it's my songs that I started coming up with
*  They were only about vapes because that's what was happening in the studio
*  Bring a vape somebody stole a vape from the studio or I was smoking on nicotine vape and then it was a bad vape
*  So it gave me the edges. And so I got about four or five
*  songs that are just about vaping because
*  My experiences have been really limited
*  Right now and I haven't been digging in the past. Maybe I need to do songs about
*  Muay Thai
*  Muay Thai tracks. Why not? Yeah. Muay Thai I'm out here. They call me elbow
*  You know, I'm getting it. You think you gonna beat me hell? No, my roundhouse is wack
*  But I'm about to kick you back. Yeah, I'm lighting up the pads catch me up and chang my I
*  Can't kick my leg high
*  But the elbow hit you right in your temple and then you won't be nimble you'll be all limping
*  It requires a little work, but there's something there
*  Yeah, it's just you got to get it out and then you rewrite it now when you go to Ghana
*  Do you have like a plan of what you plan on doing or like what would you want to just go there and write?
*  do you want to go there and just experience life and I
*  think I
*  Would want to I want to go there and
*  Yeah work produce
*  Maybe even start directing out there. Are there regular flights there?
*  Oh cuz a lot of places are quarantine like I know some people that try to go to Italy
*  Yeah, they found out, you know, even though they're letting people back in Italy. They won't let Americans
*  I think by the time I think by September I feel like but who knows this one
*  But there's there's been initiatives
*  In Ghana that they're trying to get black Americans to come live there
*  So I think they would uh, the Ghana Ghanaian government would smooth out the trip
*  But what I mean would it be hard to catch a flight?
*  Like how many flights are going to Ghana right now out of New York?
*  I mean, I'm hoping that things change in in September. I was looking at a site
*  Cuz there's now this sites like what's going where can you go? Right?
*  So I was just looking cabin fever web searching where can I where can I go and so it has each country
*  It's world of Nomad or something like that. We're like, this is what's going on. You can't go there
*  They're only accepting private flights to certain countries that you can fly private there this place you get there
*  quarantine for 14 days, so
*  so it's such a
*  Such a weird zone. I thought about going
*  to Newfoundland before the the US and
*  Canada border was closed cuz I started getting
*  Panic and I was looking at places that had low amounts of cases and I saw Newfoundland
*  You know what?
*  Maybe I go to Newfoundland and then Trudeau and Trump they started talking about closing the border
*  The Canadian US when I said shit do I I got it's now or never am I gonna really go to Newfoundland?
*  Of course, I didn't go but it was Newfoundland is interesting. They're really into curling up there
*  I did a show up there and I made fun of curling and people started going hey
*  They were mad. Hey, they were mad, you know, I think of Newfoundland
*  I think I pull up this photo Johnny cash moose hunting in Newfoundland
*  Here's another photo that we need to get turned into one the big metal prints
*  This is a Johnny cash wearing like regular clothes like an old-school rifle like
*  1965 or some shit like that moose hunting and there he is. Hey
*  Johnny cash
*  In Newfoundland there he is. Look at that. That's the photo. That's the one that's the one we need
*  That's the walkie the walkie talkie. He called. Hey, I see a see a antenna. I see a moose on
*  on the
*  Horizon, I see the moose
*  Shoot it in its eyes
*  Johnny motherfucking can't don't try it. I'm in Newfoundland
*  Shout out to man. I would have loved to meet that guy. Is that a guitar gun? No, that's just a gun gun
*  That's a moose head right there son
*  Lot of moose in Newfoundland. Look at that walkie talkie thing. He was a baller with that thing back then is
*  That's like a refrigerator with an antenna was size and set a walkie is Johnny look at look at him holding on to it
*  That's crazy
*  They probably use them to locate game
*  You call them in call them in you got to pretend that you're a female moose that wants some dick
*  This is how you call me
*  That's the moose call yeah, that's what it sounds like and they start today slow walk or they run up they they slow walk
*  They don't trust you. Yeah, they come slowly and they make their way around
*  Usually they circle like you could call a moose in and it could take hours before it comes to you
*  Like you could call a moose and then it gets dark and you're in your tent you hear something stomping around the tent
*  It's a moose looking for pussy and then you got to kill it. Well, you really can't you can't see it
*  The dark in the woods. It's fucking dark
*  Like you can't really take an ethical shot unless the moon's out and most places have laws against that. Okay
*  You know, I'll just shoot at night
*  Oh
*  Hands up fair
*  Sound like that's how bad they want dick. Oh
*  What's the ethical shot versus a unethical shot?
*  You want to have a shot that you know for certain you're gonna hit the animal in the vitals and it's gonna die
*  Okay, if you just take a shot at an animal that's really far away. You can barely see it. That's an unethical shot
*  Okay, you might hit it but you might not but you really want as an animal that's like standing still
*  Broadside so you want it's standing because if it's the animal standing straight at you you have to hit it right here
*  You have a very small like maybe a softball size area
*  No, like a cantaloupe like a cantaloupe size area that you can hit where the heart is
*  But if unless you have a rifle if you have a rifle it opens up a realm of possibilities
*  I'll take a frontal shot with a rifle. But if an animal standing broadside, then you have a very large area that you can hit
*  I thought an ethical shot is when the animal makes eye contact
*  I fucking hate this life do it. These bitches are moaning by the time I get there another moose is always there
*  I'm depressed. I hate my job
*  And when they when they walk in they make noises
*  That's what the moose does the male moose the bull
*  Gotta make a moose sounds
*  mixtape sound
*  It's one of the few animals that like anybody can make the noise
*  You can't make an elk noise elk noises are hard really? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah when you I'm good at noise
*  Like specific noises I can sometimes sometimes I'll get them. Have you ever heard Michael Winslow?
*  But every now and then as a noise and I I got it
*  He's the only guy that's made a career out of noises like if you say like a noise guy like Michael Winslow as comedians
*  He's the known noise guy Pablo a little bit. Okay little bit. Yeah
*  But either way, he's not doing an elk sound
*  You've heard an elk scream. No pull up a video of an elk scream. It sounds like some Lord of the Rings shit
*  It doesn't even sound like a real animal when you hear them in real life. It's it like gives you goosebumps
*  It's like holy fuck like if you didn't know what was making this sound you would think there were demons in the woods
*  Okay, have you heard them scream like this when they scream? It's the bulls
*  They're screaming to let the cows know what's up and to let the other bulls know to step the fuck back
*  Okay
*  Nope
*  Yeah, you're gonna do that one. You need a tube. You need like a Phelps alcohol
*  Yeah, Phelps
*  You'll get drunk you'll be like Kitty Dukakis
*  They're actually making two sounds at once which is already enough for us to do it's a whistle with a roar
*  Okay
*  And then the females have a different sound
*  Can't do the noise of the female either females like a mew it's like a it's a weird sort of noise point is
*  They make crazy noises
*  No
*  Johnny Cash Johnny Cash hunting Newfoundland Newfoundland Johnny Cash moose
*  At the noises soundboard and then you said
*  Making the app you say you gonna get the app going with the Joe Rogan
*  moose soundboard and
*  They don't get it. Absolutely expensive. I don't think there's a lot of value in a
*  Sound board with animal noises sometimes you just gotta do it for the love of the game
*  It ain't about hey about turning a profit every time man. You take some L's for fun. I
*  Wish it was easier to make an app. I've looked into having apps made it's fucking complicated
*  You ever made an app or had an app made?
*  No, I haven't I haven't had one made it's complicated
*  Uh
*  Yeah, you gotta I mean I guess you get a you gotta get some people I'm thinking about having a game made really
*  Yeah, what kind just uh on Roblox? Oh, no
*  My kids are addicted to that fucking game just a game made based on the comedy special loosely. Oh
*  Like all the subjects that you talk about in the comedy special
*  I'm not sure about all but maybe finding one angle of it and then stretching that out like the arrest story the arrest story
*  Maybe yeah something like that
*  And then having it be in a game. That could work. Jamie told me that
*  It was Grand Theft Auto. They have like places you can go like you watch a comedy show, right?
*  Wasn't that? Yeah, for sure. Yeah, I don't I haven't played it since they've expanded it in the last like two years
*  That game came like ten years ago now. Yeah, pretty crazy
*  No, the one in New York they had the that lab factory that was in Times Square was on the game and
*  Cat Williams was on there and I think
*  Patrice and you could just go in there and watch them to stand up or eat or Patrice was on the radio
*  But Patrice was definitely on there. Yeah, you can just go in there
*  Yeah, and and watch them perform. I think JB smooth
*  Was on the radio to
*  Grand Theft Auto is uh, yeah, that's look at this. Yes cat. Yeah, that is crazy
*  That is crazy. Look at this
*  Oh
*  That's his real intro so
*  Wow
*  Well, and this is ten-year-old graphics too. Yeah, like if they did this today, but that's hilarious
*  Like they even mimic is the way he walks
*  He probably did mocahs. Yeah, I just captured him. But look it's a socially distanced crowd
*  They didn't you know, it's probably complicated in terms of animation to fill the crowd up
*  That's wild. Yeah, that's a shitty animation though. Yeah, I think they had a TV or something
*  You could just sit and let go and this might have been like a show on it or something like how strange
*  Split sides comedy club
*  Yeah, but the animation they have now there's a new video that's out now that's got the new unreal engine and we played it on
*  Here, it doesn't even look like a video game. You like you when people walk little
*  Specs of dust kick up from their feet touching the dirt. What game it's what is it's a it was basically like a
*  It was just a concept but they kind of showed like a Tomb Raider watch this. Look at this
*  You can look at this screen too. If you want us face forward
*  Look at this. This is shows you what all the pixels are but this is what it looks like
*  I mean, what the fuck man the five. Yeah, how crazy is that? How crazy is that?
*  That looks so amazing
*  Unreal engine 3 is that what it is? Yeah five five now. Look at that. Yeah, this is fucking crazy
*  So if they did that and did like you do in stand-up, they could literally get it to the point where it looks like you
*  Do in stand-up now?
*  Like look like her movements a little odd, right?
*  It's good. They call that the uncanny valley the difference between reality and like obvious bullshit
*  It's like it gets real close to reality to it makes you feel weird watching it
*  Because your brain is going on my I'm watching bullshit or is this a real person
*  Goddamn, that's amazing. Like look at the graphics. It's insane. Hey, I dove
*  Heavy into the gaming when when quarantine started did you it was I play a lot of NBA 2k
*  well play and I played more than I've played in a long time because it was just
*  Now I had no sleep schedule. I
*  was playing for
*  12 hours straight sometimes and just locked in like a crazy person cuz it was it was escape escape
*  I have a real problem with video games. We have a whole video game room back there like a land land room
*  I don't even go in there anymore. I just take away from it like like I'm an alcoholic and it's a bar
*  I can't go in there. We tell him Jamie we were playing we were playing hours every day to the point
*  Jamie was telling me I had a problem. He would leave he'd look I'm not playing anymore
*  I'm like where you going get back here bitch. He would take off
*  Go forever. It was bad, right? It was bad like hours and hours every day. We would get done with a podcast
*  I couldn't wait to go play. I'd be like good night everybody
*  Run right over there boot it up get online start talking shit and we were talking crazy shit to each other
*  Come on, bitch and just like killing each other like hours and hours and hours
*  But when I would leave I would we play quake quick champions. My hands would be sweaty
*  I would feel like like I'm nervous. I'd leave I'd be driving home and like I don't feel good
*  I feel bad like I physically was feeling bad and then I started like sleeping bad
*  I was thinking I'm putting my body through all this crazy stress
*  Like when you're playing and you're you're locked onto that screen and it's like this heavy intense combat
*  And your hands are sweating and like you're so adrenaline-jacked that when you get out of there
*  It's almost like you're drunk or you like you you just got off a drug or you drank too much coffee or something
*  Feel terrible. Yeah, the shooters can put you in a I don't play Call of Duty or anything
*  I play a little GTA, but that's a different energy
*  2k was just really I
*  Was locked in and I was doing a lot of research. I started researching how to you know
*  Upgrade your character. There's the badge system where you know, if you're a point guard you get certain badges like oh
*  You know the dimer and that means you able to pass better and so all these other
*  Specific attributes you can you can upgrade. How do you upgrade?
*  Do you have to pay you can you can pay you can or you can play and get the experience and then you
*  As you keep on getting points you get better
*  You actually get better but then it takes a while if you're not great at the game
*  so I found out that there is a service where people just will play the game and and
*  You can they'll just upgrade your character. I've heard about that for those role-playing games
*  Yeah, just gigantic multiplayer games where you you'll hire people and they have like sweat chops where people just play your game
*  Constantly even as I played a game upgrade your character
*  Yeah
*  Cuz I was trying to upgrade the character it was taking too long and it was in it and I just knew I knew that was
*  A better way and then somebody told me you don't have to do that
*  You can just pay somebody 80 bucks and they'll do it over a week and I pay somebody
*  Oh, yeah, this is much better. And so you pay this guy and then you came back with refresh skills
*  Character was on point. Yeah
*  Character was on because the thing is there's the park on NBA 2k
*  And so that's kind of open world other people have their characters
*  And so if so the park is like you're playing against other folks. You're planning as other folks
*  They got their own outfits and so you can see what everybody's rated. It's real, you know
*  It's a real social thing going on with okay, everybody's here at 95 97 you can't you hear them talk shit
*  I don't want to hear anybody I could but I don't really like talking to folks like that cuz it's too it's too direct
*  What is this guy doing here Jamie? I wasn't trying to share the guy talking. I'm trying to show the video of the park
*  So you could just see the visuals of it
*  But it's not it's it's in the middle of this guy's video. Oh, wow
*  So
*  Yeah, that's the park. There's different three on three games two on two
*  Oh, why I see you do you have to wait in line and then you get some time
*  Yeah, so you those are those little circles out of waiting spots
*  So you can either play randomly or you could come through I meet up. That's why I meet up with people doing
*  Quarantine me and my cousin. Hey you going to the park? Yeah, let's go to the park at 7
*  And we team up and then we play against people graphics are amazing. I think this is actually live someone playing
*  They have a 2k league. Yes now like most of the real teams have their own team
*  Like this is so they have standings and whatnot
*  For every else and this is what they're showing on ESPN now
*  Wow real sports, but this is close Wow
*  Yeah, sometimes you'll end up playing against one of those people in a in a random game
*  You know, oh they're processing this way differently tonight
*  They got to do I even had the same system as them because how are they?
*  Doing it now, it's all
*  consoles right it's not in the computer there is
*  the most most players on ps4 and
*  Xbox but
*  There is on PC and PC is where there's hackers
*  I don't play on PC, but I watch videos of some PC youtubers
*  and so sometimes they'll just have a
*  player that is
*  40 feet tall
*  You'll see this is this one guy Trey I think his name and it's just his videos is him watching
*  Hacker videos and it'll be somebody this their arms are going across the whole park
*  The hacker can just kind of change the dynamic of the entire
*  Park because I guess yeah, you know, it's not as secure as the Xbox server. Yeah
*  Oh
*  Yeah, yes, he's like a spider yeah, oh my god, that's so funny that is so funny oh my god
*  Of course PC people do that. Of course. That's this the same with quake
*  That was always a problem guys that have aiming bots and they could just shoot you every time you showed up anywhere
*  You would get hit like they never missed so you just couldn't beat them
*  Yeah, it's it's a different fucking you know a game you're here overcooked now
*  Overcooked is a co-op game
*  Where it's you you work in a kitchen and it's just you putting together different meals
*  I you you and you and the person are going against two people and you all have to put together the most burgers and serve them
*  This is it. Oh, I do know this game my fucking wife and my kids play this stupid game
*  Don't they make it hyped up during it?
*  Full it's so you're playing pizza making
*  Something about it that it hits a different part of the brain where you get hyped and it really shows who people are
*  Under pressure and it's it's intense. They start yelling at each other
*  Get the tomatoes cuz I was talking my cousin. I saw my cousin person. Why does this game?
*  Get me more hype than being in a war game and
*  shooting people and getting shot at because
*  Violence has kind of been you know, we'd be sensitized to a video game violence
*  At least it's not this but you know being in a kitchen is kind of almost close to real life
*  And so messing up in the kitchen
*  It does something to you. I don't know. I played it once. I was like, this is stupid as fuck
*  I don't care what happens with this pizza was your team who was on your team?
*  Remember one of my daughters see see so leadership is important in this game. I got you a covid test today at six
*  Oh, thanks. So we're good to go. All right, we'll find out what's up
*  And also I've got two tests for you the current test to find out if it's in your system and also antibody test
*  Okay, see if it used to be all right if you you might have kicked it a lot of people kicked it
*  They didn't even know it's really weird. We'll see
*  Day, we'll see what what direction will my vitamins?
*  I
*  Sometimes yeah, I started taking a good amount of I take
*  Vitamin I take some zinc. That's good some
*  vitamin B B's good and
*  Adderall that's a vitamin
*  It feels like a vitamin no D is very important D is real important
*  Yeah, especially
*  Whoa, hey, man, it's you know, hey dog, you know, you got jackets get I had no idea I
*  Just be in my house with stuff. All right, you know, I have bring some of this stuff
*  How are you feeling without doing stand-up? Is it weirding you out?
*  um
*  No, I you know dropping a special
*  Made it
*  Kind of weird just because there's a lot of movement that's usually associated with a release
*  You know, I'm going to do TV usually you in New York and LA
*  you probably pop up at the Comedy Club a couple times that week and
*  So that was that was kind of a very weird foreign feeling to have a big drop
*  And then and then that and I think that's what kind of led to me
*  Throwing a little jam on my roof was like I needed I was like it's feel too weird
*  I gotta have some type of little gathering, you know what I mean?
*  But yeah, I've been I've been getting my outlet has been music as far as it's being able to hang out and you know
*  Crack jokes and and and be creative
*  And I've been seeing it there's drive-through shows happening. I'm thinking about doing some drive-through
*  Some drive-in screenings. Birdcrusher has been doing a lot of that. Yeah. Yeah, he did one with Miss Pat and Jesus Trejo
*  It looked like fun man. They're on stage and they had 700 cars
*  that's how they put it instead of like 700 people in the audience has 700 cars and
*  There's birth got a video of it
*  It's pretty badass when the people are applauding at the end they're honking their horn and flashing their lights
*  Yeah, and he said it was like like UFOs landing. It's wild. It's all these headlights 700 cars
*  Are they all?
*  Staged at once
*  No, no, I mean they did sets. I mean they did it like a comedy show
*  Okay, yeah, cuz that's the thing that I wonder about as a performer
*  We live it grill and and trying to ride the wave. You know what I mean?
*  Look at that miss Pat. She's people outside. Yeah, I was kicking it. Look man. This is wild
*  That looks like a lot of fun. He said it was great. He loved it
*  But he did some shows he did one show in Oklahoma and it was supposed to socially distant
*  It was supposed to be a hundred and twenty people in the audience. There was three hundred and forty seven people
*  They stuffed him into the place and he was like, I don't feel safe in here
*  Like what the fuck are they doing? Like what did they do?
*  No one had masks on like ten people had masks on and this is them at the end
*  See, this is like real social distancing right now
*  As long as they're all tested and look at that look at the all the crowds like all the other cars
*  They had fireworks
*  Birds and this was Burt's idea all his idea
*  Drive-in movie theaters are making a comeback now
*  There was a there's a movie that's out now. This is fucking horror movie. That's supposed to be real good
*  I forget it's like a one-word name
*  About a haunted house or some shit. It looks fun
*  But they releasing it July 3rd in the drive-in movie theaters and then July 10th on demand
*  So like they're doing everything now like basically movies have to come out on your Apple TV or Amazon or whatever
*  Which I love I don't want to go to the movies, but I want the movies to stay open. Yeah, I
*  Maybe I'll do yeah
*  Just yeah putting a special out and and
*  It's kind of reignited. Well, I want to I want to get in front of a crowd again and and just
*  Talk some shit, man. You gonna do stand-up in Ghana? Yeah, they speak a lot of English there. Yeah
*  It's gonna be it's gonna be a great trip it was you know, my first traveling I
*  went to
*  The whole situation kind of had me feeling stuck even though I could have been making moves or doing you know
*  Say in March and April where I could have been doing stuff, but I kind of
*  Because of media and just I just kind of felt
*  Trapped in the crib even though there was still options and so towards the end of May
*  my sister lives in Phoenix, I'm gonna go visit them and stay in Phoenix and
*  Just getting prepped for the trip was so because I hadn't used my book bag in months and just all the little stuff that
*  Came with traveling when I found my book bag, it felt like you know a warrior picking up his sword
*  But it was like, oh I genuine I teared up like get my bag again cuz I hadn't
*  Oh, yeah, I used to go to shit and do shit and pick my bag up made me emotional
*  And then being there at their place as you know, I live alone. So it's a
*  family of four had two teenagers
*  so it was nice to be in a house with
*  Structure and they run, you know, they work from home now, but you know, the kids got school
*  So it was it was nice cuz I would go to bed sometimes at eight in the morning just because I had nothing
*  No, just you know going to bed at eight waking up at weird to waking up at midnight sometimes
*  It was life of a comedian had a crazy
*  Schedule man. So it was just nice to be in a scent like oh, whoa. This is a functioning
*  How oh, this is what you know?
*  Structured normalcy is it was and it was really helpful for me
*  I needed it then just being just being around him after that that time and hanging with my nephew and niece and
*  It was it was really necessary. It makes you appreciate like norm like one of the things about the lockdown
*  It makes me appreciate like meals like sitting down having meals with my family
*  We didn't we didn't go to any restaurants at all for like three months
*  And then you know, it makes you appreciate like
*  Like it made me appreciate having food because in the beginning I was thinking like what if we've run out of food
*  Like what do we do?
*  Like I have a gun and I have bullets and I know how to hunt and I know where some deer are in my neighborhood
*  I've been keeping an eye on them like no bullshit just in case just in case shit gets weird
*  Just you ain't you got no vegetables in the garden you straight to the deer
*  Well, if I was between vegetables and deer you can't live that long on a small garden
*  Yeah, you can live for months on a deer
*  Like I can shoot one deer and I'll eat that fucker for three or four months
*  Wow, but if you have like four tomato plants and like some kale you got some celery. Good luck
*  You got like three salads out of that shit. I
*  Know a few people that that ball guns when shit was first
*  Starting to go down they just
*  Yeah, a lot of people came to me and asked like how do you get one?
*  Like what do I have to do? Like they were asking people that like ordained negative about guns before I have a buddy mind
*  His wife's like you're never getting a gun. We're never having a gun in this house. It's like, okay fine
*  The lockdown happened she goes you got to get a gun immediately right away. He called me up laughing
*  He's like she told me I have to get a gun. I'm like
*  Hey
*  People change their minds they change their minds
*  You know, it's real danger, you know when shit was getting real weird and this is before the riots and looting
*  This was this was just during the lockdown people started getting nervous about food
*  They started seeing people have fist fights over toilet paper. Like whoa people are losing their shit
*  the toilet paper situation was really
*  Shocking to see cuz I just had I had lots of wipes anyways just in general
*  I just had lots of wipes on that
*  Yeah, and you're gonna be okay if you have a washcloth and some water you can wipe your ass
*  It's not that big a deal. You need food. That's what you need. I mean you could clean a washcloth
*  It's not that as long as you have water. Do you have water and soap? Well, you're good
*  You don't really need toilet paper. You're gonna be okay
*  You need food. Yeah, you don't I mean you don't want to put that in the toilet paper
*  I mean you don't want to put them that shit on the washcloths really though, unless it gets dicey
*  You do what you gotta do. You do what you gotta do
*  When it's time to go number two and the apocalypse come for you
*  Mm-hmm 2020 2020 without a doubt the weirdest year ever, right?
*  In my adulthood, yeah my whole life
*  There's no luck no time ever weirder yet a global the global pandemic, you know, I was a
*  My girlfriend lives in Hong Kong and we met out there over the holiday and
*  So she was over here Hong Kong is going through some shit right now
*  Hong Kong is going through some shit, but she had the early
*  She had the early window on Kovac. So she was heading back there at the beginning of February and
*  She was looking for masks while we were in New York and shit and this is like February
*  Second third she was looking for masks. I'm like what you need some mass to go back is the I was like
*  Why you gonna go back there is fucking great. And so I remember, you know, I facetimed she be at work
*  With a mask on just like, you know February
*  15 16th that zone and I would look at her like that's crazy. Look at
*  Look at y'all and nobody's at work. That's insane
*  What you just you just sitting there with a mask on all the time
*  Wow, what is that like?
*  I would find out
*  Normal life now, I was really oblivious thing. Oh, that's gonna that's over there
*  I got an early look at the shit and it was just like oh damn that sucks
*  You should I was really telling her that you should escape there and come here and
*  Hong Kong safer now, you should wait it out over here
*  It's so bonkers to look back at I was no come to America
*  We don't get that shit over like it's in Hong Kong man. It's insane
*  Now
*  I'm thrown crazy
*  COVID jam session who knows and then being worried about it being where and then had a full-on
*  meltdown
*  like
*  Really? Mm-hmm walked up to the
*  just try to
*  There's one thing is it on a house party, but I shut down a jam session is I
*  Welcome to the keyboard. It's like
*  Kill it. Yeah looking at the drummer like keep everybody alive
*  What we need is a test that you can just like a real quick saliva test
*  Senses style. Yeah, but just everybody walks in lick that thing. Okay, you're good. Okay, you're good. Okay, you're good
*  Oh, you're not good. Ah
*  Like know who's clean let everybody in yeah
*  I mean if we did that it would change everything if they had some sort of a test like a real easy saliva test
*  Just lick it and you know, we could wipe this shit out in a week
*  The test now is all
*  Yeah
*  Right
*  No, it's no it's easy now. Yeah, it used to be like that
*  These go deep in your nostrils like way up into your sinals sinus cavity, but now it's just the inside of your nose
*  It's nothing no discomfort at all. It's like a little q-tip
*  It just goes inside the nose they swab it around a little bit for like 10 seconds
*  They dip it into some sort of a solution
*  They send it off and you'll know tomorrow and then the antibody test that you'll do
*  This is the FDA approved antibody test. They take you just squeeze your finger like that
*  They take they put a little prick on the tip of your finger a little blood comes out
*  They put it in a thing and you know in ten minutes. Okay, it's easy
*  I'm sure you're fine. I'm looking at you right now. I feel good. I'm good at this. Trust me. Let me see
*  You're good. I think you're good
*  Have you been right do you write right do you like sit down write your stand-up or do you just like have ideas?
*  And work them out on stage a
*  Little bit of both
*  Yeah, I'll write some and then just have some some ideas
*  Here's here's my here's my Kovac game show idea
*  it's you get four people line them up put masks on them and
*  It's a it's a game show called who said that
*  Cuz everybody got a mask on you know who said that and then
*  My other one is a bad joke. You got to get these out your system before you hit it
*  Now the you know, everybody's wearing masks
*  The the bank robbers got a right robber on his mask
*  You've been spending a lot of time alone
*  This is strange
*  You know folks Kovac is great crazy
*  What is this obsession with becoming a game show host that you're having your your special
*  It's not an obsession is just me I've done it yeah, don't do it
*  It's not an obsession is just it's just kind of you know, that's the career path
*  Yeah, it then that happens and I have been offered a lot of game shows and I say not yet. They come with a large
*  Cheddar. Yeah, they haven't made it
*  Undeniable for me on the game show side yet if I was in the same position
*  I was when I took fear factor I'd take it again because it changed my life changed my life gave me freedom like real freedom
*  But it's job. There's a big difference between doing that and doing stand-up when you do stand-up. You're having fun
*  When you're doing fear factor, sometimes you're having fun, but it's a job you're working. It was a great job. Don't get me wrong
*  Yeah, that's why I think on the game show side. I really just gotta put my energy into who said that
*  The Kovac game show what if Steve Harvey retires from Family Feud? That's an easy one. I would do Family Feud
*  I wouldn't do family
*  It's an easy one survey says
*  Yeah, I remember back when Richard Dawkins hosted you in the airport and just people asking you random shit
*  Mmm
*  Good and then they just you know, we got a Drew Carey's got the prices, right? That's an easy one. It looks easy
*  I don't think it's just I don't think it's for me
*  I enjoy some of them but just me and what I think I as a regular gig I
*  Gotta be the one creating it. It's so about the true. Who said that Drew Carey seems like
*  Money, he's stacking money like and no one even knows about it. Oh Pat. Say Jack
*  Will of Fortune has been on for my entire life, right? But Pat say Jack's not a comic
*  What do you do before it will of fortune? He didn't do anything. He was born on the set
*  He's been doing that forever
*  He's not a comic though. Maybe maybe he was at one point in time. Maybe I don't think so though
*  He's not a comic. I've you ever heard of Pat's a Jack former weatherman and talk show. Hey, yeah, yeah that makes sense
*  Yeah, so he hit the jackpot but who else what are the comics have done game shows
*  Howie Mandel
*  Howie he's done a gang of them, right? He had that one deal or no deal
*  He'd more than one right and he did
*  How that was the other note that was the other note. They all stinking of something else
*  Deal or no deal was a winner like why did they ever stop that show?
*  Think they might well not live now, I think there was something like they were touring it
*  I think I don't know if it's I mean it might it would move to like CNBC instead of primetime TV
*  I still be in produce all the time like who wants to be a millionaire still on TV. Hmm
*  See, I don't think I've quite sold you on who said that so let's really dive into the concept
*  Wearing masks, you know
*  Somebody says something I would like it if one of them was covid positive
*  One of them covid positive, yeah, why just for the fuck just for the other state that season three people get bored
*  Yeah season three season three art covid but and then once somebody says something but it's not much movement
*  All right, and you gotta see yeah, yes. Yes. Yeah, you gotta get that
*  32nd episodes
*  You shoot 500 of them
*  It's on YouTube
*  It's not a bad idea
*  Who said that was him
*  Who said that was it him?
*  What's it?
*  How high did you get before you came here? No, this is me man CBD. It's the kill cliff CBD
*  These are good, right? Very addictive
*  Good for you. Yeah, I'm addicted to these
*  That actually is not a bad idea for a show
*  As long as they didn't like you could guess
*  And especially if it's like they said things
*  That were like closely related to what they did like maybe you can ask them what they did
*  Like and then figure out who would say what?
*  I
*  Think keeping it simple and quick for these short attention spans
*  Like and then maybe that's somebody that becomes a legend on the show and they just kind of it's somebody and maybe it's scripted
*  Maybe it's real but if somebody say who said that boom and they say whoa, that was fast
*  They just miss episodes over intros longer than that episode intros 15 second episode
*  Four seconds now, let me know. Let me know how this sells. I'm gonna
*  Yeah, take it out I'm gonna take it I'm gonna take it out onto you know, the video conference in circuit just different
*  Do some meetings. I think they're filming things now because Felipe
*  Had a thing on his Instagram
*  Where he said he's he's on a new show or if it might be a movie and they're they're going to the set on
*  Monday and he's all excited
*  He was talking about the protocols and all the different shit they have to do for covid
*  But they're fucking filming but what I was saying is like if you're filming
*  You have to go home at the end of the day
*  What if you go home you go out and you catch it and then you come back to the set like how often are they
*  Testing you I don't I don't I don't know. I don't someone gets it
*  Like if you're the star and you get it, what do they do? They lock the show down for two weeks and then come back
*  If the star gets it, I think it's I think I heard they say it goes by
*  Number on the call sheet and so if the star gets it then they cough in everybody else's mouth and then
*  Herd immunity and then the show goes on because you know
*  Mmm, what you say?
*  I think when I this was happening or starting Tyler Perry's production team was saying that they're gonna like lock the whole team down in
*  Quarantine together in like a one hotel and then they all go to the set so nobody leaves right? Yeah
*  Yeah, everybody gets tested nobody Tyler Perry can do that though because he's got his own right
*  He's got his own studio. He's his own boss. He's got it locked up. He doesn't have to deal with any bullshit
*  He's all non-union. He's he's like he's got a complete system
*  I think I heard they do it quick quicker than normal to they do it in a couple weeks as opposed to like a month or
*  two
*  Yeah, he's got an island Tyler Perry's got a fucking island. Yeah, that's next level
*  You don't get a island. No, no, no, I'm not interested in
*  Really no
*  You sure don't use cuz you I want a ranch
*  I don't want an island you might wanna cuz you remember I think last time I was on here a
*  Time before that I was talking about getting a Tesla and you said don't get a Tesla now. You got a Tesla. Yeah
*  That's true, but I got that because Elon talked me into it he was willing to do my show I said alright man
*  I'll do I'll buy a Tesla cuz he did my show but then once I got it. I was like he's right
*  It's dope you have one
*  Dude, they're the craziest cars out. It was like every other car seems dumb
*  It's so fast. It's it's so fast. It doesn't even make sense like it defies physics. It just goes
*  It takes off like and then you got this giant screen for the navigation and then it drives itself
*  It does drive in itself part. It's amazing. Everything's amazing about it. You can play video games on it
*  It got that fart thing too, it's got the fart thing if you hit the blinkers
*  Yeah, do that the fart it's a solid car. What kind of car you drive? I
*  Got an infinity. It's not mine. I started written
*  I was written from this guy and I was starting to shop for a car and then the pandemic happened
*  So then I just just held on to the real, you know
*  Because I didn't know if I was gonna have to escape
*  I probably drove it once or twice the entire month of April
*  You have a lot of money like why wouldn't you just get a car I was shopping for cars but then
*  Okay. Yeah, I started I was like shopping in so you're ready early March to see if you like it
*  No, I was just renting cuz I will rent through this app to a road
*  It's like every car and then I started just written directly from this guy instead of because it less fees for him
*  You know what I mean?
*  And it was just we just text and he bring a car it was smooth
*  and I was starting to look for a car cuz it wasn't making sense to keep renting from him and
*  Then you know Kovac and Kovac I was shopping for a car and then the virus came and said stop
*  The only thing I saw the car Vanna you saw car Vanna commercials. They put on who what's car Vanna car Vanna
*  It's like we'll bring the car to you and then we'll associate they deliver
*  socially distanced car
*  But they're buying in the car. How they buy a car and I don't know they bring driving
*  So they have to touch it
*  Maybe they they wear a hazmat suit. I don't know how there it is. Oh, they drop it off on a truck. Yeah
*  Car Vanna I said it Wow, they have 11,000
*  850 vehicles and they just drop it off on a flatbed and they don't even touch it
*  Wow have it or pick it up at a vending machine
*  You seem like a dude who would like a fun car you need something fun your life
*  Dodge Dart Dodge Dart on 22s
*  They're still doing that Miami I was in Miami and they had these like like a Caprice classic on giant
*  I saw a BMW 7 series on these giant fucking wheels. They look like they're 27 inch wheels
*  27 inch wheels that is the it's like a wagon like you're driving around in an old covered wagon
*  My yeah, you gotta have solid parking skills for that. Are you gonna scuff the rims on it, too?
*  You gotta be parking good. You gotta be careful with your my parallel parking game is
*  I've just given up and
*  Gone around a block again sometimes
*  Uncertainty where I've thought about just going to some type of school just a specialized
*  Just to get that parking just a parallel parking
*  Intensive course get a car that does it for you
*  Yeah Lexus there's a certain Lexus the sedan that you just press a button. It'll power all park
*  I know that I know that there's some that'll do it
*  But you want to be able to because it's not like I can't there's sometimes we're up. I nail it
*  And then other times it's just practice
*  Think about when you first started doing stand-up. I'm probably weren't as good as you are now. You got to practice
*  Yeah
*  Just just go somewhere with his cars
*  Start parking. Just park a lot. Just take a day. Just take a day. Yeah Saturday's Park Day
*  Parking parking all day with a full tank of gas. Try it on busy streets
*  That's the real thing is the pressure parking when the people behind you
*  Yeah, they're giving you room but and then you got to kind of block out that noise. Yep. Yeah speaking of noise
*  How have the fighters?
*  liked
*  being in
*  The situation now I have some some love it some love it. Yeah, I think some miss the crowd
*  But some love it because it's first of all, it's real quiet. No distractions
*  You don't you don't have the energy people screaming at you. You can just focus on the fight
*  And it's a lot like just being in a gym. Yeah, it's all like sparring, you know, so you could you could look at it that way
*  I'd like it as a comment here. I'm just like I was just
*  Just talking to Louie about Louis CK about this. I was like, I don't know if it's better. I got kind of like it. I
*  Don't I miss the crowd in some ways, but I kind of like no crowd because you could focus. Yeah, it's they're different
*  They're very they're different things like one of them is
*  insane like if you go to a Conor McGregor fight and
*  It's in a pack T-mobile arena and Sanate O'Connor's screaming singing and the fucking green mist is on the air and everything
*  It's wild. It's a spectacle
*  But there's something about the apex center where it's just me and Daniel Cormier and John Anik and
*  Fucking Bruce Buffer screaming to nobody. There's nobody in the arena and then the fighters walk out
*  It's weird and then when they're hitting each other man you hear fucking everything you hear every every shot to the ribs
*  You hear the you hear breathing heavy you hear wincing you you hear you hear all that shit
*  You hear you hear them talk shit to each other. It's it's very different. It's very different
*  There's something stunning about someone getting really fucked up where there's no crowd noise like Francis and Gano
*  Who's the scariest person on the planet Earth? He knocked out Jarzino Rosenstrike in like 20 seconds and
*  Rosenstrike is also a big scary dude, you know Francis is?
*  Fuck he's terrifying and he all he has to do is connect on people right so he boom
*  Boom boom and Rosenstrike is out cold and there's no sound
*  It's just him walking off Rosenstrike is out cold and we're sitting there going holy shit
*  This is why it's like there's no one there. There's no scream of the crowd. It's just
*  The violence of it all the explosion is so stunning. It's all it's stunning. It's weird
*  I wonder what if you're gonna take a L
*  I wonder what is better for the psyche tonight probably to not have that cheer right because then it's like a regular
*  Streetfight it is like sparring way. Yeah, you don't get to hear right 20,000 people
*  cheering your
*  As long as you stay offline for a couple weeks. Yeah, you just get off Twitter
*  That's the the fact that people go on people's social media that a fighter's to taunt them after they lose a fight
*  You know, are you gonna go square up? You just gonna you got knocked out. Yeah by a pro. Why are you?
*  Hey, it feels like a weird move to dig in. Oh, it's a bitch move. It's a bitch move for sure
*  But it's a real common bitch move. It's super it's it's a hundred percent guaranteed
*  It's gonna happen and if you get flatlined someone's gonna come along and go back
*  And they're gonna have that thing from Friday with Chris Tucker. Yeah, they're gonna have that that's gonna come up
*  Chris Tucker nice cube you're gonna have people taunt you
*  Like some guys are fine with it like Ben Askren who got knocked out by Jorge Masvidal
*  Fastest knockout in history. It was just the one-year anniversary of it a couple of days ago and he was like, oh great
*  Like he was he was saying imagine your most embarrassing moment and they celebrate it with a one-year anniversary
*  Slow-mo. Yeah, but that wasn't to it was a packed audience and everybody went wow
*  And it lasted a long time the screams and the cheers and he was out for a long time, too. I
*  Don't know if that would be better if there was no one there
*  It would be stunning if there was it. I think I like it better with no one there man
*  I don't know. I love both of them, but I might like it a hair better with no crowd
*  is it I wonder if it's too small of a sample size to
*  to decide
*  But have you seen any?
*  change in
*  Fighting styles at all or is it something different in the performance? No, I don't think so
*  Maybe they've been maybe even a little wilder
*  But I just think it's also like fighters didn't get to fight for months, right?
*  so everybody was kind of chomping at the bit and
*  Also, there's a lot of eyes on them. So everybody realized that this is the only game in town. There's no other sport
*  There's no other sports right now that are running except for the UFC
*  and the marble races and the marble races and
*  The floor is lava floor floor is lava
*  Shout out floors of life
*  Shout out the Rutledge wood. I don't know if any other sports are coming back anytime soon
*  NBA is soon. Yeah
*  you know what I heard they're working on they're working on a thing where there's gonna be an app on your phone and
*  You get to you you'll be able to make noise and that noise will be piped into the arena
*  So like each individual person like you'll have a seat. Yeah, and your seat will be making noise
*  Oh
*  Now how you feel about the most soundboard I did
*  Now we have a launch pad for it perfect NBA bubble season boom that is a profitable app
*  I have to feel that people are gonna organize shit where they're gonna like chant and say things
*  You know have fun and they're like, you know
*  Like people will there'll be things where people get together and try to figure out like maybe sing a song
*  Like you have everybody together all singing a song at the exact same time
*  Yeah, you can do you know we we don't want the virus
*  We wish we could be there but this is alright
*  Got basketballs back NBA playoff game
*  Imagine there's no
*  Amazing never know
*  Well, listen, one of the things that's come out of this is like a lot of people have gotten real creative with shit
*  You know, they've found ways to make things interesting. They found ways to have fun. They found ways to
*  I like when people are confronted with real adversity and challenges because you get to see how the human imagination works
*  See creativity. Yeah, it just you know
*  for me it helped me kind of I
*  helped me think about the other people in my life and who I work with and just how to
*  Highlight and produce for them better since I was able to sit. Oh, I was thinking about my uncle
*  Kelvin he
*  Used to deal at casinos in Chicago area from mid to late 90s early to probably 10 years or so
*  And so he's a character and so oh we should do a and I had a kind of gambling problem for a little bit
*  Did you yeah, what kind?
*  sports and
*  Casino a lot of sports when you say gambling problem like what what made it a problem
*  What made it a problem is that it was really taking up a lot of time and I'd never gotten to real
*  Trouble just because I was you know constantly working. I had great weeks
*  I had bad weeks, but it was just if you're
*  You know betting on stuff every other day or whatever then that means you're kind of
*  Until and not able to function most of the time and this when you were drinking a lot, too
*  This is when I was drinking a lot to it. So I was drinking and gambling
*  Getting in game whoo and then getting up at midnight
*  No, that was that was that that's quarantine sleep schedule
*  My regular regular sleep schedule is you know drunk stuff, you know four or five a.m. But how'd you kick it?
*  Kick the gambling habit the gambling. I had to just really take a look at what I was doing
*  and then what how was serving me and
*  Look at the other stuff that I was doing and that's also gambling investing
*  So realizing I had that outlet it just wasn't in sports or
*  You know throwing some dice, but you can gamble by you know investing in a company early
*  You can gamble by getting a building you can gamble by you know trying to produce your own show out of pocket
*  All of these other things are game more. Yeah, sorta. They get more of an invest though
*  It's an invest, but if it you know investments go bust companies
*  You know people to put you know millions of dollars billions into companies that quibi that
*  So that was an investment and people they were really hyped about it and real big checks
*  Yeah, so it was really realizing that and just realizing that you know when I am when I was you know
*  Looking at a game and just take up time because I would get really into it and
*  research the history with teams and look at all these other matchups and
*  So I could actually I could spend that time and and mental energy on something else. It's more productive. Hmm
*  Well, that's a wise way of looking at it, but a lot of people don't when they get sucked into something
*  It's very hard to get like we were just talking about video games about my addiction to video games
*  I just had to go cold turkey
*  I just had a step away and go I can't fucking do this anymore and just I figured it out and I stopped but
*  That's not easy to do sometimes like sometimes look whatever it is about gambling
*  Like whatever switches that pops off in your brain that gives you that dopamine charge. Yeah, it's I mean
*  There's certain bets
*  That are just super pleasurable if you if you bet
*  The total in an NBA game if you bet over
*  And you're there live
*  The total is say the total is what you know what the two teams will score 200 points and that's you're rooting for every score
*  Everybody everybody you're just yeah. Yeah free throws you like yeah free throws
*  So to have you know a couple grand on a game and you're rooting for both teams live
*  I don't know you do wrong with this guy. Yeah any total any total score?
*  Yeah, you hockey whatever soccer you if the goals are over three then you rooting for both team
*  You don't care if it's you know two to two or four to nothing a fifty four like that's exciting
*  Yeah, the over bed is
*  Super high Jamie you gamble a little right? Yeah. Yep. I came on fights, too, right? Yeah
*  Gimbal on the over. It's more fun to gamble on the over under on rounds and shit, too
*  You're like don't don't hang on hang on right, right, right? Yeah
*  Who did I?
*  Try to think of some memorable fights. I had some money. I think I
*  had I
*  Had rumble Johnson against
*  Texara Oh
*  That was a brutal knockout. I had yeah, I had rumble over everybody except Cormier
*  Yeah, for whatever reason Cormie's got his number, but rumble hits anybody they go night night. He's coming back
*  It he's bored she's coming back might come back as a heavyweight. Oh wow. He's huge now
*  I mean fucking huge like 250
*  gigantic
*  I'll tell you the my craziest gambling story
*  I told I've told it on stage, but this is the most this is where it was like it was really
*  bonkers
*  So I started I was I was bedding with a bookie
*  But I'll use a site, you know
*  But it was you know, if I won the guy was sin sin money
*  He's saying a bunch of money in $500 money orders or
*  You know, I would just send a PayPal whatever and it was it was like that
*  But the thing was that since you could just do it like that. It made it you like sending a text
*  You just doing on the site is so it doesn't it's not the same as
*  holding the cash and
*  And bedding where you really have to think about is you just typed it real quick
*  And so you're doing you know these large bets
*  So after a while my tolerance was I needed more and I was on a hot streak
*  And so I asked my friend for another bookie with a higher limit
*  Cuz the limit on my one was like two grand
*  And so he found this is he knew this guy that do five thousand a game
*  And so
*  But then it's five thousand on the honors so it's not you're not putting up five each time cuz I was putting up five
*  with my physical
*  He's time I probably would but because it was like five here five here
*  And I had a hot streak
*  I was betting on a lot of hockey at this time and I was getting I had a hot streak on how you so much of my
*  gambling buddies Bozeman and CJ they started calling me hockey Hannibal because I was
*  Vegas Golden Knights were doing really well that was their first season and
*  Black Hawks were hitting some stuff so I was doing parlay so if you parlay a
*  $5,000 bet with you know with the total or something then that five is you know
*  1215 win so I had a good run after a week I
*  was up a hundred thousand cash and
*  And I love a hunt and so and it but I'd never put in any money so I got this
*  100,000 from type and so I meet up with the guy in Chicago and
*  and
*  I mean I pull up next to his car and he and he had me a hundred grand cash and a brown paper bag whoa
*  Did you do like the demean more thing we throw the money on the bed and roll around naked no
*  I put it on the table and kind of just really looked at
*  I kept it for it considering. I kept the catacombs. I just put it on the table like what the
*  Just yeah
*  Dollars and all hundred it's not
*  Great it's a lot, but it's not you know it's not massive
*  It's a couple. It's a few stacks. Yeah, and
*  It was it was what so because
*  There was no real
*  Effort to get that money. I didn't value it like that and so
*  In my head the gambler's mind is not happy. It's like it won't and so I like you know what?
*  Let's get him for a hundred more and the next week proceeded to go down
*  Go down 90 grand
*  And so he starts hitting me up hey, I get that 90
*  And
*  So I was too prideful at the time. I didn't want to give him the cash
*  I just want he we had an agreement to do PayPal on some stuff
*  But he of course it wasn't for anyone to do PayPal for no 90
*  He do PayPal for you know it was two three, but I was in a zone
*  I don't want to I can't deal with giving this cash back
*  and so
*  And
*  So he's asking for I'm paper and I PayPal him the 90 grand and then
*  He sends that shit back
*  Now we plant hot potato playing internet hot potato with $90,000
*  and
*  And yeah, and so it was just really it was intense cuz I was just and then he hit me up
*  See we see you gonna be in Brooklyn
*  And so I try to I puff up and just kind of say you don't want to show up to Brooklyn dog
*  I'll make sure you I tried to talk some shit to the ticket
*  Hey, man, you don't come to Brooklyn you gonna get touched. I don't come to my show said that yeah
*  I just I texted that thing that don't come through Brooklyn. You said you're gonna get touched
*  Texted I was just trying to I was out of my mind. I was on tilt man
*  I
*  Was being ridiculous
*  Cuz I wanted I didn't want to welch, but I just didn't want to pay like that and so
*  Eventually, you know you tried to pay we sent it back and he eventually just took it but
*  Yeah, that was that was actually took what the the 90 V of PayPal even though that probably was a heat
*  You know, yeah, that's bad for the taxes. That's bad for taxes or whatever
*  And so I actually called him this week to have all that. Yo, sorry, man
*  I was bugging back
*  Says yo, that was poor form on my part my bad. I don't gamble no more
*  Sorry to put you through that and bring heat on you and and it wasn't aren't but it was that's that was the wildest one
*  Man, why was I it just had me in a in a in a real irrational zone my friend delete all that
*  My friend
*  Friend Dana White the president of the UFC. He lost a million in a day. Yeah a million
*  Playing crap. Well, it's point. No blackjack. Yeah playing blackjack
*  Million million dogs. He won seven million in a day
*  Seven so he's doing crazy shit. Wow. Yeah, that's it and he's very wealthy
*  So like the only way he's getting a charge is if he does some crazy shit
*  Yeah, that's that's madness. That's some is is intense
*  So hand sweaty I get hand sweaty talking about that like oh god
*  Cuz I don't ever want to be that guy but I could be that guy
*  Like if I got into gambling I I was gambling for a while on the UFC before I decided probably wasn't a good look
*  This is like the early
*  early
*  2000s but the early 2000s it was stealing money
*  Right because there was a bunch of guys coming in like Anderson Silva and I would look at the odds with Anderson Silva over
*  Chris Lee, but I'm like are you out of your fucking mind?
*  This is a hundred percent fight like bet the house on the Brazilian Jesus Christ
*  There was a few of those and I did it for a while and then I stopped but my business partner in on it
*  He's gambling all the time
*  So I would just sit down with him before the fights and so I was like this way my conscience is clear
*  But we were like 85 87 percent
*  Yeah, like is stealing money because I know all these fighters
*  Yeah, I know the fights like there's fights where a guy would be like slightly favored
*  I'm like slightly like this is a hundred percent fight or there's a guy that was the underdog
*  They're like, this is totally lopsided. This is and still to this day. Sometimes they get it wrong still to this day
*  I'll look at someone like I'm like, how is that guy the underdog doesn't make any sense
*  And then the fight will be like a domination by the guy was the underdog. I'm like, okay
*  I should have bet that yeah, but I don't bet on them
*  But my business partner at on it man, we made all he made, you know, I made it for him
*  But we called a lot. I mean literally high 80% it was just stealing money
*  Yeah, yeah, that's barely gambling. That's kind of gambling. But that's like I mean, let's say gets gambling fights are crazy
*  Anything can happen but some shit, you know, right when you know, yeah
*  Yeah, I remember hitting you up for tips sometimes before the like hey
*  Would you like on did I ever fuck you over did any of them ever turn bad?
*  I think most of them were solid most of them were solid when I when I hit you up
*  So my uncle so it hit me. Oh, we should me and my uncle should do a gambling podcast
*  Since I had he's still sort of have some focus
*  He's he has it from the dealer perspective and he gambles too, but he's seen it's a it's a fascinating perspective
*  Just to watch from that side
*  Where you're facilitating
*  People losing lots of money and you get paid with 10 15 hours an hour and you're just kind of the messenger or you're helping
*  And so his stories are wild man. And so sitting in quarantine. Oh, yeah, we should do that
*  gambling podcast idea and that's easy to do and we can do it remotely for now and
*  And then we tried we tried one out and it was it was a good feeling. Oh, yeah, this is a good
*  Is a dope show it's fun to do and we can you know
*  Get other gamblers on and just really talk about and just of course not encourage people
*  I think I gotta have something up top like this is not an endorsement to gamble
*  I'm just telling the story we do not gambling you might lose your shit. Don't spend your college money. Don't spend your zoom college money
*  Don't spend your
*  kids teleconference
*  lecture fun, but
*  Yeah, yeah, it's really what it was the craziest when he said like what's the nuttiest gambles that he saw
*  He's just seen people lose, you know a few hundred thousand in a in a in a quick sitting, you know just and
*  Yeah
*  He's just seen people really fall apart and and people really I was fortunate but some people really lose their whole lives
*  Just
*  Awesome on chance on some cards on some and they go crazy to you know crazy lose and they can't believe it
*  They just want to jump out of a fucking building
*  That's why when you go to Vegas all the windows and the casinos they don't open wide up, right?
*  They don't let you just jump off because there would be people jumping off every couple of days
*  Yeah
*  You think all the hundred when Vegas was wide open all the hundreds of thousands and millions of people coming in there and how
*  Many of them are just blowing insane chunks of cash. They don't pay for those places on the buffet
*  You know, that's not what pays for those big buildings. It's people can't lose it losing. I watched this
*  documentary on
*  Amazon
*  That
*  Something on the edge gambling on the edge of some way is a car-counting guy and
*  It's just you know
*  It's just mostly just him getting kicked out of casinos hidden camera footage because they just come up to him
*  Hey, we don't want your action anymore. Where does that you can't count cards. You can't be good at what you're doing
*  No, I mean that's never not in that business
*  Hey, you can they say you could play any game here except for blackjack. They kick people out
*  They people get beat up. They kicked Dana out of the palms for winning
*  Yeah, and you know, so he pulled the UFC from the palms. It's like fuck you
*  Because they didn't know was him why he knew was him and they know what yeah
*  They used to have the fights there and then they kicked him out of there. They see you can't gamble anymore
*  He's like what like you you were fine if I lost but as soon as you win, they'll just put the kibosh on you
*  Yeah, they had to take that
*  I mean the casino business they were one of the first companies to start asking for long like four days into the
*  Lockdown they started at y'all been whooping motherfuckers for years and years
*  And the world shut down for a few days and you get your hands out
*  Yeah, there's a lot of businesses needed money constantly coming in. They can't just exist
*  Yeah, like the way they are they're set up
*  They need that and no one ever thought it was gonna there was gonna be something that shut everything down where no money was coming
*  in for months and months
*  That's never happened
*  Like you can't make a business model based on something that's never happened before so everybody thought the money was gonna keep flowing in
*  Yeah, it's this was actually the first year
*  That I had kind of planned out the entire year
*  Before I got had a full-on
*  Okay, January I was supposed to do like the porn Awards, but I ended up not doing it
*  The AVN Awards, I think so
*  Then February all-star weekend March was South by Southwest April was a 420 thing
*  May was something June was I was gonna go to the Olympics and then
*  Like I had you know, I wanted to have one major event each month
*  That was the first time I planned out the year before just to have experiences
*  Yeah experiences and then kind of build the the tour around it, you know, go to the Olympics also do some shows in Korea
*  And around Japan a little bit and and then it was like nope
*  That was like when did you film Miami nights Miami nights? We filmed August of last year. Oh, wow
*  Yeah, why were you holding on to it so long? It was just
*  Just getting stuff right and and
*  Yeah, we filmed it twice actually I filmed it in February of last year and then didn't like how it came out
*  And
*  Then I did it again both out-of-pocket shoot. Oh, wow. Yeah
*  It was but it was the right decision to do it again. How many shows did you film?
*  Two shows each time I do for right I do for now
*  Yeah, I did two before and I did it in Denver the first show some lady heckled
*  My oh my god that bit's dead now I'm fucked now I have to get it right on the second show
*  It's a lot of pressure with the people one bit though. If you if you really fit it. Yeah, it was a big bit
*  It's a big bit. Yeah, there's a bit that led up to another bit too. There's a lot to it
*  It was they they piled on together. Yeah, and the way she did it. It was like, oh, come on prove it
*  I was like it wasn't even a good heckle. Yeah, it was like
*  Give me some time dummy. I know what I'm doing here. Yeah
*  But uh
*  Then I did four and when I did four I did four for triggered and I did it out-of-pocket
*  Like Netflix had a certain amount budgeted out
*  But I said I want to do four and the idea was that if I did four
*  When I went on stage for the first one, it was like it was a regular show
*  Like I had no nerves. I didn't have feel like oh my god
*  I got to get this right if I get this right my second show will be loose. I didn't feel that at all
*  I just went out with ah, it was just totally normal
*  Which one did you use most of the footage from out of four?
*  Triggered I think it was probably the second night
*  But on strange times my last one a lot of it was the first show because I was just so
*  Pumped up right out of the gate. I was so excited. Yeah, and I was ready like I
*  I've done specials before where I didn't plan enough
*  But now when I do a special I treat it like like I'm training
*  Like I want to be like like I'm running a marathon like I put those miles in so when I get onto that stage the
*  night of the show
*  everything's oiled up right everything's just
*  Greased and smooth and just every words in place and the experience of doing stand-up is so deeply ingrained in me
*  It's just a nightly thing every night two three shows bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang
*  And so when I'm done like I want Saturday night last show like I am fucking done with this material
*  I don't even want to hear these jokes anymore. I did it. I'm done
*  Nice break. Yeah it uh it
*  So yeah, we filmed in August. I did a screening in
*  November the beginning of November
*  Because I didn't want to send it to folks first to shop. I would rather
*  Had an event for it. I wanted to kind of create
*  An experience around it versus somebody kind of watching it all dry in that office, so I threw a party you know had
*  Some weed mint company weed drinks, you know food truck
*  We made a mixtape just for the food truck and had I wanted to have his whole thing
*  and so then
*  Got some offers
*  But it just didn't just didn't feel
*  Great about them and just once
*  You know I had an offer in the beginning of March
*  And then I was sitting on it for a little bit and then in May
*  I mean I agreed to and then I decided I'd rather
*  Drop it on my own because the world is crumbling and so I need to mix it up
*  Mm-hmm, so I'd rather you know give it a shot because if I put it up there
*  The
*  Benefit would have been oh, I'm touring I'm gonna tour in the fall and
*  It'll fill up the the tour go crazy because it's up there
*  But then that went away and it's like well now it doesn't it doesn't look as great and so I'd rather
*  Gamble on my own and just see what's up, so decided to put it on YouTube and see what's up
*  Yeah, I think it's a good move to put things on YouTube
*  Worked out real great for Andrew Schultz mark Norman worked out real great for him. He loves it
*  Yeah, he's got like more than two million views like a like a couple of weeks
*  Yeah, it's been it's been a month of some change for him because I mean I was tracking his just to see how to know
*  One thing too is it I could take that shit down right right I could
*  Re-edit actually some bits that I might put that Thailand bit back in there
*  But I thought the king it's so just the freedom to be able to you know what this is the other addition
*  Right and that people oh I can take this down here it is with only the French
*  Redubbing I have some French voiceover person do the bits and that's that's gonna be up for this week
*  and so it's just the
*  Just let me be creative and try more stuff and and it could still go to one of the places afterwards
*  It's just right now. I'm doing what I want with it and then and you know yourself
*  Yeah, you could edit it all yourself. You don't need anybody
*  Yeah, I think that's gonna be a lot of comics gonna look to that is in terms of accessibility right now Netflix has the market
*  Cornered but Amazon is sneaking in gaffigan had a real good experience at average at Amazon
*  And he said that they got real excited about it. They had a lot of a lot of views
*  They were very excited. It was the most viewed hour they had in a long period of time
*  so he said they're gonna do more but
*  The thing about doing something on YouTube is everyone can see it
*  The whole world and you see it on your phone
*  Instant like that anytime you want you're on a bus. You're on a train driving in your car. You can listen to it instantly
*  Yeah, people shared a link more so than they would share the other link
*  Yeah, and they share a link and you never have to worry about if you have the app everybody has fucking YouTube
*  Yeah, and even if you don't have it your browser opens up and you get it. Yeah
*  Yeah, so I'm uh
*  We worked hard on it man. It's one just because of the the situation with the the false arrest
*  It's uh is really is super personal
*  Cuz I kind of had to keep living that story every time I told it
*  and then live it in the edit and
*  it's uh, it's just a funny situation to you're drunk and
*  This guy is arresting you for going back into a bar. I think so. It wasn't that bar
*  I hadn't been in that bar. You went to a different I went to the bar after we spoke
*  I went to the bar, but he was still he was upset about what I said, so he follows me into the bar
*  But then you know, they they made they cut it on their body cam footage
*  They cut it made me look he really left his post and follow me to be on bullshit. So
*  Yeah, we probably he went up getting fired I
*  Don't know I don't think I think he's still on the force for now that's abuse
*  Yeah, that's the it's a lot of sort of emotion and emotion a lot of ego based
*  Policing on the on the super petty side, you know
*  Where there's obviously that you know the issues on the extreme with the killings that was a terrible
*  But then there's a lot of motherfuckers that are ruining lives with petty arrests
*  Somebody got to go they got to miss work or something or some some do you don't?
*  Some do you don't
*  Get mad cuz they got looked at the wrong way. Yeah, and then people I go to so
*  It's a lot you a cop should be able to handle somebody talking a little shit to them drunk
*  You're a cop in Miami
*  You should be used to motherfuckers talking a little drunk shit to you without you putting the cuffs on them
*  And if you can't you shouldn't be a cop shouldn't you're supposed to be better than us?
*  Yes, because it's less of you. You should be better than us
*  You should have the mental fortitude and that like freak out because somebody says some shit that you don't like and you have extreme
*  Responsibility you have a gun on your hip in front of everybody
*  Like it's not like whether or not I don't know you have a gun or you might have a gun
*  No, you definitely have a gun. It's right there and you're allowed to shoot people you're allowed to it's part of your job
*  You're trained to shoot people. It's part of your job. You have to be
*  Elevated you have to be above
*  Normal discourse you have to be able to handle all kinds of shit and the reality is that's not the case with most people that
*  Are police officers? Yeah, man, even that cop I was I was walking away from him
*  Mm-hmm, but I was just talking hella shit because he just followed me into a bar
*  And so I'm walking away and and so that shit was really you know, I
*  Say is
*  Absolutely
*  Instigated that situation, but it wasn't an arrestable thing and the cost I had to pay for that is
*  Is pretty high as far as this, you know my public shit on there just for a drunk night
*  Just for talking some shit and I'm on TMZ. I lost some corporate gig
*  Because of that cuz they just saw it and then oh you got arrested. Ah, they just wiped the gig
*  it was a decent pan, you know, it was a
*  It was a hockey Hannibal type of gig
*  In that race so it was a
*  It was it was a rough. It was a rough little time man that after that soda to finally kind of
*  Get the piece out get the special out even just putting it out Friday like a huge
*  weight like none of the other specials because it was
*  The other specials kind of done on a two-year clock too and they were kind of and this one filmed it twice out-of-pocket
*  It's a super it has so many other elements that made it
*  Really heavy and that's and you have to close with that too. Yeah had to close with it
*  And that's why through a kovac party. I'm sorry
*  I'm sorry about the party. I just I just needed to blow off some steam
*  Those mushrooms will let you know if you fucked up too. Oh, man, they would let you know
*  They'll drag you they would drag you to the darkest part of your imagination
*  Yeah, man, it was like oh set and setting is everything super important
*  That's why they say silent darkness is the way to go set is setting at a kovac party
*  Yeah, I'm mushrooms thinking you killed everybody think you go to some funerals. You're looking at people vibing out
*  Yeah, what did I do?
*  I did this oh
*  Man I don't envy cops. I don't I would not want that job. It is a very hard job, but I
*  You know I'm I'm I'm an optimistic person generally, but I don't know what's gonna come out on the other end of all this shit
*  This is get into those kill clips, huh? Yeah, man legit. I
*  Don't know what's gonna come out on the under the other end of this bring Sam Harris now
*  I
*  Forgot about that for people who don't know
*  Hannibal and I did a podcast well we got hammered and then I had a podcast afterwards with Sam Harris
*  And I think was Josh Zepts. Yeah, who's an Australian?
*  TV presenter now
*  And you guys got into it about he was pulling up stats on police brutality or or violence with?
*  cops and
*  And I was like faded
*  I
*  Was not in it. I should have left
*  After that podcast after after we but I just stuck around. Oh, we're drunk. I'm drunk
*  I called I did call him a human PowerPoint presentation
*  There was something I think it was just being so faded and in that tone. He was
*  Yeah
*  Well, it's the touchiest subject in all of history cops killing people that's the touchiest subject
*  You get killed by the people that are supposed to protect you especially unjustly, you know, I mean
*  Nothing else would have made that the these protests the way they went down
*  Like that George Floyd video to see it so obvious
*  Where there's no if-ands or buts that is what it is
*  It is a cop who's supposed to protect someone he's killing somebody in front of everybody
*  It's being filmed by a 17 year old girl. Yeah
*  Doesn't have it doesn't get any heavier and that's why the reaction was the way it is. It was like a powder keg
*  It's like everything was building up. There had always been that there had always been this
*  This insane tension and then you see that it's just like
*  And we're still dealing with it still dealing with it months later. It's uh,
*  It's super
*  It's super wow, you know I was when I was driving to Arizona
*  I
*  stopped at a gas station to do
*  somebody's a zoom interview thing I just kind of I
*  Set up the tripod and my phone on the on the hood of the car and then I was hyped
*  Just it was I was like hyped to not be sitting in my computer and I was just you know
*  Look at me. I'm outside and
*  But uh because I have been I have been off of social media
*  I didn't even know the Joyce Floyd thing had happened until I got until I was driving later and my friend told me she like
*  George Floyd
*  in the Minneapolis and so
*  And this had been I think I've been 48 hours or something at this point
*  But I was on a some interview like hey what's going on?
*  I'm out
*  Outside
*  Just completely oblivious is just happy to be traveling and shit and that knowing what I was
*  Maybe 45 minutes away from knowing what was
*  Happening in the world. So they told you they didn't tell me but they probably were wondering why I was acting so
*  Lucy goosey. Did you have that jacket on? I did not
*  Have I don't know. I had some dope I had some shade song
*  It was a real I was genuinely joyful just being on the road and having that feeling again
*  and then I found how many hour later and
*  Probably look kind of kind of crazy right there little jaded
*  Yeah, but
*  it's I mean how often you off social media like that is that a normal thing for you it was
*  Well, it was the beginning of kovat I had to kind of that's when I just got into that zone and well like
*  Turn this off like just send us if you want to get some stuff up
*  Just send it to your folks have them post it up
*  And then it's better when I get in that zone anyway, cuz it's more like
*  Operating like a quarterback than it is just being in it, you know
*  Hey, let's do this this day this day this day this day and then I'm able to just do whatever I want
*  Do whatever I want, you know, right just finish writing up the treatment for who said that in verses like
*  The longest running joke
*  It's just a three hour podcast you gotta keep it weaving it in I get it I get it
*  So you did the the interview and then you found out afterwards found out after did you want to call them back
*  It was and then I get to my sister's house and it's on the TV and and it was it's heavy man
*  It's it's super heavy
*  But it's it's really just it's the training and
*  It's just it's just needs to be a high level of training I talked to Jocko willing he's a
*  Former Navy SEAL and commander and he said that they should be training
*  20% of their time
*  He said that they trained for a very short amount of time in the beginning of their career and then they don't train anymore
*  He said they should be training 20% of their time on the force while they're there
*  They should be going over how to defuse situations. They should be going over how to keep people safe. What's your objective?
*  What are you trying to do when you come up to a drive your if you're emotional of your partner's emotional
*  You got to see that and step in you defuse that situation and you step in and go hey Mike
*  Let me let me talk to this guy and then you come in and you be a nice guy
*  Figure out a way if you see someone abusing someone you got to step in step in relieve him and you take over and figure
*  Out a way to do it where the guy doesn't have to lose face
*  But you can keep everybody safe and figure out a way where they can train these people
*  With shit like this doesn't happen
*  And it's we're in this time where these these fucking people they go to work every day wondering if they're gonna die
*  They go to work every day pulling people over they're all freaked out
*  You never know what day is gonna be your last if you're a cop you're seeing people get shot every fucking day
*  I mean, I've I can't imagine
*  To look at it from their perspective to be to look at it with the the rosiest of rose-colored glasses
*  I can't imagine that you are
*  You're walking up on suicide victims murder victims. You're walking up on robbery victims
*  You're constantly around violence and death and and crime
*  They're all PTSD doubt. That's what I think
*  I think most cops have extreme PTSD and some of them can handle it
*  Some of them could just handle it and there's a lot of them that are good people
*  And then there's a lot of them that should never been fucking cops in the first place
*  There should have been a more stringent process that guy in the George Floyd case
*  You know they got into it when they work together
*  Because it's bouts is right. Yeah, because the cop was abusive
*  He was abusive to customers and George Floyd and him got into it because of that. So there was a personal element to it. I
*  Don't want that job. You don't want that job
*  I mean fuck that job, but the people that get that job and we've got to figure out a way to make it
*  Safer for them better for them better training and safer for everybody else and I don't know what the fucking solution is
*  No one does that's why we're all in chaos and the people running around defund the police like whoo
*  Okay, do you know what's what that's like? That's like New York City right now where people getting shot left and right
*  Did you see like the stats in New York City? It's crazy. Really? It's fucking crazy. It was on the cover of
*  the cover of
*  The New York Post see if you can find that about the amount of shootings
*  41 people shot over the weekend nine killed
*  Something crazy like that when they said this they've never had it like this
*  This is like since the 80s is the worst gun violence weekend. They've had in the history of the police force
*  Damn, why do you but the police hate the mayor?
*  The mayor wants the cops to stand down cops are quitting left and right the cops don't feel like they're supported by the mayor
*  The mayor is like this super progressive, you know, really liberal guy who is just has no respect
*  The police officers have no respect for him and they're quitting they don't want to do this
*  And then you've got people that don't think that they're in a place that's being policed. And so they're just going wild
*  They don't think the cops are coming. They don't think anybody's gonna stop them
*  So that and then you know, obviously with the kovat and the lockdown how many people are out of work?
*  How many people are broke how many people are just on tilt just starving and not knowing where their fucking money's coming from and super tense
*  Damn, so you can't defund the police
*  That's that's we don't want to live in Mad Max. We don't want to live in Mad Max
*  We want more funding for the police better education for the police and we all got to come to some sort of a fucking agreement
*  Cops are us mandatory
*  Meditation for the police the mushrooms
*  mushroom mushrooms for all cops they have to
*  Yeah, yeah, they had the cops gotta go to Joshua tree mandatory mushroom training. Yeah, I
*  Feel like that I feel like the mandatory mushrooms could help everybody including politicians
*  Mandatory mushrooms for politicians. I want to be in the room with like
*  The governor Newsom of California. I want to be in the room when that guy eats five grams
*  Yeah, I want to see how he freaks out
*  How do you handle it we should all be able to watch you eat five grams
*  I want to know who you are
*  When the devil comes knocking at your door
*  the floor is lava
*  Did you find the cover
*  But it said tripled over the week compared to the year before
*  That's all it was comparing it to well just the numbers though. What is that?
*  It was something 101 compared to 26 101 people shot. Yeah
*  Okay, I was wrong. I thought was 40. Hey 101 people shot over a weekend. That's crazy
*  That's crazy. That is what fucking crazy
*  For New York though New York City school skyrocket as court closures let pistol perps walk free. Whoa
*  1,800 people I think that have some sort of charge that haven't been fully charged because the courts are and you know
*  chaos
*  Whoa
*  1,000 people have been indicted with a gun possession charge where the cases are open and they're walking around the streets in New York City today
*  Wow
*  Have been charged and not formally indicted yet
*  That's just in New York City. Oh my god, that's madness 2,000 shooters
*  Running around New York. Just think of that
*  You can't defund the police folks
*  all that that crazy
*  Progressive
*  Marxist nonsense of defunding the police stop you want to be safe. You want everybody to be safe
*  You just want the police to be way better at what they're doing way better and they're gonna need funding for that
*  Seems counterintuitive right like if cops are abusive they shouldn't get money, but that's it's not going to the cops
*  The gene needs to go to education and and they need to figure out how to do it better
*  What am I a cop educator fuck am I talking about you coming to me for cop advice you fucked up
*  I'm a pothead and a cage fighting commentator. You coming to me for cop advice
*  Yeah, man, it's gonna be the fall that's why I'm trying to get about here
*  I'm gonna go get out of here by November no matter who wins in November. It's gonna be madness
*  Yeah, I want to just I want to I don't want to hear about no more
*  You know
*  versions of
*  this
*  We're not calling it urban music anymore
*  Pancakes are racist. Let me just I mean
*  It's just that the changes. I don't know just the grandstand a part of it
*  I think it and it's tough to gauge. I mean most of it is just you know they want their company to do well
*  So they write they look at oh, let's let's do it and so
*  And then the politicians are playing off it both ways you have some politicians that are playing off it
*  They're they're supporting that and then some politicians like Trump
*  He's upset that the Washington Redskins and the Cleveland Indians are gonna change their name now
*  What are the red the Redskins finally they finally broke
*  It looks like they're breaking
*  They're talking about breaking, but what are they gonna call themselves like what's offensive? I?
*  Mean the Trump faces
*  Trump faces
*  Yeah
*  We're the the Washington spray tans yeah, we're not the Redskins
*  What are they gonna call them so do we know they haven't done any there's a bunch of names, but like
*  Doesn't it like a lot of the professional soccer teams or football and Premier League and what not this could just be like the
*  Washington FC like football club literally and just run just run just be the city team
*  Do you know how valuable those those Redskins jerseys?
*  They'll still be they'll make new ones with just the you know the news without Redskins on it now
*  I know but the old Redskins jerseys is gonna be so valuable. They're not selling them anywhere now
*  They're not really all off Nike took it all off
*  Within the last couple weeks within the last couple days
*  Somebody about to start making some on wow etsy what I did
*  I thought was crazy was NASCAR just removed the Confederate flag
*  They just did it just recently
*  Last week because of right yeah, it was the Bubba Wallace thing just recently
*  Removed the kid like I didn't think it was still there
*  Like that is my hey
*  Why everybody's looking let us do this real quick everybody's let's get us to get this up out of here. That's the last ground
*  You know it's interesting man, so it's weird where this is all gonna end because there's gonna be an adjustment right there's an overcorrection
*  and then there's an adjustment things come forward and back and you know we want to get to a place where
*  People are just cool with each other and we're not there, and I'll be on my farm in Ghana
*  You know directing films
*  Living off my who said that
*  I
*  Do my gambling pocket do they have stand-up in Ghana you checked on that they do yeah
*  I do and then in Nigeria as
*  I did some stand-up in Nigeria. Did you really his comedian basket mouth that hosted us over there and
*  Did some shows with him?
*  Yeah, it was it's a lot of people perform in Pigeon English
*  Oh
*  So I would wanted to show that I went to I know what the fuck was being said
*  But oh this guy's a solid performer his delivery sounds airtight
*  But I get I'm getting nothing and so you went did your stand-up, but did they not understand you no they understand English
*  But people the perform in pigeon oh, so they preferred you to perform in pigeon
*  And when you were just doing it regular English they didn't it didn't work with them
*  No, it worked is just if if I performed in pigeon that would have went well
*  I did but I did a set it's just one of those things to where you know they want to
*  Well, I don't know what they wanted, but you just when you talk about outsider perspective on stuff
*  Yeah, and they you know okay. He's talking about oh, yeah. He dealt with our traffic. He dealt with yes
*  Yes, all this you know just hearing a
*  American come in and speak on on Lagos which was
*  Bonkers it took four hours to get from the airport to the hotel the traffic in Lagos is
*  in
*  saying and
*  It's like one of those places where people don't pay attention to lights
*  Lights I mean the the traffic so crazy on a highway that people
*  sell stuff on the highway
*  On a fucking six-laner is people I walk in selling snacks
*  I think I bought what I bought banana chips or something just a snack on and oh shit
*  Yeah, that's real Lagos traffic is oh
*  Sure it's like if New York only had the BQE and that's it that's kind of what cars are parked sideways
*  on the highway
*  Yeah, they just gave up it's tense look at that. They have umbrellas. It's a it's an
*  Existential level of traffic we well I guess this is it. I'm here now four hours four hours from
*  Airport to hotel and how far are you going?
*  Probably no traffic is 30 40 minutes
*  It was yeah
*  Is fucking insane these images Jamie, what do you what are you googling so people can Google along with you?
*  Like a Nigeria traffic. This is it folks. This is insane. There's people standing in the middle of the highway with umbrellas
*  And not not a few people a lot of people. Yeah, it's uh, oh
*  My god, this is crazy. Oh
*  My god, it's everywhere
*  Yeah, yeah, you know it's some stuff you take for granted over here
*  Emissions standards and you just accept them. Yeah. Yeah, it's kind of
*  But I remember we
*  We were behind this a semi truck and it let off some shit into the sky
*  That was so like smoky. Oh this shit my crazy
*  my my friend Babylon said
*  He said Captain Planet would have a fit with this shit just cuz the smoke was so crazy
*  This video is what is this video title? That's a slum. I love slum. It's a 4k drone video and this is all water
*  So these houses are in water
*  Just barely above the water on sticks. This is fucking crazy
*  And all everything's on fire. Look at that. Oh my god, this is madness
*  That is it but it's amazing that so many people live there and
*  Then you know, this is just what they accept people just get used to a certain way of living and
*  For them, I mean it's probably normal life for you or for us we go there
*  I'm like what the fuck but the once you're in the mix the shit is dope
*  I had a great time and you know go on to different spots
*  What's the food like there food is great
*  It's a lot of spice on stuff
*  But I haven't been to Ghana yet. So I'm excited about Ghana
*  Yeah, Lagos is is is an intense spot doesn't China has been
*  Investing and buying up a lot of they've been invested all over Africa kind of building
*  Infrastructure everywhere they say it's yeah, they're doing a lot in the Congo as well
*  there's a lot of mineral rights and stuff there they're taking there a lot of
*  Precious elements and stuff things that they use for cell phones and all kinds of stuff like that
*  Yeah, I've never been to any place like that
*  But I've been to Mexico City and I was stunned by the air quality there too
*  Mexico City is madness man. I took photos of it and I put it up on my Instagram
*  It looks like I'm flying into a fire
*  And see if we could find that like I took like as I was flying and I was like this is this does not even look
*  Real it looks like you could you could barely see the buildings because it's just fought. That's it. Look at that
*  That's not a fire. That's my phone out the window
*  Crazy wait, are you saying the smoke? Oh, yeah all that smoke in the background. Yeah, that's all just emissions
*  That's not a fire
*  Like you can see like a mile or two out and that's it everything else is just clouds but it's just it's just exhausts
*  Yeah, a lot of the big cities a lot of the cities in India had the same issue Bangkok. I remember
*  Take I had an option and maybe take a seven or eight minute
*  uber or do a 15 20 minute walk from somewhere from my hotel in Bangkok and
*  I
*  Did the walk but when I got back to the hotel I felt
*  Filthy I felt the pollution on my skin. It was my worst walk decision
*  And look at that image from Bangkok. Yeah, god damn. That's crazy
*  That is that that's like you're in the middle of a raging forest fire
*  like you can't
*  Yeah, I remember this getting there man. Oh
*  I took I had to take a shower just from that walk. It was cuz you sweating and it was
*  It was next level when I was in Mexico City. I got a headache. I was like I'm getting a headache just from the air and
*  Plus it's that altitude Mexico's pretty high up there and there was for the UFC fights
*  Which was really crazy because they're like 8,000 feet above sea level. So there's thin air and then bad air
*  It's a combination of both things. Yeah
*  So they train it in
*  Yeah, they well some of them like Fabrizio over a doom. That was when he beat Kane Velasquez
*  he went up into the mountains and he trained actually higher than 8,000 feet above sea level and he went out there way in advance so he
*  can acclimate and
*  He was in superb shape because that and then Kane who's usually known for his cardio actually gassed out
*  The Kane Kane didn't know that he was training like that. He couldn't go there early
*  He came out like two weeks out and that's not enough
*  But they say you're actually better off going there the day of than going there two weeks of
*  Two weeks before because two weeks before you're actually you're not gonna acclimate. You're actually just gonna be tired
*  You know because your body's still trying to figure out what the fuck is going on. Why is there no air?
*  We're lucky man
*  We're lucky and there's a China is even worse in some cities man
*  There was one city that I saw in China where there was so much pollution in this video that it looked like the sky like it
*  Was nighttime and it was during the day and it was just coal just burning coal in the air just particulates
*  The air was like a dark gray. It was crazy. See we find that it's like
*  It's it's weird to look at because you imagine like if that was your mom living there or your daughter or your
*  Family if this is where you have to survive and you have to look up into that sky every day
*  It's like a like a Judge Dredd movie, you know, it's doom
*  Yeah, man. I couldn't yeah, I struggled just in Denver
*  When I was out of shape and I had a gig in Denver and I was drinking a little bit
*  At one point I started forgetting jokes
*  And I hadn't smoked a drink before the show but I was unhealthy but I was blanking out and
*  Then another show my breath short up. I had to step off stage to go get my inhaler
*  I told Tony Trim and DJ say man
*  Play something real quick. He starts scrambling and shit. Yeah, you have asthma. Yeah
*  Yeah
*  But I would don't fucking suck
*  High altitude. Yeah, it was out. Yeah asthma high altitude and in bad shape is
*  Is a terrible combination have you found any that shit from
*  China in the middle of looking I had to pee and I was about to go run and pee
*  We can we can wrap this up. We're almost at six o'clock and that's when we find out
*  That's when we find out whether you got the
*  Do I got the kovat do I have it I don't think so who said that put in your bet
*  Send it to my Venmo
*  Miami nights right now Miami nice available on YouTube
*  Next time when you're coming back from Ghana, I need to know you know what that was like. We need to talk
*  Yeah, man back and I'm gonna write a book. Ooh
*  Have you have you ever thought about writing a book before this?
*  I have I had a book deal in
*  2013 what happened I
*  Realized that I would have to write a book
*  I have a lot of respect for people have done it because that's a thing like you if you're an author like you've really done
*  It you really wrote a book. That's a big deal
*  Hey, it's just you know, I think it's
*  like once you lock in on what you want it to be and then just force yourself to
*  So it's a focus my friends have done it though like Tom Poppo or Norton or Whitney they say it's fucking brutally hard
*  It's a lot of work. It's an extreme amount of effort
*  Did they work with I wonder?
*  I guess it's just finding a good editor too and just what the what the angle is
*  Just write down everything right? Yeah, you know just kind of let it fly and then and then cut it down
*  I had a book deal once the editors there were so it was so annoying
*  Talking to them. They essentially wanted me to take my stand up at one point time
*  Just transcribe it
*  I was like I'm not doing that and like their idea of what it wanted to be or what they wanted it to be versus
*  My idea I just gave him the money back
*  I'm like I'm not doing it. Damn. That was like more than ten years ago. Yeah, that was before the podcast even damn
*  Yeah, so probably I'm gonna do it actually we supposed to
*  We were supposed to do a
*  People still hit me up about we we talked about doing a gig
*  Was it Newfoundland or was it somewhere else something crazy like that might have been Newfoundland was it Newfoundland or was it?
*  It wasn't Nova Scotia
*  Somewhere weird somewhere weird somewhere Canadian. I'm still down for that
*  Let's do it when things get normal 2021 when I'm back
*  Back next fall the king of Ghana tour
*  Come see it at King of Ghana in Nova Scotia. Well, thank you, sir. Always a pleasure, thank you man
*  And your YouTube special is available right now and check it out
