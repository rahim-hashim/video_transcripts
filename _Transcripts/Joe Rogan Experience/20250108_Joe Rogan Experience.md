# Joe Rogan Experience #2253 - Theo Von
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [January 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day! [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6.0s)]
*  Who sings that? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=16.0s)]
*  How dare you? How dare you say who sings that? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=17.0s)]
*  No, who's, uh... [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=20.0s)]
*  Angus Young. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=21.0s)]
*  No, Angus Young is the guitarist, right? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=22.0s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=26.0s)]
*  It's, uh... [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=27.0s)]
*  God damn it. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=28.0s)]
*  My brother used to beat the shit out of me with that music. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=30.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=33.0s)]
*  And then, before him... [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=35.0s)]
*  Bon Scott. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=38.0s)]
*  Bon Scott died of a drug overdose, right? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=39.0s)]
*  Oh, man. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=41.0s)]
*  Is that how he died? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=42.0s)]
*  Just went too hard. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=43.0s)]
*  That's the thing. It's that moment where you're like, do we want to go any harder? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=45.0s)]
*  I saw a video of Angus on stage the other night, like, recently. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=49.0s)]
*  He's like, seven years old. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=54.0s)]
*  From ACDC. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=55.0s)]
*  Going ham. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=56.0s)]
*  Old fucking dude. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=57.0s)]
*  White hair. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=59.0s)]
*  Just dancing. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=60.0s)]
*  See if you can find that video. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=61.0s)]
*  Just dancing around on stage. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=62.0s)]
*  Carl is still up. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=64.0s)]
*  He's like, Dad, you didn't even put me down yet. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=65.0s)]
*  It takes three minutes. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=67.0s)]
*  It takes three minutes to calm him? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=69.0s)]
*  You got a whole system? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=71.0s)]
*  It's usually three or four minutes, and then for sure seven or eight, he's asleep. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=73.0s)]
*  And get him a weighted... [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=76.0s)]
*  Do they have a weighted blanket or not for him? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=77.0s)]
*  No. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=79.0s)]
*  I don't think they do that for dogs. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=80.0s)]
*  He doesn't have that much anxiety. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=83.0s)]
*  He's pretty big. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=84.0s)]
*  Does that really work with people? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=85.0s)]
*  I feel like there's other ways. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=87.0s)]
*  There's that one video that really like, kind of weak kid who gets trapped under one or whatever. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=89.0s)]
*  Oh no. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=96.0s)]
*  At that birthday party. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=97.0s)]
*  How big is the blanket? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=98.0s)]
*  I mean, it's like, I guess it's like 80 pound test or whatever. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=100.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=103.0s)]
*  I have a threat. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=104.0s)]
*  Like a Marlin blanket? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=105.0s)]
*  Marlin line? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=106.0s)]
*  I mean, I don't know how heavy the threat was, but it's like, he's trying to text for help or whatever. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=107.0s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=113.0s)]
*  Oh, so it's just a joke. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=114.0s)]
*  No, no. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=115.0s)]
*  It has to be a joke. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=116.0s)]
*  For real? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=117.0s)]
*  No, he was really trapped? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=118.0s)]
*  Yeah, it looked like he was very much trapped under there. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=119.0s)]
*  Oh man. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=122.0s)]
*  He was very, I don't know, say malnourished or unnourished. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=123.0s)]
*  He just didn't like to eat or whatever. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=128.0s)]
*  One of those kids that only eats nuggets or whatever. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=130.0s)]
*  Oh well, nuggets are better than just chips. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=132.0s)]
*  At least nuggets are some kind of protein. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=134.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=136.0s)]
*  I mean, some kind of. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=137.0s)]
*  What do you think Bobby Kennedy's going to do when he gets into the White House? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=139.0s)]
*  Did we start? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=143.0s)]
*  I think we're starting. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=144.0s)]
*  Are we rolling? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=145.0s)]
*  I've been going. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=146.0s)]
*  Yeah, we're rolling. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=147.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=148.0s)]
*  Do you think they're going to get rid of nuggets? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=149.0s)]
*  See, here's my take on, like I was just reading this whole thing about Chick-fil-A, and they [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=151.0s)]
*  were saying, this is the most dangerous food in America. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=157.0s)]
*  The number one burger, Chick-fil-A is like the number one fast food sandwich, chicken [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=160.0s)]
*  sandwich, and there's a fucking thousand ingredients in this. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=165.0s)]
*  Yeah, just don't eat it every day, stupid. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=168.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=171.0s)]
*  I eat them. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=172.0s)]
*  I'm healthy. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=173.0s)]
*  I'm real healthy. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=174.0s)]
*  You just don't eat them every fucking day. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=175.0s)]
*  You enjoy them. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=178.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=179.0s)]
*  You don't. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=180.0s)]
*  It's not your primary diet. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=181.0s)]
*  Yeah, if you're going over there every day or whatever, leaving your kids at home to go [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=182.0s)]
*  get one or something. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=186.0s)]
*  If you're lying. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=187.0s)]
*  You're just fiending. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=188.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=189.0s)]
*  You're just fiending for Chick-fil-A all day. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=190.0s)]
*  Well, they're so good, and they come in that little bag. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=191.0s)]
*  It almost has that. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=193.0s)]
*  They come in the unmarked bag, you know? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=194.0s)]
*  This is a paid advertisement for better help. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=196.0s)]
*  Life is kind of like a book, and every new year is the start of a new chapter, except [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=199.0s)]
*  in this case, the pages are blank, and you can write whatever the fuck you want. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=204.0s)]
*  Maybe you're working towards buying a new home. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=209.0s)]
*  Maybe you want to learn how to garden or pick up hunting, or maybe you want to work on your [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=211.0s)]
*  relationships. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=216.0s)]
*  However you want your story to play out, it's going to take work, dedication, and a little [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=217.0s)]
*  bit of help. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=222.0s)]
*  Even the greatest authors have an editorial partner to bounce ideas off, and that's nothing [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=223.0s)]
*  to be ashamed about. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=228.0s)]
*  If you need some help living the life you want, therapy is always a great place to start. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=229.0s)]
*  Therapy is for everyone, not just people who've gone through a major trauma. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=234.0s)]
*  It can teach you valuable skills, like how to cope with stress, how to communicate better, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=239.0s)]
*  how to set boundaries, and more. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=244.0s)]
*  One of the best ways to get into therapy is better help. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=246.0s)]
*  It's entirely online, so it's easy to get started and more affordable, too. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=249.0s)]
*  And as the largest online therapy provider in the world, better help can provide access [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=254.0s)]
*  to mental health professionals with a diverse variety of expertise. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=260.0s)]
*  Write your story with better help. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=264.0s)]
*  Our listeners get 10% off their first month at betterhelp.com slash JRE. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=266.0s)]
*  That's better, H-E-L-P, dot com slash JRE. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=272.0s)]
*  I went to a football game the other day, three of them. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=277.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=280.0s)]
*  Feel good, still work out, still feel healthy. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=281.0s)]
*  The key is just don't make that most of what you eat. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=284.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=288.0s)]
*  Every now and again, a little Chick-fil-A is not going to hurt nothing. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=289.0s)]
*  Yeah, treat your lady, treat your friend, treat yourself. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=292.0s)]
*  Treat yourself. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=294.0s)]
*  Get off of work. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=295.0s)]
*  I'm going to have one today. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=296.0s)]
*  I'm going to get me a double-double from in and out. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=297.0s)]
*  Fuck it. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=299.0s)]
*  That's a lot, though. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=300.0s)]
*  Double, just get a regular one. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=301.0s)]
*  Nah. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=302.0s)]
*  If you're going to go hard, go all the way hard. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=303.0s)]
*  See, I'm the guy who I would get two singles instead of getting a double. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=306.0s)]

*  Mexicans and Puerto Ricans and the Mexicans would always say that the Puerto Ricans didn't work hard enough [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=641.92s)]
*  Like the discipline like some of the Puerto Rican guys are maybe more talented [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=649.3199999999999s)]
*  But the Mexican guys were known for discipline like some of the great Mexican boxers like Julio Cesar Chavez one of the things about him [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=653.3199999999999s)]
*  Was his volume was insane. Yeah his knowledge of boxing was insane [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=661.66s)]
*  But his volume was insane and the only way you could have volume like that is if you have supreme conditioning [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=666.3s)]
*  And what does volume mean volume punch volume of punching Wow you ever watch Julio Cesar Chavez one of the greatest of all time [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=673.06s)]

*  Because when he was in his prime [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=701.28s)]
*  He one of the greatest fights of all time was him versus Meldrick Taylor and he not no trick Meldrick Taylor [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=703.1999999999999s)]
*  Who's an Olympic gold medalist phenomenal boxer and he knocked out Meldrick Taylor with like 10 seconds to go in the final round [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=709.24s)]
*  Hmm [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=716.16s)]
*  He made his toot cry. I look his hair should make me cry who's that again? [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=718.4s)]
*  That's is that the dude from red clay strays. That's his brother [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=722.12s)]
*  Looks like he could be his cousin that wants money from him [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=729.36s)]
*  My cousin the boxer shit that looks like it looks like fucking machine gun punching [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=733.4399999999999s)]
*  This is so I don't know why he made this toot cry [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=740.8399999999999s)]
*  But just go get me a highlight because we don't have the time to like to watch him break this dude down [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=743.14s)]
*  Give me just like a Julio Cesar Chavez jr. High excuse me Chavez senior highlight [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=748.02s)]
*  She comes from silver spoon those guys you got one of their jackets on man. You you're wearing a red case [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=752.8199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, they're great man. Thank God. This is warm. So in the 1990s [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=760.66s)]
*  He was the fucking man [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=765.6999999999999s)]
*  He was the man he was I forget what his record was before he had his first defeat [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=768.64s)]
*  But there's something crazy like 80 or 90 fights before we had his first defeat. Yeah, I had to let it go [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=774.0s)]
*  Bro, and just is there a highlight of his knockouts. Oh [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=780.6s)]
*  Just give me a highlight of like him beating the fuck out of people. He was so good, dude [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=785.0s)]
*  Look at this. He about to cook this bro. That was Meldrick Taylor [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=790.04s)]
*  Oh [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=792.9200000000001s)]
*  So Meldrick Taylor and him had an epic fight where Meldrick was winning the beginning of the fight the Meldrick was very good [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=793.44s)]
*  And he's no drink. No, that's pernell Whitaker. That was a fight where he [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=799.0600000000001s)]
*  Probably shouldn't have won [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=803.0s)]
*  But they gave it to him and a lot of people including myself watch that and think pernell Whitaker got robbed pernell [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=804.6400000000001s)]
*  Whitaker was like the slickest of all of the [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=811.0400000000001s)]
*  American boxers of his era [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=815.44s)]
*  But Julio Cesar Chavez just broke Meldrick down later in the fight what made him so good and what made him well [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=818.12s)]
*  It's you know, what makes a fighter [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=825.2800000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of things but he didn't stand out in terms like he wasn't faster than everybody or hit harder than everybody [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=826.9200000000001s)]
*  He's he was a volume puncher so he would put guys away by breaking them down [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=834.5600000000001s)]
*  He would break their will and crush them [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=839.44s)]
*  That was what he would do and he would do with this fucking mean look on his face when he's just at the end of fights [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=841.6s)]
*  When he had guys broken he would just overwhelm them and swarm them [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=847.08s)]
*  He was one of the most terrifying guys because he can keep his pace up 12 rounds. No fucking problem like iron chin [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=851.48s)]
*  But different, you know, it's like who else that's the final punch that dropped Meldrick Taylor [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=857.96s)]
*  Wow, and that was one where it was a fucked up call because Richard Steele knew that Meldrick Taylor was out [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=862.6s)]
*  But there was really only two seconds left in the fight [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=868.44s)]
*  But he still has to wave it off because the dude can't fight right so it's kind of crazy [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=870.84s)]
*  So all these people were mad at Richard Steele because if he didn't do that Meldrick Taylor would have won the decision [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=874.96s)]
*  So he stops the fight with like two seconds to go. How many seconds was it when he called the fight off? [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=881.0400000000001s)]
*  I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say two seconds might have been five seconds [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=885.76s)]
*  And what were you doing that situation then? [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=889.72s)]
*  Well, he's doing the right thing [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=891.48s)]
*  The ref the referee is there to save the fighter if he takes one more punch in those two seconds and that one punch kills [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=893.2800000000001s)]
*  Him right that's him. It's on him [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=900.6800000000001s)]
*  Seventeen when he went so seventeen he goes down well, so let's see what happens [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=903.24s)]
*  So he gives him the count which is a standing eight count and then he looks at him [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=907.12s)]
*  He asked him a couple of questions. Give me some volume [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=911.12s)]
*  So look he's not looking at the clock he's looking to save this guy but look at look at the what look at him [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=915.64s)]
*  Look at him [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=922.92s)]
*  Wow, he looked him in the eye he wasn't there three seconds left, but he's doing the right thing he's doing the right thing [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=925.8s)]
*  It's crazy if there's three seconds left, but he is doing the right thing [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=932.0799999999999s)]
*  It's because the referee's job is to make sure that they stay alive. Yes [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=935.9599999999999s)]
*  Protect the fighter because a fighter wouldn't make the right choice. You're saying right? [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=939.8s)]
*  That's why that's why a referee has to protect the fighter from a cut [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=943.16s)]
*  Like if the cuts too bad the referee has to call it or bring in a doctor to call it [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=946.7199999999999s)]
*  There's some times where the referee it's it's a judgment call and sometimes they get it wrong because they're human [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=950.5999999999999s)]
*  But it's a crazy job. They have the hardest job in the world [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=956.52s)]
*  So the guys like Herb Dean the guys like Mark Goddard those guys need more praise because it's it's one of the most [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=959.66s)]
*  Difficult jobs in all of combat sports other than being a fighter [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=966.9s)]
*  The second most difficult for sure is being a referee Wow because you got to make these calls [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=970.86s)]
*  You do like in the middle of chaos in a world title fight where millions of people are watching [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=975.42s)]
*  Oh, and you got to keep this thing together in this very chaotic sport. That would be so tough [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=980.4599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I wonder what are the requirements to be a referee like how much you know like to be one of those [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=986.42s)]
*  Like Mark Goddard or this courses you can take you know [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=993.42s)]
*  I know Big John McCarthy was very instrumental in [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=997.9399999999999s)]
*  Educating people Herb Dean's very instrumental in doing this was a lot of these guys [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1002.3399999999999s)]
*  Mark Goddard, they they'll put together seminars and help guys that are coming up and there's probably a formal [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1007.0999999999999s)]
*  Final like what is the website that's like best for if someone wants to go and learn how to be a referee [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1014.3s)]
*  But you know probably just pull up in Memphis and start blowing the whistle on a bunch of most of them are massive fans [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1020.18s)]
*  Of course most of them train like Mark Goddard trains. I believe Mark Goddard's a black belt in jujitsu [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1025.94s)]
*  I'll have to check that I heard Dean. I know had a few MMA fights [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1032.06s)]
*  Oh, so they also have a lot of them also have experience [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1036.12s)]
*  Mm-hmm [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1039.34s)]
*  You have to set up some you have to know what's going on because sometimes especially in like [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1040.5s)]
*  Submissions and things like that like if things get complicated real quick [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1046.02s)]
*  Yeah, like someone not letting go of an inside heel hook and like that's a scary one [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1049.68s)]
*  There's like do you remember who Samar Paul? Hi, Raz? Oh [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1054.96s)]
*  No way is that his name was to Kenya which means [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1058.78s)]
*  Tree trunk that's like his his nickname who Samara is Brazilian Samar Pahara's he was the scariest guy of all time [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1062.72s)]
*  Because he was all leg locks and he was built like a tank. He was like five eight [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1069.4199999999998s)]
*  185 pounds just just fucking ball of muscle and he would dive on dudes legs and just rip them apart [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1075.74s)]
*  Oh like a pipe and when I go wouldn't let go of the legs so guys be tapping [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1082.1599999999999s)]
*  He's the only guy to ever get kicked out of the UFC winning [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1086.34s)]
*  Because he was holding submissions. They kicked him out. They said you can't do that [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1089.78s)]
*  What do you mean? You can't do it? You can't do what a let go and the referee says stop [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1094.06s)]
*  Oh, he can't crippling people. Oh [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1098.12s)]
*  You want to see a highlight that makes you cringe pull up who's small Paul? Hi, Raz submission highlights [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1100.6s)]
*  Oh, I don't want to see it [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1106.1s)]
*  Jake Shields punched him in the face after their fight because he got a hold of a camora Jake tapped and he still kept [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1107.6s)]
*  Cranking on it. He would do that with guys. He just was a pit bull. He wouldn't let go but there's [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1113.62s)]
*  Unsportsmanlike aspect do you feel like sure that's unsportsmanlike at a certain point? It seems like it is [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1119.8s)]
*  Yeah, you know you're gonna cripple a guy, you know, if you keep twisting on a knee [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1124.1s)]
*  He's gonna have to have surgery, you know if a person taps that you let it's supposed to be that's it [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1129.16s)]
*  You know and there's the heat of the moment stuff [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1134.42s)]
*  But then there's some people that just do it over and over and over again and there's you know folks are going to that [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1137.02s)]
*  So what look at he would do man. He would just get a hold of guy [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1143.98s)]
*  Look and he's still he's tapping and he's that was with John Fitch show that one again [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1148.18s)]
*  So he's tapping so he gets this kneebar. This kneebar is awful. Look how bad he's tapping and he's still cranking still cranking [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1152.42s)]
*  Wow, yeah still cranking [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1159.7800000000002s)]
*  So it was like he would hold on for an extra second or two [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1161.42s)]
*  Which is more than enough to destroy and they kicked him out a second doesn't seem like a long time unless you're caught in a [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1164.5s)]
*  Kneebar that seconds that's an eternity where you your knee is getting exploded and you're tapping and he won't let go [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1169.42s)]
*  You got to let go [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1176.98s)]
*  When the person taps yeah when the referee stops the fight you got to let go immediately [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1179.3s)]

*  Conversation you mean the when people think that people have been co-opted [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1450.98s)]

*  100% you would think oh someone replaced Alex Jones with a fake Alex Jones, but he would tell you if that happened [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1539.56s)]

*  it's generally frowned upon to have a fake account like [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1572.72s)]
*  It seems like it would be a fun way to fuck around online [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1577.88s)]
*  I don't have one but it seems like it would be a fun way to fuck around online [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1581.08s)]
*  It takes a lot of time. It seems like yeah, but you could have like a fake account [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1584.16s)]
*  Where if you if you're a public person, you know like Elon Musk and you want to say some wild shit [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1587.96s)]
*  But you don't want to take responsibility for it [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1593.16s)]
*  You just want to shitpost like everybody else like an anonymous person. Oh, that's true. He can't do that really [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1595.2s)]
*  Yeah, I would say that would be a smart thing to do it did it was it really him [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1600.28s)]
*  Did they find out is that is that unethical that when one person can call themselves, you know cat turd? [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1604.32s)]
*  You know, that's a legit name for a dude [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1610.4s)]
*  I don't know anything about that cat but he can that guy could just talk about anything [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1613.24s)]
*  He wants to talk about but if Elon Musk does it well, he has the responsibility of his public image [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1617.2s)]
*  Right like if you it's I don't have a problem with either one of them [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1622.9s)]
*  Yes, I know you just want to shed your skin [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1626.5s)]
*  You just want to take a layer off and you want to relax at the house [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1628.26s)]
*  You want to kick your feet up and yell something down the hallway? [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1630.7s)]
*  You shouldn't yell right and that's what he wants to do. I think you should be allowed to do that [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1633.58s)]
*  Yes, this is one of the problems with making the internet, you know, like taking away the anonymity, but here's my question [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1637.64s)]
*  Because of that, right? [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1645.22s)]
*  So if people can just have fake accounts and people should be able to which I think they definitely should be able to do [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1646.38s)]
*  Because of that though, then you have to wonder when you see arguments [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1653.14s)]
*  how many of these arguments are real people in their real opinions and how many of these arguments are a [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1656.8400000000001s)]
*  This giant block of accounts that's been purchased by a large organization [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1662.8200000000002s)]
*  That is hiring people or using AI to have arguments with people and in sight things online [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1667.14s)]
*  It's not zero percent people now [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1675.5400000000002s)]
*  No, I'm I'm saying like if you have a personal belief in something like no, they're not boss because I think that way [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1678.7800000000002s)]
*  I'm not saying that you don't believe what you believe and I'm not even saying that you're wrong. I'm saying [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1684.7s)]
*  That if there's any hot button [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1691.14s)]
*  cultural topic [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1693.8600000000001s)]
*  You can fucking guarantee that some of the people talking about it aren't real [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1695.46s)]
*  Either they're not real in that these are not their real opinions [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1701.58s)]
*  They're being told to say these things or they might not even be a real human. They might be an algorithm or [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1704.98s)]
*  They're a bunch of people that have been hired [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1713.06s)]
*  whenever there's hot button cultural issues or voting issues or [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1716.62s)]
*  Political issues a lot of those people arguing are not real [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1721.18s)]
*  Yeah [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1724.62s)]
*  And there's a real question as to what the number are like how much of this is like real interaction between people and [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1725.02s)]
*  How much of this is? [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1731.94s)]
*  All this meddling that's being done like there's the changing the way people think about things and [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=1734.22s)]

*  Actors is they talk outside of acting. It's almost the worst thing you could do [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=2209.24s)]

*  And again, I think it should be legal [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=2254.6s)]
*  I don't think you should have to tell your fucking name if you want to talk shit about something that's going on [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=2256.4s)]

*  Would encourage criminals to go there. I would release them out of my jails and give them money to go north [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=2880.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, you just walk across to America. We're gonna pay you to do it [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=2886.3799999999997s)]
*  well, I think you have a lot of people that have like that believe in some sort of a moral and ethical code and [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=2890.2599999999998s)]
*  They feel like they don't have a place to be sometimes, you know [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=2896.8599999999997s)]
*  But there's also some people that grow up and they just got fucked by the world [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=2900.7799999999997s)]
*  They just got brought to a real bad spot and they started off way worse than you and I for sure [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=2904.2999999999997s)]
*  And that's the reality of if you want to keep a healthy society [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=2910.46s)]
*  You have to keep those fucking people out like the world is not fair [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=2914.3399999999997s)]
*  It's not fair and if you want to protect the best aspects of the world [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=2918.62s)]
*  You got to keep them safe and then spread out spread out that safety from there [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=2923.2999999999997s)]
*  Spread out that safety from there. It's not let in all the bad. It's spread out the safety [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=2927.1s)]
*  It's like the way to do it isn't to just let all the criminals in and then oh well now we all live with crime [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=2932.7s)]
*  Like no, that's stupid [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=2939.1s)]
*  The way to do it is to solve the crime problem in an area and then expand that area ever greater across the world [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=2940.18s)]
*  That is totally doable. That's totally doable. You're never gonna stop all crime, but you can minimize it significantly [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=2947.74s)]
*  With a concerted effort which is not being done [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=2954.06s)]
*  They're not doing that and there's a bunch of different things that they have to do instead of just hiring cops to fuck people up [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=2956.46s)]
*  They should train cops better. They should pay them more. They should make them more respected [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=2962.7s)]
*  Yeah, I saw the make make people appreciate cops instead of like think of them as the enemy. I agree [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=2966.2200000000003s)]
*  We always thought that cops were reliable, but then I guess some cultures have different experiences with cops [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=2971.7400000000002s)]
*  but these days cops are so diverse that it's like you couldn't have a like you'd almost have to be a [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=2975.82s)]
*  Alien or something to have a [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=2982.38s)]
*  Racial issue it feels like sometimes, you know, well, I think cops are just like all all kinds of people and [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=2985.7400000000002s)]
*  The problem with all people is they're gonna vary [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=2992.94s)]
*  There's gonna be some people that can handle pressure and and some people that can handle having power and being a boss [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=2995.42s)]
*  I've got good bosses. I've had great bosses. We're great guys. They made you happy to work with them [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3000.46s)]
*  You knew they were the boss [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3006.1800000000003s)]
*  But it was a cool situation and then you got people that are cunts just because they're bosses [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3007.02s)]
*  You got this guy that just won't stop talking down to you because he knows you can get away with you because you need the job [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3011.74s)]
*  You can get away with shitting on you. You've all had that too and those [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3017.82s)]
*  That's that's the problem with being a cop [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3022.62s)]
*  Like some people are just not good at having power over people and some people are great with it [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3024.66s)]
*  And then there's the reality of the stress that they face every fucking day. You might get shot every day [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3029.42s)]
*  You're pulling people over what is the worst thing that's gonna happen to you in your day? Oh, did someone open their door on your car? [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3034.98s)]
*  Oh, yes one whistle at you because I saw a 10 year old get their face shot in yeah, you know [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3040.7400000000002s)]
*  I saw a little girl get run over by a car. I saw [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3046.7400000000002s)]
*  horrible murder scenes, you know, they [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3051.34s)]
*  They're going upon car accidents every day. You're seeing so much awful shit [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3054.02s)]
*  You're dealing with and then every time you pull somebody over every cop has seen those videos of [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3060.22s)]
*  People pulling people over and just getting lit lit with bullets just [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3065.7s)]
*  Fall into the ground. There's so many of those videos getting your gun taken away from you getting shot and killed [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3070.18s)]
*  Yeah, I've all seen those videos. Oh, yeah, I can or Walmart everywhere a lot of that shit [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3074.3799999999997s)]
*  It's like there's just so much violence now [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3079.62s)]
*  It's one where this guy was beating up this female cop and his daughter was telling her to telling him to stop [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3081.2999999999997s)]
*  The daughter was trying to get him to stop beating this cop to death [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3088.54s)]
*  Oh, you're like, oh my god. So like that job is not a normal fucking job and [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3092.3399999999997s)]
*  When people don't have respect for it and don't appreciate it's a it's a sign of the the sickness of society [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3099.22s)]
*  It's the illness of society that we don't appreciate law and order and we think of it as something that somehow or another [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3105.7799999999997s)]
*  that it's [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3114.9s)]
*  uniquely oppressive and [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3116.58s)]
*  that [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3118.38s)]
*  With without it being there you'd have less problems [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3119.54s)]
*  So there was that that was all that defund the police thing [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3122.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, which is just we should have learned from that and I hope a lot of people did like that's a terrible idea [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3125.1s)]
*  the problem is not [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3130.9s)]
*  Cops the problem is cops are human and right they have to stay human. Otherwise you're gonna get fucking robocop [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3133.74s)]
*  Oh, yeah, so what are we gonna do robocop could easily get hijacked too. That's another issue [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3140.74s)]
*  it's like a lot of side like if there were cyber attacks like [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3145.86s)]
*  Where they wanted every? [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3150.3s)]
*  Electric vehicle or something to just go drive off a cliff [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3153.1400000000003s)]
*  They could just control like 100% if they wanted every oven to just heat to 250 degrees [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3156.02s)]
*  It is burned down every house. Sure, like if something got hacked, you know, it'd be very spooky [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3161.3s)]
*  So yeah [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3165.5s)]
*  if cops got hacked for that would be crazy and then also they could just say they hacked like like you could have a [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3166.02s)]
*  Dirty entity hack the cops and use them for whatever they want. And then who do you even sue with that? [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3171.9s)]
*  What are you gonna even you know, they don't even people you're gonna put a robot on the stand [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3177.14s)]
*  Well, you also you would have to know [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3180.58s)]
*  What kind of like hacking is even possible and whether or not it can be detected because if they're doing it wirelessly [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3183.1s)]
*  Like can they do it? Why like Jamie you would probably know this. Can you hack something? [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3190.62s)]
*  wirelessly from an anonymous account and like get into a [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3195.98s)]
*  System and no one knows who did it or is everything ultimately traceable if they could find the source of the invasion [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3201.36s)]
*  I think [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3209.84s)]
*  When you get to that high level stuff [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3211.7599999999998s)]
*  They're going the hacker like the partners that doing the attack goes through so many levels to try to hide where they're going from [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3213.52s)]
*  Yeah, so they can hide somewhat and also how many of those guys that are like operating at that level even exist? [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3219.36s)]
*  Yeah, how many of those like super high-level hackers are out there and [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3227.56s)]
*  Everybody else is just kind of at the mercy like if you like try understanding that if you don't do that [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3232.16s)]
*  No, it's impossible. So how's a judge gonna understand it? How's who's gonna understand it? Yeah, how are the cops gonna understand it? [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3237.7599999999998s)]
*  Right. It's kind of yeah, it's gotta be weird. If you know that much stuff. You're kind of in a world of your own [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3245.12s)]
*  Oh, yeah, if you're like a super Bitcoin creator type, dude, you're in a world of your own [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3249.0s)]
*  You're you're existing in the most [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3254.04s)]
*  sophisticated [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3256.8s)]
*  layers of the [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3258.04s)]
*  technological power of [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3260.36s)]
*  The likes the world's never seen before never seen anything like it and you're the people that are at the head of the code [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3262.72s)]
*  You're the people that are making AI [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3269.64s)]
*  Yeah, you're like crypto for Columbus or whatever you're the fuck [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3272.44s)]
*  Bro, that's great dude if people that's why I've said this few years people with autism are the [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3279.32s)]
*  They are the link between [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3285.08s)]
*  Regular people and machines it's that's where we're headed. It's all [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3288.08s)]
*  No in seven two generations. Everyone will have autism you won't be able to find anybody [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3291.84s)]
*  That doesn't have it or that doesn't like I'm gonna freak out if like somebody's like whistling or whatever [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3297.36s)]
*  It's it's almost like whatever the reason why more people have autism today [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3303.44s)]
*  I'm sure there's a bunch of people that think it's vaccines. There's a bunch of people that think it's environmental issues [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3307.56s)]
*  A bunch of people think it's chick-fil-a some people probably could be could be I'll take it though, dude [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3312.88s)]
*  It's so fucking good. There's no way you wouldn't take some chick full autism, dude if they had it [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3318.28s)]
*  If you like every now and then just a weird guy runs out of the back room with a [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3325.44s)]
*  Couple pickles on his back, dude. I'd fucking be like I love this guy no matter what he has, you know [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3329.6800000000003s)]
*  I totally forgot what I was gonna say. Sorry, dude [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3335.3s)]
*  It [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3337.8399999999997s)]
*  Had something to do with autism that oh what we were talking about like oh, I think that this is the end of that [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3339.2799999999997s)]
*  Man, so just imagine. All right [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3344.64s)]
*  So there's whatever the reason why there's more cases of autism most people I think [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3347.56s)]
*  Will agree there are more cases of autism now than ever before. Okay [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3353.2799999999997s)]
*  But what meaningful changes have we done if any to try to limit that or to try to mitigate that or pull that back? [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3358.4399999999996s)]
*  I'm not sure and what meaningful like like what progress has been made where you're saying like oh now we have [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3365.48s)]
*  20% less autistic kids [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3373.56s)]
*  So if so if that's not the case and yet we're in the greatest [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3375.84s)]
*  Technological time that we've ever been aware of and people have more access to information now than ever before [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3380.28s)]
*  Why? [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3385.28s)]
*  Why is it moving in that direction? And maybe that is a natural thing? [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3386.52s)]
*  Maybe all this transgender shit where everybody's like, oh my god, like I am so sick here and there's boys and there's girls and that's it [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3390.7599999999998s)]
*  maybe when you find out about [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3398.7999999999997s)]
*  plastics and the things that's happening to the human body because it's fucking with our endocrine system and it's [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=3400.8399999999997s)]

*  Attention market that is social media [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4171.34s)]
*  There has to be a few people out there that are pretending to be gay that aren't like here's a good [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4173.5s)]
*  Oh for sure. Here's a good example. There were a bunch of girls and people got mad at them [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4178.58s)]
*  Because they're hot female only fans girls and they started putting fake dicks in their in their pants [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4184.26s)]

*  Pretending that they're trans because I was getting them a lot more views [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4192.62s)]
*  So apparently the way to get a lot of views is to be a really hot trans person [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4196.5s)]
*  Like really hot trans people are in right now [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4203.38s)]

*  Like the actual cultural appropriation kind of yeah, but like hey [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4220.42s)]
*  Right [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4225.42s)]
*  Are you doing that you have a dick and you're saying you're a girl and then these girls who don't have a dick are putting [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4227.9800000000005s)]

*  It's very short-sighted because you should be pro trans even if it's fake trans, right? [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4241.46s)]
*  If that would make more people into trans people, it'd be better for everybody right no matter what now are some people [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4245.54s)]
*  It's a famine thinking are there really some people? [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4251.42s)]

*  I have not heard of that [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4260.94s)]
*  But I know that some guys do have problems with their breasts like there's a thing when guys take steroids [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4262.46s)]
*  They develop something called gyno mastica and gyno mastica is an enlargement of the breast tissue [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4267.54s)]
*  I know guys who have had to get their nipples cut open and they have to get that removed and then sewn back together again [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4273.26s)]
*  It's like a serious operation [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4280.78s)]
*  But so are some people that is that's breast tissue because they take so much testosterone [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4282.7s)]
*  That their body starts producing extra estrogen. Okay, and then they get titties as a side effect [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4288.7s)]
*  Yeah, I don't I hope I'm not fucking that up. That's what I've been told [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4294.08s)]
*  I'm pretty sure that's how it goes [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4296.7s)]
*  But the point is that's the only time I've ever heard of like with a dick and tip [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4298.62s)]

*  Yeah [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4580.86s)]

*  The worst reasons you lit a school on fire [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4601.42s)]
*  That's the worst reasons like that's not the worst reasons for going viral because why did he pretend to be trans? [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4603.98s)]
*  He came out as a trans woman. He gave interviews with public like page six, but are there people that aren't um [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4609.82s)]
*  Came out of the terms of me okay, so this guy just pretended to be trans for a long time a long time [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4616.62s)]
*  He was making a mockery of them. He said five months, so he did it for five months, so [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4621.139999999999s)]
*  What I do is an October five months later [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4626.38s)]
*  He said that he was actually it was all a social experiment on an episode of the conservative podcast prime time with Alex Stein [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4628.78s)]
*  Cider said the purpose was to expose how gullible and delusional the left is [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4635.74s)]
*  What I did is I fake being a faker he said I pretended to be a pretender [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4640.54s)]
*  But yeah, well that's right the thing is like people don't want to admit that he's correct because it makes you insensitive [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4646.139999999999s)]
*  but what he's saying is like [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4652.86s)]
*  Logical right it's logical and so what if people are actually trained or some people actually trans [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4655.219999999999s)]
*  You'd have to ask them okay therein lies the problem [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4661.339999999999s)]
*  I think there are people that are not though [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4664.299999999999s)]
*  There's people that are perverts for sure and pretend to be trans so they can go to women's rooms for sure oh yeah [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4666.38s)]
*  Yeah, that's an LA at first. I'm not accusing all of them [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4671.94s)]
*  I'm just saying it's I've seen it there's you're going to have that if you have this thing this loophole [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4674.339999999999s)]
*  It's new thing when I was a kid if a guy with a beard and a dress tried to go into the women's room men would [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4679.9s)]
*  Go in there and beat the fuck out of them. Yeah, they wouldn't let that happen [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4685.54s)]
*  It's that they would say oh that guy's a pervert and if a woman went into the men's room [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4688.04s)]
*  We tell her to bring a couple of her friends [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4691.94s)]
*  Still in a respect of a way about or you would guard the door while they were urinating [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4694.62s)]
*  That was another thing if a woman said I really need to urinate in here [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4699.179999999999s)]
*  You know yeah, well no one would care the added thing is here post a parent [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4701.9s)]
*  Maybe had a relationship with this Monica Beverly Hills person. Oh is Monica Beverly Hills a gay guy. It's a [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4705.5s)]
*  contestant from Drag Race [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4712.54s)]
*  Like tried to out them I guess and they [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4716.66s)]
*  So that's they're saying that he might have done this all in retaliation for this see that's what happens a lot of times is [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4723.18s)]
*  People will I just read that well listen it was for whatever maybe the guy's gay [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4729.54s)]
*  And he pretended to be a woman. He was not a woman [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4735.46s)]
*  Alright, so maybe he had a gay relationship with a drag queen or maybe it's not even a gay relationship if it's a drag queen [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4738.5s)]
*  I don't remember anymore. I don't know what the new regulations are all I'm telling you [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4744.26s)]
*  All I'm saying is if you want to be a person who is open-minded and who's compassionate and who? [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4749.38s)]
*  Wants to let people live and let live you can't get mad at these girls putting rubber dicks in their pants [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4758.02s)]
*  Yeah, somebody dressing up like for someone for Halloween I feel like right a little bit [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4763.0199999999995s)]
*  You could say that's what they're doing though. I [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4768.78s)]
*  See what you're saying. You know you're saying you're making a you're making your own Halloween [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4771.34s)]
*  Yeah, you can't be upset when you make a Halloween you can you can say you're a girl [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4774.84s)]
*  You can say you're a girl, and you can be a guy with a beard [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4779.4s)]
*  Let me think about nails and say you're a girl, but you can't make me go along with it [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4781.66s)]
*  I see what you're saying. I'm not saying that you can't say you're a girl [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4786.099999999999s)]
*  I'm not saying that you can't call yourself a new name [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4789.26s)]
*  But if we're in this weird aggressive situation [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4792.74s)]
*  And you want me to say you're a girl so you can go do girl things in the girls room and like [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4795.34s)]
*  You can't make me agree to that right that's where it gets crazy like if you're not infringing on anybody else's space [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4800.5s)]
*  But there's a reason girls don't want to be in a fucking bathroom with dudes [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4807.06s)]
*  Yeah [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4810.14s)]
*  And if it's like trans men in the men's room men don't give a fuck because women aren't going in there to rape men [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4810.62s)]
*  Right right so that's the difference there women that think they're men no one cares if a woman who thinks she's a man wants [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4817.82s)]
*  To enter into men's sports no one's gonna stop her right cuz somebody it's all one direction isn't it isn't it always men going? [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4825.06s)]
*  To women's stuff well for sports for sure look there have been women that are they've turned trans and competed against boys that it [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4832.3s)]
*  Definitely has happened, but the striking dominance [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4840.26s)]
*  That you see were trans men or trans trans women biological men who identifies women compete against [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4844.68s)]
*  Regular biological women in sports yeah, it's crazy you get people with like I [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4852.68s)]
*  Would listen when I? [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4859.24s)]
*  Just it's a delusion. It's just a delusion [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4860.96s)]
*  You shouldn't let in if you want to have an all trans league do that [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4863.36s)]
*  That's what we should do I feel like it seems like there should be that so that then it's just a cheat code [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4866.599999999999s)]
*  You can't just say you're a girl. You're not a girl. Let's do a DNA test. Let's do a chromosome test [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4871.08s)]
*  Oh look X Y your guy will DNA tell you the truth every single time will that answer always? [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4875.56s)]

*  There's gonna be a thing even with that right so if you have like male and female all male and all female are not created equal [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4887.64s)]
*  There's a giant curve between like the most [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4895.12s)]
*  Manly man and the most womanly man [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4898.68s)]
*  Oh, and then the most manly woman and the most womanly woman like there's this giant fucking curve that all it means to be [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4901.48s)]
*  A human being I can't tell you where you are in that curve. Yeah, I don't know what you are you man [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4908.84s)]

*  Pretending you're a female you want to enter into like women's rooms [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4922.599999999999s)]
*  You can't do that because there's too much of a potential for that to be abused by creeps [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4925.72s)]
*  So what's the solution? I don't know what the solution is I don't know you know individual bathrooms [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4930.599999999999s)]

*  Oh, yeah, I know it's denying, but if he wasn't and then he had that big old hog keep him out of the women's room [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=4962.6s)]

*  Oh for sure the East Coast is a great example that and one of the best the best examples is the tolls [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5055.34s)]
*  The tolls were supposed to be created to pay for the city to build the roads right build the bridges [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5062.22s)]
*  But they paid for it a hundred times over once. It's already been paid right now [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5068.22s)]

*  Yeah, and so then that's good became and then you get a guy like a Daniel Day-Lewis. Yeah, you know, where does he come from? [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5510.4s)]

*  If this is an American, this is what we do [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5685.72s)]
*  You know [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5687.44s)]
*  It's kind of like how you were brought up like with the Pledge of Allegiance civics class all that type of stuff [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5687.84s)]
*  Like this is what it means like Ford tough type vibes, you know [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5692.36s)]
*  But then everything kind of changes over time and now I feel like it's we don't know what America is [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5695.5199999999995s)]
*  And I think that's the part that seems super scary to people sometimes [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5701.08s)]
*  Well, that's the part that's easy to manipulate right? So in this moment of chaos that we're talking about [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5703.84s)]
*  I don't know what America is anymore. That's when you get all these fucking activist groups that are not real [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5708.32s)]
*  That's when you get this discourse online [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5713.16s)]
*  that's when you get people attacking and you get real people that get caught up in it too and [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5715.16s)]
*  They're getting you caught up in it as well because all these people like people are super addicted to arguing with stuff online [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5718.88s)]
*  and I you know, I see like [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5724.44s)]
*  Otherwise very reasonable people that are on Twitter 12 hours a day and I just don't understand what the fuck is wrong with you [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5726.96s)]
*  Yeah, otherwise very reasonable successful people. What why are you doing this? Yeah, some people tweet all day Elon tweets all day all day [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5732.32s)]
*  It must be an addiction right at this point. I mean, there's no way if it's real. Do you think it's really him doing it? [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5739.639999999999s)]
*  Well, that was the Andre Dittman thing. That was the thing that people were saying that this was a fake [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5745.759999999999s)]
*  So was that proven that it wasn't him? [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5751.879999999999s)]
*  I've been trying to track that down to have no idea what I'd heard that it was proven that it wasn't him because this guy [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5754.68s)]
*  Who sounds like Elon was doing something while Elon was playing Diablo live? [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5761.32s)]
*  They had him talk to what I think in a space, right? [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5767.48s)]
*  They were never taught they were definitely both making noise at the same time [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5770.76s)]
*  But again like without seeing both this also never seen a picture of the other guy. I don't think that could be AI [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5773.96s)]
*  Right, you told me a guy like Elon couldn't like just for funsies [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5780.88s)]
*  Rig something like that. That's him. He's catching rockets with robot arms, you know, you don't think you'd figure that out [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5784.88s)]
*  Yeah, figure that out. He could have the algorithms talk to each other. I [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5791.24s)]
*  Think there's you know, they can already translate your your language that you know [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5796.2s)]
*  They can take whatever you're saying right now and your podcast and they can translate it to German [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5801.56s)]
*  Translate Spanish they could translate to anything. Hmm, if they can do that [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5806.64s)]
*  they could for sure have a [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5811.0s)]
*  Version of you that's quick enough with AI that it could respond like a person. Yeah [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5814.4400000000005s)]
*  Which is it's all gonna get interesting because now there's there used to be places if you didn't like what was going on [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5821.04s)]
*  You could sail off to another place, but there's not that many of those places anymore. No, that's why we got to protect America [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5825.72s)]
*  We got to protect freedom because if they can lock down on us [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5833.76s)]
*  We are the last beacon of hope for the world and I know that sounds ridiculous [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5837.96s)]
*  Oh, you guys are so ridiculous help so egocentrically [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5841.92s)]
*  Look what's happening to Europe. Look at the chaos. Look at the chaos [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5846.12s)]
*  Look, it's look it's what's happening in terms of like how people are upset at their political parties [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5851.4s)]
*  look at what's happening with Palestine and [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5856.64s)]
*  Israel look what's happening with [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5860.16s)]
*  Ukraine and Russia. Did you see that fucking bomb that went off today? You want to see something nuts? That's real. You don't know if it's real [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5862.68s)]
*  For real sent me in the middle night. Yeah [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5871.92s)]

*  I don't like shitting at night cuz I don't know if I'll go back to sleep [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5882.04s)]
*  So I'm sitting there my legs will fall asleep. You ever heard that happen to you, Bob? [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5884.76s)]

*  He just imagine that's how you hurt yourself like slipping your pants down by your ankles and your numb ass stupid legs [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5898.08s)]
*  You bang your fucking head into the nightstand like [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5906.24s)]
*  And your wife's like is this [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5910.16s)]
*  Yeah [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5913.04s)]
*  Here's a protector you KO'd yourself in the toilet room [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5914.2s)]
*  Slamming your head off the fucking door knob [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5918.679999999999s)]

*  Every time she looks at you. She thinks of you with your stupid fucking bruise your pants down by your ankles [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5926.12s)]

*  My mom used to always come we doze off on the shitter as children [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5935.16s)]
*  You know, I'm I would always come in there and rescue us or whatever you know, it's hilarious [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5939.32s)]
*  Now it must be more common because of phones. Oh, yeah people are time a lot of crazy stuff [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5943.12s)]
*  I mean, you know the Asians can't eat hot dogs in water saw that the other day as a general rule [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5949.72s)]
*  They're not allowing it North Korea. We just looking up Jamie [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5954.36s)]
*  Yeah, you need to see this [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5960.6s)]
*  I've already [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5964.04s)]
*  How to shoot down [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5966.32s)]
*  It's I don't think that video is real [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5968.04s)]
*  Don't start there you son of a bitch [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5970.4s)]
*  But there's already said saying like don't believe the hype from a 2023 Ukraine and the Kinzel missile don't believe the hypersonic [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5972.32s)]
*  I well, I remember in the beginning of the war [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5978.799999999999s)]
*  There was a bunch of footage that turned out just be video games [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5980.96s)]
*  It was going everywhere because people can make money from clicks, right? So [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5983.599999999999s)]
*  Can I see that again [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5991.48s)]
*  Well, everything's just dangerous now [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=5997.48s)]
*  How do you know that's not real that when it comes up here that video of that bomb and that tree like that's to someone [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6000.4s)]
*  edited to that part [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6007.299999999999s)]
*  Those two things aren't the same in what way just I'm just my history of looking at this stuff a lot [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6008.96s)]
*  so [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6016.839999999999s)]
*  It's a lot of separation right there. Oh [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6018.12s)]
*  line, mm-hmm [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6022.0s)]
*  But if it's far enough away for the curvature of the earth, wouldn't that? [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6023.92s)]
*  All right in theory it could be real but this is the only video of this that exists right and no one else [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6027.9800000000005s)]
*  This is claiming that this is real anywhere else online [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6034.06s)]
*  Right. Um, what I'm seeing though is that that thing that you're looking at in the background is elevated, right? [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6036.5s)]
*  So that that would indicate to me hills and valleys [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6042.92s)]
*  So that means the bomb could be going off in the valley below that and I don't know how far down that is [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6045.860000000001s)]
*  So if you're talking about an area like this could be Utah, right [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6052.660000000001s)]
*  So if you if you were taking a photograph in certain like you thought it's got a soccer field [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6056.780000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah, where do they play a lot of soccer in Ukraine? [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6061.22s)]
*  Utah or Ukraine they probably do right so see what I'm saying [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6064.700000000001s)]
*  Like that could be far enough over that hill where you get that effect of separation and still be natural [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6069.080000000001s)]
*  The way that it even looks though it looks like someone's got a TV behind another thing and they're showing an explosion of a TV [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6076.9s)]
*  The way that that looks is not even right. It does look like a little [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6083.339999999999s)]
*  Exposed correctly if you write and it looks pulls away. It gets yeah, it looks grainier [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6087.98s)]
*  And I don't know how you would be filming that to catch a hypersonic missile [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6093.0599999999995s)]
*  It says it was a US people reporter accidentally films it like, okay [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6096.42s)]
*  Yeah, really and it's going pretty slow at that point too. Let me say it again [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6100.259999999999s)]
*  Well, it's hard its perspective thing like it might look slower than it is because you know, it's covering a lot of distance [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6103.52s)]
*  It looks like Terminator 2 really that's kind of like [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6111.8s)]
*  It's hard too because like we're probably looking at cell phone footage and cell phone footage is still not that good [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6116.52s)]
*  So bizarre they keep making it better and better but it gets worse and worse the photos do [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6123.4800000000005s)]
*  First of all like drones I have not seen one good cell phone drone video [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6128.44s)]
*  So all that argument about like if UFOs are real where the fucking videos everyone's got a phone those are those arguments are now [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6133.04s)]
*  Out the window because we know the drones are real right so we don't what? [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6139.64s)]
*  Here's the result for that Kinzel missile thing like [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6143.08s)]
*  It just starts talking about it. Oh the type of missile that they're saying that that was that was a real video [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6146.6s)]
*  It's in theory would be everywhere. Yeah, it would be everywhere. What do you mean? [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6152.04s)]
*  There would be a bunch more results saying like look at this crazy video of this missile going off [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6156.78s)]
*  Oh, I see. I see not so that's only there's only one video and there's no other [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6160.94s)]
*  Reports of that that bomb. I also look at the account that posted it and start looking at some of the other shit [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6165.7s)]
*  They posted it so what is oh, it's a shit poster [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6170.98s)]
*  What was that one though that did blow up was it in Iran or in Syria? [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6174.38s)]
*  Recently where they hit some ammo depot the Israelis did and it looked crazy and that was a real one [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6179.9s)]
*  Well, yeah, you remember that one [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6187.66s)]
*  Was it I think you're right. I think you're right. That's how I can oh so scary you watch the the amount of [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6189.78s)]
*  Explosion when it hits you like Jesus [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6196.54s)]
*  Check this out. Oh, this is a different one, but this is another one. That's crazy [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6200.98s)]
*  This is an ammunition depot building that blows up, but watch this you're lying [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6206.5s)]
*  Bro, how fucking scary that so play that back again? [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6211.46s)]
*  That's real. Mm-hmm. Watch this [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6215.9s)]

*  Um, if you really want to pay attention you have to go down multiple rabbit holes [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6269.0199999999995s)]
*  Okay, but you know Assad was just removed as the dictator of Syria [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6273.219999999999s)]

*  thought you did he did get removed right and [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6281.58s)]
*  Is he dead or is he because there was reports that he was in a plane the plane was shot out of the air [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6284.9s)]
*  Is he dead or is he because there was reports that he was in a plane the plane was shot out of the sky [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6290.38s)]
*  But then there was reports that he landed in Russia. So I don't even know what's true [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6295.26s)]
*  Did did he get a shot out of the sky or was that that was like a story that was in the news? [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6300.860000000001s)]
*  Are the story still up that says his plane got shot out of the sky because I remember [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6312.5s)]
*  They there were stories that said his plane got shot out of this guy and then there was some Twitter story saying that he was [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6316.820000000001s)]
*  That he landed in Russia. I was like what is going on with this? [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6322.1s)]
*  but they wanted a regime change and [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6326.38s)]
*  They got it [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6330.1s)]
*  How hard was it for him to get? [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6331.66s)]
*  You know, that's the problem if you want to go down this rabbit hole and have a conversation like Dave Smith about it [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6333.9800000000005s)]
*  He knows yeah, okay, he'll take you down a rabbit hole. He's an interesting guy, huh? He knows a lot [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6338.38s)]
*  He's very smart, huh? Very very smart. He knows a lot. He knows a lot and he like legitimately knows lies [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6343.1s)]
*  Not bullshitting about what he knows. Yeah, and that's why he gets these these guys they get cocky and they want to have caught like Chris [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6348.18s)]
*  Cuomo want to have a debate with him and he just trounces him [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6354.820000000001s)]
*  He's like he knows what he's talking about. He's and he's not lying right the difference between a guy like [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6357.820000000001s)]
*  like any of these [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6365.860000000001s)]
*  CNN type media [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6367.860000000001s)]
*  Darling types who pushed the fucking kovat narrative and push every mainstream narrative those guys [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6370.5s)]
*  There's that's a very specific kind of mindset [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6377.219999999999s)]
*  it's a a bullshitter's mindset and those guys all melt in front of [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6379.86s)]
*  Actual conversations with people like Dave Smith who know what they're talking about are not ideologically captured [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6385.58s)]
*  Yeah, because there's certain things you just can't argue [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6390.82s)]
*  You can't argue that it's a good idea to do certain things and if you have not made that conclusion in your mind [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6393.179999999999s)]
*  You're still thinking like you're employed at CNN. You're never gonna beat a guy like Dave Smith in a conversation [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6401.0199999999995s)]
*  Because he's not gonna argue with you if you're right if you're right, he's gonna agree with you [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6407.099999999999s)]
*  He seems so locked in these people that are they're doing a totally different thing [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6411.38s)]
*  Reuters reports Assad may have died in plane crash later removes report. Well, they got the call [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6416.139999999999s)]
*  He escaped I guess but well, yeah, so their thing is gone and down and he I've seen no more updates other than this that [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6422.94s)]
*  Do you believe that we still can get real news information Joe? [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6431.42s)]
*  Not from me [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6435.9s)]
*  Speaking of which I have to correct something because there was a conversation that I had with [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6440.46s)]
*  Yannis Pappas and Christa Stefano we were talking about John Jones [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6446.34s)]
*  I'd heard a rumor that John Jones wanted 30 million dollars to fight Tom Aspin all and I did hear that rumor and I did [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6449.2s)]
*  Hear that the UFC said yes, but it is not true. So Dana contacted me said that rumors bullshit [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6455.8s)]
*  So I felt obligated to tell everybody that was that was a fake rumor [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6462.16s)]
*  I don't even remember who took because we did that podcast. Unfortunately, we did that podcast two weeks ago. Yeah [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6466.54s)]
*  I don't remember who told me that what do you think the amount is that John Jones would fight him for? [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6471.0s)]
*  Do you think it's an amount? Well, apparently John is thinking about retiring. Yeah, and he should I mean he's going to have to someday [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6475.04s)]
*  He should I'm not saying he should retire [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6481.84s)]
*  I'm saying he should think about it give the man all the time he wants he can fight whenever he wants to fight [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6483.6s)]
*  That's John Jones. He's the goat [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6489.44s)]
*  So leave him alone if he decides one day to come back and he comes back and he wants to fight Tom [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6490.8s)]
*  Aspin all for the the heavyweight title the question is like [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6496.76s)]
*  How long are you allowed to hold on to the title before they start having that conversation now [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6500.7s)]
*  He just knocked out steep a me o chitch. So give the man's months give the man five or six months [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6505.86s)]
*  Just leave him the fuck alone [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6512.26s)]
*  But at a certain point time you have to decide who the heavyweight champion is and if Tom is the interim heavyweight [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6513.62s)]
*  Champion and John decides he doesn't want to fight anymore [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6518.58s)]
*  He could do that and he could do that also and then come back in a year and fight for the title [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6521.46s)]
*  He could do that like yeah, you do whatever he wants but he might decide you know what [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6526.58s)]
*  Had an unbelievable career never lost [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6531.7s)]
*  Except the disqualification lost to a rule that has since been reversed [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6534.5s)]
*  He's the goat. He retires. He's got plenty of money. He's got a opportunity to do some acting [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6539.58s)]
*  Yeah, he's an interesting character to me because he seems like them. He seems [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6545.9s)]
*  Unique kind of nice very unique. Yeah, like you can he seems hard to pinpoint kind of they make any sense or no [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6551.62s)]
*  But that doesn't ever stop me from conversations with you. Thanks, dude [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6561.02s)]
*  Listen Theo, I really love you. I love talking to you, but you gotta make sense imagine that would ruin our whole relationship [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6571.9400000000005s)]
*  That [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6578.7s)]
*  Would be the most ridiculous requirement. Well, you know what Joe said to me people go what? [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6580.7s)]
*  That is so fucked up. Why would he say that? [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6586.5s)]
*  God give me one of those gay steaks [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6590.66s)]

*  The way to takes it out of the shoe plates it [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6603.84s)]
*  The way to just kind of it onto your tongue. Yeah, I'm called a juicy Santana the [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6610.12s)]

*  They're gonna start getting with the D you put a D in there [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6622.62s)]
*  They keep putting other stuff so new what's yeah, they always add ones but the one that pisses me off the most they add the a [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6633.28s)]
*  That's asexual. Hey stay out of it [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6640.4s)]
*  This is not you. Why are you in there? [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6643.4s)]
*  Yes, it's like the it's the electoral college thing that I was talking about, right? [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6645.599999999999s)]

*  And then just pile it all up [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6657.0s)]
*  Do you think it's a good idea to get rid of the electoral college do you think it should be one person one vote [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6659.08s)]
*  Yeah, I kind of do because I think [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6665.68s)]
*  It just there's no way that it's [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6669.76s)]
*  Like a skew it all then you know, I feel like it's one person one vote. That's it, right? [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6673.6s)]
*  You know, I just worry about still like how many extra votes they had the one time [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6678.88s)]
*  You know if that was ever figured out or not nobody figured it out, which seems crazy [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6683.56s)]
*  But this theories I just wonder once our voting gets compromised. It's a rat. There's theories, but the theories suck [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6687.64s)]
*  The numbers too big to me [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6695.08s)]
*  15 millions too many people you look at the like the graph of how many people voted [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6698.160000000001s)]

*  But like you were saying earlier [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6872.78s)]

*  controls all of the social issues all of the [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6895.88s)]
*  Contentious issues about whatever it is whether it's Second Amendment First Amendment abortion [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6900.459999999999s)]

*  Then you stifle the debate about what's best for the population [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6910.219999999999s)]
*  Because when the people get into control they enforce that and then they penalize the people that don't agree with them and they make it [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6914.219999999999s)]
*  Like real obvious that you step out of line [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6922.0599999999995s)]
*  They're gonna come get you and they're gonna arrest you just like they're doing in the UK [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6925.299999999999s)]

*  Because they don't want to go to jail and that's not good. It's not good. That's the problem with centralized control [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6936.78s)]
*  Yeah, I just saw a thing where they oh, yeah [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6944.0199999999995s)]
*  Well, that seems like the scariest thing because it's like well [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6946.24s)]
*  How do you think that people here are like people there or that the beliefs here are like the beliefs there? [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6948.4s)]

*  Well, but then you get the problem of people coming into a place and deciding that they want to put their own [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4jB0MMl1U&t=6967.679999999999s)]
