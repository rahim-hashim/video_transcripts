# Joe Rogan Experience #2017 - Bryan Callen
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6.0s)]
*  Oh, hi, Bob. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10.0s)]
*  Hi. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=12.0s)]
*  It's been a while. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=14.0s)]
*  Yeah, we're talking about stem cells. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=15.0s)]
*  Yeah, huge believer. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=16.0s)]
*  Ways to well, I go to them in town. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=17.0s)]
*  They fixed everything. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=19.0s)]
*  Every time I have like an injury, I get stem cells on it. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=20.0s)]
*  How many times have you gotten stem cells? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=23.0s)]
*  A gang of times. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=25.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=26.0s)]
*  Yeah, dozens. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=27.0s)]
*  And you swear by it? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=28.0s)]
*  Everybody does. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=29.0s)]
*  All the elite athletes I know, all the jujitsu guys, Gordon Ryan. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=30.0s)]
*  Gordon Ryan had something wrong with his shoulder. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=34.0s)]
*  He got shot into his shoulder and it fixed his neck. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=36.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=39.0s)]
*  Yeah, he had a problem with his neck for over a year. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=40.0s)]
*  And it went away after putting stem cells in his shoulder. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=42.0s)]
*  They literally find where the injuries are. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=45.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=47.0s)]
*  And it gravitates towards them and it helps you heal. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=48.0s)]
*  That's wild. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=50.0s)]
*  Yeah, between that and BPC157, which is body protecting compound 157, I think it's called. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=51.0s)]
*  It's a peptide. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=58.0s)]
*  Body protecting compound sounds like a complete marketing thing. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=59.0s)]
*  It does. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=62.0s)]
*  It's a body protecting compound. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=63.0s)]
*  It's like human. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=64.0s)]
*  Inner armor. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=65.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=66.0s)]
*  It's an exoskeleton. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=67.0s)]
*  Just take it. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=68.0s)]
*  Don't ask questions. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=69.0s)]
*  It's made out of spider skin. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=70.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=71.0s)]
*  The problem is I don't know. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=72.0s)]
*  I told you, I called you up and I'm like, dude, supplements work. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=73.0s)]
*  You're like, hey, fucko. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=77.0s)]
*  I've been saying that since I was 35. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=79.0s)]
*  Yeah, you fell into this, all you need is a good diet thing. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=81.0s)]
*  Because they'll teach you that. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=84.0s)]
*  Well, I talked to doctors. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=85.0s)]
*  When I did my podcast, I had guys who were like, no, I don't do it. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=86.0s)]
*  People who worked at Harvard, I was like, do you take supplements? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=89.0s)]
*  I don't. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=93.0s)]
*  But then you look at them and you're like, well, but you don't do any sports. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=94.0s)]
*  You've got to talk to a doctor that's jacked, like Huberman. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=97.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=101.0s)]
*  Jack scientists. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=102.0s)]
*  Talk to that guy. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=103.0s)]
*  Jack scientists. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=104.0s)]
*  Lane Norton. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=105.0s)]
*  Yeah, Lane Norton. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=106.0s)]
*  Andy Galpin. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=107.0s)]
*  Andy Galpin. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=108.0s)]
*  Dan Garner, all those guys. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=109.0s)]
*  Yeah, scientists that are fit. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=110.0s)]
*  Talk to those guys. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=111.0s)]
*  They'll all tell you supplements are valuable. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=112.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=114.0s)]
*  I took under my hood that rapid health at Dan Garner, Andy Galpin. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=115.0s)]
*  Then they just prescribed me just some stuff. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=119.0s)]
*  Not a lot of stuff. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=122.0s)]
*  Like a multivitamin. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=123.0s)]
*  CQ10. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=125.0s)]
*  Tonkat Alley brings your testosterone up a little bit. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=126.0s)]
*  I got a story about this. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=129.0s)]
*  You don't need that. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=130.0s)]
*  I got a story about this. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=131.0s)]
*  I don't need that, by the way. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=132.0s)]
*  My testosterone was 700. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=133.0s)]
*  That's good. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=135.0s)]
*  But my estrogen levels were at like 37. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=136.0s)]
*  You're a bitch. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=139.0s)]
*  I'm a bitch. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=140.0s)]
*  No, this is good. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=141.0s)]
*  I have to make a speech at my friend's wedding. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=142.0s)]
*  I don't know what's going on with me, but I'm getting a little ... I'm looking in the [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=145.0s)]
*  mirror and I'm getting, for the first time in my life, a little soft around the old hips [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=148.0s)]
*  in the back. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=153.0s)]
*  I'm like, all right, I'm getting older, but this can't be. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=154.0s)]
*  That's just diet. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=157.0s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=158.0s)]
*  Hold. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=159.0s)]
*  It's not? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=160.0s)]
*  Oh, there's a twist. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=161.0s)]
*  Then I'm with my wife and I'm crying over shit I see in a ... I don't know, a scene [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=162.0s)]
*  in a rom-com or a fucking commercial. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=170.0s)]
*  I'm not kidding. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=175.0s)]
*  I'm dead behind the eyes. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=176.0s)]
*  You've known me a long time. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=177.0s)]
*  I'm not a very emotional ... I'm certainly not going to share my emotions with you, but [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=178.24s)]
*  I'm bursting into tears. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=182.2s)]
*  At a commercial? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=185.0s)]
*  Now hold, please. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=186.0s)]
*  At an anti-depressing commercial. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=187.0s)]
*  I got to make a speech at my boy Tarik's wedding. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=189.0s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=191.0s)]
*  You're all emotional. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=192.0s)]
*  That's probably part of why you were emotional. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=193.0s)]
*  Your friend was getting married. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=195.0s)]
*  I get emotional at weddings. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=196.0s)]
*  I'll admit that. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=197.0s)]
*  I do too. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=198.0s)]
*  My friend's getting married. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=199.0s)]
*  His mother's an Afghan refugee. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=200.0s)]
*  I know she went through a lot of stuff, so it's an emotional time. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=202.0s)]
*  But I'm there to be funny and make a speech. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=205.0s)]
*  That's what I'm there for. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=207.0s)]
*  It's a festive moment. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=208.0s)]
*  I couldn't get through the speech, sir. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=212.0s)]
*  You were crying? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=213.0s)]
*  In the middle of it, I started crying so hard ... I started crying that I couldn't finish [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=214.0s)]
*  the speech and I couldn't get it together. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=220.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=222.0s)]
*  So I thought something's wrong. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=223.0s)]
*  Well ... [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=224.0s)]
*  Why is it that men have to think that? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=225.0s)]
*  Oh, you're taking Propecia. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=228.0s)]
*  I was taking Propecia. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=229.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=230.0s)]
*  And I was taking Propecia and it was raising my estrogen levels and it was binding my testosterone [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=231.0s)]
*  up. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=238.0s)]
*  There's topical stuff that you can use to keep whatever fucking chemotherapy hair you [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=239.0s)]
*  have left on the top of your head. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=243.0s)]
*  Hey, bro. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=244.0s)]
*  Listen. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=245.0s)]
*  Bro, I'm going bald. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=246.0s)]
*  I don't give a fuck. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=247.0s)]
*  I'm not going to be bursting into tears. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=248.0s)]
*  Good for you. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=249.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=250.0s)]
*  Listen, man. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=251.0s)]
*  I love being bald. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=252.0s)]
*  I really do. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=253.0s)]
*  If I could grow a full head of hair, I would 100% shave my head. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=254.0s)]
*  You would? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=255.0s)]
*  I just, yeah, let it grow stubbly. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=256.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=257.0s)]
*  But then I'd shave it again. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=258.0s)]
*  It stops you from having to have any uncomfortable conversations with barbers. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=259.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=263.0s)]
*  Just take a little off here. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=265.0s)]
*  Well, sometimes they'll tell you a story and then they're holding the scissors. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=267.0s)]
*  And then I told that motherfucker and you're like, oh my God, please cut my hair. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=269.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=273.0s)]
*  Don't just fucking kidnap me and force ... [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=274.0s)]
*  And gossip with me. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=276.0s)]
*  ... and force me to listen to this story that has no ending about someone who disrespected [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=277.0s)]
*  you at work. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=282.0s)]
*  Like, oh no. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=283.0s)]
*  You know what? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=284.0s)]
*  I have a weird thing where if you clip scissors near my ear, I start getting a tickly sensation [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=285.0s)]
*  in my back and I start to twitch. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=291.0s)]
*  Oh wow. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=293.0s)]
*  From when you were a kid maybe or something? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=294.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=295.0s)]
*  It's just a nerve thing. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=296.0s)]
*  I start to feel like ... [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=297.0s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=298.0s)]
*  It's like when somebody blows in your ears and you're like, eee, like that. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=299.0s)]
*  I haven't had a haircut in like 12 years. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=300.0s)]
*  I just go ... I keep one here too. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=303.0s)]
*  Like if I need a little touch up, I just fucking ... [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=307.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=309.0s)]
*  I cut my own hair. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=310.0s)]
*  Oh yeah? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=311.0s)]
*  It looks like it. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=312.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=313.0s)]
*  Do you have a flow beat? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=314.0s)]
*  Somebody took a picture of me. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=315.0s)]
*  Somebody took a picture of me. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=316.0s)]
*  I was with my kid and they took a picture of my profile, literally on the plane on the [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=317.0s)]
*  way here. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=324.36s)]
*  I looked at my profile and I texted my wife. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=325.36s)]
*  I go, listen, I know I'm very ugly. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=328.52s)]
*  Just so you know. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=331.0s)]
*  I don't know how you went from ... She dated like a black professional athlete. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=332.48s)]
*  You went from chocolate and jacked to medium, narrow, gray and wrinkled. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=337.72s)]
*  I don't get it. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=343.20000000000005s)]
*  It was just ... [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=344.20000000000005s)]
*  Stop thinking about yourself. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=345.20000000000005s)]
*  I know. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=346.20000000000005s)]
*  That's the problem. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=347.20000000000005s)]
*  Think about life. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=348.20000000000005s)]
*  No. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=349.20000000000005s)]
*  You've got to be nice to yourself. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=350.20000000000005s)]
*  Sure. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=351.20000000000005s)]
*  I'm not good at that. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=352.20000000000005s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=353.20000000000005s)]
*  You've got to learn how to talk. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=354.20000000000005s)]
*  You've got to learn how to be truthful all the way across the board, but with yourself [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=356.24s)]
*  and then be nice to yourself, man. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=362.16s)]
*  That's one of the reasons why I work out so hard. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=364.08s)]
*  When I work out really hard, I have respect for myself. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=366.68s)]
*  If you force yourself to do something, for that day, I know I'm not a lazy piece of shit. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=372.32s)]
*  For that day, I know I'm focused. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=377.5s)]
*  For that day, when I'm done, I'm like, I know who I am. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=379.94s)]
*  I get shit done. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=382.6s)]
*  That's exactly ... My philosophy on all that self-restraint and discipline is that every [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=384.32s)]
*  time you do something like that, it's a victory. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=390.14s)]
*  Every time you don't do it, it's a defeat. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=392.98s)]
*  In my opinion, you get weaker. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=394.66s)]
*  It's not about getting your body stronger. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=396.98s)]
*  We're all flesh and blood. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=399.21999999999997s)]
*  You can take me out with fucking a knife. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=400.21999999999997s)]
*  It's more about the fact that no matter what's going on in my life, I show up. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=402.46s)]
*  I think mental resilience is like cardiovascular fitness. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=407.7s)]
*  I think you have to work on it all the time. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=411.06s)]
*  It never ends. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=413.62s)]
*  I think that's the same with comedy. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=415.1s)]
*  I know that's the same with archery. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=416.96s)]
*  I know that's the same with playing pool. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=418.74s)]
*  I know that's the same with jiu-jitsu. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=420.34s)]
*  It's one of those things where these are all perishable skills. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=422.46s)]
*  I think mental resilience is a perishable skill. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=426.34s)]
*  It's perishable minute by minute. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=430.38s)]
*  You can never let off. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=433.94s)]
*  You get to a point in your life where maybe you have a bunch of goals and you scratch [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=437.12s)]
*  them off. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=440.41999999999996s)]
*  In some ways, the most lost I was at 50, I think, I drew a line through a lot of the [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=442.17999999999995s)]
*  things I came to LA to do. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=448.74s)]
*  And what I realized was that I'm not made to just ... You need a challenge, but more [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=451.66s)]
*  importantly I think there's something that you gain from the idea that anything that [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=459.06s)]
*  happens to you, I don't care, especially bad things, especially discomfort, especially [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=465.62s)]
*  something new, especially something that's painful or creates anxiety or just the unknown. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=470.98s)]
*  I think that that is ... All of those things can truly be looked at as good. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=477.06s)]
*  And the reason they should be looked at as good is ... And more in fact, better for you [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=481.9s)]
*  than the good things that happen a lot of times, is a very simple reason. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=487.38s)]
*  If you take the perspective that it is ... You can call it God, the universe, I don't care [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=491.78s)]
*  what you call it. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=497.94s)]
*  It is the order of things. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=498.94s)]
*  Instead of looking at what you can get from the universe, try to ... Look at it as what [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=501.96s)]
*  the universe is trying to get from you. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=505.82s)]
*  So anything you go through that's difficult, that's very uncomfortable, is there to make [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=507.62s)]
*  you grow. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=513.18s)]
*  There are hidden gifts in that great unknown, in that chaos. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=514.18s)]
*  And if you embrace it properly, you will come out the other side proud of yourself, much [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=519.1s)]
*  stronger and with deeper understanding. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=525.42s)]
*  Maybe more empathy at the end of the day for everything. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=528.14s)]
*  Yeah, it's that old expression, what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=530.42s)]
*  For real. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=533.26s)]
*  For real. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=534.26s)]
*  It's just like lifting weights. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=535.7s)]
*  Why do you get stronger? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=537.62s)]
*  You get stronger because you're forcing your body to go through something very difficult. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=539.22s)]
*  But do you ever have this ... Like with stand-up, I went to ... I'm over it now. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=543.3s)]
*  I'm really happy with it. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=547.74s)]
*  Bro, I was there for six months. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=549.3s)]
*  You don't smoke enough weed. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=551.9399999999999s)]
*  I start taking mushrooms. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=553.9s)]
*  Yeah, you don't smoke enough weed. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=554.9s)]
*  I think mushrooms ... Well- [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=556.74s)]
*  It's steroids for comedy. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=558.1s)]
*  Mushrooms are weed. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=560.38s)]
*  100%, both of them. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=561.38s)]
*  Dude. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=562.38s)]
*  They make me so much nicer and so much more connected to my material. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=563.5s)]
*  When I do stand-up on mushrooms, I am just so locked into what I'm saying. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=568.42s)]
*  I'm never press and play. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=574.54s)]
*  I'm really into what I'm saying. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=576.74s)]
*  I'm really thinking about what I'm saying. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=579.18s)]
*  I did acid for the first time. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=581.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=584.22s)]
*  And that was very interesting. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=585.22s)]
*  And then I had a set, a 45-minute set. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=589.34s)]
*  I was closing out the show in Venice. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=593.2199999999999s)]
*  And I was still very much in the mix of what was going on with me. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=595.54s)]
*  And I remember saying to my buddy, Kaj, I go, dude, I don't know how I'm going to do [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=601.8599999999999s)]
*  this. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=606.42s)]
*  I actually don't know how I'm going to do it. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=607.42s)]
*  And then I saw ... They had a picture of me from like 10 years ago. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=609.42s)]
*  And I don't know how I did it, but I started giving my younger self advice on stage. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=614.02s)]
*  And it worked. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=620.38s)]
*  I was just improvising. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=621.38s)]
*  It worked. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=622.38s)]
*  It was one of the best sets I've ever had in my life. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=623.38s)]
*  And I'm not kidding. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=626.14s)]
*  Isn't that weird? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=627.14s)]
*  Because you don't want to try to repeat that. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=628.14s)]
*  No. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=630.06s)]
*  You don't want to do acid every time you do stand-up. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=631.06s)]
*  I wouldn't mind trying though. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=634.58s)]
*  You will go so far gone. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=636.46s)]
*  You'll be gone. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=639.06s)]
*  Yeah, you can't. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=640.06s)]
*  You can't. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=641.06s)]
*  But you can ... I was on the tail end of it. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=642.06s)]
*  That might be the best time. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=644.26s)]
*  That's the perfect time for weed too. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=645.78s)]
*  Like when you have an edible. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=647.14s)]
*  Like right when you're not scared of everything anymore. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=648.5s)]
*  When it wears off, you're like, oh my God, I can't wait to get on stage and just be free. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=651.3399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=655.74s)]
*  That stand-up keeps you honest. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=656.74s)]
*  And I never want to be ... What I was trying to avoid was I said, I don't want to repeat [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=658.42s)]
*  myself. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=664.54s)]
*  I don't want to be obsessed with the same questions that I'm always obsessed with. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=665.54s)]
*  Which is really my questions are always, what is masculinity? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=670.4599999999999s)]
*  What's the difference between a coward and a hero? [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=673.0999999999999s)]
*  I've always been obsessed with them. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=674.78s)]
*  That's all your questions? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=675.78s)]
*  Really? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=676.78s)]
*  My questions have always been something in that area. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=677.78s)]
*  Because I internalized, I think, a warped sense of what masculinity is. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=680.74s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=684.14s)]
*  So it's an interesting battle for me. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=685.14s)]
*  But now, you have kids. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=687.9s)]
*  And like you said, you can't think about yourself. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=692.5s)]
*  You get older and you're just more in a position of service. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=696.1800000000001s)]
*  But that forces you to contend with larger questions. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=698.86s)]
*  I think a lot about God, which is ... [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=701.9s)]
*  Are you becoming a Christian? [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=704.14s)]
*  I am not becoming a Christian. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=705.34s)]
*  A lot of people do. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=706.54s)]
*  Although I know a lot of very intelligent people later in life who embraced religious [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=707.54s)]
*  beliefs, whether it's Islam or Christianity. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=712.8199999999999s)]
*  And they felt like it gave them structure that they didn't have before. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=717.74s)]
*  And even if they didn't believe that ... Here's the problem. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=720.78s)]
*  If God did, at one point in time, communicate to his disciples, there was no written language [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=725.86s)]
*  at the time. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=732.2199999999999s)]
*  As time went on, when they started writing things down, they wrote things down in languages [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=734.22s)]
*  that we don't use anymore. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=738.62s)]
*  We don't use ancient Hebrew anymore. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=740.42s)]
*  At least we don't. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=741.7s)]
*  But ancient Hebrew is a fucking super complicated language where the letters double as numbers. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=743.02s)]
*  So there's numerical value to all the words. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=748.42s)]
*  So we lost all that in the translation to Latin, to Greek, to English. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=752.7s)]
*  There's so much confusion as to what the original meaning of the word was. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=758.0600000000001s)]
*  I'm sure you've read a tweet before that was in Russian, and then you press the translate [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=761.38s)]
*  button, and then it gives you this broken English version of what they're trying to [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=766.5799999999999s)]
*  say. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=770.3399999999999s)]
*  Well, without the context of their language, understand how they use grammar, it's very [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=771.3399999999999s)]
*  confusing when you're translating things. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=774.9799999999999s)]
*  And then you have these ancient ways of describing things, where it's so hard to understand what [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=778.06s)]
*  their point of reference was. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=785.0999999999999s)]
*  The way they were describing things is very different, the way they say things than we [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=786.4599999999999s)]
*  So that's open to interpretation. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=791.02s)]
*  And then on top of that, you clearly have the work of man. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=793.5s)]
*  So if this was an enlightened encounter with some divine being that gave forth incredible [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=797.74s)]
*  wisdom to people, along with it became, there's some fuckery got added. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=804.06s)]
*  And so the question is like, how much fuckery? [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=810.62s)]
*  Because you know, it's not zero. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=812.78s)]
*  There's never been a series, never ever been a person in a position of power over a kingdom [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=813.98s)]
*  that didn't lie. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=821.46s)]
*  Yeah, they didn't manipulate, they didn't control the masses, they didn't. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=822.46s)]
*  If they were in control of whatever the religious documents were, for sure there's some fuckery. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=826.86s)]
*  I don't concern myself with those details. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=832.94s)]
*  No, no, I think it almost misses the entire point. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=835.02s)]
*  So what I'm interested in is the idea, you know, you can get into, it's funny, I went [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=838.3000000000001s)]
*  to Israel for 10 days, right? [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=842.86s)]
*  I don't know if you know that. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=844.34s)]
*  Yeah, I was excited to talk to you about it on the show. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=845.34s)]
*  We'll talk about it. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=848.2600000000001s)]
*  And then I went to Jordan, remind me to tell you that. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=849.7800000000001s)]
*  But what I'm interested in, what gets me thinking is it's very hard for me to wrap my head around [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=851.58s)]
*  the idea of I'm a Christian, I believe that Jesus rose. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=860.5s)]
*  That's very hard for me. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=863.5s)]
*  I just can't accept. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=864.5s)]
*  That's not how I... [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=866.0600000000001s)]
*  You can't accept the resurrection. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=867.0600000000001s)]
*  I can't. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=868.0600000000001s)]
*  See, that's another, that's one of those. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=869.0600000000001s)]
*  But that's okay. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=870.0600000000001s)]
*  What did they mean by that? [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=871.0600000000001s)]
*  I will say this. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=872.0999999999999s)]
*  I find it very, very intriguing and interesting that you take, let's take Jesus Christ and [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=874.3399999999999s)]
*  Julius Caesar. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=879.9799999999999s)]
*  Julius Caesar, the most powerful man in the world at the time. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=880.9799999999999s)]
*  And let's just take any sort of reincarnation of that guy, you know, just Jeff Bezos or [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=883.9399999999999s)]
*  whoever it might be. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=888.78s)]
*  You've got the world at your fingertips, even someone like Joe Rogan. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=890.4599999999999s)]
*  Everybody loves you. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=894.0999999999999s)]
*  You've got, everything is free. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=895.0999999999999s)]
*  It's, you know, it is what it is. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=896.0999999999999s)]
*  You've reached the top of the mountain. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=897.5799999999999s)]
*  So let's take Julius Caesar. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=900.6999999999999s)]
*  All the power in the world commanded armies, ran everything, and anyone would be seduced [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=902.8199999999999s)]
*  by that prospect. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=907.5s)]
*  It'd be pretty cool to be at the top of the mountain. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=909.6999999999999s)]
*  Yet somehow there's a guy who was a radical rabbi, really, which just really means teacher, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=912.6999999999999s)]
*  a first century Jew who at the prime of his life is killed, tortured, put up on a cross. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=919.62s)]
*  And despite him being quote unquote God or very close to divinely inspired, he gets [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=928.98s)]
*  tortured and put on a cross. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=933.98s)]
*  So there's no, you die with nothing. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=935.0600000000001s)]
*  And oh, by the way, a couple of crazy notions. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=937.42s)]
*  Love your enemy. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=941.1800000000001s)]
*  You know, walk as a humble person. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=943.3s)]
*  Sell all your possessions. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=947.82s)]
*  Give the money to the poor. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=948.82s)]
*  All these things. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=950.22s)]
*  And oh, you in your body, there's something higher. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=951.22s)]
*  Your appetites, this physical frame is actually should be subservient to a higher ideal. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=954.7s)]
*  And I'm going to prove it by being on a cross. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=960.98s)]
*  And what's the last thing I'm going to say? [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=962.78s)]
*  Something to the effect of I love you and I forgive you. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=964.3s)]
*  Not a great way, not a good ending, by the way, not a way if you want to get successful. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=968.7s)]
*  But yet we revere that person. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=974.02s)]
*  Somehow all of us, atheists, Christians, whoever it is, somehow nostalgically or in our imagination [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=976.86s)]
*  know that the way he walked that path, even if it ends in total ruin, that path somehow [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=984.18s)]
*  has more power. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=991.5799999999999s)]
*  Somehow it lasts longer. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=993.42s)]
*  Somehow it has more meaning. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=995.2199999999999s)]
*  Even if we try to emulate it to a lesser degree, somehow it makes us feel somehow there seems [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=996.9s)]
*  to be something. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1003.62s)]
*  It seems to dovetail with the laws of the universe. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1005.0999999999999s)]
*  It seems to dovetail with something we would call the truth. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1009.6999999999999s)]
*  Something we'd call beauty, something we'd call inspiration. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1013.34s)]
*  That's what I'm interested in. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1017.1800000000001s)]
*  We don't talk about Julius Caesar or anybody who accomplishes crazy things the way we talk [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1018.1800000000001s)]
*  about people like Mohandas K. Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, people that were emulating [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1022.1800000000001s)]
*  this idea, the idea of passive resistance, the idea of turning the other cheek and then [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1029.8600000000001s)]
*  a guy like Christ, the Buddha. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1034.06s)]
*  I find that interesting. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1036.18s)]
*  I find it very interesting that human beings seem to resonate in their, when they think [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1037.66s)]
*  of, I always say my best version of myself is clearing his throat in the other room. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1042.58s)]
*  You and I call it the pesky truth. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1049.5s)]
*  I got to get this shit done over here. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1051.82s)]
*  I know the right way. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1053.82s)]
*  I know what I should be doing. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1054.82s)]
*  I know the way I should be behaving. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1056.8600000000001s)]
*  I find it very interesting that if you were to just accept that the laws that are laid [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1059.46s)]
*  down in the scripture, let's say the Old Testament, the New Testament, the Koran, the Bible, [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1065.74s)]
*  the Abrahamic religions, I'm just going to talk about that for a second. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1073.3000000000002s)]
*  There's a lot of self-restriction in that. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1077.3000000000002s)]
*  There's a lot of prudence in that. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1080.3000000000002s)]
*  It ain't that much fun. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1083.9s)]
*  You can't be promiscuous. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1085.5800000000002s)]
*  Well, look at a guy like Khabib Nurmagomedov. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1086.5800000000002s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1089.5800000000002s)]
*  I don't know how to fuck this last name up. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1090.5800000000002s)]
*  Khabib Nurmagomedov, yeah. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1092.5800000000002s)]
*  Khabib Nurmagomedov is arguably the greatest fighter of all time. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1093.5800000000002s)]
*  He's definitely in the argument. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1096.42s)]
*  I mean, the guy lost like two rounds ever in his whole career. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1097.42s)]
*  He is devoutly religious. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1101.62s)]
*  I mean, five times a day there's a call to prayer. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1104.22s)]
*  They don't fuck around. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1107.0s)]
*  During Ramadan, there's no eating, no drinking, no nothing during the day. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1108.7s)]
*  The training is all like brutal and Spartan. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1112.84s)]
*  And he takes no credit. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1117.78s)]
*  What does he do all the time? [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1118.78s)]
*  He goes this, no, that. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1119.78s)]
*  And he's super humble. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1120.78s)]
*  Yes, always. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1121.78s)]
*  He's super humble. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1122.78s)]
*  And he's admirable, right? [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1124.14s)]
*  Like you see a man like that, that's a man of character. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1128.7s)]
*  That's a man of distinction. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1132.1s)]
*  That's a champion. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1133.1s)]
*  Yes. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1134.1s)]
*  I'd rather fight an atheist than a man coming to me singing the fucking Psalms. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1135.1s)]
*  Remember when Evander Holyfield was singing the Psalms when he stepped in with the unbeatable [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1138.1s)]
*  Mike Tyson? [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1143.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1144.86s)]
*  Well, you know, he had the Holy Ghost, the Father and the Son and himself. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1145.86s)]
*  That's four people that Tyson was fighting that day. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1150.3s)]
*  And just pure belief in himself. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1152.62s)]
*  Yes. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1154.54s)]
*  But more in belief in something higher than himself. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1155.54s)]
*  I think that we are in deep trouble if we don't have a transcendent truth we believe [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1159.7s)]
*  in. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1166.94s)]
*  That's where I disagree with Sam Harris. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1167.94s)]
*  Because Sam is a very smart guy and I think is a very, I love listening to him and I agree [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1169.9s)]
*  with a lot what he says. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1175.6200000000001s)]
*  But Sam, I think Sam makes the argument that if you look at nature, the golden rule, treat [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1176.6200000000001s)]
*  your neighbor as you would treat your neighbor as you treat yourself or whatever, treat others, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1182.3s)]
*  you can now almost be proven in nature. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1187.86s)]
*  It's a better way to walk. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1190.4599999999998s)]
*  I don't think that's enough. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1191.82s)]
*  I think you need to feel like somebody. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1193.1s)]
*  That's a hard sell when you look at regular nature, when you watch animals tear each other [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1196.1399999999999s)]
*  apart. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1200.3s)]
*  I know it is. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1201.3s)]
*  I know it is. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1202.3s)]
*  Survival of the fittest is the clearest, if there's some sort of a mandate for the world, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1203.3s)]
*  it's survival of the fittest. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1208.6599999999999s)]
*  And then whatever those things are, have to figure out how to get more fit because their [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1210.3799999999999s)]
*  prey is getting more fit. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1214.1799999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1215.78s)]
*  There's this constant horrific cycle of eating things. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1216.78s)]
*  That's why Healy's saying, if you're a gazelle and you wake up, run fast. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1219.78s)]
*  If you're a lion and you wake up, run fast. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1225.1s)]
*  I had a conversation with a friend of mine once. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1226.78s)]
*  He's like, you always talk about nature like it's this horrible thing, but you go into [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1228.78s)]
*  nature, it's beautiful. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1231.98s)]
*  I go, yeah, that's because they're digesting. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1232.98s)]
*  They're digesting everything they just fucking mauled and tore to pieces in front of its [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1236.46s)]
*  mother. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1240.74s)]
*  Correct. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1241.74s)]
*  What are you talking about, man? [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1242.74s)]
*  Have you ever been? [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1243.74s)]
*  What do you do? [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1244.74s)]
*  You go hiking? [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1245.74s)]
*  I stared a mountain lion in the eyes. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1247.7s)]
*  They're terrifying. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1249.58s)]
*  It's a war. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1250.58s)]
*  It's a constant war. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1251.58s)]
*  They're terrifying. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1252.58s)]
*  I made eye contact with a grizzly bear from 50 yards away. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1253.58s)]
*  You did? [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1256.86s)]
*  Almost shit my pants. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1257.86s)]
*  It wasn't even a big one. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1258.86s)]
*  It was a six-foot grizzly bear. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1260.34s)]
*  They look at you so different than any other bear. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1261.94s)]
*  I've been around grizzly bears at the zoo and shit like that, but that's a different [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1265.3s)]
*  animal. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1269.86s)]
*  When you see them in the wild, they look through you. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1270.86s)]
*  They look at you like this. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1272.78s)]
*  A regular bear, like a black bear, they look at you like, who are you? [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1274.74s)]
*  What's going on here? [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1278.06s)]
*  They kind of side-eye you because they're not the king of the forest. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1279.54s)]
*  No. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1282.22s)]
*  As they wander around, they're always terrified that a grizzly is going to show up. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1283.22s)]
*  They look at you like, oh. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1286.22s)]
*  Unless it's a big black bear, a big black bear could be a real problem because they [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1288.82s)]
*  tend to, when they attack people, they tend to do it predatorily. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1292.5s)]
*  Whereas grizzlies oftentimes- [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1296.1s)]
*  Get off my land. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1297.5s)]
*  My kids are here. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1298.5s)]
*  Yeah, the kids are there or you fucked up and you scared them. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1299.5s)]
*  There's a distance where they're inside that distance. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1302.62s)]
*  It's very dangerous. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1304.86s)]
*  Here's my thing. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1305.86s)]
*  There are two animals I don't want to get eaten by or messed up by. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1306.86s)]
*  A chimp because they just start pulling shit off because they're spiteful. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1309.5s)]
*  And then a bear because- [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1313.9399999999998s)]
*  I want a cat. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1316.3799999999999s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1317.3799999999999s)]
*  I'll take a cat. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1318.3799999999999s)]
*  You're out of your mind. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1319.3799999999999s)]
*  No, no. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1320.3799999999999s)]
*  Listen to me. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1321.3799999999999s)]
*  Listen to me. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1322.3799999999999s)]
*  No problem. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1323.3799999999999s)]
*  Let me tell you why. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1324.3799999999999s)]
*  What? [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1325.3799999999999s)]
*  They grab you by the back of your neck and you go bye-bye. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1326.3799999999999s)]
*  They just bite you. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1327.3799999999999s)]
*  You just want to go bye-bye? [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1328.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1329.3799999999999s)]
*  I want to- [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1330.3799999999999s)]
*  You want to fight out of it? [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1331.3799999999999s)]
*  There's been a bunch of dudes that survived getting grizzly bear fucked up and they just [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1333.14s)]
*  have faces- [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1335.66s)]
*  Yeah, but sometimes they eat you ass first. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1336.66s)]
*  The problem is they start eating your legs. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1337.8600000000001s)]
*  If they start eating you, yeah. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1338.8600000000001s)]
*  That's a problem. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1339.8600000000001s)]
*  If they eat you, it's a problem. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1340.8600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1341.8600000000001s)]
*  And it's an 1,100 pound angry dog. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1342.8600000000001s)]

*  It took like a half an hour for him to kill him. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1345.42s)]
*  That's right. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1348.3000000000002s)]
*  That's right. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1349.3000000000002s)]
*  And what's his name? [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1350.3000000000002s)]
*  Werner Herzog is listening. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1351.3000000000002s)]
*  He's like, whatever you do, don't listen. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1352.3000000000002s)]
*  I'm just begging you not to listen. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1354.42s)]
*  Burn this tape. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1356.3400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I'd have to- [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1357.3400000000001s)]
*  This is the best unintentional comedy that's ever been made. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1358.66s)]
*  I agree 100%. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1361.2600000000002s)]
*  It's an amazing documentary. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1363.14s)]
*  And it's a comedy. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1364.14s)]
*  It's a comedy. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1365.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1366.34s)]
*  When that sheriff looks right at the camera and goes, I thought he was retarded. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1367.34s)]
*  You're like, come on, this is a comedy. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1368.34s)]
*  And there's a smash cut after that. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1371.34s)]
*  Like, Werner Herzog's a genius. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1372.98s)]
*  He knows what he's doing. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1374.7s)]
*  He does. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1375.7s)]
*  He knows what he's doing. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1376.7s)]
*  Of 100%. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1377.7s)]
*  Because there is some beauty in the story and there is some tragedy in the story and [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1378.74s)]
*  there's like this weird human element where this clearly gay guy who's in the closet [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1382.94s)]
*  is out wandering around in the woods pretending he's protecting grizzly bears. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1388.34s)]
*  It's fucking amazing. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1393.5s)]
*  But he had amazing encounters. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1394.5s)]
*  Like he had an incredible friendship with this little fox who was like hanging out with [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1395.98s)]
*  him. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1400.34s)]
*  Like foxes, like when you camp in a place for a long period of time and they realize [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1401.34s)]
*  you're not dangerous, they just become your friend. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1403.86s)]
*  Really? [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1406.1s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1407.1s)]
*  They hang out. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1408.1s)]
*  The fox is hanging out with this dude. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1409.1s)]
*  The fox stole his hat. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1410.1s)]
*  They were playing. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1411.1s)]
*  The fox stole his hat and dragged it into his den. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1412.26s)]
*  And he's laughing with the fox and chasing after him. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1414.3s)]
*  Give me my hat. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1416.98s)]
*  I don't remember that. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1418.66s)]
*  I remember I was in Alaska and a guy had a female wolf. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1419.66s)]
*  And I said he found it. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1424.1s)]
*  I think, I don't know what happened, but he adopted it. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1427.18s)]
*  And that female wolf, first of all, he said, you have a wolf, you're not going to the store [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1429.82s)]
*  and leaving the wolf. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1434.22s)]
*  That's not how it works. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1435.3s)]
*  The wolf is always with you. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1437.54s)]
*  That's how it is. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1439.24s)]
*  It's not like I'll be home in eight hours. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1440.24s)]
*  No, no, no, that's a wolf, bro. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1441.66s)]
*  They're going to break out of it. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1443.06s)]
*  Whatever they're going to do, you're part of their pack and you're not going anywhere. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1444.06s)]
*  It was so smart that he would bring it hunting and it figured out that he only killed does. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1448.42s)]
*  And so it would point. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1453.8600000000001s)]
*  It would point the way a pointer does. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1455.6200000000001s)]
*  It would literally point whenever it smelled a doe and not when it smelled a stag. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1457.5s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1463.22s)]
*  Yes. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1464.22s)]
*  And then I said, well, what about a male wolf? [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1465.22s)]
*  And he said, no, no, you never. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1466.22s)]
*  Where was this? [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1467.6200000000001s)]
*  In Alaska. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1468.6200000000001s)]
*  I was in Ketchikan and he said I was fishing, you know, and I didn't see the wolf, but he [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1469.74s)]
*  was. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1475.6200000000001s)]
*  Was she spayed? [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1476.6200000000001s)]
*  Imagine if she's in heat and she puts out that set and the males come around. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1478.54s)]
*  That'd be an issue. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1482.02s)]
*  But the males, I said, would you ever have a male? [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1483.02s)]
*  And he said, you'd never have a male. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1485.58s)]
*  I said, why? [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1487.06s)]
*  He goes, because it would always be challenging you. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1488.06s)]
*  It would always, they're pack animals and it would always be, you guys would always [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1489.7399999999998s)]
*  be in a situation and you'd end up getting fucked up. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1493.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1496.8999999999999s)]
*  That's 150 pounds. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1497.8999999999999s)]
*  There's a lot of people that have wolf dogs. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1498.8999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, bad idea. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1501.3s)]
*  Seven, eight, ten wolf. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1502.3s)]
*  Yeah, they're so sketchy. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1503.3s)]
*  They kill everything. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1504.3s)]
*  They kill kids. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1505.3s)]
*  The reason they kill kids is because they have a very, they have a, their pack, the [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1506.98s)]
*  pack hierarchy is incredibly present in their DNA. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1510.06s)]
*  So what happens is if you have a child in that house, when you leave, that dog, that [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1516.46s)]
*  wolf considers that child to be lower. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1522.8999999999999s)]
*  It's going to challenge. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1525.8999999999999s)]
*  So they had too many times where a hybrid wolf, I'm going to get, I'm sure people, [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1527.34s)]
*  I have hybrid wolves and they're the nicest dogs. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1532.02s)]
*  No, you don't. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1534.3s)]
*  They're great dogs, but a lot of people actually testified at these things, at these, because [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1535.3s)]
*  at the lawsuits and things, because those dogs, they're wolves and they look at children [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1541.82s)]
*  as being below them on the pack. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1546.94s)]
*  So there's always a chance they're going to take that competitor out. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1548.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1552.62s)]
*  No joke. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1553.62s)]
*  So no hybrids, bro. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1554.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1558.74s)]
*  I had a friend who had one and it got out. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1559.74s)]
*  He was living on a ranch. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1561.74s)]
*  It got out and killed eight of the neighbor's sheep. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1562.82s)]
*  Just want to slaughter fast doing wolf shit. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1567.14s)]
*  Just doing wolf shit. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1569.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1570.34s)]
*  Just killed them all. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1571.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1572.34s)]
*  Just figured out some of them, right? [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1573.34s)]
*  Just didn't need them at all. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1574.34s)]
*  Just found out that they were contained in this little fence. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1575.34s)]
*  Ten areas like that fence is four feet high. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1577.14s)]
*  Boink. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1579.26s)]
*  Just jumped over that fence. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1580.26s)]
*  Like it was nothing. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1581.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1582.26s)]
*  You ever see a coyote jump a fence? [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1583.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1584.26s)]
*  They're so graceful. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1585.26s)]
*  I know. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1586.26s)]
*  I saw a coyote jump over my back fence with, with one of my chickens in his mouth. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1587.26s)]
*  Dude, and you, that, I've been to that. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1590.5s)]
*  I know exactly what fence you're talking about. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1591.74s)]
*  Like nothing. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1593.3799999999999s)]
*  That's a seven foot fence. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1594.3799999999999s)]
*  Six feet. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1595.3799999999999s)]
*  He went up to the top like it was nothing. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1596.3799999999999s)]
*  Toes on the top. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1597.3799999999999s)]
*  Boing. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1598.3799999999999s)]
*  God. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1599.3799999999999s)]
*  Like, like a gymnast. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1600.3799999999999s)]
*  With a chicken in his mouth. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1601.3799999999999s)]
*  With a chicken in his mouth. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1602.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1603.3799999999999s)]
*  What's a chicken weigh? [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1604.3799999999999s)]
*  Like five pounds? [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1605.3799999999999s)]
*  A hundred pounds, dude. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1606.3799999999999s)]
*  I don't know, I don't know biology, but I think it's about a hundred pounds. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1607.3799999999999s)]
*  What's a chicken weigh? [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1609.9399999999998s)]
*  What is like a female chicken weigh? [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1610.9399999999998s)]

*  Yeah, maybe. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1615.6999999999998s)]
*  I saw the fucker just with it in his mouth. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1616.7s)]
*  Just bound over that fence like it was non-existent. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1619.54s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1621.42s)]
*  And I was like under the illusion that those fences were keeping these cocksuckers out. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1622.42s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1625.8600000000001s)]
*  Well, six feet. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1626.8600000000001s)]

*  Look how insane that is. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1639.18s)]
*  That's a skinny-ass fucking picket fence. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1640.5800000000002s)]
*  He lands on the top of it. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1642.74s)]
*  No dog would do that. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1643.74s)]
*  No dog. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1644.74s)]
*  He's a Malinois. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1645.78s)]
*  Yeah, maybe a Belgian Malinois. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1646.78s)]

*  Bro, this guy, Matt Ritlin, Mike Ritlin, you know who he is? [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1648.78s)]
*  No. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1651.98s)]
*  He was a SEAL. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1652.98s)]
*  He trains in Malinois. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1653.98s)]
*  I had a 65-pound Malinois. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1654.98s)]
*  He's in Dallas. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1658.54s)]
*  Shout out to Mike. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1659.54s)]
*  Did you put the bite suit on? [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1660.54s)]
*  I did. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1662.98s)]
*  Put the bite suit on. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1663.98s)]
*  And then he had the dog in the car. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1665.3s)]
*  The handler had the dog by the leash. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1667.58s)]
*  And so he said, just walk up to the car and just be kind of aggressive. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1670.3s)]
*  65-pound dog, skinny, little dog. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1674.74s)]
*  You look at him and be like, whatever. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1676.82s)]
*  And I start going, and then I just stick my arm in and the thing grabs onto me. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1679.7s)]
*  And my buddy Nick, who's a bodybuilder, crazy strong, he did the same thing. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1686.5s)]
*  The pressure, the pressure. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1691.1s)]
*  Have you ever done it? [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1692.78s)]
*  No. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1693.78s)]
*  It'll give you a new respect. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1694.78s)]
*  It'll give you a new respect for the power of an animal. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1695.78s)]
*  The pressure through the sleeve was so disconcerting. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1698.14s)]
*  And I knew, because I'd already done it in Afghanistan. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1701.7s)]
*  I did the Afghanistan. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1703.98s)]
*  I did the USO. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1705.5800000000002s)]
*  Oh, I like that. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1706.5800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, bro. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1707.5800000000002s)]
*  Come on. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1708.5800000000002s)]
*  I did the USO tour. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1709.5800000000002s)]
*  So we had dogs, these giant Dutch separds loose on us. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1710.5800000000002s)]
*  But this 65-pound dog was doing it because he hated me. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1713.46s)]
*  It's one thing when it's a game of tug of war and it's prey drive. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1716.8200000000002s)]
*  This thing had fight drive. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1720.02s)]
*  This thing was like, I hate your guts. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1721.22s)]
*  I'm going to try to kill you. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1723.14s)]
*  His eyes just went, those grizzly bear eyes. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1724.7s)]
*  And my buddy Nick got depressed. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1728.22s)]
*  I said, you all right? [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1731.7s)]
*  No, I'm a little bit depressed. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1732.7s)]
*  I said, why? [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1734.18s)]
*  He goes, because I've never felt that kind of pressure on my arm. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1735.18s)]
*  And I'm a really strong guy. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1738.18s)]
*  But I said, oh, yeah. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1739.54s)]
*  And Matt, who's a seal, he goes, your body shuts down. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1741.82s)]
*  When you get bit like that by a dog like that, even a 65-pound dog, a lot of times what happens [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1745.3s)]
*  is the nerves get crushed. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1750.66s)]
*  So you can't use that arm. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1752.18s)]
*  You're in big trouble. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1755.1000000000001s)]
*  So even if you're on PCP, you just shut down. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1756.3400000000001s)]
*  Those guys that get attacked by dogs, like when they sick dogs on them, those guys are [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1758.86s)]
*  never the same again. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1763.1s)]
*  No. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1764.1s)]
*  When they grab their arms, that arm is fucked forever. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1765.1s)]
*  Correct. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1767.06s)]
*  You can't do that. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1768.06s)]
*  That's why Rottweilers, I heard, they don't use rots anymore because they were harder [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1769.06s)]
*  to recall and their mouths are so big and they bite so hard that, yeah, it causes permanent [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1773.3s)]
*  damage and the cops were getting sued. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1779.62s)]
*  So let's use a malinois. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1781.98s)]
*  Bite really hard, but you can call them off faster. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1783.5s)]
*  They might bite less with their back teeth, blah, blah, blah, although they inhale you. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1787.1s)]
*  They fucking inhale you. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1791.02s)]
*  Now, now hold, please. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1792.3s)]
*  That is a dog. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1794.82s)]
*  Now let's go with a Nile crocodile or a grizzly bear or any of those things. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1796.5s)]
*  Enjoy that shit. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1801.74s)]
*  Why are we talking about animals? [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1802.74s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1803.74s)]
*  I'm watching a video today of a crocodile swimming with a guy in its mouth. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1804.74s)]
*  I've seen that. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1806.8999999999999s)]
*  I watch it once a week. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1807.8999999999999s)]
*  There's people on the bridge. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1810.8999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1811.8999999999999s)]
*  I don't know what language you're speaking, but they're pointing down to poor fuck. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1812.8999999999999s)]
*  Terrifies me. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1816.86s)]
*  I'm being dragged by a crocodile. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1817.86s)]
*  Terrifies me. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1818.86s)]
*  Well, you had that guy on the Amazon. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1819.86s)]
*  He's talking about Black Caymans. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1821.54s)]
*  Paul Rosely. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1823.2199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1824.2199999999998s)]
*  Love that podcast, but- [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1825.2199999999998s)]
*  I did not know Black Caymans got to 16 feet long. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1826.2199999999998s)]
*  Well, my buddy, he was a Green Beret and he was the last Green Beret to do jungle training, [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1828.54s)]
*  I guess, in Brazil. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1834.1799999999998s)]
*  They had this joint task force with the Brazilian Special Forces. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1835.1799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1838.26s)]
*  So he was- [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1839.26s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1840.26s)]
*  Yeah, there you go. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1841.26s)]
*  Here's the dude swimming with the body in his mouth. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1842.26s)]
*  Fuck. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1843.86s)]
*  Yeah, that's not a good time. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1844.86s)]
*  That's so dark. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1846.4199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, that's really dark. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1847.4199999999998s)]
*  By the way, this is not the same video. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1849.5s)]
*  The one I watched, it was a different one, but it was another crocodile. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1851.4199999999998s)]
*  Notice his other arm, his arm is off. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1853.62s)]
*  He doesn't have an arm or a foot. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1855.4199999999998s)]
*  See that? [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1857.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1858.02s)]
*  That's so insane. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1859.02s)]
*  Bro. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1861.02s)]
*  Is this Costa Rica? [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1862.02s)]
*  Where is this? [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1864.02s)]
*  Australia, but I'm not sure. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1865.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1868.02s)]
*  So these Green Berets are with the Brazilian Special Forces, and in the middle of the night, [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1869.02s)]
*  they go, get in the water. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1874.86s)]
*  You guys are going to swim two miles. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1877.1399999999999s)]
*  And then they were showing, they were shining a spotlight on the banks of the river, and [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1879.54s)]
*  you could just see these eyes. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1882.4599999999998s)]
*  They're like, don't swim to the bank, don't swim to the bank. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1883.4599999999998s)]
*  But it was all these guys. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1886.5s)]
*  So it was a big group of guys swimming, and they had to get to a point. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1887.5s)]
*  They get to the rock, and one guy just wasn't there. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1890.82s)]
*  And they had a moment of silence, and that was the end of that. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1896.02s)]
*  And they got back in the boats, and that was their night. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1898.82s)]
*  The guy was taken by a black caiman, I think. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1902.38s)]
*  Just disappeared just that quickly. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1904.3400000000001s)]
*  Just shoop. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1906.6200000000001s)]
*  See you later. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1907.6200000000001s)]
*  You can't do that. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1908.6200000000001s)]
*  You can't be swimming in water when there are 18-foot black caimans. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1909.6200000000001s)]
*  Come on. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1913.2600000000002s)]
*  Why did they make them do that? [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1914.2600000000002s)]
*  Well, because... [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1915.5800000000002s)]
*  That doesn't seem wise. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1916.5800000000002s)]
*  Because if you're a Special Forces guy, what is that? [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1918.1000000000001s)]
*  Look at all of them out there. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1920.7s)]
*  Yeah, what are they all out there for? [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1922.3400000000001s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1923.8200000000002s)]
*  This guy opened his tent, and they were all just there. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1924.8200000000002s)]
*  He probably knew where he was, I would hope. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1927.22s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1929.8600000000001s)]
*  Because he's laughing. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1930.8600000000001s)]
*  That's not good, bro. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1932.02s)]
*  Those are alligators. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1933.86s)]
*  So, whoa, whoa, whoa. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1934.86s)]
*  Can you back that up a little? [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1935.86s)]
*  Yeah, all the way behind it. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1936.86s)]
*  Were those eyes behind it? [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1937.86s)]
*  Yeah, yep, yep. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1938.86s)]
*  Look at all the eyes. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1939.86s)]
*  That's a nightmare. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1940.86s)]
*  That is so insane. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1941.86s)]
*  You go out to take a piss, and you just get rolled. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1942.86s)]
*  That must be a place where they all beach to dry off or something. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1948.62s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1953.4199999999998s)]
*  Back to God. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1954.62s)]
*  That's hell right there. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1956.82s)]
*  That is hell. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1957.82s)]
*  Hell on earth. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1958.82s)]
*  Do you think about spirituality or God? [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1959.82s)]
*  I try not to, because it's annoying. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1963.46s)]
*  I definitely don't bring it up. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1968.6599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but you have a lot of people on or talking about it. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1970.46s)]
*  I've been thinking a lot about spirituality. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1972.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1973.9399999999998s)]
*  You know. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1974.9399999999998s)]
*  There's a follow-up video. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1975.9399999999998s)]
*  This was in Brazil. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1976.9399999999998s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1977.9399999999998s)]
*  They did attack his tent a little bit. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1978.9399999999998s)]
*  So are those black canines as well? [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1980.4199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, those are black canines. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1982.54s)]
*  Oh my God, dude. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1983.54s)]
*  Homeboy just decided to camp out where they nest. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1986.6599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you do that in Australia, and they come into your tent. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1989.34s)]
*  So don't do that. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1992.6599999999999s)]
*  Fuck. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1995.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1996.18s)]
*  It's just there's so many interesting things on this earth in terms of life forms and how [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=1997.18s)]
*  they interact with the other life forms. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2002.8999999999999s)]
*  Some of them eat them with their face. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2005.26s)]
*  God, I know. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2006.8999999999999s)]
*  Like big giant life forms. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2007.8999999999999s)]
*  I know. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2009.5s)]
*  That have existed in that same exact shape for how many millions of years? [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2010.5s)]
*  How many millions of years of crocodiles been around? [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2015.78s)]
*  Let's guess. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2018.3799999999999s)]
*  A hundred? [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2019.3799999999999s)]
*  I mean, they're dinosaurs. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2020.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2021.3799999999999s)]
*  I mean, they're giant reptiles, right? [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2022.3799999999999s)]
*  What is the number? [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2023.98s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2024.98s)]
*  I'm going to say a hundred million years. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2025.98s)]
*  They probably predate the dinosaurs, don't they? [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2028.22s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2031.3799999999999s)]
*  Or coexisted with the dinosaurs. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2032.3799999999999s)]
*  I would imagine a version of them. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2033.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2035.3799999999999s)]
*  I mean, that's probably what life was like 65 million years ago. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2036.3799999999999s)]
*  It was just that everywhere. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2041.66s)]
*  Very few mammals. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2044.42s)]
*  What you're supposed to do, say you're on an island and you have to get to safety because [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2046.0600000000002s)]
*  there was that story about the guys who got stranded on an island. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2048.94s)]
*  240 million years ago. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2052.86s)]
*  They first appeared 240 million years ago. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2056.7400000000002s)]
*  It was the Mesozoic era in the time of the dinosaurs while others have evolved into different [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2058.58s)]
*  shapes and forms. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2062.64s)]
*  The crocs stuck. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2063.64s)]
*  The crocs stuck have stuck to the same, they fucked it up. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2065.98s)]
*  Crocs have stuck to the same structure for the last 200 million years. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2070.82s)]
*  It's not in the Bible, dude. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2074.5s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2075.5s)]
*  See, that's the problem. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2076.5s)]
*  Right? [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2078.5s)]
*  That's the problem. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2079.5s)]
*  Well, that's my problem. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2080.5s)]
*  For me, it's about metaphor. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2081.5s)]
*  Right? [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2082.9s)]
*  Right? [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2083.9s)]
*  Like there are too many contradictions. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2084.9s)]
*  That's why I don't get hung up on details. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2085.9s)]
*  I'm just more interested in the overall arching idea that I do think there is something called [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2086.9s)]
*  truth and I think there's something called a lie. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2092.7s)]
*  I think there's something called a good way to live and a bad way to live. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2095.3s)]
*  And I think if you extrapolate in either direction, one leads to something like fulfillment or [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2098.62s)]
*  who you're supposed to be and then the other leads to who you're not supposed to be. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2104.82s)]
*  That's what I kind of obsess about. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2109.22s)]
*  What do you think is the source of it? [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2110.22s)]
*  Where did the Bible come from? [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2113.82s)]
*  Did it come from man's inherent understanding of his connection with God and they wrote [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2115.38s)]
*  things down and eventually became stories? [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2120.46s)]
*  Or the real experiences that were divine? [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2123.5s)]
*  I'll answer it this way. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2127.42s)]
*  I think that any time you go through any kind of loss or destruction or hardship, you have [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2128.5s)]
*  a better chance at seeing something you wouldn't if you came from nothing but comfort, safety [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2137.0200000000004s)]
*  and something like the Garden of Eden. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2144.0600000000004s)]
*  So I think that it's... [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2148.6600000000003s)]
*  I don't think anybody escapes suffering. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2152.94s)]
*  I don't think anybody escapes some kind of ruin, some kind of loss, some kind of even [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2154.7799999999997s)]
*  age you start to lose all the things you're proud of. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2159.62s)]
*  And I think having to contend with that maybe and trying to derive meaning from that because [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2162.5s)]
*  if you don't have that... [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2168.4199999999996s)]
*  But hang on. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2169.66s)]
*  So that's a person. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2170.66s)]
*  That's not God, right? [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2172.66s)]
*  So it's a person's experience with misery and life and reality led to the creation of [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2174.66s)]
*  the Bible? [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2179.66s)]
*  I think I'm just talking about the idea that there are things that human beings are capable [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2181.7s)]
*  of, for example, conceiving of something that doesn't have any material relevance in the [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2186.62s)]
*  world but that later on does. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2194.1s)]
*  So let me give you an example. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2196.46s)]
*  There are mathematicians that devote their entire life to a theorem. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2198.3799999999997s)]
*  It's 350 pages long. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2204.22s)]
*  They're 80 years old. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2208.18s)]
*  Six people in the world understand what it's about and they end up dying. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2209.66s)]
*  And in 150 years later, somebody's trying to put a rover on Mars and they go, you know [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2215.3399999999997s)]
*  what? [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2219.98s)]
*  This equation actually is what I've been looking for and what we need to do such and such and [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2220.98s)]
*  such and such. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2225.7799999999997s)]
*  So all of a sudden it bears material reality. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2227.06s)]
*  I think that that's an example of maybe something that is grounded in the human mind that doesn't [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2231.66s)]
*  have to have its roots in experience, doesn't have to have its roots in what you can touch [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2241.62s)]
*  and what you can measure, but rather what you can imagine. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2246.9s)]
*  That's interesting to me. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2250.9s)]
*  That's the difference between a human being, say, and chat GPT or artificial intelligence. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2253.46s)]
*  The idea that artificial intelligence is working on a model that already exists. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2258.38s)]
*  It's sourcing from everything that's already been. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2263.9s)]
*  Something like the theory of relativity or something like a theoretical math theorem or [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2267.54s)]
*  for that matter even something that's really beautiful. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2272.2200000000003s)]
*  I don't know what it would be like the Sistine Chapel. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2274.62s)]
*  That brings us to our knees because it surprises us. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2278.94s)]
*  It shocks us. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2281.7400000000002s)]
*  It goes beyond what we thought was possible. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2283.1800000000003s)]
*  That I think is what's endlessly fascinating. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2287.18s)]
*  Then I would say to you, why? [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2289.2599999999998s)]
*  What is it about the human brain that we have a mind that can actually conceive of something [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2292.18s)]
*  like that and wants to? [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2296.8999999999996s)]
*  What is it about our mind that seems to have limitless potential for understanding and [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2299.54s)]
*  for creativity? [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2304.54s)]
*  To what end? [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2306.14s)]
*  To what end? [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2307.46s)]
*  It's not just comfort. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2308.7s)]
*  It's not just so I can have more food and I can watch more stuff. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2310.54s)]
*  Everybody who's had all that sensation doesn't do the trick, man. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2315.98s)]
*  You can follow all the sensation you want. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2320.7s)]
*  There also seems to be something with creating something as undeniably amazing and beautiful [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2322.3s)]
*  like St. Peter's Basilica where when you walk in there it's so overwhelmingly beautiful [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2328.14s)]
*  that everyone gasps and all these people are looking around. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2335.34s)]
*  sense, doesn't that mimic the divine force of creation in the universe? [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2340.74s)]
*  Yeah, you know what it does? [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2347.02s)]
*  Human beings and their creativity and their mind and their effort to express that have [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2349.9399999999996s)]
*  created this awe-inspiring thing of beauty. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2358.5s)]
*  You know what Chopin and Arnice said about that? [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2364.58s)]
*  When you see great art like that, when you do great art, anything like that, when you [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2368.78s)]
*  say I had a feeling of awe, what you're really saying is I forgot I was human for a second [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2375.2200000000003s)]
*  or an hour or whatever, meaning you forget you have to go to the bathroom, you have to [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2380.2200000000003s)]
*  have sex, you have to eat, you have to make money. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2383.82s)]
*  Something about that arrested development that's sort of in high relief you kind of [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2386.86s)]
*  go you just get you're awed by something that is possible. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2390.94s)]
*  It's like a majesty. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2396.7400000000002s)]
*  It's like this thing where you just go how do you not believe in God when I have this [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2398.14s)]
*  feeling, this feeling of inspiration maybe. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2402.5s)]
*  So God, again let's be careful with that. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2406.74s)]
*  I don't say Jesus, I'm just saying something bigger than myself. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2408.86s)]
*  Overwhelming power of the universe. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2413.94s)]
*  There might be a point to this. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2415.46s)]
*  There might be something about those two different ideas of power. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2418.54s)]
*  There's power that makes me bow my head, I'm afraid of you, which Pol Pot or Mao Zedong [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2421.7s)]
*  or Stalin had. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2425.62s)]
*  And then there's the kind of power that Michael Jordan has, where I look up and I want to [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2426.62s)]
*  be like you. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2431.3s)]
*  And it's the same idea. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2432.3s)]
*  So you see somebody who seems to do what you didn't think was possible. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2433.3s)]
*  You watch Jordan in his prime. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2437.02s)]
*  You watch an amazing musician do something on a guitar like Jeff Beck and create a sound [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2439.1s)]
*  you hadn't heard or the Sistine Chapel or whatever it might be and you just go how did [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2444.58s)]
*  you do that? [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2449.86s)]
*  How the fuck did you do that? [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2451.42s)]
*  And then there's a similar feeling that you get when you see mountains. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2452.94s)]
*  Like if you are on a ridge and you're looking out and you're seeing these snow capped mountains [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2456.62s)]
*  and a creek running through it and deer walking by, you're like holy shit is this beautiful. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2462.2200000000003s)]
*  It's beautiful. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2468.9s)]
*  And what is that thing about people? [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2470.78s)]
*  The recognition of beauty. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2473.78s)]
*  Like are we the only animal that recognizes beauty? [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2476.14s)]
*  Because we don't just recognize it. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2480.34s)]
*  We value it so highly. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2482.7s)]
*  Whether it's a beautiful landscape or a beautiful car or a beautiful woman, a beautiful house, [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2485.66s)]
*  there's something about the way things look that to us is just awe inspiring. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2493.8999999999996s)]
*  Well, there's a whole body of, you know, romantic body of, you know, true, a body of thought [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2501.1s)]
*  that says that beauty and truth are almost the same thing. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2510.22s)]
*  You know how the Greeks define beauty? [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2514.8599999999997s)]
*  It's a beautiful way of doing it. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2516.2599999999998s)]
*  In one word, harmony. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2518.02s)]
*  And if you watch a cheetah run, that's what you're watching. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2520.2999999999997s)]
*  If you watch even symmetry on a human body, you watch somebody in slow motion doing what [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2523.22s)]
*  they do really well, a great boxer. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2528.8599999999997s)]
*  You watch like Crawford or someone. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2530.5s)]
*  There's something about where they place their feet, how they move their body and you just [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2532.7s)]
*  go, well, you're even the way a great athlete is built. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2535.8199999999997s)]
*  Is a thing of beauty. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2540.14s)]
*  Sure. Like martial arts. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2541.54s)]
*  It really is an art form because when someone pulls it off in an amazing way, it is beautiful. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2543.62s)]
*  It really is. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2549.2599999999998s)]
*  There's no denying it. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2550.14s)]
*  Also, like when Justin Gagey head kick Dustin Poirier this weekend. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2552.5s)]
*  I know that was a thing of beauty. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2556.5s)]
*  I know it was amazing. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2558.86s)]
*  It was amazing. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2561.1s)]
*  Were you there for that? [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2561.98s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2562.86s)]
*  Was it did you hear it? [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2563.8199999999997s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2564.98s)]
*  It was perfect. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2566.1s)]
*  Yeah. It's the perfect kick. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2567.06s)]
*  Yep. Amazing. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2568.42s)]
*  One little detail. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2569.62s)]
*  To land that on Dustin Poirier like that and KO him. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2570.62s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2573.42s)]
*  We had, I had on Fighter in a Kid yesterday, we had Jorge Masvidal, who I love. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2574.42s)]
*  I love that dude. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2579.38s)]
*  He's the best. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2580.02s)]
*  And Jorge was, you know, Dustin's his boy. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2580.98s)]
*  So Jorge was, he said he's at the fight. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2583.58s)]
*  He's like, he kept watching every time Dustin would kick low, Justin was kind of dipping his head. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2587.02s)]
*  So Jorge's and right at the start of the second round, he's like, head kick. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2594.14s)]
*  Dustin, head kick. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2598.86s)]
*  Head. Oh, fuck. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2600.6600000000003s)]
*  Not, not, no, I didn't say Justin, Dustin. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2602.34s)]
*  And he just caught him. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2605.1s)]
*  And it was just, it was just because he had his hand here. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2605.98s)]
*  Yeah. It wrapped around his head. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2608.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2609.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. By the way, I don't know if you've heard the, I don't know if you heard the rumor, [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2610.2200000000003s)]
*  but Masvidal looked at Brendan yesterday on Fighter in a Kid and said, hey, man, [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2615.38s)]
*  you could always step in the old cage again. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2621.98s)]
*  Oh, boy. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2625.82s)]
*  And, you know, but the numbers, there's some numbers thrown around there. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2626.58s)]
*  And I was like, I heard those numbers. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2630.82s)]
*  And I kind of went, hey, he's in. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2632.98s)]
*  And Brendan was like, hey, what the fuck are you talking about? [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2635.58s)]
*  I go, shut the fuck up, dude. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2637.1s)]
*  And I was like, maybe I'll do it. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2638.62s)]
*  It's some numbers. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2640.58s)]
*  Yeah. Brendan does not need to get hit in the head anymore. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2641.82s)]
*  Just, hey, wrestle him. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2644.38s)]
*  I thought you were his friend. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2645.7799999999997s)]
*  Wrestle him. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2646.54s)]
*  If you can. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2647.62s)]
*  He was throwing Derrick Lewis out there with no gloves. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2648.3s)]
*  Good lord. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2650.46s)]
*  But wait, hold on. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2651.22s)]
*  Just hear me out. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2652.14s)]
*  Do you want to die? [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2652.86s)]
*  Sir, hear me out. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2653.74s)]

*  I'm just talking about just shoot a blast double. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2656.14s)]
*  Shut the fuck up. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2659.3399999999997s)]
*  Take him to the ground. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2660.02s)]
*  And then we got that. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2660.54s)]

*  Shut the fuck up. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2662.8599999999997s)]
*  I'm just talking. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2664.58s)]
*  Derrick Lewis puts people in neighboring dimensions. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2666.02s)]
*  He hits you so fucking hard, you just cease to exist in this plane. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2669.2999999999997s)]
*  So terrifying. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2672.66s)]
*  When he knocked out Curtis Blades with that uppercut. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2673.7799999999997s)]
*  Oh, god. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2675.8599999999997s)]
*  Curtis Blades is a big man. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2676.3399999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2677.9s)]
*  I've seen him train. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2678.46s)]
*  He's a big man. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2679.22s)]
*  And when Derrick landed that uppercut and just flatlined him, [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2680.42s)]
*  they just face planted him. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2683.02s)]
*  I'm like, good lord. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2684.18s)]
*  What is that power? [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2685.98s)]
*  They've never met him. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2687.02s)]
*  He's the best power in the history of the sport. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2687.78s)]
*  He does? [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2689.54s)]
*  Yes. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2690.06s)]
*  Derrick Lewis has the most knockouts. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2690.42s)]
*  Statistically, he has the most knockouts. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2692.62s)]
*  More than Ingano? [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2694.54s)]
*  We has 14 now, I believe. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2695.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2697.14s)]
*  Because he just knocked out Jorjero de Lima. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2697.62s)]
*  He's a fucking monster, man. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2702.58s)]
*  Oh, I'm saying. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2705.14s)]
*  When Derrick starts swinging bombs at you, man, [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2705.9s)]
*  the power that guy generates is so crazy. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2708.7400000000002s)]
*  Even Ingano didn't engage with him. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2711.14s)]
*  That was the most boring fight of all time. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2713.62s)]
*  Oh, god. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2715.9s)]
*  No, stop, stop, stop. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2716.54s)]
*  Watch this again. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2716.98s)]
*  Watch that uppercut again. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2717.58s)]
*  Watch how he lands it. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2719.18s)]
*  It's so pretty. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2720.54s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2721.1s)]
*  Boom. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2721.66s)]
*  OK, OK. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2723.2599999999998s)]
*  I mean, he's out. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2723.7799999999997s)]
*  He's out long before that. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2724.74s)]
*  I mean, he's out before he hits the ground. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2727.38s)]
*  That's awful. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2729.38s)]
*  Derrick's the number one knockout puncher [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2730.22s)]
*  in the history of the sport. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2732.02s)]
*  He has more knockouts than anybody in any division [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2733.34s)]
*  in all the sport. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2736.34s)]
*  He fucks everybody up, dude. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2737.46s)]
*  He would do that. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2738.7s)]
*  That would be bad. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2739.02s)]
*  Dude, you don't want to get hit once by Derrick Lewis. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2739.8199999999997s)]
*  He drops bombs, man. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2743.6600000000003s)]
*  All I'm saying is, is there a number on a check? [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2745.1000000000004s)]
*  And he's a lot more fit now, too. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2748.0600000000004s)]
*  That was what's really interesting about his last fight. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2749.82s)]
*  He really dedicated himself. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2752.0600000000004s)]
*  He had a fucking, he had abs. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2753.3s)]
*  At the weigh-ins, he had abs. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2755.9s)]
*  You look at him like, because he used to have to starve himself [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2757.5s)]
*  to make 265. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2760.6200000000003s)]
*  So he would really be undisciplined about it [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2762.38s)]
*  where he had to go three days without eating. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2765.94s)]
*  And he did that a couple of times. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2768.26s)]
*  He did that for one of his last fights, and he felt terrible. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2769.6200000000003s)]
*  Because he's got to weigh 265, which is, to me, insane. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2772.78s)]
*  That he has to suck down. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2775.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2776.6600000000003s)]
*  That's how big he is. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2777.1400000000003s)]
*  That's how big he is. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2778.26s)]
*  I was in the elevator with the ones before I did. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2778.82s)]
*  And that's also why they should have a fucking super heavyweight [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2780.42s)]
*  division. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2782.7000000000003s)]
*  Don't you want to see a 400-pound dude? [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2783.38s)]
*  Yes, I do. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2785.1800000000003s)]
*  Vroom, vroom. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2785.7000000000003s)]
*  Yes, I do. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2786.46s)]
*  Want to see the Mountain fight in MMA? [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2786.94s)]
*  I agree. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2788.5s)]
*  The Mountain could not fight in MMA. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2789.34s)]
*  He's too big. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2790.7400000000002s)]
*  Well, the biggest guy is Brian Shaw, who I've become good [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2791.42s)]
*  friends with. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2795.78s)]
*  He's so big. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2796.3s)]
*  What does he weigh? [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2797.02s)]
*  So Brian came to my show in Denver, [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2797.78s)]
*  and I did a whole episode of two episodes called Best Of, [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2800.38s)]
*  my YouTube show with him. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2805.34s)]
*  I went to his gym, and I worked out with him. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2806.42s)]
*  And it was just so much fun. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2808.98s)]
*  Does he do the Atlas stones and shit? [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2810.3s)]
*  Dude, listen. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2812.1400000000003s)]
*  This is a real thing. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2813.94s)]
*  OK, he's 6'8". [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2814.94s)]
*  I think might be 6'9". [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2816.34s)]
*  And he is 441 pounds. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2818.3s)]
*  He was 465 pounds. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2820.42s)]
*  Trim. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2822.02s)]
*  Fucking trim. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2823.2200000000003s)]
*  465. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2824.82s)]
*  So he would have to lose 200 pounds to fight in the UFC. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2825.86s)]
*  Dude, he took 300 pounds in one hand, Joe. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2828.62s)]
*  300 pounds in one hand. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2833.7s)]
*  Look. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2834.58s)]
*  And went like that. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2835.1s)]
*  He squatted 720. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2836.62s)]
*  720. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2838.42s)]
*  Yeah, he's ridiculous. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2839.94s)]
*  That's so insane. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2841.7s)]
*  There's more to him. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2842.46s)]
*  But let's just let him. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2843.54s)]
*  He's a very smart guy, though. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2844.62s)]
*  Very smart. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2845.8599999999997s)]
*  You've got to have him on the podcast. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2847.62s)]
*  Very smart. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2849.18s)]
*  He's about to do the Brian Shaw Classic, which [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2850.42s)]
*  is going to be huge. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2852.46s)]
*  He's squatting a car in the Brian Shaw Classic. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2853.9s)]
*  Imagine trying to do jiu-jitsu against that guy. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2856.42s)]
*  Well. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2858.82s)]
*  What are you going to do? [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2859.58s)]
*  Well, I'm a little obsessed with him [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2860.98s)]
*  because he squatted 720 pounds 13 times in under a minute. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2862.54s)]
*  Why don't we get this guy to train jiu-jitsu? [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2867.86s)]
*  How old is he? [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2869.7000000000003s)]
*  He's 40. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2870.5s)]
*  He'd smoke everybody. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2872.14s)]
*  I know he would. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2873.06s)]
*  All he has to do is get him to like blue belt level. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2873.7000000000003s)]
*  He's playing with the idea of arm wrestling. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2875.62s)]
*  And Levant, the greatest guy of all time, [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2877.78s)]
*  the set of a funny video going, Brian, [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2880.2200000000003s)]
*  we don't need you in the arm wrestling division. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2882.02s)]
*  He's so ridiculously strong. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2884.1800000000003s)]
*  You've got to remember, he picked up a Thomas Inch [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2885.82s)]
*  barbell. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2888.06s)]
*  He was playing basketball. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2888.42s)]
*  And he was just walking around like a giant guy. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2889.6200000000003s)]
*  And you know what the Thomas Inch is? [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2891.7000000000003s)]
*  It's a circus trick. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2893.26s)]
*  Like, nobody can do it. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2894.2200000000003s)]
*  You have to pinch the barbell and lift it up. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2895.1400000000003s)]
*  Everybody who's strong tries to do it. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2899.1800000000003s)]
*  You can't do it. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2900.5800000000004s)]
*  It's one in like 100 million people can do it. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2901.1400000000003s)]
*  And he walked over and goes, I don't know. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2903.1400000000003s)]
*  What is this? [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2905.34s)]
*  And they go, that's a Thomas Inch. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2905.98s)]
*  Try to pick it up. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2907.46s)]
*  Nobody could do it all day. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2908.1400000000003s)]
*  And he goes, OK. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2909.2200000000003s)]
*  And just pinched and went, this? [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2910.42s)]
*  And the guy goes, do you know what you just did? [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2914.02s)]
*  He goes, no. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2915.98s)]
*  This is before he started training? [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2916.94s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2918.18s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2918.82s)]
*  And he goes, if you don't become a strong man. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2919.34s)]
*  But what makes Brian special is his intelligence, [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2921.38s)]
*  but he's super competitive. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2924.3s)]
*  To the point, he came to my show in Denver, [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2927.14s)]
*  and we're talking. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2929.3s)]
*  What size the fucking guy? [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2930.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2931.1s)]
*  Yeah, those are over 200 pounds. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2931.62s)]
*  Bro, I want to get in his ear. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2933.14s)]
*  Oh, no, no. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2935.14s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2935.62s)]
*  Talk him into slap fighting. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2936.38s)]
*  Well, there's a video of him slap fighting. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2937.9s)]
*  He was hitting him. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2941.1s)]
*  Yes. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2941.98s)]
*  You don't understand how big he is, bro. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2942.82s)]
*  Oh, I do understand. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2944.46s)]
*  I saw a picture of you guys next to each other. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2945.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2946.78s)]
*  Now, he, um. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2947.46s)]
*  He's like Shaquille O'Neal, but built like the Hulk. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2948.54s)]
*  But this is how he is. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2951.5800000000004s)]
*  He read a story about a guy. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2952.94s)]
*  I think he knew the guy who got fucked up by a black bear. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2954.54s)]
*  The bear pulled his face off or something like that. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2958.02s)]
*  And the bear weighed like, I think they found the bear, [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2961.02s)]
*  and the bear was like 450 pounds. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2963.34s)]
*  OK? [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=2965.94s)]

*  You're not a bear. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3016.3s)]
*  The strength those things have, they [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3017.54s)]
*  drag mooses around with their face. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3020.3s)]

*  He's so big. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3222.6600000000003s)]
*  It was just like when Buster Douglas beat Mike Tyson. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3223.58s)]
*  It couldn't be done. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3226.02s)]
*  Fabricio catches him in a triangle. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3227.7000000000003s)]
*  Fabricio was so dangerous because his guard was just [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3229.66s)]
*  as lethal as his top game. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3233.8199999999997s)]
*  A lot of times those big guys, with the exception of Frank [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3235.7799999999997s)]
*  Muir, who also had a super, super lethal guard [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3238.14s)]
*  as a heavyweight, most of those really big guys, [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3240.8199999999997s)]
*  they're always on top of the training rope. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3244.06s)]
*  They're 250, 260. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3246.54s)]
*  They're just driving on top of you and they're getting mountain. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3248.3399999999997s)]
*  They use that strength and that pressure for their game. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3251.58s)]
*  But Fabricio Verdun is smart. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3255.98s)]
*  And so what he realized is, look, he's already a big, [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3258.5s)]
*  giant dude. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3261.7s)]
*  If he develops a lethal fucking guard, [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3262.82s)]
*  then it doesn't matter where he is. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3265.14s)]
*  So he put as much emphasis into the guard as every other [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3267.14s)]
*  aspect of his game. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3270.5s)]
*  So his guard was just fucking nasty against world class [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3271.42s)]
*  heavyweights in an MMA fight. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3275.54s)]
*  To lock up a triangle like that on Fedor Emelianenko [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3277.02s)]
*  in his prime, amazing. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3280.62s)]
*  I know, it's so insane. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3282.34s)]
*  Dude, Fabricio Verdun is the fucking man. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3283.46s)]
*  When you watch his jiu-jitsu, when he gets on top of guys, [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3286.82s)]
*  they're fucked, man. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3289.6600000000003s)]
*  Well, I think it was just his, he was a craft, [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3291.06s)]
*  the craft, he was a technician too. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3293.1000000000004s)]
*  To be that big but also technical. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3296.98s)]
*  World champion in jiu-jitsu. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3298.5800000000004s)]
*  World top of the food chain jiu-jitsu, [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3300.38s)]
*  but with an MMA warrior. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3303.98s)]
*  A guy who can knock you out too. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3306.1800000000003s)]
*  Just a competitor. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3307.54s)]
*  Yeah, so I don't know how that fight plays out. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3308.7400000000002s)]
*  Junior Dos Santos obviously is an elite striker too. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3311.6200000000003s)]
*  Long in the tooth, he's been in the game for a long time. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3315.7s)]
*  He's had some real wars. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3318.66s)]
*  Yeah, but he's in shape. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3319.74s)]
*  Those Steve Bay fights, the Cain Velasquez fights. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3320.58s)]
*  No matter what you do, those take something out of you. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3323.3399999999997s)]
*  Those kind of wars. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3325.7s)]
*  He's in crazy shape right now though. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3326.54s)]
*  I'm sure. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3327.58s)]
*  Well, these guys, I love the fact [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3328.9s)]
*  that there's other organizations [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3330.7799999999997s)]
*  that are giving these guys a chance. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3332.22s)]
*  And honestly, I'm a fan of the idea, [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3333.9s)]
*  at least the idea of bare knuckle MMA. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3336.66s)]
*  Cause I think- [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3339.1s)]
*  You've always said that. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3339.94s)]
*  Yes. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3340.7599999999998s)]
*  Cause I think there's something very unrealistic [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3341.6s)]
*  about just opening up and punching people with your knuckles. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3343.06s)]
*  You can break your hands. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3345.74s)]
*  And it's also defense wise, [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3347.22s)]
*  when you have, especially boxing gloves. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3349.14s)]
*  Boxing gloves give you this very distorted area of protection [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3351.46s)]
*  that you do not have when it's just your hands. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3356.34s)]
*  Things sneak through. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3358.42s)]
*  You gotta be literally like that. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3359.2599999999998s)]
*  Well, Mike Perry talked about it. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3361.46s)]
*  Like he's the most successful MMA fighter [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3362.74s)]
*  to make the conversion to bare knuckle boxing. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3365.58s)]
*  And I think he's like uniquely suited for it. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3368.3s)]
*  Cause he's such a dog. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3370.82s)]
*  Such a mad dog. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3373.82s)]
*  Luke Rockhold's a monster. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3374.66s)]
*  But that check hook wasn't working on, [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3375.48s)]
*  Mike just plowed ahead and just said, [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3377.62s)]
*  you're gonna break your hand. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3379.5s)]
*  I'm gonna lead with this part of my head [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3380.34s)]
*  and I'm gonna swing. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3382.5s)]
*  And it's hard to deal with that, man. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3384.14s)]
*  When you're dealing with gloves, [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3385.66s)]
*  you can't roll the same way. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3386.62s)]
*  Also, Mike has got some real experience in those fights. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3388.86s)]
*  He's been doing it for a while now. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3392.38s)]
*  He's all in on bare knuckle boxing. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3394.34s)]
*  He knows strategies. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3396.94s)]
*  He knows to punch differently. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3398.7400000000002s)]
*  Like you gotta think that was [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3400.22s)]
*  Luke Rockhold's first bare knuckle boxing fight. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3401.26s)]
*  Like you don't really get to train hard bare knuckle boxing. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3404.3s)]
*  Like you can't really spar bare knuckle boxing. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3407.82s)]
*  You'll cut your face out. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3409.86s)]
*  It's a different thing. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3410.9s)]
*  It's a different game. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3411.82s)]
*  Every time you're in there, I would imagine at least, [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3413.2200000000003s)]
*  every time you're in there, it's a unique experience [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3416.1400000000003s)]
*  that adds to your repertoire of understanding [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3418.42s)]
*  what this thing is and how this is different [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3421.3s)]
*  than gloved MMA or boxing. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3422.82s)]
*  So it's just different. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3425.2200000000003s)]
*  And Mike excels in that. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3426.5800000000004s)]
*  That is where his skill set and his toughness [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3429.26s)]
*  and his fucking grit just dominates. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3431.7000000000003s)]
*  He dominates people. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3434.5s)]
*  It's almost a mindset. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3435.94s)]
*  It's a type of person that can do that. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3437.1400000000003s)]
*  He's an animal. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3438.1800000000003s)]
*  Dude's a legit 100%, no faking it, all animal. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3439.3s)]
*  He's not pretending to be an animal. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3443.6200000000003s)]
*  That is who that guy is. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3445.5s)]
*  And when he fights in the bare knuckle boxing ring, [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3446.7400000000002s)]
*  he's like uniquely qualified [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3448.98s)]
*  to fuck people up in that sport. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3450.7400000000002s)]
*  So let me ask you, you know fighting. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3452.1800000000003s)]
*  Bradley Martin on the podcast said he was gonna beat, [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3454.94s)]
*  he could beat Mighty Mouse, but he has no Mighty Mouse. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3458.58s)]
*  Mighty Mouse said, I'm going on vacation, [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3460.98s)]
*  but when I get back, I'm down. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3463.18s)]
*  They're not gonna have MMA fight. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3465.42s)]
*  They're gonna have a Jiu-Jitsu match. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3466.62s)]
*  Bradley Martin has no chance. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3468.58s)]
*  Against 125 pound fighter. He has no chance. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3470.9s)]
*  Is there a time limit? [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3473.46s)]
*  There is not a time limit, sir. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3474.82s)]
*  Then he has no chance. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3475.66s)]
*  Is that right? Zero chance. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3476.58s)]
*  He's gonna get his back taken. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3477.62s)]
*  He's gonna get choked out. Oh, he's 100% [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3478.82s)]
*  gonna get choked out. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3479.98s)]
*  So we're gonna- It's just gonna take time. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3481.06s)]
*  Yeah, we're gonna lay some mats out. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3482.7s)]
*  Bradley is enormous. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3483.7s)]
*  And Bradley is so fucking strong. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3486.1s)]
*  He's an athlete too. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3488.8999999999996s)]
*  He's an athlete. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3489.74s)]
*  Yeah. Yes. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3490.58s)]
*  No, he's a fucking specimen. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3491.4199999999996s)]
*  He's a specimen. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3493.62s)]
*  Now, if this was in a street fight, [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3494.8199999999997s)]
*  the thing about Bradley is he can hit you with the earth. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3498.22s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3502.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3503.62s)]
*  Like he can literally pick you up [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3504.4599999999996s)]
*  and you're gonna- And just dive on you. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3505.7s)]
*  Hit the earth with, what does he weigh? [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3506.7s)]
*  270, 280, what does he weigh? [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3508.58s)]
*  He's 265, but like- [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3511.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3513.22s)]
*  His hands, when you grab his hands. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3514.8999999999996s)]
*  There's Bradley. Yeah. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3516.62s)]
*  But his hands are huge. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3517.82s)]
*  The amount of force that body can generate. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3518.82s)]
*  If that guy picks you up and smashes you into the ground, [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3522.22s)]
*  your body will shatter. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3526.54s)]
*  Yes. Your body will shatter. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3527.94s)]
*  If you're a human being, [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3529.5s)]
*  if somehow or another Mighty Mouse fucks up [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3531.06s)]
*  and that guy can pick him up and slam him into the ground, [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3533.18s)]
*  I don't know how much Mighty Mouse [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3536.46s)]
*  is gonna be able to physically do to mitigate that. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3538.7799999999997s)]
*  If that guy knows how to pick people up, [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3540.74s)]
*  if he has any wrestling at all, he's so big. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3542.3s)]
*  And Mighty Mouse is, you know, [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3545.7s)]
*  he probably walks around at a buck 50 or a buck 45 [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3547.54s)]
*  and he cuts down to 125. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3550.7s)]
*  He's so good. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3552.4199999999996s)]
*  I know. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3554.5s)]
*  But if they just know slamming, [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3555.3399999999997s)]
*  if they just do a jujitsu match, [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3557.1s)]
*  Mighty Mouse is gonna get him. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3560.54s)]
*  He's gonna get tired. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3561.46s)]
*  He's gonna get him, yeah. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3562.2999999999997s)]
*  He's gonna get tired. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3563.14s)]
*  He's not gonna know the positions. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3563.98s)]
*  He's gonna get trapped. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3565.66s)]
*  That's what jujitsu is. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3566.7s)]
*  That's what grappling is on that level. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3567.54s)]
*  It will be wild to see. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3568.8999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3570.46s)]
*  Because he's so much smaller. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3571.2999999999997s)]
*  We're gonna try to do it in the studio. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3572.14s)]
*  We're gonna have some mats laid out. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3573.9399999999996s)]
*  There's some old videos of Pedro Sauer. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3575.22s)]
*  Pedro Sauer is a legendary MMA black belt. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3578.8599999999997s)]
*  Had a match with a bodybuilder. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3583.4199999999996s)]
*  And Pedro Sauer, [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3586.2999999999997s)]
*  he's not a big guy. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3588.8999999999996s)]
*  I wanna say he's maybe, [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3589.94s)]
*  I don't wanna disrespect him, [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3591.46s)]
*  but I wanna say he's in the like 160 range, [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3592.8799999999997s)]
*  170 maybe at the most. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3597.22s)]
*  And this guy is this big fucking bodybuilder. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3598.8999999999996s)]
*  And they had like a no rules fight in the gym. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3601.74s)]
*  And this guy just thought he was gonna fuck him up. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3604.2599999999998s)]
*  And Pedro Sauer just kept kicking his legs [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3606.1s)]
*  and kicking his legs. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3608.4599999999996s)]
*  And this dude's like swinging punch. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3609.2999999999997s)]
*  Then he cracks him with a punch. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3610.4599999999996s)]
*  Look at the size of this guy. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3611.7s)]
*  But eventually he gets the dude down. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3613.22s)]
*  Yeah, that guy is not a fighter at all. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3614.8599999999997s)]
*  But look how skinny Pedro is. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3615.8599999999997s)]
*  He's not a big guy. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3617.7s)]
*  But that's not surprising to me. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3619.02s)]
*  I mean, if you do any boxing, [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3620.14s)]
*  a guy like that isn't, [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3621.62s)]
*  you never see a boxer or a fighter [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3622.9399999999996s)]
*  like who's that muscle. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3624.2999999999997s)]
*  But what all Pedro's trying to do [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3625.22s)]
*  is open him up for the takedown. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3626.58s)]
*  This is what he wants. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3627.8999999999996s)]
*  So the dude gets on top of him. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3628.74s)]
*  Beautiful butterfly sweep. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3630.58s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3632.06s)]
*  The way he did that, he executed it so, [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3634.1s)]
*  and look at the guy, rolled him over though. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3636.1s)]
*  That's how strong this fucking dude is. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3638.14s)]
*  But eventually he gets the guy. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3639.8999999999996s)]
*  He'll get tired. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3640.74s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3641.56s)]
*  He's got his hips too high. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3642.3999999999996s)]
*  But this is not as big a size and strength disparity [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3643.24s)]
*  as Mighty Mouse and Bradley Martin. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3646.98s)]
*  Bradley Martin is so much bigger than Mighty Mouse. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3650.4199999999996s)]
*  This guy was bigger and stronger for sure. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3652.5s)]
*  But Pedro Sauer's not a small guy. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3654.9399999999996s)]
*  No. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3658.7s)]
*  Got all the blood and shit already. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3660.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, he catches his arm here. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3663.54s)]
*  Oh, wrestling shoes on too. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3665.5s)]
*  Wrestling shoes are a giant. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3667.34s)]
*  Imagine he talked the bodybuilder into no wrestling shoes. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3668.7s)]
*  Isn't that amazing? [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3671.98s)]
*  Like why would that guy fight barefoot? [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3673.06s)]
*  And then he got him in the belly down. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3674.46s)]
*  That's a deep arm. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3675.3s)]
*  Those are horrible. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3677.3s)]
*  Just tap. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3678.7799999999997s)]
*  I've seen so many people get their arms broken. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3679.62s)]
*  Fuck that. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3681.14s)]
*  Do you know the one that freaks me out the most [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3682.2599999999998s)]
*  is the kimura. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3683.74s)]
*  Because it's that spiral fracture of the upper arm. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3684.82s)]
*  I'm always like, please, please fucking tap. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3687.94s)]
*  Please tap, please tap. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3690.06s)]
*  Please fucking tap. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3691.1s)]
*  I've said that so many times. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3692.7s)]
*  That's how I am now with, [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3693.54s)]
*  like when people get punched in the face too much. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3695.1s)]
*  I don't like it. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3697.46s)]
*  I don't wanna see it. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3698.2999999999997s)]
*  Meanwhile you're trying to get Brendan Schaub [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3699.14s)]
*  to go fight MMA bare knuckle against Derek Lewis. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3699.98s)]
*  There's a number on a check. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3703.02s)]
*  Derek Lewis will make you forget your childhood. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3704.2599999999998s)]
*  He will, for a while. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3706.74s)]
*  You won't remember anything below like 10th grade. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3707.7799999999997s)]
*  Then you're rich. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3710.7799999999997s)]
*  Then you're rich. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3711.62s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3712.46s)]
*  We gotta protect our boy's brain. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3713.66s)]

*  I hope he's too smart to do that. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3721.38s)]
*  I don't care how much money they throw at you. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3723.22s)]
*  You don't want Derek Lewis. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3725.22s)]
*  That giant flying knee that he landed [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3726.38s)]
*  to start out the fight. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3728.66s)]
*  He goes, I was practicing that bullshit for five years. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3730.5s)]
*  I was ready to quit on it. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3732.94s)]
*  Is that what he said? [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3734.34s)]
*  Yes. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3735.82s)]
*  He took his fucking pants off in the octagon. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3736.7799999999997s)]
*  He ran around. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3739.14s)]
*  He did the X across his dick. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3739.98s)]
*  He said that to his wife. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3742.54s)]
*  He said to his wife, I'm coming home. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3743.38s)]
*  I'm going deep tonight. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3744.7799999999997s)]
*  He's an animal. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3746.46s)]
*  He's got a great sense of humor. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3747.58s)]
*  His fucking Instagram is the most funny Instagram. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3749.54s)]
*  It took it down. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3752.18s)]
*  No. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3753.1s)]
*  When? [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3753.94s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3754.78s)]
*  It's not up anymore, right? [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3755.62s)]
*  The Beast UFC? [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3756.46s)]
*  Check. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3757.3s)]
*  I hope they put it back. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3758.14s)]
*  Zuck, come on, buddy. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3758.98s)]
*  Maybe it's back up. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3760.22s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3761.06s)]
*  Put it back up. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3761.9s)]

*  But the way you work out now, like I work out, [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3867.18s)]
*  I still work out with Lou Perotta, [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3869.98s)]
*  the greatest, one of my favorite people on the planet, [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3871.62s)]
*  66 year old guy, strong man, [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3874.62s)]
*  been working out his whole life. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3877.42s)]
*  We work out maybe 20, 25 minutes. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3878.9s)]
*  It's a motherfucker. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3881.46s)]
*  It's a motherfucker. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3882.58s)]
*  But the way he confuses my nervous system [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3883.72s)]
*  and stuff like that, like I always feel good and energized. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3885.7s)]
*  I mean, some days will be strength, [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3888.94s)]
*  other days will be like what he calls hygiene. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3890.28s)]
*  Hygiene? [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3892.82s)]
*  Like we'll do, it'll always be something like, [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3893.66s)]
*  it'll always be something like a full body movement, right? [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3896.58s)]
*  So whether it's weighted lunges or pull-ups, [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3899.94s)]
*  deadlift and stuff like that. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3907.06s)]
*  But a lot of times it's not heavy weight. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3908.46s)]
*  It's not a heavy day. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3910.58s)]
*  It's just me going low, stretching it out, pulling it up. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3911.8599999999997s)]
*  And I always feel more flexible and strong. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3915.46s)]
*  I never feel injured. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3917.94s)]
*  I can do anything. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3919.2999999999997s)]
*  So if I was in Jordan and I, [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3920.14s)]
*  this is the dumbest fucking thing I've ever done. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3922.54s)]
*  But I was like, I'm done with this. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3924.14s)]
*  I'm done with being on a fucking tour. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3926.06s)]
*  And there was this Bedouin guy with an Arabian horse. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3930.18s)]
*  I was in Petra and I don't know what got into me, man. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3933.66s)]
*  I just was like, how much for you [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3936.84s)]
*  just to take me on that horse? [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3939.7s)]
*  I wanna get on the horse and I wanna just ride. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3940.98s)]
*  Now I haven't ridden in 20 fucking years. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3943.0s)]
*  And I almost died because I had no business being, [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3946.1s)]
*  you know in the movies where you get on the horse [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3949.18s)]
*  and my sister's like, what are you doing? [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3951.42s)]
*  And I'm trying to turn it and the horse is doing this. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3953.02s)]
*  And I'm, and it just takes off. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3955.3s)]
*  It was like that comedic. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3957.1800000000003s)]
*  So you were controlling the horse? [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3959.34s)]
*  No, the horse was riding me. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3961.6600000000003s)]
*  Okay, but it was just you and the horse, not the guy. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3963.46s)]
*  No, the guy's behind me and we're galloping [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3965.62s)]
*  and stuff like that. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3968.1400000000003s)]
*  And I just didn't have the balance. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3969.1800000000003s)]
*  I hadn't ridden in too long. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3972.1s)]
*  I just didn't have the balance. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3973.1s)]
*  I'm on a fucking horse. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3973.94s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3974.76s)]
*  And your estrogen's high. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3975.6s)]
*  And my estrogen, no dude, I'd stopped doing- [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3976.42s)]
*  You were weeping. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3978.7000000000003s)]
*  No bro, I stopped doing my propitia. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3979.54s)]
*  You were weeping when you saw the horse. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3981.1s)]
*  I was dead behind the eyes. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3982.06s)]
*  Okay. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3983.4199999999996s)]
*  And I was so, I was sore for a week after that [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3984.2599999999998s)]
*  because I was trying not to die [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3987.3799999999997s)]
*  because we rode for about an hour. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3989.02s)]
*  But the point I'm making is that I can do things like that [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3990.58s)]
*  and I never, I'm okay without injuring myself. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3994.1s)]
*  I can kind of do whatever it is, [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3996.9599999999996s)]
*  whether it's sand volleyball, whether it's fucking tennis, [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=3998.3799999999997s)]

*  I'm okay. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4017.06s)]

*  you're not gonna be injured. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4020.26s)]
*  Right. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4021.46s)]
*  And as you get older, I just, [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4022.3s)]
*  I don't want my body to be in the way. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4023.42s)]
*  Yeah, weightlifting is very important as you get older. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4024.9s)]
*  Yes. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4027.02s)]
*  It's very important to keep your muscle mass, [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4027.86s)]
*  keep your strength. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4029.1s)]
*  Yes. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4030.1s)]
*  It's like there's a direct correlation [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4030.94s)]
*  between longevity and muscle mass. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4032.54s)]
*  And there's also, from preventing injuries, [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4035.3s)]
*  from a preventing injury standpoint, [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4038.1s)]
*  just being more resilient if you fall, [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4039.62s)]
*  things along those lines, you really wanna be strong. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4041.74s)]
*  And it's not even just for a vanity thing. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4044.18s)]
*  It's just, you wanna be strong [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4046.02s)]
*  because it's more valuable than being weak. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4047.7s)]
*  Yes. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4049.8199999999997s)]
*  There's no value in being weak. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4050.66s)]
*  But do you lift heavy weights all the time? [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4051.5s)]
*  The heaviest weight I lift is 70 pounds. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4053.14s)]
*  Okay, there you go. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4055.38s)]
*  That's the same thing. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4056.22s)]
*  I do these kettlebell routines where they're really brutal [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4057.06s)]
*  and I do them with long breaks in between them. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4061.62s)]
*  I do that Pavel Tatsulin method. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4065.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4066.8199999999997s)]
*  It depends on the day. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4068.62s)]
*  Some days I'll do a body weight routine, [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4069.7799999999997s)]
*  which is much more cardiovascular intense. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4071.7s)]
*  But when I do the kettlebell routine, [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4074.8999999999996s)]
*  I warm up with 35s and then I do a couple of sets with 50s. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4076.94s)]
*  Or I'm just basically doing 10 reps, getting things going, [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4082.1s)]
*  and then I switch to 70s. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4086.7799999999997s)]
*  And the 70s is when I'm doing my heavy shit. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4088.3399999999997s)]
*  That's when I'm doing gorilla cleans [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4091.2599999999998s)]
*  where you're switching arms. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4094.8199999999997s)]
*  That's when I'm doing clean press and squats. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4096.3s)]
*  That's when I'm doing windmills. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4098.74s)]
*  That's what I'm doing. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4100.62s)]
*  And 70 pounds is not that heavy for you. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4101.46s)]
*  No, it's manageable. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4103.14s)]
*  It's totally manageable. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4105.02s)]
*  But that's as high as you go. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4105.860000000001s)]
*  And that's important. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4106.7s)]
*  But if I'm having two, it's 140 pounds. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4107.66s)]
*  That's a lot of weight. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4109.900000000001s)]
*  But the most important thing is that everything's working. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4110.74s)]
*  My core's working, my back is working, [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4113.9400000000005s)]
*  my legs are working. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4116.62s)]
*  And I'm conditioning my body [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4117.820000000001s)]
*  to be able to manipulate awkward weights [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4120.38s)]
*  and do it with windmills and stuff like that. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4123.58s)]
*  That's what I try to do. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4127.22s)]
*  That's my overall strengthening routine. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4128.3s)]
*  I just wanna keep my body where it works really good. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4131.54s)]
*  And then I max that in on the bodyweight days. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4134.740000000001s)]
*  It's push-ups, bodyweight squats, chin-ups, dips, pull-ups. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4138.62s)]
*  And so then I do this thing. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4143.3s)]
*  That's what he does with me. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4144.14s)]
*  That's exactly his philosophy. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4144.9800000000005s)]
*  He's like, I'm not having you lift heavy weights. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4146.38s)]
*  I'll flip a tire and stuff. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4148.7s)]
*  But he's like, you are at an age where your tendons [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4149.820000000001s)]
*  and your joints, you are gonna get injured. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4153.820000000001s)]
*  If you try to do that CrossFit stuff [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4156.26s)]
*  where you're lifting heavy weight all the time, [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4157.7s)]
*  something's gonna pop. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4160.54s)]
*  It just is. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4161.54s)]
*  You're gonna be tired that day. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4162.38s)]
*  Something's gonna be off. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4163.38s)]
*  You are not gonna be focused enough. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4164.5s)]
*  Boom. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4166.0599999999995s)]
*  And I don't do anything to failure. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4166.9s)]
*  And that's also what I learned from Pavel Tatselin. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4168.74s)]
*  He's like, if you can do 10 reps to failure, do five. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4171.34s)]
*  Really? [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4176.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and then wait a long time. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4177.44s)]
*  And then do another five. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4178.82s)]
*  Why? [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4179.78s)]
*  Because you're getting the same amount of work in, [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4180.62s)]
*  but you're not breaking down your tissue in the same way. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4182.46s)]
*  And he thinks it'll help you recover quicker [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4185.94s)]
*  and it'll condition your body [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4188.38s)]
*  to be able to do this more often. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4190.02s)]
*  Yeah, Lou calls it stimulate, don't annihilate. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4191.62s)]
*  You're talking about a guy, [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4197.06s)]
*  what I love about working out with a guy like this guy [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4198.1s)]
*  is he's been at it for, he's 66. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4200.06s)]
*  He's trained everybody. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4203.04s)]
*  And he's done it all. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4204.7s)]
*  He was a bodybuilder, a power lifter. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4205.86s)]
*  And he just has seen people come and go. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4207.3s)]
*  He's seen all the injuries. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4209.46s)]
*  Like Dorian Yates. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4210.54s)]
*  Guys like that, they just know. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4211.74s)]
*  They just know a lot. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4213.219999999999s)]
*  They've seen what an overabundance of steroids do. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4214.0599999999995s)]
*  They've seen what this does. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4216.82s)]
*  They've seen what that does. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4217.86s)]
*  So it's all about, it's body maintenance. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4219.12s)]
*  It's body maintenance. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4224.42s)]
*  Longevity. Stimulate, stimulate, stimulate. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4225.26s)]
*  Yeah, we figured out a lot of stuff [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4227.86s)]
*  so far on this podcast, guys. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4229.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you just gotta be careful not to hurt yourself. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4230.62s)]
*  And whenever I see guys doing like heavy benching and stuff, [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4232.82s)]
*  I'm like, yikes, buddy. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4235.9s)]
*  Well, jujitsu too, right? [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4237.36s)]
*  That's a good way to go. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4238.94s)]
*  But you can do jujitsu with good partners. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4239.78s)]
*  And you guys can both. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4242.86s)]
*  Drill. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4244.3s)]
*  You go like level seven or level eight. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4245.139999999999s)]
*  You're not fucking spazzing out. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4247.9s)]
*  You still rolling? [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4250.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4250.94s)]
*  You are? [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4251.759999999999s)]
*  I haven't in a while, but I'm doing it again. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4252.599999999999s)]
*  I was just waiting for my knee to get better. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4254.219999999999s)]
*  Have you ever rolled with Mr. Ryan? [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4256.099999999999s)]
*  No, I have not. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4258.46s)]
*  That seems like it would be not much fun. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4259.42s)]
*  Yeah, he's much bigger than I ever thought. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4261.66s)]
*  Yeah, I was rolling with Gabe Tuttle, [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4264.46s)]
*  who's the head instructor at 10th Planet. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4266.259999999999s)]
*  We did it for a while. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4269.0599999999995s)]
*  Then I fucked my knee up, [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4269.9s)]
*  and I realized I keep fucking it up. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4270.74s)]
*  So I stopped kicking. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4273.74s)]
*  I haven't kicked a bag in forever. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4274.82s)]
*  And I got a bunch of stem cell injections, [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4277.0199999999995s)]
*  and I did all those knees over toes things. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4278.9s)]
*  And I was just concerned with, [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4281.66s)]
*  this seems like it's continuing to deteriorate. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4284.0599999999995s)]
*  And I think if I continue with the same activities, [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4286.62s)]
*  it's gonna continue to deteriorate [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4289.219999999999s)]
*  to a point where I can't fix it. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4290.719999999999s)]
*  And I'm like, okay, I know how this goes. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4292.86s)]
*  I've seen other people do it. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4294.599999999999s)]
*  I'm gonna do a very hard thing, [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4295.919999999999s)]
*  which is hit the brakes on something I fucking love to do. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4298.3s)]
*  I love martial arts training. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4301.14s)]
*  It's the most fun. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4302.820000000001s)]
*  But I realized I really can't do that right now. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4303.96s)]
*  I could still punch the bag, but I'm like for a long time. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4306.14s)]
*  So for a fucking year, I barely kicked the bag. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4309.3s)]
*  I would every now and then walk up to it [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4312.820000000001s)]
*  and tap it a little bit. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4314.18s)]
*  But now it finally doesn't hurt anymore. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4315.02s)]
*  And after all the stem cell treatments [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4317.54s)]
*  and all the strength and conditioning routines [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4319.84s)]
*  that I put it through, [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4321.900000000001s)]
*  now it just occasionally gets sore, [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4322.78s)]
*  but it's nothing like what it used to be before. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4325.5s)]
*  What's the issue? [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4327.1s)]
*  Oh, I have two reconstructed knees. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4328.42s)]
*  And the left one, I had some meniscus removed. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4331.700000000001s)]
*  And recently, like about two years ago, [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4334.38s)]
*  I suffered an MCL tear. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4337.38s)]
*  And I didn't know it was an MCL tear. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4339.02s)]
*  I thought it was just, you know, just tweaked or whatever. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4340.820000000001s)]
*  And then finally I got it looked at. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4344.54s)]
*  And so I got a bunch of stem cells on that. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4346.08s)]
*  And that's when I stopped kicking. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4348.3s)]
*  And I went and just did like very regularly [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4349.6s)]
*  did the knee over toe stuff. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4353.9400000000005s)]
*  The pulling the sleds backwards, the step downs. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4355.58s)]
*  You know what's funny about you talking this way? [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4359.1s)]
*  It's like, as you get older, you get more delicate. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4360.58s)]
*  You calcify and you got to warm up better. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4362.34s)]
*  And you just get. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4364.9s)]
*  You know how I hurt my knee? [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4365.74s)]
*  How? [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4366.82s)]
*  I know exactly how. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4367.66s)]
*  How? [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4368.48s)]
*  You were kicking. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4369.32s)]
*  No. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4370.14s)]
*  Oh, I thought you were trying to do that. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4370.98s)]
*  No, that was my other knee. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4371.82s)]
*  With Joe Schilling? [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4372.94s)]
*  Yeah, that knee's fine now. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4373.78s)]
*  Yeah, I tore my meniscus. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4376.26s)]
*  I'm watching you do that, go on. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4377.42s)]
*  Fucking, if I had been there, [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4378.78s)]
*  it's like shop trying to race fucking Chappelle [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4379.98s)]
*  in a race without warming up. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4385.78s)]
*  I go, you're gonna fucking. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4387.14s)]
*  Yeah, you're gonna blow your hamstrings. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4387.98s)]
*  He blew both of them. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4388.98s)]
*  Yeah, I had jeans on and I was 53 with no warmup. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4390.54s)]
*  And Joe Schilling challenged me to a kicking contest. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4395.7s)]
*  I'm like, okay. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4398.58s)]
*  I saw it, yep. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4399.42s)]
*  Kicking hard, you kick too hard. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4400.26s)]
*  Yeah, so I did tweak my knee in that. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4401.66s)]
*  But that was fairly minor. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4403.38s)]
*  That was just annoying. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4405.78s)]
*  But I got a bunch of stem cells and fixed that too. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4407.58s)]
*  That doesn't bother me at all. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4409.86s)]
*  My right knee doesn't bother me at all anymore. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4410.98s)]
*  But my left knee, there is a piece of meniscus missing. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4413.16s)]
*  So this is what happened. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4416.2s)]
*  I was walking on stage at Stubbs. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4417.04s)]
*  I was doing these shows with Chappelle. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4419.36s)]
*  And this was during the pandemic. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4421.599999999999s)]
*  So we're backstage and everyone's barbecued. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4422.68s)]
*  And I'm walking, and the stairs at Stubbs [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4424.92s)]
*  are these concrete stairs and they kind of curve. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4427.28s)]
*  And I'm going to turn my recorder on on my phone [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4429.5199999999995s)]
*  and I stub my toe on one of the steps [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4432.48s)]
*  and twist my knee sideways. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4435.639999999999s)]
*  Bad, like in fucking pain. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4437.84s)]
*  Before the show? [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4440.5199999999995s)]
*  While they're bringing me up. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4441.36s)]
*  No. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4442.18s)]
*  And I'm on stage and my knee is killing me. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4443.860000000001s)]
*  And my leg is shaking like I'm nervous. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4445.5s)]
*  Oh no. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4448.820000000001s)]
*  Like my left leg is shaking. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4449.9400000000005s)]
*  And you're in front of, I don't know how many thousand, [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4450.780000000001s)]
*  12,000 people or something. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4452.820000000001s)]
*  No, no, no, it wasn't that many people. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4453.660000000001s)]
*  It was like 500 or something like that, 600 people. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4455.38s)]
*  But it was. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4457.9400000000005s)]
*  It's actually worse because they can see your knee. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4458.780000000001s)]
*  Well, they definitely could see my knee was shaking. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4460.860000000001s)]
*  But the set went great. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4462.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4463.9800000000005s)]
*  Like no one could tell by the material. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4464.820000000001s)]
*  I did the material the right way. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4466.1s)]
*  Yeah, when you just stand and fuck off it's like. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4466.9400000000005s)]
*  And it was, everybody was so enthusiastic. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4467.780000000001s)]
*  We were having so much fun. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4470.22s)]
*  But I fucked it up so bad doing that. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4471.18s)]
*  And then I started training Muay Thai right away. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4474.02s)]
*  I didn't stop. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4476.820000000001s)]
*  I just like, I shot some BPC 157 into it. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4477.66s)]
*  I waited a few days, started feeling better. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4480.820000000001s)]
*  I'm like, I'll just wear some knee sleeves and train. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4482.54s)]
*  So I went, I started doing. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4485.34s)]
*  Good idea. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4486.9400000000005s)]
*  Pro science. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4487.780000000001s)]
*  Well I was doing. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4488.62s)]
*  Shoot the shit in my knee. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4489.4400000000005s)]
*  Muay Thai in the mornings. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4490.280000000001s)]
*  Love dirt on it. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4491.3s)]
*  I fucking loved it. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4492.14s)]
*  I'd do Muay Thai and then come here straight from there. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4492.96s)]
*  Just crack pads and have a good time. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4494.700000000001s)]
*  But it just wouldn't get better. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4496.58s)]
*  It wouldn't get, it's also the same knee [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4498.740000000001s)]
*  I fucked up skiing. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4499.94s)]
*  I wiped out skiing. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4502.219999999999s)]
*  I got a concussion and I suffered what's called. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4503.379999999999s)]
*  You did? [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4505.86s)]
*  You wiped out skiing? [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4506.7s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4507.5199999999995s)]
*  And I got something that's called an insufficiency fracture. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4508.36s)]
*  It's when your knees smash together [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4511.139999999999s)]
*  because you don't have meniscus there. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4512.9s)]
*  And it cracked the top of my shin. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4515.0599999999995s)]
*  Ah, fuck dude. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4517.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it was very annoying. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4518.54s)]
*  That was my last skiing. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4519.58s)]
*  Because like, I was going around this corner [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4520.9s)]
*  and this lady was new. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4522.379999999999s)]
*  She didn't know what to do. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4523.96s)]
*  And she's just like sliding in the middle of the trail. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4524.96s)]
*  She just couldn't stop herself. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4528.339999999999s)]
*  And it was either take her out or fall. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4530.74s)]
*  And I fell hard. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4533.339999999999s)]
*  I banged the back of my head off the ground. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4534.259999999999s)]
*  And then the rest of the day I was just. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4536.78s)]
*  I got hit by a snowboarder. I had no coordination. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4538.98s)]
*  A young lady. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4540.66s)]
*  She knocked me. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4541.98s)]
*  I got just wiped. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4543.42s)]
*  And all she did was look back and I saw her down [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4545.219999999999s)]
*  in the line and I put my head down. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4549.4s)]
*  You didn't say anything? [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4553.0599999999995s)]
*  No, no, I was embarrassed. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4553.9s)]
*  I was like, I'm an old man. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4554.719999999999s)]
*  She was like a really good young girl. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4556.48s)]
*  And I was like. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4558.339999999999s)]
*  You got nervous. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4559.34s)]
*  No, she was too young. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4560.18s)]
*  She was like a fucking probably. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4561.0s)]
*  She just looked at you like an old man. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4562.38s)]
*  You were embarrassed of being old. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4563.22s)]
*  Yeah, an old man. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4564.04s)]
*  I'm like, exactly. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4564.88s)]
*  I'm like, I shouldn't be on there myself. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4565.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but she just plowed into you and Gwyneth Paltrow'd you. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4567.46s)]
*  I deserved it, bro. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4570.900000000001s)]
*  Gwyneth Paltrow won that case, right? [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4572.26s)]
*  Yeah, she did. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4574.1s)]
*  That guy seemed like he was full of shit. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4574.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, he's a fucking. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4575.780000000001s)]
*  Yes, he's completely full of shit. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4576.92s)]
*  I watched that. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4579.62s)]
*  Just seemed a little opportunistic. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4580.46s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4582.22s)]
*  Also. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4583.18s)]
*  Weren't they saying that he hit her though? [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4584.02s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4585.5s)]
*  It was embarrassing. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4586.740000000001s)]
*  He had all these ideas and what happened to him. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4587.66s)]
*  He couldn't go to dinner. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4589.98s)]
*  It was always. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4591.38s)]
*  Oh, so he just thought he was getting paid. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4592.22s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4593.9s)]
*  Isn't that wild? [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4594.74s)]
*  Even if Gwyneth Paltrow really hurt me, I wouldn't sue her. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4595.58s)]
*  Isn't that funny that people would do that [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4598.5s)]
*  where they just wanted to go away? [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4599.78s)]
*  Shortcut. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4600.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4601.78s)]
*  You're a shortcut taker. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4602.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I don't think I'm gonna be okay. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4603.44s)]
*  And my lawyer is saying that really we need to do something [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4605.26s)]
*  about this, significant. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4608.38s)]
*  Yeah, okay. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4609.7s)]
*  Really significant. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4610.54s)]
*  You go ahead and do that. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4611.38s)]
*  People who do that. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4612.5199999999995s)]
*  I love the greatest quote I ever heard Jordan Peterson say [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4614.42s)]
*  was in my 35 years of analysis, [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4617.7s)]
*  I've never seen anyone get away with anything ever, [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4621.42s)]
*  even once. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4625.54s)]
*  I fucking love that. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4626.9800000000005s)]
*  Amen. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4629.06s)]
*  Get that tattooed to your fucking. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4629.9800000000005s)]
*  He said, you can twist the fabric of reality for a while, [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4631.58s)]
*  but you ain't getting it. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4633.9800000000005s)]
*  The piper must be paid and the truth will get you. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4635.18s)]
*  So you can go ahead and do all those things. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4638.1s)]
*  You can fuck people over. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4640.34s)]
*  You can lie. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4642.06s)]
*  You can do that. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4642.900000000001s)]
*  But I'll see you over there. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4643.72s)]
*  I'll be at the bottom of the river [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4645.86s)]
*  while the bodies float by. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4647.139999999999s)]
*  You just keep doing that. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4648.299999999999s)]
*  Ooh, that's a great quote, isn't it? [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4649.139999999999s)]
*  That's Sam Tripoli, [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4650.0599999999995s)]
*  one of my favorite people on the planet. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4651.0199999999995s)]
*  Well, who is that? [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4652.9s)]
*  Is that Sun Tzu? [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4653.74s)]
*  I don't know, but Sam Tripoli is the one who says, [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4655.54s)]
*  you just gotta wait at the mouth of the river [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4657.7s)]
*  and let all the bodies float by. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4659.82s)]
*  Yeah, live long enough to see the bodies of your enemy [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4661.38s)]
*  drift by you in the river or something like that. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4665.179999999999s)]
*  Something like that. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4667.0599999999995s)]
*  What is the exact, I think, I believe it's the art of war. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4667.9s)]
*  I like that. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4670.42s)]
*  I like Confucius's notion on revenge. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4671.259999999999s)]
*  Before you seek revenge, remember to dig two graves. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4673.54s)]
*  It's great. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4676.54s)]
*  That's great. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4677.36s)]
*  Those wise things. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4678.2s)]
*  That's actually a really interesting idea. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4679.18s)]
*  Especially back to when there's no doctors. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4681.66s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4683.9s)]
*  Yeah, that's always. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4686.06s)]
*  When they would leech you. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4688.54s)]
*  Here it is, it's Sun Tzu, yeah, art of war. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4690.46s)]
*  To wait by the river long enough [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4692.18s)]
*  the bodies of your enemies will float by, damn. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4693.34s)]
*  Damn, dude. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4696.14s)]
*  I like that. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4697.62s)]
*  I think about that when I watch CNN. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4698.66s)]
*  You won that one, buddy. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4700.54s)]
*  You won that one. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4706.82s)]
*  The bodies of your enemies. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4707.66s)]
*  You won that one. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4708.82s)]
*  It's an amazing thing how, as you grow older [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4709.9s)]
*  and you have more life experiences, [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4717.34s)]
*  your perspective kind of like tightens and moves. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4719.14s)]
*  As you get older and as you see the world [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4723.22s)]
*  with more and more experience, [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4726.34s)]
*  you get a better and clearer picture. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4727.76s)]
*  It makes you wonder how limited were humans [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4729.94s)]
*  when they only lived to be like 30? [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4734.42s)]
*  How much did people really have a chance [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4736.62s)]
*  to expand and figure things out? [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4738.62s)]
*  I don't know because a lot of great things [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4740.139999999999s)]
*  were discovered or created probably then too. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4742.58s)]
*  For sure. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4745.139999999999s)]
*  I think when you're very aware of how finite your life is [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4746.34s)]
*  and when you're very aware that you are victim [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4750.94s)]
*  to forces that are so much stronger than yourself, [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4754.58s)]
*  whether it's disease, first of all, losing a child. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4756.66s)]
*  Right. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4759.98s)]
*  That was a reality, a common death. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4760.82s)]
*  It's like 50%. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4764.46s)]
*  Lincoln lost, I think, four of his children. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4765.42s)]
*  Mary Todd ended up in a mentalist institution [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4767.74s)]
*  because she lost four of her children to diseases. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4770.78s)]
*  They don't even know what they were, a fever, [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4774.099999999999s)]
*  probably diphtheria or whatever it was. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4775.94s)]
*  They would just roll through towns [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4778.66s)]
*  and it didn't matter who you were. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4780.139999999999s)]
*  Poor hygiene, no nutrition. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4781.26s)]
*  All that. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4783.74s)]
*  Yeah, people just died. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4784.58s)]
*  They didn't know what it was. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4785.58s)]
*  That people would die of what is it called? [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4786.78s)]
*  Malagra or whatever? [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4787.9800000000005s)]
*  Consumption. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4789.14s)]
*  Oh yeah, I mean that was everybody. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4790.14s)]
*  I think that sometimes when you're aware [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4794.46s)]
*  that there is a clock and that clock [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4796.28s)]
*  might ding at any moment. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4798.78s)]
*  In Japan when you get sentenced to death, [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4801.54s)]
*  they don't tell you what the date is. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4803.66s)]
*  You just sit in your cell and they show up [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4806.14s)]
*  when it's your turn. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4809.1s)]
*  It's an interesting idea because there's something [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4810.3s)]
*  about focusing your mind. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4812.94s)]
*  This might be your last day and it might be for everyone. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4816.339999999999s)]
*  Things have a different gravity to them. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4820.86s)]
*  And I think that that's where you get amazing, [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4822.94s)]
*  I don't know if I'm right about this, [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4826.58s)]
*  but I do think that there is something to be said [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4827.74s)]
*  about having very limited time, even living with pain. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4831.54s)]
*  Yes. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4836.299999999999s)]
*  You'll create some shit. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4837.139999999999s)]
*  You'll create some shit. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4838.78s)]
*  Well also that was the only reality available. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4839.62s)]
*  There was no notion of I just need to get back [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4843.7s)]
*  to civilization. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4846.62s)]
*  There was no I need to get to the city [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4848.259999999999s)]
*  and everything's gonna be back to normal again. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4850.099999999999s)]
*  I'll go to New York and ride the subway. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4851.54s)]
*  Correct. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4853.139999999999s)]
*  This doesn't exist. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4853.98s)]
*  Yeah, you didn't have the protection. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4854.82s)]
*  So the only reality that exists [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4855.66s)]
*  is this unbelievably difficult world of murder and violence. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4857.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but it does something else too. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4861.54s)]
*  I gotta pee. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4863.34s)]
*  You do? [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4864.16s)]
*  Yeah, let's go. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4865.0s)]
*  You do? [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4865.82s)]
*  I do, I do. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4866.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4867.5s)]
*  We'll come back. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4868.32s)]
*  We'll come back. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4869.16s)]
*  I gotta pee. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4869.98s)]
*  I'll secure your hips. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4870.82s)]
*  Oh, don't do it. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4871.66s)]
*  I think that's what you were saying. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4873.18s)]
*  Here's my thought on the idea of like when life [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4875.26s)]
*  was kind of brutish and short and all that. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4877.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4880.02s)]
*  I think it actually, so I think it's actually in a way, [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4880.86s)]
*  it is, it's not an accident that some of the greatest [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4885.06s)]
*  literature was written, you know, like Dostoevsky [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4888.22s)]
*  who was, you know, living in that rudimentary world [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4891.62s)]
*  and you have these great works of art. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4894.94s)]
*  I think part of it is what happens is if you are, [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4897.94s)]
*  basically you don't know when you're gonna die [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4902.860000000001s)]
*  because the universe is that much of a mystery. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4904.54s)]
*  I don't know when a disease is coming. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4907.22s)]
*  I don't know when invaders are coming [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4908.46s)]
*  and they're gonna enslave me. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4909.54s)]
*  I don't know and all that stuff. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4910.58s)]
*  There's something about creating art [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4911.9800000000005s)]
*  under those circumstances, your mindset, [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4915.62s)]
*  you are already humbled. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4918.780000000001s)]
*  It is not about you. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4920.740000000001s)]
*  It'd be really weird to like build a huge chapel [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4922.740000000001s)]
*  and then put your name on it. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4926.26s)]
*  You know, you didn't see great architecture, [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4928.26s)]
*  great buildings that were built [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4930.98s)]
*  and then the architect was Harold. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4932.179999999999s)]
*  Have you never been to Trump Tower, bitch? [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4934.419999999999s)]
*  That's very different, my friend. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4936.219999999999s)]
*  That's very different. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4937.98s)]
*  Giant gold Trump. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4938.82s)]
*  Yes, you wouldn't see that as much. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4939.9s)]
*  You see kings that did that [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4941.74s)]
*  but the artist didn't do that, Trump. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4943.7s)]
*  You know, apparently he doesn't own a lot of those buildings. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4946.94s)]
*  Shut the fuck up. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4949.299999999999s)]
*  What are you, a communist? [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4950.139999999999s)]
*  I'm just saying he leases, he puts his name on there [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4950.98s)]
*  which is great. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4954.419999999999s)]
*  He's so entertaining. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4955.74s)]
*  He's hilarious. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4957.419999999999s)]
*  But we're never gonna have. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4958.259999999999s)]
*  He tweeted or truth socialed rather. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4959.24s)]
*  No. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4961.72s)]
*  And he was like celebrating the indictment. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4962.5599999999995s)]
*  He's like one more indictment [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4964.72s)]
*  and then I'm gonna shoo in for the White House. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4965.8s)]
*  I know. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4968.24s)]
*  That's three indictments, dude. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4969.2s)]
*  He's got Teflon. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4970.64s)]
*  It's well. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4972.32s)]
*  If he wins this though, if he wins his case. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4973.16s)]
*  Well, if he wins his case, [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4977.48s)]
*  the only case. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4979.04s)]
*  I don't think he can pardon himself. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4979.88s)]
*  No, the only case he's gonna have real trouble with. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4980.72s)]
*  I think the other, the Bragg, [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4982.88s)]
*  Alvin Bragg case in, I think it's New York [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4984.32s)]
*  is a bullshit case where it's this obscure thing. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4987.0s)]
*  You got these prosecutors that are looking, [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4989.56s)]
*  they're being very, very creative with the law, right? [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4992.08s)]
*  Typically with laws, it's called meat and potatoes laws. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4994.84s)]
*  You're supposed to, when somebody breaks a law [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4997.64s)]
*  and there's a law that's passed, [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=4999.96s)]
*  it's supposed to be something that somebody [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5001.24s)]
*  who doesn't have a law degree can understand. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5003.16s)]
*  And like if you look at Jack Smith, [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5005.36s)]
*  who's the prosecutor in this January 6th thing, [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5007.4s)]
*  what he's being charged with I think is a form of fraud, [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5012.44s)]
*  defrauding the American voter, [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5016.16s)]
*  which is saying I won the election when he knows he lost, [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5019.68s)]
*  but he never ever admitted that he lost. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5024.28s)]
*  They can't find anybody who said that. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5026.5199999999995s)]
*  So there's all this gray area, [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5028.04s)]
*  but the one issue he's gonna have [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5029.84s)]
*  is the mishandling of classified documents. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5031.24s)]
*  Cause they have them on tape saying, [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5033.599999999999s)]
*  I know this is classified. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5034.88s)]
*  And then I think he has a guy, [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5038.28s)]
*  they have him talking to one of his staff [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5040.96s)]
*  saying, get rid of this. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5043.2s)]
*  That's gonna be a tough one for him. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5044.8s)]
*  But I think the other two documents are- [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5047.0s)]
*  What are the punishments of mishandling classified documents? [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5047.84s)]
*  There are people right now who are in jail for doing that. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5050.4400000000005s)]
*  They're right now. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5053.6s)]
*  And in fact, some of them I think worked for his campaign. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5054.4400000000005s)]
*  What is the difference between the accusations [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5056.52s)]
*  against Joe Biden, where he was mishandling documents [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5058.84s)]
*  and the accusations against Trump? [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5061.68s)]
*  So any time a president is, [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5063.360000000001s)]
*  presidents are allowed to have documents in their possession [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5066.24s)]
*  when they're working on their memoirs, et cetera. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5071.0s)]
*  Now the justice department and the affiliated agencies, [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5074.96s)]
*  as I understand it, then look at what you have. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5080.0s)]
*  And then they send you a notice and say, by the way, [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5083.12s)]
*  you have these documents that are in your possession. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5086.36s)]
*  X, Y, and Z are classified. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5089.599999999999s)]
*  You have to return them. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5091.24s)]
*  They give you a grace period [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5092.32s)]
*  in which to return those documents. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5093.719999999999s)]
*  So with Biden and with a lot of other presidents, [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5095.92s)]
*  that's what happens. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5098.839999999999s)]
*  They say you're in possession of classified documents. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5099.719999999999s)]
*  You have this window to return them, [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5101.839999999999s)]
*  and then you return them and Biden did. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5103.36s)]
*  With Trump, he didn't. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5105.28s)]
*  There are a number of things that he just didn't return. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5107.24s)]
*  But I thought Biden had classified documents [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5109.08s)]
*  that his aides found in his court of law. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5111.04s)]
*  They all do. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5112.88s)]
*  But wasn't that from 2014, from when he was vice president? [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5113.719999999999s)]
*  Yes, but the issue is not [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5117.88s)]
*  that he had those classified documents. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5119.5599999999995s)]
*  Is that he didn't turn them over when they were requested? [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5121.28s)]
*  Yes. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5122.92s)]
*  And there's a fundamental difference there. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5123.759999999999s)]
*  Now, if you then are, I think he said, [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5126.0s)]
*  I could have declassified this, but I didn't. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5128.679999999999s)]
*  Something like that. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5131.0s)]
*  When Trump said that, [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5132.5599999999995s)]
*  because by that point he was a private American citizen. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5133.4s)]
*  That's where the problem lies. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5136.12s)]
*  How these recordings, how were they obtained? [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5136.96s)]
*  I think they're all a matter of record. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5141.12s)]
*  I think that in discovery. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5143.36s)]
*  Well, how did someone record him? [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5145.0s)]
*  I think his lawyers had to, [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5146.759999999999s)]
*  well, a lot of what a president does [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5148.48s)]
*  when you're doing your memoirs and stuff, I think, [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5151.639999999999s)]
*  is they record you. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5154.28s)]
*  So you're recording a lot of things you're saying [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5155.5599999999995s)]
*  and things like that. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5157.32s)]
*  I think that helps. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5158.16s)]
*  He was having a conversation with someone [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5159.0s)]
*  where he was showing them the documents. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5160.24s)]
*  That was recorded somehow. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5161.84s)]
*  Yeah, somehow they have him on tape saying that. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5163.92s)]
*  So was it surreptitiously recorded? [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5167.04s)]
*  I don't know, and I didn't get that from what I followed. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5169.24s)]
*  I think that was just something [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5172.2s)]
*  that happened to be part of the body of evidence [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5174.04s)]
*  in discovery. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5177.08s)]
*  What I heard as an argument against that [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5177.92s)]
*  was that he was being braggadocious. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5179.360000000001s)]
*  They're gonna use whatever they can. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5182.360000000001s)]
*  And there's a chance he might get off on all of these things. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5185.64s)]
*  And there's no doubt that these indictments [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5189.92s)]
*  have made him stronger with his base. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5191.68s)]
*  The real question is, see, this is all, [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5194.76s)]
*  you're never gonna get people who say, [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5197.6s)]
*  well, Biden is really old and we don't have an ass. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5199.08s)]
*  Don't complain. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5202.200000000001s)]
*  If you're not gonna vote in primaries, [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5203.04s)]
*  we're always gonna have the candidates [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5205.240000000001s)]
*  that the most extreme elements of each party nominates. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5207.12s)]
*  If you want DeSantis or you want someone else, [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5211.400000000001s)]
*  you better vote in the primary. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5213.76s)]
*  If you don't vote in the primary, [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5215.200000000001s)]
*  nobody does, including me, [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5216.16s)]
*  so I'm not scolding anybody. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5217.8s)]
*  You're getting the people that the diehard Republicans, [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5220.12s)]
*  diehard Democrats and the most active members of that party [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5224.28s)]
*  are gonna nominate. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5227.24s)]
*  That's just gonna be there. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5228.72s)]
*  That's a fact. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5229.5599999999995s)]
*  You wanna change the political system, [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5230.4s)]
*  fucking vote in the primaries. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5232.04s)]
*  Andrew Yang, whoever you like, all these guys, [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5234.0s)]
*  that's all great, that's all adorable. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5236.0s)]
*  And the real political operatives just look at you [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5237.76s)]
*  and go, that's cute. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5240.08s)]
*  We'll see it. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5241.68s)]
*  What a wild system. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5242.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, vote in the primary. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5244.08s)]
*  A wild two-party system. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5245.76s)]
*  Yes, now the only thing that, [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5247.28s)]
*  like if DeSantis crushes in, [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5248.68s)]
*  first of all, I think he should go back [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5251.280000000001s)]
*  to being governor for four more years, [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5252.280000000001s)]
*  but if he wins the first two states, [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5253.4800000000005s)]
*  like New Hampshire and Iowa, [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5257.64s)]
*  and gets a lot of press for that, [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5259.080000000001s)]
*  there's a chance that there can be some, [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5261.040000000001s)]
*  but I don't think so otherwise. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5264.4800000000005s)]
*  I think the Trumpers are all in. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5267.160000000001s)]
*  The audio recording comes from a July 2021 interview [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5268.68s)]
*  Trump gave at his Bedminster Resort [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5271.4400000000005s)]
*  for people working on the memoir of Mark Meadows, [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5273.240000000001s)]
*  Trump's former chief of staff, [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5276.160000000001s)]
*  special counsel's indictment alleges [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5277.84s)]
*  that those in attendance, a writer, a publisher, [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5279.52s)]
*  and two of Trump's staff members [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5281.76s)]
*  were shown classified information [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5283.320000000001s)]
*  about the plan of attack on Iran. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5285.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5288.2s)]
*  Wow. Yep. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5289.28s)]
*  Wow. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5291.400000000001s)]
*  But here's what bothers me a little bit about all this. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5292.4400000000005s)]
*  So the- Hold on a second. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5295.56s)]
*  Let me see what Trump says here. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5297.92s)]
*  He says, there was no document [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5299.24s)]
*  that was a massive amount of papers [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5301.24s)]
*  and everything else talking about Iran and other things, [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5303.08s)]
*  Trump said on Fox, [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5306.32s)]
*  and it may have been held up or may not, [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5307.599999999999s)]
*  but that was not a document. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5310.28s)]
*  I didn't have a document per se. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5312.12s)]
*  There was nothing to declassify. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5313.96s)]
*  These were newspaper stories, [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5316.04s)]
*  magazine stories, and articles. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5317.5199999999995s)]
*  Okay. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5320.2s)]
*  Well, if that's true, [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5321.04s)]
*  that's a completely different thing. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5322.799999999999s)]
*  Then that sounds like they're saying [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5325.0s)]
*  that he showed them classified documents, [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5328.16s)]
*  and he's saying, I showed them a massive amount of papers, [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5330.639999999999s)]
*  and I didn't show them anything specifically. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5333.5599999999995s)]
*  And saying that there was nothing to declassify. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5337.04s)]
*  If he's telling the truth, [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5339.88s)]
*  these were newspaper stories, [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5341.0s)]
*  magazines, stories, and articles. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5342.16s)]
*  If that's true. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5344.12s)]
*  You're gonna have to, [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5345.4s)]
*  his lawyers are gonna argue all that. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5346.44s)]
*  This is political as much as it is legal. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5348.44s)]
*  Well, that's what scares me, [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5350.76s)]
*  that people are behind this idea [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5351.96s)]
*  that you're gonna arrest your political rival. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5353.48s)]
*  That's the biggest, not only that, [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5355.08s)]
*  but you have prosecutors [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5357.2s)]
*  that are getting real creative with the law, [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5358.28s)]
*  and I don't think we want a system like that, [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5360.16s)]
*  and I don't think we want, [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5361.679999999999s)]
*  every time somebody runs for office, [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5363.16s)]
*  because now the Bidens are in trouble. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5365.44s)]
*  I mean, Hunter Biden's in real trouble here. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5367.24s)]
*  And there is, this guy, Devon Archer, [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5369.5599999999995s)]
*  said that Biden was on the phone [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5372.599999999999s)]
*  on behalf of his son 20 times, [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5374.599999999999s)]
*  and that was Devon Archer, who's also going to jail. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5378.12s)]
*  Now that was Hunter Biden's business partner, [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5380.96s)]
*  and he said he personally witnessed that, [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5383.879999999999s)]
*  and he said that under sworn testimony. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5385.679999999999s)]
*  There is enough evidence to at least investigate the idea [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5387.44s)]
*  that maybe Biden took a $5 million bribe, [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5392.16s)]
*  whatever the case, but my point about this [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5394.8s)]
*  is the mainstream media, legacy media, [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5397.16s)]
*  gives that almost no attention. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5399.08s)]
*  And all you have, I think that the legacy of Donald Trump [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5401.320000000001s)]
*  will be, in some ways, the other side was so hysterical [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5405.96s)]
*  about him being a clear and present danger [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5411.56s)]
*  to the United States. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5414.400000000001s)]
*  And I'm talking about Republicans, [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5415.280000000001s)]
*  I'm talking about the deep state, [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5416.56s)]
*  I'm talking about Democrats, [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5417.6s)]
*  I'm talking about a lot of people, [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5419.04s)]
*  that they have behaved in an undemocratic, un-American way, [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5420.36s)]
*  they have bent a lot of rules, [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5425.719999999999s)]
*  and they're bringing these indictments, [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5427.84s)]
*  three of which now, I think, or four, [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5430.0s)]
*  in a period of six months. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5433.84s)]
*  I don't think we want a system like that. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5435.679999999999s)]
*  I don't think you want people running for office, [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5437.44s)]
*  and then somebody who's on the other side of the aisle [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5439.88s)]
*  gets real creative with their prosecutorial, [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5442.92s)]
*  with bending the law, [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5446.759999999999s)]
*  figuring out the gray areas of the law. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5447.599999999999s)]
*  And now you're spending all your money on legal fees. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5450.4800000000005s)]
*  Especially when there's been no answer [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5451.92s)]
*  to what they did with the Russia collusion hoax. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5456.4800000000005s)]
*  You mean Adam Schiff, who's still taking seriously? [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5459.96s)]
*  They promoted that. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5462.12s)]
*  They promoted that in mainstream media, [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5463.88s)]
*  they promoted that, politicians promoted it, [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5466.08s)]
*  they called him a Russian asset. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5468.72s)]
*  Listen, Adam Schiff, he was the chairman [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5471.0s)]
*  of the House Intelligence Committee, is that what it is? [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5474.6s)]
*  Adam Schiff knew, he never saw any evidence, [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5477.36s)]
*  any evidence that Trump was in collusion with the Russians, [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5481.799999999999s)]
*  or that the Russians were interfering [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5486.28s)]
*  in American elections, or that whatever. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5487.92s)]
*  Or there may have been evidence of that, [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5491.0s)]
*  but there was no evidence [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5492.719999999999s)]
*  that Russia and Trump were in collusion. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5493.799999999999s)]
*  And he kept saying it, he kept saying it [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5496.32s)]
*  on every news outlet he could. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5499.839999999999s)]
*  That's a fact, and he knew otherwise. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5502.92s)]
*  And no one's held him to task for that. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5506.04s)]
*  That was a lie to the American people, it just was. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5507.92s)]
*  And that's what I have a problem with. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5512.2s)]
*  And there's been no acknowledgement, [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5514.2s)]
*  like in mainstream media, that that was a hoax, [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5517.52s)]
*  and that he was innocent of what they were accusing him of. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5520.0s)]
*  None, none. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5522.52s)]
*  That is so wild, and they go from that to new accusations. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5524.08s)]
*  So for the casual, for the person that's not doing [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5528.16s)]
*  a deep dive on all these stories [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5530.84s)]
*  and reading all these articles, [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5532.04s)]
*  what you're getting is the narrative [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5533.6s)]
*  that you see in headlines. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5535.2s)]
*  Trump indicted again, Trump's a criminal, Trump did this. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5536.16s)]
*  Trump incited people to enter the Capitol on January 6th [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5539.4s)]
*  because he said the election was rigged. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5542.96s)]
*  And all this trouble that Biden is in now, [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5544.76s)]
*  and his son is in, was all on Hunter Biden's laptop. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5547.599999999999s)]
*  And we were told that there was nothing to see there. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5550.599999999999s)]
*  Was it 51 members of intelligence [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5553.84s)]
*  that you see signed off on that? [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5556.639999999999s)]
*  It was Russian disinformation. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5557.84s)]
*  So what does that do about, my problem with all of this [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5559.88s)]
*  is that it just destroys credibility. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5562.4s)]
*  It destroys people's faith in the institutions. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5565.24s)]
*  Which you said earlier is perfect. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5566.96s)]
*  It's un-American. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5568.2s)]
*  It really is, and I know you're doing it [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5569.639999999999s)]
*  because you think you wanna beat this guy [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5571.5599999999995s)]
*  by any means necessary, but you're becoming a tyrant. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5572.96s)]
*  You're setting up a system [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5575.44s)]
*  that's gonna be used against you too. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5576.36s)]
*  100%, and it's also setting a precedent [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5577.5199999999995s)]
*  of things that we allow. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5580.44s)]
*  And no one seems to care because it's Trump. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5582.48s)]
*  Because it's Trump, he's like a non-human to them. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5585.24s)]
*  Like all the rules of empathy and dignity [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5587.639999999999s)]
*  and the most charitable view of things never apply. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5590.68s)]
*  It's like the worst examples of anything [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5593.76s)]
*  that he's ever said or anything he's ever done. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5596.72s)]
*  And that's all he is. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5598.92s)]
*  Well, you know, I... [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5600.4800000000005s)]
*  It's, you know, and if you say, even if you say that, [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5601.92s)]
*  you're a Trump apologist. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5604.400000000001s)]
*  But like, you gotta look at what is going on. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5606.200000000001s)]
*  There's a massive movement to keep this guy [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5611.4400000000005s)]
*  from being president again. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5615.360000000001s)]
*  And some of it you don't want to see happening [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5616.4400000000005s)]
*  in a democratic society. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5619.92s)]
*  No. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5621.4s)]
*  My worry is that, you know, [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5622.24s)]
*  I really do think legacy media, [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5624.0s)]
*  a lot of these people come from the same colleges, [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5627.04s)]
*  the same area codes. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5629.96s)]
*  They do see the world differently than most of us [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5631.76s)]
*  who are out there trying to build a life. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5634.76s)]
*  Isn't that wild? [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5636.4s)]
*  It is wild. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5637.28s)]
*  That they somehow or another are supposedly representing [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5638.12s)]
*  the frequency of the country, but they're so off. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5641.84s)]
*  And they think they're superior [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5645.96s)]
*  because they're very educated. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5647.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5648.88s)]
*  Because they're indoctrinated [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5650.52s)]
*  into this progressive ideology. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5651.360000000001s)]
*  And they think that there's a mandate to not just, [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5653.08s)]
*  you know, not just exist and do your thing, [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5656.92s)]
*  but to change the world and mold it into these ideas [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5658.64s)]
*  that you were indoctrinated with in school. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5662.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5665.4800000000005s)]
*  And there becomes this lateral cooperation [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5666.320000000001s)]
*  with the powers that be. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5668.88s)]
*  And so they can very easily highlight one story [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5671.88s)]
*  and suppress another, or just not report on another. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5674.84s)]
*  And when you walk into a newsroom [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5677.92s)]
*  and you're somebody who's looking to speak truth to power [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5679.76s)]
*  and be part of the way the fourth estate should really work, [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5683.2s)]
*  which used to be that journalists were all blue collar guys [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5685.88s)]
*  who'd been gals who hit the pavement. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5688.56s)]
*  Now you've got people that agree with the idea, [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5691.6s)]
*  for example, that, you know, [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5695.68s)]
*  maybe people who are in power with this education [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5698.08s)]
*  know a little bit more than the people [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5703.68s)]
*  that are actually out the fly by states, you know. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5706.92s)]
*  That great, I can't remember who said it, [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5709.4s)]
*  might've been William F. Buckley who said, [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5711.52s)]
*  you have to understand that would you rather be ruled [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5713.4800000000005s)]
*  by the Harvard faculty or the first 2000 names [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5716.88s)]
*  in the Boston phone book? [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5720.12s)]
*  If you believe in democracy, [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5722.28s)]
*  you've got to say the first 2000 names [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5723.64s)]
*  in the Boston phone book. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5725.72s)]
*  It sounds very enticing to get the Harvard faculty, [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5726.96s)]
*  they're smart as shit. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5729.96s)]
*  They know what's best for all of us. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5731.32s)]
*  Let the philosopher kings run it. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5732.92s)]
*  But that's not how our grand experiment works. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5734.96s)]
*  And I think this is the greatest country in the world [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5738.08s)]
*  because it always pushes the ideal [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5740.36s)]
*  and the idea that the individual [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5745.24s)]
*  should always supersede the collective, [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5747.96s)]
*  that the collective will always become a tyranny. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5750.32s)]
*  And you as an individual have certain inalienable rights [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5753.4800000000005s)]
*  that can't be taken away from you [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5756.72s)]
*  no matter which way the wind blows [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5758.4800000000005s)]
*  and no matter how strong the collective is. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5760.12s)]
*  That's such an important distinction. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5762.92s)]
*  It is the fundamental distinction [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5765.8s)]
*  between being somebody who's for free markets [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5767.36s)]
*  and democracy and somebody who's a socialist. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5770.4s)]
*  That's why I think socialism is way more dangerous. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5773.12s)]
*  All these young people have a favorable view of socialism. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5776.24s)]
*  No, no, no, I'm sorry. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5779.52s)]
*  Now you have a top-down authority [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5780.56s)]
*  that believes in orchestrating [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5782.36s)]
*  and socially engineering equality at all costs, [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5784.36s)]
*  which means we got to keep the people [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5787.32s)]
*  that are really exceed, you know, excelling, [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5789.2s)]
*  got to keep them down a little bit. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5791.8s)]
*  That's why you have Congress people saying things like, [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5793.08s)]
*  in California, fuck Elon Musk. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5795.240000000001s)]
*  They say stuff like that to a guy who creates that many jobs [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5797.6s)]
*  and is that innovative and that much of a risk taker. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5800.280000000001s)]
*  And that's what I worry about. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5803.320000000001s)]
*  I worry that human beings naturally, [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5805.72s)]
*  we have an inclination towards competition [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5809.240000000001s)]
*  and we think about things [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5811.92s)]
*  not just for the greater good of the country, [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5814.12s)]
*  but when you're locked into a party war, [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5816.12s)]
*  you know, it's the Democratic Party [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5818.4800000000005s)]
*  versus the Republican Party. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5819.88s)]
*  This is a sports game. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5820.96s)]
*  And whatever dirty tricks you can use by deflating balls [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5822.64s)]
*  or fucking spiking people's Kool-Aid, [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5826.52s)]
*  whatever the fuck you can do to get people to lose [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5829.64s)]
*  or to win, there's gonna be certain elements of your party [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5833.56s)]
*  that are willing to do that. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5837.52s)]
*  There's gonna be, [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5839.04s)]
*  the problem is when it becomes the intelligence agencies. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5840.32s)]
*  The problem is when they're colluding, [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5843.76s)]
*  like they're working in conjunction. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5847.36s)]
*  And then also they're contacting social media companies. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5850.719999999999s)]
*  I think that some of it is the stuff you've talked about, [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5853.28s)]
*  which is this is new territory. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5856.5199999999995s)]
*  It's really hard to deal with the amount of misinformation [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5859.28s)]
*  and malinformation and disinformation. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5862.759999999999s)]
*  You don't know where it's coming from. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5864.48s)]
*  How much of it is coming from us? [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5865.679999999999s)]
*  Do you think there's any American [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5867.48s)]
*  misinformation troll farms? [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5870.5199999999995s)]
*  Yes. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5872.639999999999s)]
*  Do you think the government funds them? [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5873.839999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5875.16s)]
*  Jesus. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5876.12s)]
*  I mean, it would make sense. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5877.2s)]
*  I don't think it's done with like, [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5879.2s)]
*  see, I don't think conspiracy is like, [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5880.76s)]
*  I think that there are programs and ideas [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5882.88s)]
*  that might be, [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5887.36s)]
*  you might set up a propaganda ministry quietly [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5888.88s)]
*  to combat something else. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5891.84s)]
*  We did that with ISIS. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5893.96s)]
*  They were very good with their recruiting [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5895.599999999999s)]
*  and stuff like that. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5897.84s)]
*  So we said, let's figure out a way to deal with that. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5898.679999999999s)]
*  That would be best case scenario. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5902.5599999999995s)]
*  They do it to combat ISIS. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5904.2s)]
*  This is new for people. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5905.04s)]
*  This is new. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5906.96s)]
*  There's all this blowback. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5908.76s)]
*  You come up with a plan. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5909.8s)]
*  This is hard stuff. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5911.68s)]
*  There's no group of people who are so smart [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5913.08s)]
*  and they're planning all this shit. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5915.320000000001s)]
*  Good luck. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5916.84s)]
*  Too many moving parts in life. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5917.68s)]
*  No, I don't think that. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5919.2s)]
*  But I do think that the people who are in control, [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5920.52s)]
*  whether it be the government, [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5923.4400000000005s)]
*  which can contact Facebook, [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5924.8s)]
*  or whether it be the intelligence communities [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5926.28s)]
*  that say that the Hunter Biden laptop's bullshit [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5930.08s)]
*  when they know it's not. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5932.56s)]
*  When you have situations where people have [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5934.320000000001s)]
*  that kind of power and control over people, [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5936.88s)]
*  and it's through this digital realm [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5940.08s)]
*  that didn't exist before. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5942.0s)]
*  So all the rules that you would apply [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5943.32s)]
*  to the First Amendment outside of that, [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5946.2s)]
*  everything gets real slippery. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5948.4400000000005s)]
*  This is a private corporation. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5949.68s)]
*  This is malinformation and misinformation. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5952.400000000001s)]
*  Malinformation's the craziest one, [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5954.88s)]
*  which is true information that may be detrimental. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5956.76s)]
*  Oh, is that what it is? [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5959.56s)]
*  Yeah, what is the actual definition of malinformation? [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5960.4800000000005s)]
*  But it's things that may be true. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5963.4400000000005s)]
*  They can deem something that is true malinformation. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5967.8s)]
*  So you can have misinformation that's not true. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5972.24s)]
*  Let me ask you a question. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5975.4400000000005s)]
*  Here it is. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5976.52s)]
*  Malinformation is truth used to inflict harm on a person, [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5977.4800000000005s)]
*  organization or country. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5981.360000000001s)]
*  So fishing and catfishing. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5983.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, that's, yeah, but also just that term, [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5986.28s)]
*  truth that could be used to inflict harm? [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5989.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5993.72s)]
*  Well, mal in French means bad. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5994.56s)]
*  How open to interpretation is that? [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5997.4400000000005s)]
*  Doxing, swatting and revenge porn. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=5998.92s)]
*  But how open-ended is that? [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6001.08s)]
*  What if you expose something in the federal government, [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6006.160000000001s)]
*  like say, what if you're Julian Assange [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6009.280000000001s)]
*  and you expose that collateral murder video [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6011.56s)]
*  or you release those documents, the WikiLeaks documents? [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6015.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, let me ask you something. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6019.320000000001s)]
*  Maybe you and I and everybody else are being paranoid. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6021.04s)]
*  So in other words, here's my question. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6025.44s)]
*  Well, maybe it's not even a question, [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6028.759999999999s)]
*  but you and I and a lot of us complain about these things. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6030.04s)]
*  We worry about the fact that there's a lot of disinformation [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6034.719999999999s)]
*  that the government's controlling this [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6037.32s)]
*  and that big tech is this, that and the other thing. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6039.24s)]
*  But sometimes I wonder if I'm just being paranoid. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6042.5199999999995s)]
*  And sometimes I wonder if I'm just, I'm in an echo chamber. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6046.08s)]
*  And sometimes I wonder that, [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6049.24s)]
*  cause look man, I'm on the Joe Rogan experience. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6050.5599999999995s)]
*  I don't know how many people listen to this. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6054.12s)]
*  I can say whatever the fuck I want and people listen. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6055.32s)]
*  And that could be British welders. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6059.08s)]
*  That could be, I was in Israel [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6061.08s)]
*  and an Ethiopian guy said to me [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6065.08s)]
*  as he's helping me with my bag in the airport, in Israel, [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6067.599999999999s)]
*  he goes, do you come from Joe Rogan? [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6070.04s)]
*  And I was like, I do come from him. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6073.12s)]
*  I come from his rib. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6074.2s)]
*  I'm glad you asked. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6075.04s)]
*  Yes, I come from his fucking rib. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6076.24s)]
*  That's in, you know. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6077.88s)]
*  And I can, on YouTube, I can find, [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6079.799999999999s)]
*  I can confirm my bias all day long. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6083.4s)]
*  I can find politicians and thinkers [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6086.639999999999s)]
*  who believe everything I believe in. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6088.96s)]
*  And so sometimes I wonder, man, [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6091.96s)]
*  and look, as far as Hunter Biden, [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6093.96s)]
*  they tried to get away with a lot of stuff with that laptop. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6095.639999999999s)]
*  They try to do all kinds of stuff. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6098.04s)]
*  And all we're talking about now [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6099.5199999999995s)]
*  is all the shit on that laptop. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6100.88s)]
*  And it's all been exposed. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6103.2s)]
*  And I promise you, I promise you Hunter Biden and Joe Biden, [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6104.92s)]
*  I promise you are thinking about this all the time. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6109.5599999999995s)]
*  Because they're realizing it's a shit storm [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6112.6s)]
*  that's just beginning, mark my words. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6114.72s)]
*  So while all of us are complaining [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6117.56s)]
*  legacy media doesn't cover this and stuff like that, [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6118.96s)]
*  yeah, but guess what? [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6121.200000000001s)]
*  The Justice Department's gonna do their job. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6122.240000000001s)]
*  Yes, agree. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6124.200000000001s)]
*  I'm just saying, I'm just saying. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6125.04s)]
*  However, it's very disappointing [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6126.120000000001s)]
*  that legacy media doesn't cover it. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6128.56s)]
*  And the reason they don't cover it, [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6130.88s)]
*  because they think it's gonna empower the narrative [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6132.360000000001s)]
*  that Donald Trump is a superior president. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6134.52s)]
*  If their narrative was always that Donald Trump is corrupt, [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6138.120000000001s)]
*  then also there's real clear evidence [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6141.92s)]
*  that Hunter Biden and Joe Biden got, [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6144.92s)]
*  how many millions of dollars? [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6147.68s)]
*  Yeah, 11 million. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6148.76s)]
*  He made $11 million. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6150.4800000000005s)]
*  He has his law degree. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6152.12s)]
*  Now, hold on for a sec. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6153.88s)]
*  He worked for Burisma, which was, [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6154.72s)]
*  and I think he had some affiliations [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6157.52s)]
*  with some Chinese energy companies. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6158.84s)]
*  And of course, Hunter Biden, who studied, [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6161.6s)]
*  he paints and he has a law degree, [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6163.92s)]
*  but Burisma I guess paid him $11 million, [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6166.4400000000005s)]
*  $11 million over a period of, I think, [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6169.6s)]
*  I don't know what it was, four or five years, [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6172.4400000000005s)]
*  and maybe even less. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6174.52s)]
*  Because they needed his expertise on energy [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6178.4400000000005s)]
*  and on natural gas apparently. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6183.08s)]
*  Makes sense. Yeah! [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6185.120000000001s)]

*  in the White House and apparently they couldn't [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6256.96s)]
*  trace it back in the most secure building in the world, [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6259.88s)]
*  in the most secure building in the world, by the way, [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6263.52s)]
*  because there are no cameras anywhere. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6265.76s)]
*  You know what's a crazy coincidence? [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6267.32s)]

*  She came with receipts. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6316.16s)]
*  They're alternative facts. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6317.0s)]

*  That lady went hard. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6422.54s)]
*  It's my favorite performance. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6423.58s)]
*  All I could think about was how crazy must she be. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6424.62s)]
*  I think she could pull this monster out of her. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6427.58s)]
*  I've hung out with her a couple of times. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6429.54s)]
*  Demons are inside of her. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6430.98s)]
*  I've hung out with her. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6431.82s)]
*  She could pull that monster out of her. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6432.66s)]
*  Very normal, but she had a hell of a life childhood. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6433.48s)]
*  You know about that, right? [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6437.299999999999s)]
*  Mm-mm. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6438.74s)]
*  Okay. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6439.58s)]
*  I think it's public. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6440.4s)]
*  Well, let's not take a chance. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6441.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah, she went through some stuff. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6442.98s)]
*  But, god damn, that performance is insane. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6444.38s)]
*  And to be that hot and make yourself that fucking gross. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6446.099999999999s)]
*  Oh my god. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6448.9s)]
*  Gained weight and all. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6449.74s)]
*  I know, man. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6450.74s)]
*  What other female bombshell actress has ever done that? [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6451.58s)]
*  I know. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6455.62s)]
*  Because you know Christian Bale's done that a bunch of times. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6456.46s)]
*  He did it for The Machinists, [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6458.42s)]
*  where he got down to nothing. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6459.74s)]
*  And then he did Dick Cheney, where he got real fat. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6461.099999999999s)]
*  He's incredible. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6463.459999999999s)]
*  He's incredible. [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6464.299999999999s)]
*  He's on another level. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6465.12s)]
*  And Robert De Niro famously did it in Raging Bull. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6465.959999999999s)]
*  Well, that's my second favorite. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6467.9s)]
*  My first favorite performance is Charlize Theron in Monster. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6469.219999999999s)]
*  My second favorite performance of any actor [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6473.459999999999s)]
*  is De Niro in Raging Bull. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6475.5s)]
*  And he was the first actor ever to do that. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6476.7s)]
*  He gained, I think, 66 pounds. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6480.299999999999s)]
*  And he's got a frame like me. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6483.419999999999s)]
*  He's very thin and not a tall guy. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6484.86s)]
*  And gained 66 pounds. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6487.139999999999s)]
*  And no one had seen anything like that. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6489.18s)]
*  No one. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6491.740000000001s)]
*  And he was shredded. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6492.58s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6493.9800000000005s)]
*  When he played Lamada, he was shredded. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6494.820000000001s)]
*  Find De Niro from that movie. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6498.66s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6664.92s)]
*  It's that kind of acting is such a different. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6665.759999999999s)]
*  There's like, there's so many like levels of it. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6669.04s)]
*  Like sitcom acting, there's TV show acting. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6672.5599999999995s)]
*  And then there's this like, [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6676.12s)]
*  what the fuck did you just do acting? [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6677.28s)]
*  Yeah, I think that kind of acting like Christian Bale [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6679.5199999999995s)]
*  I think said, I don't like that I make believe [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6681.799999999999s)]
*  and I wear makeup. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6685.44s)]
*  So I gotta do something that makes me feel manly. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6686.44s)]
*  Like starve myself or just feel, you know. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6689.0s)]
*  Is Daniel Day-Lewis totally done with acting? [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6691.92s)]
*  He's just making shoes now or something? [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6693.72s)]
*  No, he was a cobbler. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6695.24s)]
*  He apparently took three years to become a fucking cobbler. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6698.72s)]
*  He wanted to make shoes. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6701.12s)]
*  Yeah, I think he's still acting. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6702.08s)]
*  I think it pulls him back in. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6703.56s)]
*  Really? [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6705.2s)]
*  I thought he retired. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6706.04s)]
*  No, like him in Gangs of New York was some crazy shit. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6707.4s)]
*  I thought there will be blood. [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6710.8s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, this is another guy. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6712.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6714.36s)]
*  This is another dude who said, [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6715.2s)]
*  I'm just embarrassed at being a middle-class [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6716.02s)]
*  boring Englishman. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6718.84s)]
*  So I do just crazy shit. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6720.360000000001s)]
*  And I wear other people's clothes, [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6722.28s)]
*  say other people's words. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6724.16s)]
*  And that's what I do. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6726.12s)]
*  And whatever it takes me to get there, I do. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6727.56s)]
*  And you know, I'll fucking wear that outfit, [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6729.4400000000005s)]
*  not take a shower for five days. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6732.8s)]
*  And it just gets me in character. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6735.0s)]
*  You can keep all that shit by the way. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6736.4800000000005s)]
*  You can keep all of it, okay? [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6738.72s)]
*  Acting like salad. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6739.96s)]
*  Never ate a salad where I didn't want it to be over. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6741.64s)]
*  Every time I eat a salad, I feel like a fucking coward. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6744.28s)]
*  I'm like, I'm eating salad [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6746.12s)]
*  because apparently it'll keep cancer away. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6746.96s)]
*  It's the only reason I ever eat any vegetables. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6749.16s)]
*  I hate all vegetables. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6750.2s)]
*  And acting, I've never been on a set, [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6751.32s)]
*  I'm sorry to say this out loud, [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6753.639999999999s)]
*  where I didn't want to be off, [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6755.24s)]
*  where I didn't want to be done. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6756.679999999999s)]
*  Brian Callan trying to get work. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6758.4s)]
*  I see what you're doing. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6759.639999999999s)]
*  You're playing that hard to get thing. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6760.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, is that what I'm doing? [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6762.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's what we're doing. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6762.839999999999s)]
*  I'll stick to standard, bro. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6763.66s)]
*  I got enough. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6764.5599999999995s)]
*  There will be blood. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6765.4s)]
*  Gangs in New York and there will be blood. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6766.24s)]
*  Two of the all-time greats. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6767.679999999999s)]
*  God. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6769.0s)]
*  I didn't see Lincoln. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6770.32s)]
*  Look at him in Lincoln. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6771.16s)]
*  He looks so much like Lincoln. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6772.16s)]
*  Was that Lincoln movie any good? [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6773.36s)]
*  Well, I did a movie with a guy who was in that, [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6774.86s)]
*  had a substantial role. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6777.96s)]
*  And I said, what was it like to work with Daniel Day-Lewis? [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6779.76s)]
*  And he said, well, and I went, uh-huh. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6782.24s)]
*  And he goes, no, it's just that, [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6786.28s)]
*  he wouldn't answer any questions [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6788.04s)]
*  that didn't occur after 1865. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6792.96s)]
*  He wasn't gonna talk to you about today. [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6796.56s)]
*  To today, yeah. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6799.28s)]
*  It's like at the Renaissance Fair, [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6800.24s)]
*  and someone brings character, [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6801.92s)]
*  and the other lady's like, what are thou talking about? [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6803.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6805.92s)]
*  Like you could only speak to him, [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6806.76s)]
*  and as literally as Abe Lincoln. [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6808.08s)]
*  And in fact, then my buddy came in and said, [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6810.84s)]
*  I'm sorry about all that nonsense in Cincinnati. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6813.64s)]
*  And Daniel Day-Lewis was like, yes, yes, well, [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6815.88s)]
*  we're gonna work on that. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6818.96s)]
*  And that was how it was, dude. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6820.8s)]
*  He's staying character. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6823.32s)]
*  You're talking to Abraham Lincoln, period. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6824.16s)]
*  Yeah, there's no craft services like, bro, how you doing? [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6825.88s)]
*  No, no, no, no, I'm sorry, sir. [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6828.52s)]
*  I'm gonna hold that character for three months. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6829.76s)]
*  Well, you know I did Joker, [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6832.02s)]
*  and I worked with Joaquin Phoenix. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6833.64s)]
*  I was in the room with him for five days. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6836.080000000001s)]
*  When he came, I think, to set, [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6841.84s)]
*  he was walking around, he was 180 pounds or something. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6843.4800000000005s)]
*  And I think Todd Phillips said something like, [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6847.0s)]
*  I think the character should be kind of skinny. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6849.96s)]
*  Just kind of said it casually, like I think. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6851.92s)]
*  And Joaquin, I think, showed up at 124 pounds. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6855.080000000001s)]
*  And then they were like, let's just give you a, [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6857.84s)]
*  this guy's got inhuman discipline. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6859.92s)]
*  They go, let's give you a nutritionist and everything else. [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6861.76s)]
*  And he said, no, no, no, it's okay. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6863.76s)]
*  He just ate an apple and smoked cigarettes. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6865.04s)]
*  And when we were on set, he never looked at you. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6868.04s)]
*  He never looked at you. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6871.4s)]
*  At one point, I went like this. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6873.08s)]
*  I had a scene, if you blink, I'm out of it. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6875.28s)]
*  But I had a bunch of lines that didn't make it. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6877.64s)]
*  But I go like this, I go, what'd you do? [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6880.0s)]
*  Take a gun and blow your head off? [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6882.32s)]
*  And I mimicked it, and I put it in my mouth. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6883.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm like, poof, like that. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6885.48s)]
*  And when I did that, I fell back. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6886.64s)]
*  I did that twice. [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6891.68s)]
*  On the second time, he fell straight back. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6892.68s)]
*  He fell straight back and landed. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6895.64s)]
*  He would just improvise and do crazy shit [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6899.360000000001s)]
*  where you didn't know if he was gonna even hurt himself. [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6901.08s)]
*  Remember when he punches the clock? [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6902.92s)]
*  That's not in the script. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6905.08s)]
*  He just punched that clock off the wall. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6906.84s)]
*  And Todd thought he broke his hand. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6909.76s)]
*  That was not on the script. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6912.16s)]
*  I saw, when I saw, you know the bus scene [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6913.64s)]
*  where he can't stop laughing? [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6916.08s)]
*  I saw them shooting that when I got to set. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6917.96s)]
*  I swear to God, I saw him walking, [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6920.24s)]
*  and I knew he was gonna win an Oscar. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6922.12s)]
*  It was that good. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6924.32s)]
*  And I looked at Todd and I go, holy shit. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6925.16s)]
*  He goes, you have no idea, dude. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6927.32s)]
*  It was like when I saw the fighter, Christian Bale, [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6929.08s)]
*  on the fighter, remember that opening scene? [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6930.599999999999s)]
*  I went, oh, you're gonna win an Oscar in this? [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6932.36s)]
*  I don't know, you could see it. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6934.36s)]
*  You're like, you're a crack addict, [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6936.16s)]
*  and you're an ex-boxer. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6937.24s)]
*  You see one frame and you go, [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6939.32s)]
*  well, this is something different is happening here. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6940.8s)]
*  It was the same thing with him. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6942.599999999999s)]
*  But I watched him for, I think it was four or five days [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6943.639999999999s)]
*  I was there, and I've never seen somebody [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6945.8s)]
*  be able to hold that concentration [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6948.92s)]
*  and that kind of character for that long. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6950.6s)]
*  I was like, I could never do that. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6952.4s)]
*  I don't wanna do that. [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6953.72s)]
*  That's not fun to be around. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6954.64s)]
*  That was a spooky movie, because I was like, [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6955.96s)]
*  this is too close to reality. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6958.12s)]
*  Masterpiece, bro. [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6960.6s)]
*  And then right after that, you have the BLM riots [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6961.4400000000005s)]
*  and the COVID riots, and all that stuff happened afterwards. [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6963.96s)]
*  Have you met Todd Phillips, who writes and directs [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6967.4s)]
*  those movies? No. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6969.28s)]
*  You need to meet him. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6970.12s)]
*  I'd love to meet him. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6971.04s)]
*  He's one of my favorite people in the world. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6971.88s)]
*  I love the hangover. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6972.72s)]
*  He's such a special dude. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6974.2s)]
*  You should have him on the podcast. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6976.24s)]
*  I think you'd love him, man. [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6977.52s)]
*  He grew up in a one-bedroom apartment with his mom [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6979.8s)]
*  in New York, and I think he's just a fucking genius. [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6982.28s)]
*  He gave me notes on a script I wrote once, [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6985.76s)]
*  and I was like, oh, that's why you're a genius. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6988.04s)]
*  Isn't it funny that we like people better [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6991.2s)]
*  if they grew up in a one-bedroom apartment with their mom? [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6992.96s)]
*  With chaos. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6995.76s)]
*  You feel like you grew up in a mansion in Park City, [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=6996.6s)]
*  Park City, Utah, just overlooking the slopes. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7000.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7002.52s)]
*  Well, lack of comfort. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7004.28s)]
*  You didn't have an easy childhood. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7006.52s)]
*  No, I didn't. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7009.320000000001s)]
*  I think it's a superpower. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7010.64s)]
*  I don't want it for my kids. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7012.88s)]
*  I know. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7014.320000000001s)]
*  That's the rub, though. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7015.240000000001s)]
*  Horrible. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7016.400000000001s)]
*  It's interesting. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7017.400000000001s)]
*  But I feel like kids that are loved, for whatever reason, [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7018.240000000001s)]
*  do get a certain ambition from their parents, [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7022.8s)]
*  and also they recognize work ethic. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7025.0s)]
*  My kids work really hard at stuff, that they do, [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7028.200000000001s)]
*  and I think a lot of it is because my wife works really hard [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7030.64s)]
*  at stuff she likes to do, and I work really hard [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7033.92s)]
*  at stuff I like to do, and they see that I work hard, [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7036.2s)]
*  and they know that I have multiple jobs. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7038.639999999999s)]
*  Maybe part of it's also genetic. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7041.4s)]
*  You either have that constitution or you don't. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7042.84s)]
*  I think it's genetic with one of my daughters, [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7044.48s)]
*  because one of my daughters is a complete psycho [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7046.08s)]
*  and just super driven towards things, [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7048.639999999999s)]
*  tries to do things, and she gets better and better [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7051.36s)]
*  and better and better and better at them, [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7053.24s)]
*  physical things. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7054.8s)]
*  I think that's genetic. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7056.5199999999995s)]
*  But it's interesting because she comes from, [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7057.92s)]
*  instead of needing attention, [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7060.5199999999995s)]
*  she comes from this loving household, [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7061.96s)]
*  where she gets all this love. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7063.76s)]
*  So she has confidence. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7065.4s)]
*  And her feet are on the ground. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7066.599999999999s)]
*  And she has happiness. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7067.44s)]
*  But she's also crazy driven, where when I was driven, [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7068.839999999999s)]
*  it was like, I want to figure out a way [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7072.639999999999s)]
*  where I'm not a loser. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7074.88s)]
*  I have to make something out of myself, [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7076.4s)]
*  because I feel like a loser. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7078.88s)]
*  It wasn't from a place of healthiness. [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7080.36s)]
*  I love exciting things and getting better at them. [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7083.759999999999s)]
*  It wasn't that. [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7086.5599999999995s)]
*  It was like, I am obsessed with this thing, [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7087.5599999999995s)]
*  because this is the first time in my life [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7089.759999999999s)]
*  where I didn't feel like a loser. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7091.599999999999s)]
*  Well, that's that Jungian, the notion of the shadow. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7093.32s)]
*  You have two selves, right? [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7096.32s)]
*  You have yourself and then your hidden self, [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7098.04s)]
*  the idea that all your insecurities [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7100.4s)]
*  and that boy that I've been trying to run away from forever, [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7103.719999999999s)]
*  that skinny boy who is full of shame and full of fear, [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7108.36s)]
*  and I don't want anybody to see that boy. [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7114.0s)]
*  That's somebody I always hide with something else, right? [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7117.4s)]
*  With bravado or with whatever this thing is [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7119.84s)]
*  this armor. [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7123.320000000001s)]
*  Construct. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7124.160000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and I think that part of what helps you as an artist [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7125.0s)]
*  or even as a person is to bring that boy with you. [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7129.120000000001s)]
*  Bring that shadow with you, [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7132.280000000001s)]
*  because there's a strength in that. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7134.240000000001s)]
*  There's an honesty in it. [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7136.400000000001s)]
*  I'm not interested in trying to present [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7138.080000000001s)]
*  as something I'm not. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7141.72s)]
*  I am also that other thing. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7143.080000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of strength in that boy who's skinny and full of shame. [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7145.92s)]
*  Well, there's a lot of strength in desire, right? [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7149.68s)]
*  Desire for improvement and change. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7152.32s)]
*  And that's also some of the things that come off of failure. [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7154.68s)]
*  You have this desire to never experience that again. [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7157.2s)]
*  That's a big one with stand-up when you bomb. [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7159.16s)]
*  Or if you lose in a fight, both those things are true, [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7161.72s)]
*  because you're just like, [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7164.76s)]
*  oh my God, I never want that to happen again. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7165.68s)]
*  And then you become far more dedicated. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7167.76s)]
*  You have to have those moments [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7171.08s)]
*  where the realization of effort to reward, [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7173.24s)]
*  like what's the real formula? [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7176.68s)]
*  Am I lying to myself on this formula? [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7179.16s)]
*  Am I going to six and I'm telling everybody I go to nine? [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7181.04s)]
*  Like what is actually really happening? [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7184.28s)]
*  And the only way you really find out is by attempting to do things, [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7186.16s)]
*  no matter what you're trying to do, [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7190.4s)]
*  whether it's trying to put together a stand-up set, [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7191.52s)]
*  whether you're trying to get better at jiu-jitsu, [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7193.8s)]
*  whether you're doing gymnastics, whatever it is. [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7195.32s)]
*  The only way to know whether you're doing enough [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7197.84s)]
*  and doing it the right way is to see your improvement when it's tried. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7201.24s)]
*  That's right. [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7204.2s)]
*  When it's tested and tried. [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7204.92s)]
*  That's what's so great about stand-up. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7205.68s)]
*  It's amazing. [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7207.64s)]
*  And the challenge of being original, [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7208.72s)]
*  surprising yourself never goes away. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7211.88s)]
*  It's why I'm so addicted to it. [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7214.68s)]
*  It's why I'm more excited about stand-up now at 56 than I've ever been. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7215.92s)]
*  It's fun. [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7221.280000000001s)]
*  It's fun and it's a beautiful exchange. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7222.4400000000005s)]
*  Like it's a beautiful exchange for me as an audience member. [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7225.08s)]
*  I love the exchange of watching someone on stage kill [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7227.4800000000005s)]
*  and I laugh so hard. [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7230.4400000000005s)]
*  I feel great. [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7231.4800000000005s)]
*  It's like a beautiful drug that you get. [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7232.96s)]
*  When you're laughing really hard, it's my favorite thing to do. [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7234.88s)]
*  Like last night we all went out with Patrick, [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7238.5199999999995s)]
*  that David's crew. [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7240.879999999999s)]
*  Love him. [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7241.919999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and it was me, Asana, Darryl Poston and Brian Simpson [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7242.719999999999s)]

*  It used to. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7265.44s)]
*  We used to have it at the Comedy Store. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7266.04s)]
*  Yeah, and the parking lot. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7266.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, the parking lot and then the back bar, [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7267.56s)]
*  the back comics bar was always amazing. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7270.160000000001s)]

*  I need to come out and do that. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7273.360000000001s)]
*  What we did is just take all the best elements [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7274.6s)]
*  that we saw in the store and the ethic behind the store. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7276.76s)]
*  That's the reason why the bar is named Mitzi's. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7280.88s)]
*  Yep. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7283.0s)]

*  Sometimes. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7325.6s)]
*  I rented to Axl Rose in Greece. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7326.84s)]
*  That was a wild one. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7329.04s)]
*  See, this is what happened. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7330.4s)]
*  I was with my friend Brian Mararescu. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7331.5199999999995s)]
*  He's the guy who wrote The Immortality Key, [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7334.0s)]
*  that amazing book on the Illicinium mysteries in Greece. [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7335.799999999999s)]
*  And it just so happened that when my family and I [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7339.16s)]
*  were in Greece, he was in Greece. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7342.32s)]
*  And so we all met up, and he gave us a tour of Ulysses. [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7344.44s)]
*  Wow. [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7347.799999999999s)]
*  Parthenon and all that? [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7350.12s)]
*  The Parthenon. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7351.48s)]
*  He explained. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7352.5199999999995s)]
*  We went to the museum. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7354.32s)]
*  The Parthenon Museum is explaining everything to us. [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7355.599999999999s)]
*  It was amazing. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7357.719999999999s)]
*  The cradle of democracy. [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7358.44s)]
*  Amazing. [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7359.16s)]
*  So anyway, we were at this restaurant, [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7359.639999999999s)]
*  and we were eating late at night. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7361.04s)]
*  We're having fun. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7362.8s)]
*  And he goes to the bathroom, and he comes back, and he goes, [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7364.28s)]
*  Axl Rose is here. [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7367.04s)]
*  I go, no way. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7368.32s)]
*  And he goes, yeah, he's right over there. [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7369.48s)]
*  As you're leaving, you have to see him. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7371.88s)]
*  I'm like, oh, shit. [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7373.599999999999s)]
*  So I get anxiety, because when I'm leaving, I'm like, [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7374.92s)]
*  do I say hi? [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7377.599999999999s)]
*  I kind of have to say hi. [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7378.5599999999995s)]
*  What if he doesn't know who I am? [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7380.04s)]
*  Right, that'd be weird. [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7380.8s)]
*  Oh, it was horrible. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7381.84s)]
*  So he looked at me like he didn't know who I was, [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7383.04s)]
*  and he goes, oh, hey, dude. [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7384.8s)]
*  And then he shakes my hand. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7386.32s)]
*  I'm like, thank you, baby Jesus. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7387.4s)]
*  And then he starts telling me bits that he likes. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7389.36s)]
*  Really? [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7391.4s)]
*  Yeah, he's telling me bits. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7391.8s)]
*  He's asking me about my Netflix special. [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7392.72s)]
*  And I'm like, oh, my god, this is amazing. [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7394.72s)]
*  So then he invites us to the show. [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7396.68s)]
*  So they're doing Guns N' Roses in Athens [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7398.36s)]
*  on that Saturday night. [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7401.2s)]
*  And we were going to be there Saturday night. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7402.28s)]
*  We were leaving on Sunday morning. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7403.64s)]
*  So it was perfect. [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7404.84s)]
*  So we saw three hours of Guns N' Roses [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7406.04s)]
*  in front of this massive stadium. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7408.48s)]
*  How are they? [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7411.32s)]
*  Incredible. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7412.12s)]
*  They did three fucking hours. [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7413.6s)]
*  And people don't realize they can fill a stadium still, right? [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7416.24s)]
*  And it was 95 degrees out. [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7418.92s)]
*  And nobody gives a fuck. [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7421.32s)]
*  They were dripping sweat. [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7422.04s)]
*  I mean, Slash was fucking banging that guitar out. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7423.72s)]
*  Look at that. [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7427.76s)]
*  This is the video of me. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7428.5599999999995s)]
*  I filmed this backstage. [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7429.84s)]
*  This is the end of the show. [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7431.08s)]
*  Give me some volume so you can hear it, [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7432.2s)]
*  because it's fucking incredible to hear the crowd. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7433.92s)]
*  This video has no sound. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7436.32s)]
*  Oh, really? [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7438.0s)]
*  That's weird. [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7439.0s)]
*  I swear to god, it was sound on my phone. [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7439.48s)]
*  Wow. [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7440.68s)]
*  Where is Axel? [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7441.28s)]
*  Anyway, Axel was on the box. [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7442.08s)]
*  See him standing up there? [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7446.2s)]
*  And he got down. [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7447.2s)]
*  And he cut his hair. [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7448.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7449.599999999999s)]
*  Dude is insane. [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7450.16s)]
*  It is insane. [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7451.28s)]
*  It was just so cool to see Guns N' Roses. [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7452.04s)]
*  The freakiest one for me still, though, is the Rolling Stones. [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7454.5199999999995s)]
*  When we went to see the Rolling Stones, [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7458.639999999999s)]
*  we saw them at COTA, the Circuits of the Americas. [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7460.24s)]
*  And I was standing there. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7462.719999999999s)]
*  And my friend was talking to me. [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7464.32s)]
*  I literally couldn't hear a word he was saying, [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7465.96s)]
*  because I was so freaked out that Mick Jagger was right there. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7467.96s)]
*  He's really right there. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7471.2s)]
*  And he was right in front of you? [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7472.360000000001s)]
*  No, it was a good amount of distance. [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7473.96s)]
*  You were listening to him. [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7476.92s)]
*  I was seeing him. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7477.92s)]
*  I mean, it wasn't that far away. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7479.320000000001s)]
*  We were like 30 rows back or something. [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7480.68s)]
*  But I'm staring at Mick Jagger. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7482.4400000000005s)]
*  Piece of history. [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7484.24s)]
*  He's fucking jamming, too. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7485.76s)]
*  He's 80 years old today. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7487.52s)]

*  The only thing is they stopped writing. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7529.04s)]
*  They've kind of become a cover band of themselves. [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7530.4400000000005s)]
*  Keith Richards played a new song. [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7532.56s)]

*  What are the numbers? [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7598.96s)]
*  If you had to guess, let's just guess [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7599.88s)]
*  the percentage of America that's bilingual. [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7601.0s)]
*  Oh, the percentage of America that's bilingual? [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7602.88s)]
*  Let's guess. [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7604.96s)]
*  30. [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7605.96s)]
*  You think it's that high? [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7606.8s)]
*  I mean, I'm wrong, but I'd say only because [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7607.88s)]
*  of the Spanish population. [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7610.92s)]
*  So let's say 20%. [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7612.36s)]
*  OK. [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7615.0s)]
*  I was going to say 18. [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7615.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7616.68s)]
*  Let's think of- [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7617.28s)]
*  It's probably even lower than that. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7618.28s)]
*  Now, let's say Spain. [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7619.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7621.679999999999s)]

*  70%? [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7622.92s)]
*  Sure. [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7623.72s)]
*  OK, let's look. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7624.16s)]
*  Israel, Israel, everybody in Israel. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7624.8s)]
*  And in Jordan, everyone spoke English. [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7626.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7628.4s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7630.72s)]
*  By the way, just very quickly, look it up. [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7631.2s)]
*  Now, you like to hunt. [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7635.12s)]

*  What are you going to say? [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7639.5599999999995s)]
*  There is hunting in Jordan, in that desert, [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7640.8s)]
*  that will change your life. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7643.96s)]
*  You went hunting in Jordan? [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7646.8s)]
*  I didn't, but I was talking to what they hunt, [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7647.88s)]
*  which is wild goat, which is deer, which is everything [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7650.320000000001s)]
*  you can imagine, even wild hare. [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7653.16s)]
*  And they do a lot of hunting. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7656.56s)]
*  And that desert is some of the most- [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7658.88s)]
*  I went to Wadi Rum. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7661.4400000000005s)]
*  That's where they shot The Martian. [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7663.08s)]
*  And there's some of the most beautiful part. [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7665.12s)]

*  Jordan is so amazing. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7673.6s)]

*  guy was telling me how much they hunt, [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7676.72s)]
*  because you were showing me pictures of the deer [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7678.360000000001s)]
*  and everything. [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7680.240000000001s)]
*  And I was like, what do you have? [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7680.6s)]
*  Because we have everything here. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7682.360000000001s)]
*  We have everything, and the hunting is unbelievable. [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7683.52s)]
*  And you do it year round. [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7685.08s)]
*  And even pigeon, even wood pigeon and stuff like that, [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7686.56s)]
*  crazy shit. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7690.16s)]

*  That makes sense. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7692.92s)]
*  Yeah, all those pigeons that you see in New York City? [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7693.68s)]
*  Is that true? [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7695.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7696.0s)]

*  It's great. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7697.64s)]
*  That's what it is. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7698.12s)]
*  It was brought here. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7698.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7699.400000000001s)]
*  From probably England, or? [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7699.88s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7701.4800000000005s)]
*  It's a good question. [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7702.280000000001s)]
*  Because in England, you have a lot of wood pigeon. [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7702.88s)]
*  Probably England. [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7704.52s)]
*  I've eaten a lot of pigeon. [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7705.6s)]
*  If you, there's parts of this country [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7706.92s)]
*  where people hunt pigeons still to this day. [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7709.68s)]
*  There's seasons on pigeons. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7712.320000000001s)]
*  And pigeons apparently taste really good. [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7714.6s)]
*  I think we should use your connections [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7717.160000000001s)]

*  You can't have an ego with that. [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7886.56s)]
*  And you have to be able to train with people [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7888.0s)]
*  that can just pull it back. [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7889.76s)]

*  Right. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7894.400000000001s)]
*  And they have to know you're not trying to hurt them, [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7894.72s)]
*  so they don't have to punish you either. [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7896.88s)]
*  That's right. [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7898.4800000000005s)]

*  You move around with them. [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=7906.84s)]

*  I don't want to be diving in for a double and single. [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8114.08s)]
*  Well, yeah, you don't want to get hurt. [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8116.92s)]
*  But you can still train. [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8118.44s)]
*  You can still train. [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8119.84s)]
*  Specifically, if you train Jiu Jitsu with the gi, [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8121.32s)]
*  with people who know what they're doing. [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8124.44s)]
*  There's guys that are in their fucking 60s that roll all [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8126.16s)]
*  the time. [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8128.44s)]
*  Yes. [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8128.92s)]
*  All the time. [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8129.2s)]
*  I will do that. [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8129.92s)]
*  If I could find the time, to be honest with you, [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8130.84s)]
*  but I got kids and I got it's hard. [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8132.84s)]
*  I get it. [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8135.48s)]
*  You got to pick your poison. [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8136.04s)]
*  And you got to pick your distractions and your hobbies [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8138.24s)]
*  and stuff. [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8140.72s)]

*  I know. [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8146.200000000001s)]
*  That one sucks up too much time. [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8146.52s)]
*  You especially. [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8147.52s)]
*  You can't because you'll get crazy. [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8148.400000000001s)]
*  I know you. [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8149.88s)]
*  You're a fucking maniac. [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8151.04s)]
*  It looks like too much fun. [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8152.84s)]
*  The people that do it all love it. [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8154.64s)]
*  No, dude. [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8156.8s)]
*  They can't wait to get out and play. [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8157.360000000001s)]
*  Because you love pool and you love archery. [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8158.8s)]
*  Those kinds of skill sets where it's all about your mind [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8161.4800000000005s)]
*  and stuff, you would obsess over it. [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8164.8s)]

*  I see Jamie. [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8167.76s)]

*  My dad is 83 years old. [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8171.400000000001s)]
*  I love my father because at 83. [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8173.040000000001s)]
*  Oh, DJ Khaled. [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8174.4800000000005s)]
*  DJ Khaled's gotten into golf. [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8175.4800000000005s)]
*  Everything he does goes viral. [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8177.400000000001s)]
*  He's having a great time. [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8179.280000000001s)]
*  He thinks he can go pro. [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8180.200000000001s)]
*  No, he can't. [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8181.64s)]
*  But he's not bad. [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8182.160000000001s)]
*  But he can't. [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8183.320000000001s)]
*  He's the best. [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8185.160000000001s)]
*  So if he's not good enough to be pro, how good is he? [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8186.84s)]
*  Is he good like Santino good? [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8190.360000000001s)]
*  Santino's supposed to be really good, right? [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8191.88s)]
*  He's not as good as Santino. [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8193.16s)]
*  He's still in first year. [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8193.84s)]

*  I don't know. [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8195.84s)]
*  But Santino, I think, is like. [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8196.2s)]
*  Isn't he a scratch golfer? [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8197.52s)]
*  Three? [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8199.640000000001s)]
*  That's crazy good. [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8200.08s)]
*  That's crazy good to be in. [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8201.24s)]
*  But my father, at 83, came in the other day. [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8203.32s)]
*  And this is what I love about him. [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8206.039999999999s)]
*  Literally came in and goes, I figured out [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8207.44s)]
*  what I was doing wrong. [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8210.039999999999s)]
*  And I go, what? [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8211.64s)]
*  And he goes, I wasn't moving my. [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8212.24s)]
*  And he had just had a lesson. [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8213.48s)]
*  He was like, I got it. [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8214.88s)]
*  That's how obsessed he is with golf. [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8217.039999999999s)]
*  You've got to love that. [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8219.039999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8219.88s)]
*  You've got to love it. [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8220.36s)]
*  That's the same thing with pool. [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8220.92s)]
*  It's like the reason why people are like, [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8222.28s)]
*  why does people waste their time playing that? [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8224.12s)]
*  Because every time you make a shot, [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8226.039999999999s)]
*  it requires all of your concentration. [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8228.6s)]
*  And the more you can keep it together and run out [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8231.519999999999s)]
*  rack after rack after rack, you get this euphoric mindset. [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8234.439999999999s)]
*  It just locks you into the task. [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8240.279999999999s)]
*  I think it forces you to overcome your liabilities. [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8243.039999999999s)]
*  I think it actually forces you to somehow contend [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8246.519999999999s)]
*  with the things that are holding you back. [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8250.68s)]
*  Well, your liabilities during shots, [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8252.64s)]
*  whether it's an archery shot or a pool shot, [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8255.68s)]
*  are distractions, doubts, fee. [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8258.04s)]
*  There's a lot of things. [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8262.560000000001s)]
*  Not concentrating on the task. [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8263.44s)]
*  But if you can just block all that out and just [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8265.92s)]
*  purely concentrate on the task, it's [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8269.400000000001s)]
*  like a form of meditation. [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8271.160000000002s)]
*  That's right. [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8272.400000000001s)]
*  That's right. [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8273.04s)]
*  Particularly archery, I think, because it's [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8273.560000000001s)]
*  the same sort of position. [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8275.84s)]
*  You're in the same position every time. [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8278.2s)]
*  Every time you draw back, your shoulders relaxed, [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8280.68s)]
*  your back is taut, you're on the string, [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8284.0s)]
*  you're just gently pulling through that trigger. [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8286.36s)]
*  It's the same position every time. [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8289.2s)]
*  And you're trying to hit this thing. [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8291.32s)]
*  With me, it's 73 yards. [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8293.400000000001s)]
*  I'm trying to hit this thing that's this big. [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8294.68s)]
*  And it's just, whoo. [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8296.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8298.76s)]
*  To do it right, you cannot be thinking about anything else. [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8299.640000000001s)]
*  It all goes away. [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8303.6s)]
*  And there's a mind-cleansing aspect to that. [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8305.36s)]
*  Yes. [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8308.32s)]
*  I agree 100%. [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8309.08s)]
*  I talked to John Dudley about that. [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8310.84s)]
*  I went to his Stump's wedding. [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8312.26s)]
*  John's a giant. [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8314.08s)]
*  He's a giant. [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8315.12s)]
*  Stud. [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8315.72s)]
*  Talk about being built well, just a natural athlete. [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8316.359999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he's a great guy, too. [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8319.199999999999s)]
*  And he's a masterful archery instructor. [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8320.359999999999s)]
*  I guess he is. [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8322.599999999999s)]
*  Masterful. [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8323.48s)]
*  Because I was kind of asking him about the principles [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8324.0s)]
*  around it. [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8326.4s)]
*  And I realized very quickly that this guy could probably [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8326.92s)]
*  talk to you for a year before you even picked up [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8330.32s)]
*  a bow about his philosophy around it. [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8332.359999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8334.96s)]
*  No, he teaches archery. [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8335.48s)]
*  So he has the most extensive video collection. [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8337.84s)]
*  If you go to Knock On Archery on YouTube, it's Knock On NOCK. [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8341.16s)]
*  It's the most extensive archery instructionals [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8345.32s)]
*  that you could get anywhere and the best instruction [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8349.76s)]
*  you can get everywhere. [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8351.76s)]
*  He does it perfectly. [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8352.68s)]
*  He teaches you perfect form. [[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8354.8s)]
*  He gives you exactly what you need [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8357.0s)]
*  to do to tune your arrows and tune your bow. [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8359.119999999999s)]
*  I mean, and he puts it all up there for free. [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8362.24s)]
*  Well, I think I've said this before. [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8364.119999999999s)]
*  I think if you really want to get to know yourself, [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8366.52s)]
*  get really good at at least one thing. [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8368.56s)]
*  Just get really good at one thing. [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8370.96s)]
*  Because what it takes to get really good at that one thing [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8372.36s)]
*  forces you to confront the things that are holding you back [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8376.6s)]
*  in general. [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8379.1s)]
*  And I don't know what those are, but everybody has them. [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8380.08s)]
*  Everybody has hang ups. [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8383.04s)]
*  Everybody has insecurities. [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8384.08s)]
*  Everybody has even resentments. [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8385.640000000001s)]
*  It's really hard to go through life [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8388.720000000001s)]
*  without having some resentment for people. [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8390.24s)]
*  And I think one of the most valuable things to do [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8392.76s)]
*  is to be able to let go of those people with love. [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8397.52s)]
*  I know it sounds hokey. [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8400.88s)]
*  I know it sounds hokey. [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8402.359999999999s)]
*  Listen to Jesus over here. [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8403.48s)]
*  I know. [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8404.599999999999s)]
*  I know, right? [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8405.099999999999s)]
*  This is a book called The Tools. [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8405.599999999999s)]
*  You ever see the Stutz that? [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8408.119999999999s)]
*  No. [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8409.599999999999s)]
*  Oh, fuck. [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8410.599999999999s)]
*  Jonah Hill had his therapist. [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8411.359999999999s)]
*  He did a documentary about his therapist. [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8414.519999999999s)]
*  His therapist was when his therapist was nine years old. [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8416.24s)]
*  His brother died of cancer, his three-year-old brother. [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8420.119999999999s)]
*  And his parents were both atheists. [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8423.08s)]
*  And his parents had nothing to fall back on. [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8424.759999999998s)]
*  So he ended up being his parents' therapists. [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8426.72s)]
*  Oh, Jesus. [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8429.48s)]
*  And by the time he became a therapist, [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8430.8s)]
*  it was a joke for him. [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8432.52s)]
*  He was like, I've been doing this my whole life. [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8433.6s)]
*  And what was really interesting about the book [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8435.96s)]
*  and also about the documentary is that then at 30, [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8437.8s)]
*  he gets Parkinson's. [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8440.72s)]
*  And it's debilitating. [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8442.64s)]
*  And so he has to contend. [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8444.56s)]
*  He's now 75. [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8446.68s)]
*  And he has to contend with his mortality. [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8447.6s)]
*  And one of the things that he found the most frustrating [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8449.84s)]
*  thing about psychoanalysis was this idea that I can tell you, [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8451.88s)]
*  we can find out where after talking for a long time, [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8456.08s)]
*  where your anxiety comes from. [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8458.68s)]
*  Your dad did this, or your uncle did this, [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8460.36s)]
*  whatever it might be. [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8462.24s)]
*  You can find the causes maybe. [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8463.08s)]
*  We can expose those. [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8464.56s)]
*  But now what do we do about it? [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8466.04s)]
*  Just because you know why doesn't mean you know [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8467.68s)]
*  what to do about it. [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8469.960000000001s)]
*  So you've got anxiety, or you've got this self-limiting, [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8471.52s)]
*  you've got this self-saboteur, or whatever it might be. [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8475.0s)]
*  Or you have this depression. [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8477.36s)]
*  Well, what do you do about that? [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8478.68s)]
*  I can prescribe medication, but sometimes that doesn't work. [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8480.44s)]
*  And he created these things called tools, [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8483.4s)]
*  which I have to say at 56, read the book. [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8486.76s)]
*  And I really, really found it useful, [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8490.12s)]
*  and I found it enjoyable. [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8492.32s)]
*  But one of the things he talks about is the idea of, [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8493.2s)]
*  and again, it's a Christian notion, [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8496.52s)]
*  but it's also, it just makes total sense. [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8498.32s)]
*  If you hold on to resentment for people, [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8500.6s)]
*  you're turning your back on your future. [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8503.960000000001s)]
*  You know, you're fighting with them. [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8505.960000000001s)]
*  You're still fighting with them in one way or another. [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8508.6s)]
*  That's a weird thing to hold onto. [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8510.800000000001s)]
*  And I think that it's really important, [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8512.68s)]
*  however you can do it, to move on from that. [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8514.52s)]
*  But if you move on from that, [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8516.880000000001s)]
*  like wishing for their destruction and stuff, [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8518.04s)]
*  I don't think that works as well. [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8520.36s)]
*  I think better is to kind of just realize, [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8522.2s)]
*  hey, whatever you're going through, [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8524.640000000001s)]
*  I forgive you, I forgive you, I forgive whatever it is, [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8527.560000000001s)]
*  and I'm gonna move on from there, [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8530.800000000001s)]
*  and actually actively do that. [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8532.04s)]
*  And you can do that through meditation. [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8534.08s)]
*  You know, he's got these things where you do that, [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8535.560000000001s)]
*  and there's a meditative way to do it. [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8537.720000000001s)]
*  But I think that's pretty powerful. [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8539.560000000001s)]
*  I think it's very helpful, [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8540.82s)]
*  because it allows you to move on [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8542.08s)]
*  from the things that are holding you back. [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8543.76s)]
*  It's also practical. [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8544.880000000001s)]
*  It's practical. [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8546.28s)]
*  You only have so much energy. [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8547.12s)]
*  You have so much time and so much concentration. [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8548.32s)]
*  You had to do that. [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8550.48s)]
*  Yeah, you had to learn how to do that. [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8551.32s)]
*  You told me your biggest accomplishment was peace of mind. [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8552.16s)]
*  I always think about that. [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8554.56s)]
*  Yes. [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8555.4s)]
*  That's a big thing. [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8556.22s)]
*  You gotta learn how, [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8557.06s)]
*  well, the way I always talk about it [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8559.64s)]
*  is that I think of my mind as bandwidth. [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8561.16s)]
*  Like I have 100 units of bandwidth. [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8563.4s)]
*  And any time I'm spending time on something that's nonsense [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8565.48s)]
*  or not constructive or not beneficial, [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8569.2s)]
*  it's stealing from the amount of bandwidth [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8571.72s)]
*  that I would have to writing a new bit [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8574.16s)]
*  or concentrating on something I love to do [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8576.119999999999s)]
*  or being with my family or friends. [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8578.16s)]
*  Like any time you've got some stuff stealing from you, [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8580.88s)]
*  you gotta figure out a way to push that out. [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8585.039999999999s)]
*  Like you don't need it. [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8586.96s)]
*  You do not need to be dwelling on some. [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8587.96s)]
*  Did you read a book about that [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8590.8s)]
*  or did you just come to that? Figured it out. [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8592.039999999999s)]
*  You did? Yeah, I figured it out. [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8593.32s)]
*  I just, I figured it out. [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8595.08s)]
*  I always figure out like what makes me feel bad. [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8596.32s)]
*  Like what is it about like what I've said [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8598.32s)]
*  or what someone said to me or what I've done [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8600.6s)]
*  or what someone's done to me? [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8602.960000000001s)]
*  Like what makes me feel bad? [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8604.04s)]
*  And then how much of that could have been preventable? [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8605.84s)]
*  How much of that is, how much of it can I mitigate? [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8608.92s)]
*  How much of it is necessary? [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8611.84s)]
*  And when you think about like disputes with people [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8613.08s)]
*  in particular, where some people just hold grudges [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8615.12s)]
*  and disputes forever, it's just thievery. [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8617.32s)]
*  You're stealing from yourself. [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8621.0s)]
*  You're stealing from your time. [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8622.640000000001s)]
*  And- Fuck, that's so important though. [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8624.800000000001s)]
*  It's such an important thing to understand. [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8627.0s)]
*  Yeah, the best revenge is to live your life well. [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8628.72s)]
*  Yeah, just accomplish it. [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8631.32s)]
*  Yeah, just live your life well. [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8633.32s)]
*  And then let that poor person who keeps dwelling, [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8635.199999999999s)]
*  let them hold onto that. [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8639.519999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and also nobody gives a fuck about, [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8640.679999999998s)]
*  the universe is gonna treat you unfairly. [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8643.4s)]
*  Okay, I'm sorry. [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8645.199999999999s)]
*  It's just the way it is. [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8646.48s)]
*  You can dwell on that, worry about it. [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8647.439999999999s)]
*  Or you can get to work. [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8649.08s)]
*  Yeah, just go to work. [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8650.24s)]
*  And you can do amazing things with your life [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8651.4s)]
*  if you can just figure out what to concentrate on. [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8654.359999999999s)]
*  The people that fuck their life up, [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8657.96s)]
*  they waste so much time concentrating on bullshit. [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8659.599999999999s)]
*  And you just don't have time for things [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8662.64s)]
*  that you really love if you do that. [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8665.039999999999s)]
*  I know. [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8666.32s)]
*  And that's just a cold, hard pragmatic approach [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8667.16s)]
*  to thought management. [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8671.32s)]
*  And I had to figure that out on my own. [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8673.0s)]
*  I figured that out. [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8675.439999999999s)]
*  But it's just uniquely me. [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8676.519999999999s)]
*  I would think about like, [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8678.64s)]
*  like one of the ones that was like early on [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8680.4s)]
*  that I realized was jealousy. [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8682.08s)]
*  That I would have jealousy over if a comic did really well [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8683.960000000001s)]
*  or if their career was doing really well. [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8688.24s)]
*  That was your competitive nature. [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8689.56s)]
*  Yes, and I realized that. [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8691.0s)]
*  I remember that when I was like 21 years old. [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8692.32s)]
*  When I was at an open mic night [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8695.36s)]
*  and I was hoping that someone bombed. [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8696.8s)]
*  And I remember thinking, wow, what a weak thought. [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8698.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8702.0s)]
*  Like, what are you doing here? [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8702.84s)]
*  Seeing someone die. [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8703.68s)]
*  But it was like, I didn't have a framework [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8704.52s)]
*  and a structure like I did with martial arts. [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8707.12s)]
*  So it was like applying like competitive drive [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8709.6s)]
*  to an artistic endeavor where actually [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8712.84s)]
*  the people that are really good are supremely beneficial. [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8716.28s)]
*  They're not bad for you. [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8720.04s)]
*  They're really good for you. [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8721.2s)]
*  They're inspiring. [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8722.64s)]
*  They're inspiring. [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8723.48s)]
*  And it's also, there's a camaraderie to it [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8724.32s)]
*  that's beautiful. [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8728.32s)]
*  And you learn how to do it from both observing [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8730.4s)]
*  and practicing. [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8733.2s)]
*  And then the level that you're around [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8734.16s)]
*  makes you raise your own level up. [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8736.36s)]
*  Yeah, it puts you on notice. [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8738.0s)]
*  You're like, I gotta get to work. [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8739.04s)]
*  100%. [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8740.56s)]
*  So I realized that and I got past that. [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8742.119999999999s)]
*  But I realized, oh, these are these kind of weaknesses [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8744.64s)]
*  that are just inherent to human character. [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8748.199999999999s)]
*  That's inherent to human desires and ego [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8750.08s)]
*  and your thoughts about yourself [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8753.279999999999s)]
*  and what you deserve versus what you're getting. [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8754.68s)]
*  And especially with young people, [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8757.72s)]
*  there's this frantic rush for success. [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8760.0s)]
*  And you think that somehow or another, [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8762.84s)]
*  if someone else does well, it takes away from you [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8764.96s)]
*  because you're not winning. [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8768.32s)]
*  They're winning. [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8770.039999999999s)]
*  God damn it, I fucking hate that dude. [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8771.359999999999s)]
*  So there's a thing that people can get trapped doing [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8773.32s)]
*  and they can do that with all sorts of aspects [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8777.48s)]
*  of their life. [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8780.439999999999s)]
*  It's just a waste of energy. [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8781.599999999999s)]
*  What's funny is that you have to keep reminding yourself [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8783.92s)]
*  of that because you can fall right back into that. [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8785.8s)]
*  You don't master anything. [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8788.48s)]
*  It's like, I'm finally here and I have no demons to fight [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8790.039999999999s)]
*  and I have no habits to overcome anymore. [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8793.439999999999s)]
*  I have arrived at my job. [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8795.32s)]
*  That's a serial killer. [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8796.48s)]
*  Yeah, that's a serial killer. [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8797.599999999999s)]
*  That shit doesn't exist. [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8799.04s)]
*  You know what's funny? [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8802.84s)]
*  I've also been thinking about this too [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8803.68s)]
*  is the idea that you better be careful [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8804.880000000001s)]
*  when you do hit the top of the mountain [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8806.800000000001s)]
*  because that's when the devil comes, [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8809.2s)]
*  sorry to get biblical on you again. [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8812.28s)]
*  I'm getting fucking biblical, [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8813.880000000001s)]
*  but that's when the devil starts whispering in your ear. [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8815.160000000002s)]
*  What is he saying? [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8817.400000000001s)]
*  Well, I'll tell you what he says. [[02:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8818.240000000002s)]
*  He goes like this. [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8819.28s)]
*  He goes, you know what? [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8820.240000000002s)]
*  You're not just God's favorite. [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8821.6s)]
*  You might be God. [[02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8823.52s)]
*  And you know what? [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8824.960000000001s)]
*  Go ahead and slap Chris Rock. [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8826.2s)]
*  I know it's the Oscars, but you can get away with it. [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8828.0s)]
*  You know what? [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8830.72s)]
*  Wear a sock over your face and say you love Hitler. [[02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8831.56s)]
*  You can do it because you're special. [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8833.64s)]
*  And we see it where everybody can fall [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8835.679999999998s)]
*  when you're at the top of that pinnacle. [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8838.16s)]
*  You can, man, you can start to say, you know what? [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8840.16s)]
*  The laws of the universe don't apply to me [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8844.279999999999s)]
*  and I'm gonna push it. [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8846.119999999999s)]
*  And that's when the gods go, ha, look at this motherfucker. [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8847.359999999999s)]
*  He thinks he's one of us. [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8850.56s)]
*  He thinks he's one of us. [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8852.24s)]
*  He forgot he's human. [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8853.64s)]
*  And apparently, I don't know if this is true, [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8855.36s)]
*  but Denzel Washington whispered in Will Smith's ear, [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8858.08s)]
*  I like Will Smith, you know, [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8861.08s)]
*  but he whispered in Will Smith's ear. [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8862.560000000001s)]
*  He said, the devil comes to us at our highest moment. [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8864.32s)]
*  You know, and Mike Tyson said that too. [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8867.92s)]
*  You ever see Mike Tyson talking to Francis Engano? [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8869.880000000001s)]
*  Mike Tyson said, you're special, man. [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8872.400000000001s)]
*  Watching you knock people out. [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8875.32s)]
*  You know what that means. [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8876.6s)]
*  It means you're one of God's favorites. [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8877.92s)]
*  And Francis went, wow. [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8879.960000000001s)]
*  And he goes, here's the bad news. [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8881.24s)]
*  You're one of the devil's favorites too. [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8883.080000000002s)]
*  And you gotta leave with the guy you came with [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8885.640000000001s)]
*  because he's looking to take you home too. [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8888.480000000001s)]
*  And it's like, damn Mike, dropping fucking knowledge. [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8890.720000000001s)]
*  You know, he's training Francis Engano [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8895.720000000001s)]
*  for the Tyson Fury fight. [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8897.720000000001s)]
*  That's crazy, is he? [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8899.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8900.36s)]
*  That old school, that custom model, that old school. [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8901.2s)]
*  I mean, I don't know how much he's gonna change his style [[02:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8903.480000000001s)]
*  because they're fighting in October, you know? [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8906.92s)]
*  It's August now. [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8908.68s)]
*  He's got, I mean, Tyson Fury's got a plethora [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8909.84s)]
*  of knowledge there. [[02:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8914.92s)]
*  He's the best ever. [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8915.76s)]
*  As far as heavyweights, it's hard to imagine [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8917.6s)]
*  other than Mike Tyson in his prime, [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8920.0s)]
*  anybody beating that guy. [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8922.72s)]
*  Tyson Fury's so good. [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8925.04s)]
*  He's so good. [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8927.44s)]
*  He's mad at me. [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8928.48s)]
*  He's mad at me because I said John Jones would fuck him up. [[02:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8929.44s)]
*  But in an MMA fight he would. [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8931.68s)]
*  That's not being mean. [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8933.72s)]
*  Yeah, but just the way I said it. [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8934.8s)]
*  I dragged him into this, who's the baddest man [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8936.6s)]
*  on the planet thing. [[02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8938.92s)]
*  I didn't mean to do, I love the guy. [[02:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8940.68s)]
*  Yeah, but he's probably being dramatic. [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8941.52s)]
*  I was talking a little loose. [[02:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8942.36s)]
*  He's being dramatic. [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8943.2s)]
*  I was with Schultz, I think we probably had [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8944.04s)]
*  a couple of cocktails. [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8945.44s)]
*  I was talking a little loose, he got very mad at me. [[02:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8946.72s)]
*  He did, for real? [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8948.6s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8949.44s)]
*  Did he text you or text you? [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8950.28s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, he just talked shit about me, [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8951.12s)]
*  made a video. [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8952.960000000001s)]
*  I love the guy, I really do. [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8953.880000000001s)]
*  It's nothing not to love. [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8955.64s)]
*  But it's just the difference, look, if he learned MMA, [[02:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8956.48s)]
*  look, that guy's a warrior. [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8958.68s)]
*  If someone taught him when he was young [[02:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8960.28s)]
*  how to wrestle and jiu-jitsu and leg kicks, [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8962.56s)]
*  he would fuck everybody up as an MMA fighter as well. [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8964.76s)]
*  Because that's who he is. [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8967.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but also. [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8968.8s)]
*  But the reality of wrestling is just, [[02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8969.64s)]
*  it's a different thing. [[02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8972.12s)]
*  You're not defending against an ankle lock [[02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8972.960000000001s)]
*  unless you've seen it and drilled it a lot of times. [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8973.8s)]
*  It's not just that, you're not defending [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8975.32s)]
*  against John Jones. [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8976.64s)]
*  A rear naked choke. [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8977.48s)]
*  Especially if there's nowhere to go. [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8978.44s)]
*  Take downs. [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8979.72s)]
*  Like I said, trapped in a room. [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8980.56s)]
*  Yeah, but that's not insulting. [[02:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8982.16s)]
*  He thought it was. [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8984.88s)]
*  It's a different sport. [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8985.72s)]
*  Because he's a fucking warrior, man. [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8986.56s)]
*  But it's a different sport. [[02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8988.08s)]
*  You can't say that a guy is a better man than him. [[02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8988.92s)]
*  That's what it is, a challenge. [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8990.88s)]
*  I could have said it in a much more diplomatic way. [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8992.08s)]
*  Okay. [[02:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8994.36s)]
*  I should have said it in a much more diplomatic way. [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8995.2s)]
*  You mean you were too honest. [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8996.2s)]
*  Little bit. [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8997.92s)]
*  Talking shit. [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=8999.28s)]
*  That's what it was. [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9000.12s)]
*  I was talking shit. [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9000.94s)]
*  But I do love the guy. [[02:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9002.160000000002s)]
*  And I do think that the thing about Francis Ngannou [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9003.12s)]
*  in Tyson Fury is, I do not imagine a world [[02:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9006.480000000001s)]
*  where Francis Ngannou can out box Tyson Fury. [[02:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9011.2s)]
*  I do not think that that will ever take place. [[02:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9013.880000000001s)]
*  No way. [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9016.560000000001s)]
*  Tyson Fury is a master. [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9017.400000000001s)]
*  His footwork, his jab, his understanding of what to do. [[02:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9018.6s)]
*  You ever see that fight with Otto Wilde [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9023.0s)]
*  where he's on the ropes and just bobbing and weaving [[02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9024.52s)]
*  and slipping punches? [[02:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9027.08s)]
*  He can see what you're doing. [[02:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9027.92s)]
*  He's gonna put Francis Ngannou. [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9028.880000000001s)]
*  So one of the great things about watching Bud Crawford [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9030.4s)]
*  with Errol Spence is. [[02:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9032.6s)]
*  Oh my goodness. [[02:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9033.960000000001s)]
*  Bud Crawford was able to put his feet [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9034.800000000001s)]
*  in a place where Errol Spence had to keep adjusting. [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9037.76s)]
*  That's why it looked, as great as Errol Spence looked, [[02:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9040.44s)]
*  you'll never see him look as off balance [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9044.12s)]
*  as he did against a genius like Bud Crawford. [[02:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9046.720000000001s)]
*  It's more where he's placing his feet. [[02:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9049.140000000001s)]
*  Those little details, those micro adjustments. [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9051.08s)]
*  He's never out of place. [[02:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9053.32s)]
*  And his accuracy. [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9054.8s)]
*  Ugh. [[02:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9055.84s)]
*  But again, it's because. [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9056.68s)]
*  He's landing those hooks in tight like that. [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9057.52s)]
*  Where he's punching from. [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9058.96s)]
*  Yes. [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9060.32s)]
*  It's where he's punching from. [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9061.16s)]
*  Perfect positioning. [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9061.98s)]
*  Yes. [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9062.82s)]
*  Perfect positioning. [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9063.66s)]
*  That has to be, you don't learn that in four months. [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9064.48s)]
*  No, no. [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9067.96s)]
*  Those are details that are, if you're tutored right [[02:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9069.58s)]
*  and you have the kind of brain that someone [[02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9073.96s)]
*  like Hopkins or Bud Crawford has. [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9076.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9078.8s)]
*  That's for you. [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9079.64s)]
*  What I will say though, is Francis Ngannou [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9081.4s)]
*  hits like a freight train. [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9085.119999999999s)]
*  Correct. [[02:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9086.64s)]
*  He hits like a freight train. [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9087.48s)]
*  But Dylan White does too. [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9088.32s)]
*  And so does. [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9089.92s)]
*  I don't think those guys hit as hard as Francis. [[02:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9090.76s)]
*  I mean, I don't know, but Francis is a natural 265. [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9092.58s)]
*  He has to cut down to make 265. [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9095.96s)]
*  He hits so fucking hard. [[02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9098.96s)]
*  The question is, will he be able to connect [[02:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9102.08s)]
*  on the greatest heavyweight ever? [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9103.68s)]
*  Also, when is he gonna get tired? [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9105.68s)]
*  Yeah, will he get tired? [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9107.96s)]
*  Will he be inefficient? [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9109.0s)]
*  Like with Connor and Floyd Mayweather. [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9110.240000000002s)]
*  Floyd Mayweather is so efficient and so smooth and composed. [[02:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9112.320000000002s)]
*  Relaxed, moving. [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9116.0s)]
*  Always relaxed. [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9117.0s)]
*  And he can box like that for 30 rounds in a row. [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9117.960000000001s)]
*  They also roll shots. [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9119.92s)]
*  He can just kind of move. [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9121.28s)]
*  Look at this with Otto Whalen. [[02:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9122.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's incredible. [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9124.84s)]
*  Watch this. [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9125.68s)]
*  Watch this movement. [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9126.52s)]
*  Look at, he knows what's going on too. [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9127.34s)]
*  He just keeps his. [[02:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9128.400000000001s)]
*  And the length and distance that fucking guy has. [[02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9129.300000000001s)]
*  Look at him. [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9131.960000000001s)]
*  His jab is just. [[02:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9132.800000000001s)]
*  He's so good. [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9133.640000000001s)]
*  Everything he does is incredible. [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9134.460000000001s)]
*  And there was this crazy controversy [[02:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9136.08s)]
*  after the Deontay Wilder fight [[02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9139.16s)]
*  where they were claiming that he didn't have [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9140.6s)]
*  his gloves on correctly. [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9141.8s)]
*  And then his knuckles were actually over the padding. [[02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9143.0s)]
*  Stop, stop. [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9145.4s)]
*  But that's just because he's so loose. [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9146.24s)]
*  When he throws his hands out sometimes, [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9148.6s)]
*  he mixes up between showing you the jab [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9150.6s)]
*  and just popping you and then driving with a power shot. [[02:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9154.1s)]
*  He just figures out. [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9158.039999999999s)]
*  But he also figures out all your patterns. [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9159.08s)]
*  The other thing about being a boxer [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9161.68s)]
*  at someone like Mugano's level, rather novice, [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9163.64s)]
*  and someone like Tyson Fury. [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9167.2s)]
*  Tyson Fury has patterns. [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9169.519999999999s)]
*  He can see what you're gonna do. [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9171.0s)]
*  Francis Mugano's gonna come to him with a game plan. [[02:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9173.8s)]
*  That game plan, with all due respect, [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9175.82s)]
*  for someone like Tyson Fury is rudimentary. [[02:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9178.359999999999s)]
*  They're gonna figure out, I see what you're doing. [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9181.279999999999s)]
*  Bah, bah, bah. [[02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9183.72s)]
*  It's like with Duran. [[02:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9184.56s)]
*  I can't remember the boxer, [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9185.4s)]
*  but he came back to his corner and goes, [[02:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9186.279999999999s)]
*  he's reading my mind. [[02:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9187.439999999999s)]
*  No, Duran just understands those patterns so well [[02:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9188.72s)]
*  that he was beating you to the punch. [[02:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9191.779999999999s)]
*  That's what was happening. [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9193.72s)]
*  It's the same idea. [[02:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9195.039999999999s)]
*  Once a fighter does that, [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9196.119999999999s)]
*  Manny Pacquiao did that to the great Miguel Cotto. [[02:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9197.800000000001s)]
*  He did it by the third round. [[02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9199.92s)]
*  He figured him out. [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9201.24s)]
*  And you could see, what's his name? [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9202.24s)]
*  Freddie Roach, screaming, knock him out. [[02:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9204.6s)]
*  And then Freddie, after that fight, said, [[02:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9206.68s)]
*  I talked to him, actually, he said, [[02:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9209.0s)]
*  he didn't wanna knock him out. [[02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9210.28s)]
*  Didn't wanna hurt him, but he could. [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9211.56s)]
*  That's how good, so. [[02:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9213.0s)]
*  He's so nice. [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9214.84s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9215.68s)]
*  Fear killer. [[02:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9216.880000000001s)]
*  How about that? [[02:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9217.72s)]
*  Manny Pacquiao's so nice. [[02:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9218.54s)]
*  Didn't wanna knock. [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9219.52s)]
*  That's true, though, man. [[02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9220.800000000001s)]
*  When a fighter figures your game out that quickly, [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9221.64s)]
*  we'll see you later. [[02:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9224.76s)]
*  He downloaded everything you ever do. [[02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9225.58s)]
*  He really didn't wanna knock him out. [[02:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9226.9s)]
*  That's what Freddie Roach said. [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9228.3s)]
*  Wow, that's crazy. [[02:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9229.26s)]
*  Cause he was like, get him outta here. [[02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9230.42s)]
*  And he's like, I don't wanna be mean. [[02:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9231.74s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9234.5s)]
*  You could see it. [[02:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9235.58s)]
*  You could see, he broke his nose, [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9236.42s)]
*  and it was just crazy. [[02:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9238.24s)]
*  Manny's talking about fighting again, like a real fight. [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9239.58s)]
*  Well, guys like Manny and guys like, [[02:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9242.38s)]
*  nobody talks enough about Bernard Hopkins [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9244.98s)]
*  and what he was able to do up in the age of 50. [[02:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9246.78s)]
*  I was talking to Masvidal about this. [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9250.54s)]
*  You're talking about a guy in a division [[02:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9253.14s)]
*  where speed and power make a big difference. [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9255.18s)]
*  And he was at 50. [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9258.26s)]
*  He was still fighting at a level [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9261.5s)]
*  that maybe two other people. [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9263.86s)]
*  World Championship level. [[02:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9264.7s)]
*  Crazy. [[02:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9265.54s)]
*  Yeah, incredible. [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9266.36s)]
*  And that's because of his fight IQ. [[02:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9267.2s)]
*  His fight IQ and his discipline. [[02:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9268.66s)]
*  The guy never got out of shape, never ate bad, [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9270.380000000001s)]
*  never drank. [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9272.220000000001s)]
*  Did push-ups between rounds. [[02:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9273.06s)]
*  Yeah, he was incredible. [[02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9274.58s)]
*  He's just one of the all-timers. [[02:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9276.7s)]
*  And just, what a guy to emulate. [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9278.960000000001s)]
*  You see his style. [[02:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9280.94s)]
*  Like when he beat Tito Trinidad, [[02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9283.14s)]
*  nobody gave him a chance. [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9284.580000000002s)]
*  He went over to Puerto Rico [[02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9286.02s)]
*  and threw the Puerto Rican flag on the ground. [[02:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9287.060000000001s)]
*  I didn't see that. [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9288.660000000002s)]
*  They tried to kill him. [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9289.5s)]
*  I didn't see that. [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9290.320000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9291.160000000002s)]
*  Oh, he hyped that fight up in a big way. [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9292.0s)]
*  And he got Tito Trinidad very emotional. [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9292.84s)]
*  And then he just boxed his face off. [[02:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9295.18s)]
*  He'll get in your kitchen, man. [[02:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9297.140000000001s)]
*  He'll find you. [[02:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9298.62s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9299.460000000001s)]
*  You always have a window open in your house [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9300.300000000001s)]
*  and he'll climb into that fucking window. [[02:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9301.320000000002s)]
*  And good luck. [[02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9303.300000000001s)]
*  Such a good boxer. [[02:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9304.220000000001s)]
*  Apparently with Kelly Pavlik, who was a killer, [[02:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9305.060000000001s)]
*  he whispered in his ear, he said, [[02:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9307.52s)]
*  "'Don't let this ruin you.'" [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9308.900000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[02:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9310.660000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9311.5s)]
*  Wow. [[02:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9312.42s)]
*  I remember that fight. [[02:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9313.42s)]
*  He was in his 40s. [[02:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9314.9s)]
*  And Kelly Pavlik was like, [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9315.74s)]
*  was a killer. [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9318.14s)]
*  Killer. [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9318.98s)]
*  Was after he knocked out Jermaine Taylor. [[02:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9319.82s)]
*  Right. [[02:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9321.300000000001s)]
*  And Jermaine Taylor was a monster. [[02:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9322.14s)]
*  Kelly Pavlik was a killer. [[02:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9323.74s)]
*  Yeah, killer. [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9325.300000000001s)]
*  But just ran into a genius. [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9326.14s)]
*  He just ran into a genius. [[02:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9327.42s)]
*  That's okay. [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9328.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9329.54s)]
*  Genius boxers to me. [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9330.36s)]
*  It's the most exciting thing to watch. [[02:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9331.86s)]
*  So when you watch a guy like Terrence Crawford [[02:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9333.74s)]
*  or the guy who's going to fight next, Boots Ennis. [[02:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9335.460000000001s)]
*  I don't know much about Boots Ennis. [[02:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9338.62s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9339.460000000001s)]
*  He's so good. [[02:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9340.300000000001s)]
*  Is he fighting him at 54? [[02:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9341.12s)]
*  I think they're talking about doing a rematch [[02:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9342.86s)]
*  with Errol Spence at 54. [[02:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9345.300000000001s)]
*  Yeah, well. [[02:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9347.300000000001s)]
*  But you know, that's a hard sell. [[02:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9348.82s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[02:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9350.74s)]
*  The only thought would be that Errol Spence [[02:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9351.58s)]
*  depleted himself so much getting to 154 [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9354.060000000001s)]
*  that he couldn't fight to the best of his abilities. [[02:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9356.82s)]
*  But just looks like Terrence Crawford's on another level. [[02:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9358.92s)]
*  He is. [[02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9362.1s)]
*  I mean, it's undeniable that boxers do get weakened [[02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9362.94s)]
*  when they lose a lot of weight. [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9366.060000000001s)]
*  It's undeniable. [[02:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9367.140000000001s)]
*  But he had been world champion at 47. [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9368.220000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9370.66s)]
*  I don't think that was an issue of weakness. [[02:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9371.58s)]
*  I think that was an issue of just. [[02:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9373.42s)]
*  Genius. [[02:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9374.82s)]
*  Genius. [[02:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9375.66s)]
*  You just, sometimes you are out, [[02:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9376.5s)]
*  you're beaten by some, [[02:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9378.98s)]
*  I think Bud Crawford is greatness. [[02:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9380.5s)]
*  He's greatness. [[02:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9382.7s)]
*  He's not just good, he's greatness. [[02:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9384.18s)]
*  And greatness is a different X factor. [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9385.82s)]
*  What did you think of Lomachenko, Devin Haney fight? [[02:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9387.9s)]
*  I didn't see enough of it. [[02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9390.46s)]
*  I saw highlights. [[02:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9391.4s)]
*  And I heard that Lomachenko got the best of him, [[02:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9392.82s)]
*  but I don't know. [[02:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9396.38s)]
*  It looked to me like he won. [[02:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9397.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9398.54s)]
*  I've watched it twice now. [[02:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9399.66s)]
*  I could kind of see a world where it's close. [[02:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9401.7s)]
*  It's close. [[02:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9404.34s)]
*  And the unfortunate aspect of the fact [[02:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9405.220000000001s)]
*  that a lot of people don't agree with the decision [[02:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9407.060000000001s)]
*  is that it kind of tarnishes an amazing fight. [[02:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9409.300000000001s)]
*  Because the fight was amazing. [[02:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9415.26s)]
*  Both Devin Haney, his performance, [[02:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9416.82s)]
*  and Lomachenko's performance. [[02:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9418.94s)]
*  It was an incredible fight between two guys [[02:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9420.42s)]
*  in their fucking prime. [[02:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9422.220000000001s)]
*  It was such a good fight. [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9423.82s)]
*  Is Lomo in his prime though? [[02:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9424.66s)]
*  He still is, man. [[02:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9426.300000000001s)]
*  The way he fought against Devin Haney, [[02:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9427.140000000001s)]
*  he looked fucking fantastic. [[02:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9428.58s)]
*  I think he's 36 now. [[02:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9430.1s)]
*  You know how many fights he's had? [[02:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9432.46s)]
*  Those guys who come up through that Russian system. [[02:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9433.46s)]
*  I think like Triple G had 350 fights. [[02:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9435.5s)]
*  I think it's the amateur or something crazy. [[02:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9438.9s)]
*  Like are you out of your fucking mind? [[02:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9440.539999999999s)]
*  Insane. [[02:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9441.859999999999s)]
*  Insane. [[02:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9442.939999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9443.779999999999s)]
*  I mean. Insane. [[02:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9444.619999999999s)]
*  Lomachenko's got a wild story too [[02:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9445.939999999999s)]
*  because his dad made him stop boxing for two years [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9447.58s)]
*  to learn Russian, Ukrainian dance rather. [[02:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9449.779999999999s)]
*  I know, that's so weird. [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9452.3s)]
*  Yeah, and Ukrainian dance was like the foundation [[02:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9453.14s)]
*  for his footwork. [[02:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9455.34s)]
*  Isn't he Usyk's coach as well? [[02:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9456.18s)]
*  Yes. [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9457.859999999999s)]
*  Now that's a guy, [[02:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9458.7s)]
*  if you watch that Anthony Joshua fight. [[02:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9460.980000000001s)]
*  Usyk's insane. [[02:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9464.18s)]
*  He's just a, I mean that's so beautiful to watch that. [[02:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9465.18s)]
*  I know. [[02:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9469.7s)]
*  Setting traps and like I watched some guy break down [[02:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9470.54s)]
*  the stuff that I didn't see, that I didn't know [[02:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9473.740000000002s)]
*  as just somebody who doesn't understand. [[02:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9475.54s)]
*  How about the sheer volume of strikes that he throws [[02:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9477.060000000001s)]
*  as a heavyweight? [[02:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9480.02s)]
*  God. [[02:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9480.86s)]
*  Incredible. [[02:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9481.820000000002s)]
*  Because he's a natural cruiserweight too. [[02:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9482.66s)]
*  It's not like he's a big man. [[02:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9484.820000000002s)]
*  No, he's like 220 I think. [[02:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9486.02s)]
*  That's so weird. [[02:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9487.300000000001s)]
*  He's not a big heavyweight at all. [[02:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9488.3s)]
*  But you gotta realize also that Mike Tyson in his prime [[02:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9489.939999999999s)]
*  was also about 220. [[02:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9492.619999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's correct. [[02:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9494.5s)]
*  That's correct. [[02:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9495.699999999999s)]
*  He's big enough to hurt you. [[02:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9496.539999999999s)]
*  Usyk was so slick. [[02:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9497.38s)]
*  I know. [[02:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9498.699999999999s)]
*  And Anthony Joshua is such a fucking big man. [[02:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9499.539999999999s)]
*  It's such a power. [[02:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9501.26s)]
*  Well you're talking about a super athlete. [[02:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9502.099999999999s)]
*  And he almost took Anthony Joshua out in the first fight. [[02:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9502.939999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9505.38s)]
*  Especially like towards the end of the fight, [[02:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9506.5s)]
*  like he was battering Joshua. [[02:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9508.46s)]
*  Just everything's a plan though he's doing. [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9509.98s)]
*  Yeah, he's so slick man. [[02:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9514.019999999999s)]
*  He rolls with stuff. [[02:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9515.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9516.539999999999s)]
*  He's like he's gonna take you out. [[02:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9517.38s)]
*  And then he starts putting it on you. [[02:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9518.22s)]
*  Look at that hairstyle and that mustache. [[02:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9519.06s)]
*  He's such a unique character. [[02:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9521.06s)]
*  He is. [[02:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9522.46s)]
*  He's very, very eccentric. [[02:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9523.5s)]
*  Wasn't he a two time Olympian? [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9527.06s)]
*  I believe so. [[02:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9528.74s)]
*  Yeah, I think he won. [[02:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9529.58s)]
*  Right? [[02:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9530.9s)]
*  Look that up Jamie, I think he was a... [[02:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9531.74s)]
*  It's crazy. [[02:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9534.14s)]
*  Phenomenal boxer though. [[02:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9534.98s)]
*  And interesting, right? [[02:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9535.82s)]
*  So I was really interested in seeing him in Tyson Fury. [[02:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9536.66s)]
*  I was too. [[02:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9539.699999999999s)]
*  That's an amazing fight. [[02:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9540.619999999999s)]
*  I don't know why, I wonder if his camp [[02:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9541.46s)]
*  just doesn't want that. [[02:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9543.5s)]
*  I wonder if his camp is like... [[02:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9545.22s)]
*  Whose camp? [[02:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9546.58s)]
*  Tyson Fury's camp is like... [[02:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9547.46s)]
*  Who knows? [[02:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9548.78s)]
*  I think they want the most money possible [[02:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9549.62s)]
*  in the Francis and Gano fight. [[02:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9551.06s)]
*  They're doing in... [[02:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9552.9s)]
*  I think they're doing the UAE. [[02:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9554.38s)]
*  I think they're doing it. [[02:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9556.82s)]
*  I don't know where they're... [[02:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9558.06s)]
*  Maybe they're doing it in Dubai. [[02:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9558.9s)]
*  He won a gold medal there. [[02:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9559.82s)]
*  I thought it was twice, but I think it was just warrants. [[02:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9561.06s)]
*  Outporting Arthur Bitterbeuf. [[02:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9563.18s)]
*  And Bitterbeuf is the only fighter right now [[02:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9565.7s)]
*  that's a champion that has a 100% knockout rate. [[02:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9568.94s)]
*  He's undefeated. [[02:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9572.38s)]
*  He's 19 and 0 with 19 knockouts. [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9573.78s)]
*  He is a fucking monster. [[02:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9577.1s)]
*  And that was the guy that they were trying [[02:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9579.300000000001s)]
*  to set Canelo up with. [[02:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9580.86s)]
*  Because when Canelo fought Beval, [[02:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9582.660000000002s)]
*  one of the other names that was on the table was Bitterbeuf. [[02:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9584.820000000002s)]
*  Oh, he's a destroyer. [[02:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9587.34s)]
*  You ever seen this guy fight? [[02:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9588.86s)]
*  Beval? [[02:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9589.900000000001s)]
*  I saw him fight. [[02:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9590.740000000002s)]
*  No, Bitterbeuf. [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9591.58s)]
*  No, I've never seen this guy. [[02:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9592.400000000001s)]
*  Bitterbeuf is one of the most impressive guys in boxing. [[02:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9593.240000000002s)]
*  Is that right? [[02:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9594.34s)]
*  What weights he fight at? [[02:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9595.18s)]
*  He's a light heavyweight. [[02:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9596.0s)]
*  He's a light heavyweight champion. [[02:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9596.84s)]
*  He's the guy who knocked out Joe Smith Jr., [[02:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9597.900000000001s)]
*  the guy who knocked out Bernard Hopkins. [[02:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9600.060000000001s)]
*  Oh boy. [[02:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9601.42s)]
*  That's a lot to deal with for Canelo. [[02:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9602.34s)]
*  Go to Bitterbeuf's highlights. [[02:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9604.18s)]
*  Go to his highlights. [[02:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9605.78s)]
*  That's a bigger man than Canelo. [[02:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9606.62s)]
*  He's a fucking monster, dude. [[02:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9608.380000000001s)]
*  Too big for Canelo. [[02:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9609.78s)]
*  He's not just big, he's a fucking destroyer. [[02:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9611.02s)]
*  And he's not like an elusive guy like an Usyk. [[02:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9613.34s)]
*  He's a Chechnyan. [[02:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9616.1s)]
*  Just a fucking warrior, dude. [[02:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9617.58s)]
*  Just comes at you with insane technique, [[02:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9619.42s)]
*  blood and guts, just smashing people. [[02:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9621.98s)]
*  But Canelo- [[02:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9624.94s)]
*  All knockouts, dude. [[02:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9625.78s)]
*  Canelo wants to fight him? [[02:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9626.6s)]
*  Joe Smith Jr. [[02:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9627.54s)]
*  No, I don't believe so. [[02:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9628.380000000001s)]
*  I don't believe he wants any of this. [[02:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9629.7s)]
*  I think he wants another Bevaul fight, [[02:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9630.82s)]
*  but this is the most terrifying matchup [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9633.06s)]
*  of light heavyweight. [[02:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9634.9s)]
*  He's a fucking animal, dude. [[02:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9635.779999999999s)]
*  And he looks like an animal with that fucking beard. [[02:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9638.1s)]
*  He's, look, there's a reason there are weight classes. [[02:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9640.74s)]
*  Watch some of these chaos, man. [[02:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9643.3s)]
*  This fucking guy is terrifying. [[02:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9644.86s)]
*  And a 100% knockout ratio. [[02:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9646.779999999999s)]
*  Everybody he fights, and every fight is the same way. [[02:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9650.619999999999s)]
*  Seek and destroy. [[02:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9653.42s)]
*  Comes straight at you, hands up high, and break you down. [[02:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9655.039999999999s)]
*  And he hits like a fucking Mack truck. [[02:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9659.140000000001s)]
*  I mean, he's a fucking tank, dude. [[02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9663.86s)]
*  And he puts together these beautiful combi- [[02:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9667.82s)]
*  Look at how tight that left hook was. [[02:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9669.86s)]
*  Everything's tight. [[02:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9672.140000000001s)]
*  It's these beautiful combinations, [[02:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9673.18s)]
*  but it's just constant pressure. [[02:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9674.86s)]
*  Like, look how he breaks people down. [[02:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9680.42s)]
*  Just a beast. [[02:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9682.7s)]
*  And this was the Anthony Yard fight. [[02:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9684.34s)]
*  And Yard's a monster. [[02:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9685.74s)]
*  Oh, dude, he's fucking people up, dude. [[02:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9688.7s)]
*  He's so interesting to watch, too. [[02:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9690.580000000002s)]
*  Because it's just, how long can the person outlast [[02:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9692.62s)]
*  this attack? [[02:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9696.54s)]
*  Oh, Christ. [[02:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9697.94s)]
*  I mean, how long can the person handle this? [[02:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9699.980000000001s)]
*  I don't think that's Yard. [[02:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9701.86s)]
*  I think your body just gives in. [[02:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9703.18s)]
*  Oh, covered his- [[02:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9704.820000000002s)]
*  He hit him in the body and came right to the face. [[02:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9705.660000000002s)]
*  Yeah, that wasn't Anthony Yard. [[02:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9706.86s)]
*  But this is, I mean, there's a whole series [[02:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9708.220000000001s)]
*  of his fights like this, and they're all the same way. [[02:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9710.660000000002s)]
*  He just puts it on guys until they break. [[02:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9712.980000000001s)]
*  Yeah, no thanks. [[02:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9715.18s)]
*  He's incredible. [[02:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9716.380000000001s)]
*  Who would be a competitive fighter? [[02:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9719.34s)]
*  Beval. [[02:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9720.900000000001s)]
*  Beval and him would be a great unification fight. [[02:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9721.740000000002s)]
*  Beval looked like a bigger Canelo, [[02:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9723.42s)]
*  like very similar style to me. [[02:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9725.1s)]
*  Like really, really similar to Canelo when they fought. [[02:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9727.660000000002s)]
*  I was like, that's just a bigger Canelo. [[02:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9730.42s)]
*  Big and long and a real light heavyweight. [[02:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9731.900000000001s)]
*  Fundamentals are perfect. [[02:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9734.78s)]
*  Never of being 154. [[02:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9736.42s)]
*  He's a real 175 pound guy. [[02:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9738.18s)]
*  I mean, props to Canelo for wanting to challenge himself [[02:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9740.740000000002s)]
*  like that, because it's kind of wild. [[02:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9743.300000000001s)]
*  He's great. [[02:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9745.060000000001s)]
*  It's kind of wild that he goes up and knocks out Kovalev. [[02:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9745.900000000001s)]
*  And Kovalev is huge. [[02:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9749.14s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9751.619999999999s)]
*  I mean, Kovalev was like later in his career then, [[02:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9752.699999999999s)]
*  but if you go back and watch his fight, [[02:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9754.779999999999s)]
*  his first fight with Andre Ward and all the other guys [[02:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9756.14s)]
*  that he knocked down, like Kovalev when he was the crusher, [[02:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9759.34s)]
*  he was a beast. [[02:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9761.939999999999s)]
*  Andre Ward was another guy who could just [[02:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9762.82s)]
*  download what you were doing, did it with Kovalev twice. [[02:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9764.3s)]
*  And by the way, fought most of his career with one arm. [[02:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9767.22s)]
*  What do you mean? [[02:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9770.099999999999s)]
*  Hit a fucked up shoulder most of his career. [[02:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9770.939999999999s)]
*  Is that true? [[02:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9773.18s)]
*  Yeah, he had an operation before the second Kovalev fight. [[02:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9773.619999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[02:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9776.38s)]

*  All the middleweight tournament that he went through, [[02:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9778.18s)]
*  the Karl Frosch, all those guys. [[02:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9781.26s)]
*  He beat all those guys with one shoulder. [[02:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9782.66s)]
*  You know who came out of that camp, [[02:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9784.42s)]

*  So like, how far can a ship be to where the bomb goes off? [[02:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9943.140000000001s)]

*  Holy shit. [[02:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9966.34s)]
*  Wait till it pans out and you see how high it goes. [[02:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9967.62s)]
*  Are you, did they detonate it underwater? [[02:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9970.300000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9972.86s)]
*  How many fish that killed? [[02:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9973.7s)]
*  Everyone. [[02:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9974.94s)]
*  All the fish. [[02:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9975.94s)]
*  Are you kidding? [[02:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9976.9s)]
*  They probably killed fish for a mile around. [[02:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9977.74s)]
*  100%. [[02:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9979.94s)]
*  That's not the best view of it. [[02:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9980.78s)]
*  There's a view of it from the shore. [[02:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9982.94s)]
*  There's another one. [[02:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9983.78s)]
*  And that's all water? [[02:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9984.62s)]
*  What is that? [[02:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9985.460000000001s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9986.300000000001s)]
*  That's water. [[02:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9987.140000000001s)]
*  Yeah, the nuclear bomb shot the water. [[02:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9987.98s)]
*  Like I'm, I don't know how high in the air. [[02:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9990.1s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9991.7s)]
*  There's another one that, yeah, that's the one. [[02:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9992.86s)]
*  This is, this one's wild. [[02:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9995.220000000001s)]
*  I love this one. [[02:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9996.74s)]
*  Watch this one. [[02:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9997.62s)]
*  Cause they detonate. [[02:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9998.94s)]
*  Oh. [[02:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=9999.78s)]
*  So they detonate this one. [[02:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10000.62s)]
*  Look at this. [[02:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10004.26s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10005.74s)]
*  Watch how high it goes. [[02:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10006.9s)]
*  It just keeps going. [[02:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10008.62s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10010.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10012.54s)]
*  Look at this. [[02:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10013.380000000001s)]
*  Look at this, dude. [[02:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10014.58s)]
*  How insane is that? [[02:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10016.86s)]
*  Imagine seeing that. [[02:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10018.78s)]
*  Look how high that fucking cloud is. [[02:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10022.060000000001s)]
*  That's so insane. [[02:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10024.42s)]
*  And there's, there's different angles of it [[02:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10025.26s)]
*  where it's like a zoomed back angle [[02:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10026.900000000001s)]
*  where you can see the whole thing from one. [[02:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10029.02s)]
*  I've never seen that, man. [[02:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10030.820000000002s)]
*  Fucking incredible. [[02:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10031.66s)]
*  Now that's an atomic bomb, not a thermonuclear bomb. [[02:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10033.26s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10035.980000000001s)]
*  Apparently there's a difference. [[02:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10036.820000000002s)]
*  Yeah, they're more powerful. [[02:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10037.66s)]
*  Yes. [[02:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10038.86s)]
*  That is correct. [[02:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10039.7s)]
*  So like the bombs that they dropped on Hiroshima [[02:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10040.66s)]
*  and Nagasaki, the ones that they have now [[02:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10043.7s)]
*  are so many times more powerful. [[02:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10045.58s)]
*  Well, I told you, I have dinner with Eric Weinstein [[02:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10047.74s)]
*  and he comes in and he's all down. [[02:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10050.06s)]
*  I'm like, what's that? [[02:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10052.18s)]
*  He goes, oh, I don't, I think we have 30 years left. [[02:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10053.02s)]
*  I'm like, here we go. [[02:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10055.02s)]
*  He's very dramatic. [[02:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10056.38s)]
*  And he's like, we're going to miniaturize [[02:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10057.22s)]
*  thermonuclear weapons. [[02:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10058.7s)]
*  And with CRISPR Cas9, we're going to be able to take [[02:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10059.9s)]
*  viruses and manipulate them. [[02:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10061.7s)]
*  And I was like, you have a point there. [[02:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10063.14s)]
*  You have a point. [[02:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10064.9s)]
*  Get to work. [[02:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10065.74s)]
*  Hey you, get a lab and get to work. [[02:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10066.58s)]
*  Solve these problems. [[02:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10068.02s)]
*  The lab they found, the Chinese operated lab [[02:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10068.900000000001s)]
*  that was in Los Angeles or in the LA area. [[02:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10071.060000000001s)]
*  No. [[02:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10074.26s)]
*  Yeah, they found some lab with mice [[02:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10075.1s)]
*  that were in horrible conditions that there was something [[02:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10077.26s)]
*  about them being infected with COVID-19 or they had, [[02:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10079.980000000001s)]
*  see what the article is. [[02:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10083.78s)]
*  But it was like a bio research lab [[02:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10085.34s)]
*  that was in some abandoned warehouse somewhere. [[02:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10088.380000000001s)]
*  So California officials closed down a bootleg Chinese lab [[02:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10091.300000000001s)]
*  brimming with infectious agents such as COVID and HIV. [[02:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10095.34s)]
*  In addition to pathogens, investigators found hundreds [[02:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10098.9s)]
*  of chemicals, a thousand mice, many of them dead [[02:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10101.62s)]
*  and bootleg COVID and pregnancy tests [[02:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10104.78s)]
*  apparently developed on site. [[02:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10107.18s)]
*  Well, that's not good, man. [[02:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10108.82s)]
*  So they were experimenting with rats and mice [[02:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10110.3s)]
*  to develop COVID tests? [[02:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10113.42s)]
*  Holy shit. [[02:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10115.74s)]
*  In a fucking warehouse somewhere with HIV. [[02:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10116.58s)]
*  Oh, so they were trying to come up with tests. [[02:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10119.1s)]
*  Who knows what they were doing? [[02:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10120.5s)]
*  Who fucking knows? [[02:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10121.98s)]
*  But the rats or the mice rather, [[02:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10122.98s)]
*  most of them were dead already. [[02:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10124.619999999999s)]
*  Did you see where they put in the chat GBT, [[02:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10126.22s)]
*  come up with chemical weapons and it came up [[02:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10129.58s)]
*  with 40,000 different variants of a chemical weapon? [[02:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10131.66s)]
*  Do you see this? [[02:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10134.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10135.34s)]
*  That's not good. [[02:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10136.18s)]
*  No, there's a lot to worry about. [[02:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10137.02s)]
*  Yeah, Eric Weinstein scares the shit out of me [[02:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10138.619999999999s)]
*  with all that we have 30 years left talk. [[02:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10140.1s)]
*  What do you think of this UFO shit? [[02:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10141.779999999999s)]
*  I don't think any of it's true. [[02:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10143.26s)]
*  I feel like I'm being lied to. [[02:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10144.859999999999s)]
*  Me too. [[02:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10147.22s)]
*  And here's the thing. [[02:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10148.06s)]
*  I wonder if that's because disclosure, [[02:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10149.06s)]
*  I imagine in my head that it would be this grand moment [[02:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10152.98s)]
*  and the clouds would part and we would figure out [[02:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10156.66s)]
*  that we're not alone in the universe. [[02:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10159.939999999999s)]
*  And maybe this reality of what they're disclosing [[02:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10161.34s)]
*  that they have recovered alien spacecrafts, [[02:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10165.859999999999s)]
*  that they have biological creatures from another planet, [[02:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10168.619999999999s)]
*  that they have frozen or from another dimension, [[02:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10170.939999999999s)]
*  they are in possession of both craft and biologics. [[02:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10172.939999999999s)]
*  They know that aliens are real. [[02:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10175.9s)]
*  Maybe it's just that is so strange and so alien [[02:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10177.46s)]
*  that my mind is not registering it as a possibility, [[02:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10181.539999999999s)]
*  even though it can be a possibility. [[02:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10185.22s)]
*  If you just look at the stars in the sky [[02:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10187.3s)]
*  and look at what we know about biology on Earth, [[02:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10190.06s)]
*  it's totally possible that this in this infinite universe [[02:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10193.539999999999s)]
*  has occurred other places [[02:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10196.859999999999s)]
*  and gotten to a much more advanced stage. [[02:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10198.259999999998s)]
*  I love that they were able to cross galaxies [[02:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10200.14s)]
*  and then they couldn't land. [[02:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10202.3s)]
*  No, that's not the thing. [[02:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10203.5s)]
*  It's like the thing is, [[02:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10204.619999999999s)]
*  even if you have the most advanced spaceships, [[02:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10208.46s)]
*  think about cars. [[02:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10213.099999999999s)]
*  They're so much more advanced than they've ever been before. [[02:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10214.419999999998s)]
*  Thousands of people still die every year in car accidents. [[02:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10216.779999999999s)]
*  If you have electrical storms, [[02:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10219.46s)]
*  and the very famous case in Virginia, Brazil, [[02:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10221.98s)]
*  which James Fox did this documentary [[02:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10225.38s)]
*  called The Moment of Contact, it's amazing. [[02:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10228.74s)]
*  It's about this town in 1996 in Brazil [[02:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10231.66s)]
*  that experienced just universal sightings. [[02:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10234.62s)]
*  Everyone in the town saw these flying saucers [[02:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10238.34s)]
*  and saw that there was this giant lightning storm [[02:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10241.34s)]
*  and something appeared to have crashed. [[02:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10244.140000000001s)]
*  And these people went to the side of this crash site [[02:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10246.5s)]
*  and they said that there was biological entities. [[02:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10249.62s)]
*  One of them was badly injured. [[02:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10252.140000000001s)]
*  This guy carried it. [[02:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10253.86s)]
*  This police officer carried it. [[02:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10254.94s)]
*  He put it in the back of a car. [[02:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10256.380000000001s)]
*  They took it to a hospital. [[02:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10257.300000000001s)]
*  They kicked them out, took it to another hospital. [[02:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10258.26s)]
*  The guy who carried it developed [[02:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10260.58s)]
*  a horrible bacterial infection that they could not cure. [[02:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10262.42s)]
*  And he was dead within two weeks. [[02:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10265.46s)]
*  They didn't know what it was. [[02:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10267.06s)]
*  There's documentation of them bringing this thing [[02:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10268.46s)]
*  to these different hospitals. [[02:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10271.14s)]
*  There's documentation of this guy dying [[02:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10272.339999999998s)]
*  of this horrible bacterial infection. [[02:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10274.38s)]
*  There's all these eyewitnesses. [[02:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10276.74s)]
*  The town, when you enter into the town, [[02:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10278.66s)]
*  has an actual statue of this fucking UFO [[02:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10280.42s)]
*  that is in the center as you're entering into the town. [[02:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10284.38s)]
*  They're famous for this incident. [[02:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10287.619999999999s)]
*  They said the US Air Force sent a plane down there [[02:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10290.34s)]
*  to recover the wreckage and return it back to America. [[02:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10293.18s)]
*  This guy, David Grush, who's the whistleblower, [[02:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10296.66s)]
*  has exposed that they supposedly have a retrieval program [[02:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10299.02s)]
*  for crashed UFOs and that it's happened multiple times [[02:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10303.34s)]
*  over the course of human history. [[02:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10307.1s)]
*  This was what Bob Lazar was talking about in 1989. [[02:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10309.14s)]
*  Why keep it a secret? [[02:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10311.82s)]
*  I don't understand. [[02:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10313.06s)]
*  Well, I think they don't want to anymore. [[02:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10313.9s)]
*  I think there's part of it that it's not beneficial [[02:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10316.06s)]
*  to keep it a secret. [[02:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10318.9s)]
*  And that too many people who feel like [[02:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10321.14s)]
*  this is an important thing that the world should be aware of [[02:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10322.9s)]
*  and that maybe this could actually be a uniting moment for us [[02:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10325.98s)]
*  if we realize that Space Daddy is really watching [[02:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10328.98s)]
*  everything we do and there are something that's here, [[02:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10332.179999999998s)]
*  whether it's interdimensional, [[02:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10336.539999999999s)]
*  whether it's from another planet. [[02:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10337.66s)]
*  That would be very unifying. [[02:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10338.74s)]
*  Very unifying. [[02:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10340.5s)]
*  You know, but I don't believe it. [[02:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10341.34s)]
*  But I appreciate it. [[02:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10343.539999999999s)]
*  What do you think is going on then? [[02:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10344.38s)]
*  Why do you think they're having these? [[02:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10345.779999999999s)]
*  I think it's impossible to keep a secret, [[02:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10347.58s)]
*  a secret of that magnitude. [[02:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10349.38s)]
*  There's no way- [[02:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10351.019999999999s)]
*  Well, they're not keeping it. [[02:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10351.859999999999s)]
*  That's one of the things. [[02:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10352.68s)]
*  It's getting out. [[02:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10353.519999999999s)]
*  But they have since the 30s, according to these whistleblowers. [[02:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10354.359999999999s)]
*  But have they? [[02:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10357.099999999999s)]
*  Because look, Bob Lazar talked about this very program [[02:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10357.939999999999s)]
*  exactly in 1989. [[02:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10361.619999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10363.939999999999s)]
*  But was he talking about a drone program? [[02:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10364.779999999999s)]
*  And do we have technologies that we are not aware of [[02:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10367.42s)]
*  that can do things that make no sense? [[02:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10370.34s)]
*  Perhaps. [[02:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10372.9s)]
*  It's kind of like the Manhattan Project, right? [[02:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10373.74s)]
*  We might have some technological breakthroughs [[02:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10375.5s)]
*  that we are not sharing with other countries. [[02:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10378.38s)]
*  And that may be the case. [[02:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10380.939999999999s)]
*  The US military may have game-changing technologies. [[02:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10382.179999999998s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10387.14s)]
*  That's certainly possible. [[02:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10387.98s)]
*  That sounds more plausible to me. [[02:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10388.82s)]
*  A lot of people think that's what that Tic Tac incident is. [[02:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10391.099999999999s)]
*  Off the coast of San Diego in 2004, [[02:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10394.019999999999s)]
*  it's a famous one where Commander David Fravor, [[02:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10396.82s)]
*  they have multiple instrumentation, [[02:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10399.339999999998s)]
*  the documentation of where this thing was. [[02:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10403.42s)]
*  And it was at 50,000 plus feet above sea level, [[02:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10407.140000000001s)]
*  and it went down to 50 in less than a second. [[02:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10409.86s)]
*  It took off at an insane rate of speed. [[02:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10412.300000000001s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10413.94s)]
*  They have multiple pilots. [[02:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10414.78s)]
*  That was 2004? [[02:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10416.02s)]
*  Yes, multiple jets, more than one jet [[02:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10416.9s)]
*  that had visual contact with this thing. [[02:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10419.86s)]
*  They have video of this thing taking off. [[02:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10421.98s)]
*  They estimated that at the speed that it took off, [[02:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10424.42s)]
*  there was some sort of analysis [[02:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10427.66s)]
*  of what it would do to a biological entity. [[02:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10429.66s)]
*  And it would turn you into jelly. [[02:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10431.66s)]
*  It would just, the amount of force required [[02:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10433.54s)]
*  to go that fast, that quick. [[02:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10435.54s)]
*  It was something like, I forget what the G-force was, [[02:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10437.26s)]
*  but it was something insane. [[02:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10440.060000000001s)]
*  Some insane number of G-force [[02:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10441.42s)]
*  that it was taking off that fast. [[02:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10443.42s)]
*  There's no way a biological entity would survive. [[02:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10445.060000000001s)]
*  But the question is, why would we assume [[02:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10447.5s)]
*  that it's a biological entity? [[02:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10449.300000000001s)]
*  It doesn't have any windows. [[02:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10450.5s)]
*  It's this round thing that looks like a Tic Tac. [[02:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10451.7s)]
*  If there is some sort of advanced propulsion system, [[02:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10453.86s)]
*  some revolutionary way of moving through space and time [[02:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10456.42s)]
*  that the US government has developed [[02:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10460.660000000002s)]
*  in some black ops program, [[02:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10463.26s)]
*  that seems very likely impossible. [[02:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10464.74s)]
*  That seems more likely than aliens visiting us. [[02:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10466.94s)]
*  But there's more than one incident. [[02:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10471.14s)]
*  And there's a lot of these things. [[02:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10473.78s)]
*  And the possibility of alien life in the universe, [[02:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10475.26s)]
*  although we've never experienced it, seems rational. [[02:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10478.14s)]
*  It seems very rational. [[02:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10481.22s)]
*  And if you were gonna study an emerging civilization [[02:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10482.54s)]
*  that is both primitive and warlike [[02:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10486.78s)]
*  and yet insanely technologically advanced [[02:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10489.22s)]
*  to the point where they have nuclear weapons, [[02:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10492.06s)]
*  they can transmit video through the sky, [[02:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10493.66s)]
*  they have propaganda, they have tracking of their citizens, [[02:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10495.619999999999s)]
*  that's us, that's us right now. [[02:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10499.06s)]
*  And while we are these territorial primal beings [[02:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10501.74s)]
*  with fucking nuclear weapons, this would be a good time [[02:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10505.74s)]
*  to start exposing yourself and to stop this nonsense. [[02:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10509.619999999999s)]
*  Insanity. [[02:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10513.38s)]
*  Yeah, and look, the reason why we named the rooms [[02:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10514.22s)]
*  at our club Fat Man and Little Boy [[02:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10517.34s)]
*  is because in UFO lore, that's when they started showing up. [[02:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10519.82s)]
*  After the detonation of the atomic bombs in Japan, [[02:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10523.539999999999s)]
*  that's when the UFO sightings ramped up. [[02:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10525.98s)]
*  And they ramped up mostly in the US, right? [[02:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10528.94s)]
*  Yes. [[02:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10531.1s)]
*  So that's interesting, [[02:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10531.94s)]
*  because the US was the one with the nuclear power. [[02:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10532.76s)]
*  And we were the one who was doing a lot of fucking testing. [[02:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10535.34s)]
*  And also we have all these military bases. [[02:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10538.619999999999s)]
*  Who the fuck has more military bases than us? [[02:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10541.14s)]
*  Who has more nuclear weapons pointed [[02:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10543.699999999999s)]
*  at other people than us? [[02:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10545.58s)]
*  We have them all over the place. [[02:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10547.06s)]
*  And there's all these multiple sightings [[02:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10549.02s)]
*  and eyewitness accounts of very credible people [[02:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10551.9s)]
*  who say these things have hovered over military bases. [[02:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10554.74s)]
*  It'd be pretty cool if these aliens were benevolent overlords. [[02:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10557.26s)]
*  And they were like, hey, my children. [[02:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10561.82s)]
*  Yeah, or maybe even so advanced intellectually [[02:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10563.3s)]
*  that the concept of an overlord is preposterous. [[02:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10567.58s)]
*  And they're just biological management. [[02:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10570.58s)]
*  They're just the gardeners tending to make sure [[02:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10573.42s)]
*  the weeds don't get out of hand [[02:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10576.9s)]
*  and just let this process continue to play itself out. [[02:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10578.58s)]
*  Because this process of technological innovation [[02:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10581.9s)]
*  is everything that humans do. [[02:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10584.18s)]
*  It's what we do at the pinnacle of our creation [[02:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10588.26s)]
*  is we make better technology. [[02:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10591.699999999999s)]
*  Well, I always wonder about fractals and whether or not, [[02:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10593.38s)]
*  this idea of this being a simulation, [[02:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10596.3s)]
*  this being, we are kind of replicating, [[02:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10598.22s)]
*  we are creating machines and doing our best [[02:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10602.94s)]
*  to create them in our own image, right? [[02:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10605.02s)]
*  And that's interesting. [[02:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10607.300000000001s)]
*  You know, because the mythologies that we subscribe to [[02:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10608.58s)]
*  are the idea that this God that we pray to [[02:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10612.140000000001s)]
*  made us in his image. [[02:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10614.54s)]
*  And we're doing the same thing now with robots and computers. [[02:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10616.02s)]
*  And that's an interesting thing [[02:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10620.78s)]
*  that we seem to have this sort of paradigm, [[02:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10622.5s)]
*  this idea that that's the scaffolding [[02:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10627.460000000001s)]
*  for the way we think, right? [[02:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10631.02s)]
*  And to what end? [[02:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10632.740000000002s)]
*  And why are we doing that? [[02:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10633.980000000001s)]
*  Maybe it's the creation of a new life form. [[02:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10635.74s)]
*  But has it already happened? [[02:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10637.66s)]
*  Are we the result of that impulse [[02:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10639.06s)]
*  that happened way longer, a long time ago? [[02:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10646.1s)]
*  I think we are the shit throwing chimps [[02:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10648.26s)]
*  that are gonna become the nuclear physicists. [[02:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10650.699999999999s)]
*  That's what I mean. [[02:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10652.58s)]
*  We are the shit throwing chimps from 2001 [[02:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10653.42s)]
*  that become Oppenheimer. [[02:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10655.5s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[02:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10656.619999999999s)]
*  And then I think this thing that we become [[02:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10657.5s)]
*  is integrated with technology. [[02:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10659.539999999999s)]
*  It's probably some sort of a hybrid. [[02:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10661.3s)]
*  It's some sort of a cyborg. [[02:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10663.18s)]
*  That's wild. [[02:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10664.619999999999s)]
*  Because I think we're already on the verge of merging. [[02:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10666.3s)]
*  All this talk of Neuralink and all these various things. [[02:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10669.38s)]
*  We watched this video the other day of this guy [[02:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10672.339999999998s)]
*  who was Googling questions and getting answers in his head [[02:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10674.099999999999s)]
*  with his headpiece on. [[02:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10677.82s)]
*  Have you seen that thing? [[02:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10678.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10679.5s)]
*  That's so crazy. [[02:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10680.339999999998s)]
*  Incredible. [[02:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10681.179999999998s)]
*  So how long before that is, that's Pong. [[02:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10682.019999999999s)]
*  I know. [[02:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10686.419999999998s)]
*  But that's- [[02:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10687.259999999998s)]
*  And then you have the Unreal 4 engine in 2023 [[02:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10688.099999999999s)]
*  that looks like a movie. [[02:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10690.619999999999s)]
*  How long before that technology gets to the point [[02:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10691.98s)]
*  where it's just supremely advanced? [[02:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10694.7s)]
*  And we literally are like gods. [[02:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10697.220000000001s)]
*  But my question really is also the idea [[02:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10698.980000000001s)]
*  that that's engineering, right? [[02:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10700.900000000001s)]
*  That's a tool. [[02:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10702.86s)]
*  It's innovation. [[02:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10703.7s)]
*  But there's engineering. [[02:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10704.54s)]
*  So there are two aspects to it. [[02:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10706.740000000002s)]
*  One is getting information faster and stuff, [[02:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10708.380000000001s)]
*  which doesn't get you close to the truth, [[02:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10711.5s)]
*  but it gets you information faster. [[02:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10712.66s)]
*  There are endless facts. [[02:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10714.1s)]
*  But more importantly, I always wonder [[02:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10715.34s)]
*  why we are given this. [[02:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10719.900000000001s)]
*  I really believe that human potential [[02:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10721.58s)]
*  is pretty much infinite. [[02:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10723.26s)]
*  Whatever you can imagine and beyond, we can do. [[02:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10724.7s)]
*  And we are doing. [[02:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10727.62s)]
*  We seem to be doing this. [[02:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10728.58s)]
*  Think about how crazy that is. [[02:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10729.98s)]
*  I can wear a headset and I can do things with my mind [[02:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10731.14s)]
*  and look up the answer. [[02:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10733.9s)]
*  That's insane. [[02:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10735.1s)]
*  That's magic. [[02:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10736.18s)]
*  It's crazier than magic. [[02:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10737.98s)]
*  But there's a way to measure that and quantify that [[02:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10739.5s)]
*  and replicate that. [[02:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10741.74s)]
*  So it's not magic. [[02:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10743.06s)]
*  I can do it and I can tell you exactly how I get there, [[02:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10744.300000000001s)]
*  which is even crazier. [[02:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10746.5s)]
*  So what is that leading us to? [[02:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10748.14s)]
*  It is nudging us closer. [[02:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10752.1s)]
*  I think it's very significant [[02:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10753.82s)]
*  that we're getting a better understanding [[02:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10755.98s)]
*  of what it's like to be someone else. [[02:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10757.66s)]
*  We are. [[02:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10759.7s)]
*  It's really hard to say that a Yanomami Indian [[02:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10760.54s)]
*  or whoever it might be, [[02:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10764.98s)]
*  thinks about things differently than I do [[02:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10766.42s)]
*  when I know so much about how all these human beings, [[02:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10769.300000000001s)]
*  like someone in Iran, someone in Jordan, [[02:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10773.02s)]
*  laughs and cries and bleeds at the same thing I do. [[02:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10777.46s)]
*  Being prejudiced based on what that person looks like [[02:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10785.779999999999s)]
*  over there is becoming harder and harder to justify. [[02:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10788.859999999999s)]
*  Where it was before we knew about that, [[02:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10791.58s)]
*  we were like, well, those people over there [[02:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10793.099999999999s)]
*  are quote unquote savages or they're this, that, [[02:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10794.339999999998s)]
*  and the other thing. [[02:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10796.74s)]
*  And I do think that we are getting a better understanding [[02:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10797.58s)]
*  of what it's like to be each other [[02:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10799.46s)]
*  and being nudged in the same direction. [[03:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10800.82s)]
*  I'm not saying we don't become tribal. [[03:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10803.14s)]
*  I think that's true too. [[03:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10804.98s)]
*  But why? [[03:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10805.82s)]
*  And it's interesting to think about where that's leading us. [[03:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10806.66s)]
*  To what understanding? [[03:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10810.82s)]
*  To what understanding? [[03:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10812.5s)]
*  And then when we have that understanding, [[03:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10813.82s)]
*  what are we gonna do about that? [[03:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10815.14s)]
*  Right, and are we gonna pull it together? [[03:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10816.46s)]
*  And are the aliens here to make sure [[03:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10818.58s)]
*  that we don't fuck it up? [[03:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10819.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10821.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10822.619999999999s)]
*  That's the beautiful idea. [[03:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10823.46s)]
*  The terrible idea is that it's all us. [[03:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10824.94s)]
*  And then it's all the big ruse [[03:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10827.22s)]
*  and it's all just drones that we're doing [[03:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10828.779999999999s)]
*  because we don't want China and Russia to know about it, [[03:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10830.66s)]
*  but we have insane propulsion systems [[03:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10832.54s)]
*  that operate on gravity and. [[03:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10835.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10837.78s)]
*  I think it is us. [[03:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10839.26s)]
*  But it seems like both. [[03:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10840.22s)]
*  It seems like us and it also seems like [[03:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10843.86s)]
*  there's some shit that we just don't understand. [[03:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10846.82s)]
*  And I don't know if those people are telling the truth. [[03:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10850.26s)]
*  Because if the people that are telling the truth, [[03:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10853.02s)]
*  that there's biological entities, [[03:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10854.7s)]
*  and this is what Jackie Gleason said that Nixon told him, [[03:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10856.86s)]
*  and Nixon took him on, they were drinking. [[03:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10860.060000000001s)]
*  You know that famous story? [[03:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10862.54s)]
*  No. [[03:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10863.460000000001s)]
*  Who knows if it's true? [[03:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10864.300000000001s)]
*  It's a legend. [[03:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10865.140000000001s)]
*  But the legend is that Jackie Gleason [[03:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10866.380000000001s)]
*  and Nixon were drinking. [[03:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10868.060000000001s)]
*  And that Nixon said, [[03:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10869.42s)]
*  you wanna see some fucking aliens? [[03:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10870.58s)]
*  And they get on Air Force One [[03:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10872.140000000001s)]
*  and they fly to some Air Force base [[03:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10874.5s)]
*  and they go to a place where they have a crashed UFO [[03:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10876.78s)]
*  and they have biological beings that are in freezers. [[03:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10881.5s)]
*  And Jackie Gleason sees this. [[03:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10884.74s)]
*  And Jackie Gleason after that has a house built [[03:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10886.140000000001s)]
*  in upstate New York that looks like a UFO. [[03:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10888.78s)]
*  He became obsessed with UFOs after that. [[03:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10891.220000000001s)]
*  There was a house, it was actually for sale at one point. [[03:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10893.5s)]
*  Yeah, so he has this house that he had shaped like a UFO. [[03:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10896.060000000001s)]
*  And this is like, who knows if this is a true story. [[03:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10899.94s)]
*  Because it was kind of sort of disputed, [[03:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10903.140000000001s)]
*  his ex-wife told the story or something like that. [[03:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10905.5s)]
*  I forget. [[03:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10907.18s)]
*  I think that kind of thing [[03:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10908.02s)]
*  is actually impossible to keep secret. [[03:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10910.94s)]
*  No, I don't think so. [[03:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10913.18s)]
*  Really? [[03:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10914.02s)]
*  No, I don't think so at all. [[03:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10914.86s)]
*  You think generations of government bureaucrats [[03:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10915.7s)]
*  can keep something a secret? [[03:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10918.539999999999s)]
*  Sure, they tell the people at the very highest level [[03:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10919.66s)]
*  know about it, it's very few people, [[03:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10923.42s)]
*  it's all very compartmentalized. [[03:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10924.98s)]
*  They monitor everyone's phone calls, everyone's emails, [[03:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10926.74s)]
*  everything everyone does. [[03:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10930.179999999998s)]
*  At a top secret clearance level? [[03:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10932.019999999999s)]
*  No way. [[03:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10933.699999999999s)]
*  I don't think you're right. [[03:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10934.539999999999s)]
*  Totally impossible. [[03:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10935.359999999999s)]
*  You're definitely not right. [[03:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10936.199999999999s)]
*  I think it's impossible. [[03:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10937.14s)]
*  Listen man, they can keep secrets. [[03:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10938.22s)]
*  When? [[03:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10939.66s)]
*  People at high levels of military can keep secrets. [[03:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10940.5s)]
*  Yeah, but they're always rotating out. [[03:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10942.06s)]
*  They're retiring, they're dying. [[03:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10943.14s)]
*  Yeah, they probably want to fucking Hillary Clinton [[03:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10944.3s)]
*  and a lot of those dudes. [[03:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10946.42s)]
*  Hey listen dude, this is not conspiracy social club. [[03:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10948.66s)]
*  This is the Joe Rogan experience. [[03:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10953.3s)]
*  I am not willing to relinquish the idea [[03:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10954.699999999999s)]
*  that they can keep that secret. [[03:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10958.38s)]
*  Well that's because it's fun to believe in. [[03:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10959.339999999998s)]
*  Yeah, but it's not just fun to believe in. [[03:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10960.9s)]
*  It is possible. [[03:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10962.58s)]
*  It's a physically possible thing to do. [[03:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10963.779999999999s)]
*  Especially if you have the right people [[03:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10966.14s)]
*  and they're indoctrinated in the right way [[03:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10968.099999999999s)]
*  with top secret clearance. [[03:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10970.099999999999s)]
*  By the way, it's not like these people [[03:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10971.779999999999s)]
*  don't tell their friends. [[03:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10972.98s)]
*  And it's not like there's a bunch of stories [[03:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10974.14s)]
*  floating around, because there are. [[03:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10975.539999999999s)]
*  There's a shit load of stories floating around. [[03:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10976.58s)]
*  I would never keep that a secret. [[03:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10979.02s)]
*  I'd be like hey, hey, you have fucking aliens. [[03:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10980.94s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[03:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10982.94s)]
*  When you have senators and congressmen [[03:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10983.78s)]
*  who find out about this, and they find out [[03:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10985.78s)]
*  that military contractors are the ones [[03:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10987.5s)]
*  who have access to this stuff, [[03:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10989.26s)]
*  because the back engineering program [[03:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10990.66s)]
*  has to involve someone who has the capability [[03:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10992.42s)]
*  of recreating this. [[03:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10994.380000000001s)]
*  So who would that be? [[03:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10995.460000000001s)]
*  That would be the people that make jets. [[03:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10996.300000000001s)]
*  If you've got someone who's making you [[03:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10997.7s)]
*  a fucking stealth bomber, and you have a crashed UFO, [[03:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=10998.74s)]
*  those are the people that you want discussing [[03:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=11003.18s)]
*  what kind of things you've recovered [[03:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=11006.26s)]
*  from a fucking alien crash, and can this be replicated? [[03:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=11007.98s)]
*  No, here's the problem with your whole theory. [[03:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=11010.9s)]
*  Don't you know me, motherfucker, [[03:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=11012.06s)]
*  because you don't know. [[03:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=11013.5s)]
*  You might be wrong. [[03:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=11014.34s)]
*  This is your wrong, no. [[03:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=11015.16s)]
*  No, no, no, don't say you're wrong, [[03:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=11016.0s)]
*  because you don't know that I'm wrong. [[03:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=11016.98s)]
*  This is the problem with your theory, ready? [[03:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=11017.82s)]
*  Okay, go ahead. [[03:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=11019.26s)]
*  I'm sorry, and I love that you want to believe in this, [[03:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=11020.099999999999s)]
*  and so do I, but here's the problem. [[03:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=11021.74s)]
*  There's no law, there's no written law, [[03:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=11023.46s)]
*  that says I'm not allowed to talk about aliens. [[03:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=11025.779999999999s)]
*  And I mean at the level, the top levels of clearance, [[03:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=11028.539999999999s)]
*  like the most secret level, there is no world [[03:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=11031.58s)]
*  where if I'm a government official, [[03:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=11035.140000000001s)]
*  and I take a bunch of pictures, [[03:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=11036.74s)]
*  and I come before Congress, and I go, [[03:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=11038.140000000001s)]
*  here's my evidence, I'm blowing the whistle, [[03:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=11040.06s)]
*  there are real aliens. [[03:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=11043.220000000001s)]
*  You don't think they would go after you for [[03:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=11044.220000000001s)]
*  violating your top secret clearance? [[03:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=11045.78s)]
*  No, because it's not violating my top secret clearance. [[03:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=11047.98s)]
*  But it would be. [[03:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=11050.02s)]
*  Nope, because I'd never go to jail for that. [[03:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=11050.86s)]
*  Because I'd be like, you're gonna put me in jail [[03:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=11052.82s)]
*  for exposing what everybody wants to know? [[03:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=11055.42s)]
*  The whole world would be like, holy shit, [[03:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=11057.32s)]
*  you guys kept this a secret? [[03:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=11059.42s)]
*  But that's assuming that you have access to that material [[03:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=11060.26s)]
*  to extract it from wherever the people, [[03:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=11062.62s)]
*  maybe not. [[03:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=11065.1s)]
*  Maybe those are the kind of people [[03:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=11066.18s)]
*  that wouldn't do that, Brian. [[03:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=11067.26s)]
*  Listen, my friend. [[03:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=11068.54s)]

*  these establishment talking points. [[03:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkr0DSgnQU&t=11078.220000000001s)]
