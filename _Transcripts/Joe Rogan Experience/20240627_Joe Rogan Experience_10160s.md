# Joe Rogan Experience #1964 - Rick Doblin
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by Dave, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5.82s)]
*  Hello Rick, good to see you again my friend, how are you? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=10.48s)]
*  Yeah, I'm doing great. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=15.72s)]
*  It was so nice to be with you a couple weeks ago. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=16.72s)]
*  Yeah, it was fun to have you at the club. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=18.96s)]
*  You were there like one of the first days. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=21.52s)]
*  Yeah, I think I saw the first event in the small room. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=23.16s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=27.2s)]
*  Yeah, did you see Dave Chappelle? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=28.68s)]
*  I did. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=30.0s)]
*  Yeah, that was the first one. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=31.0s)]
*  Yeah, we had Dave there. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=32.0s)]
*  He wanted to do that room. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=33.0s)]
*  We opened it specifically for him. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=34.0s)]
*  That was the first time we did a show there. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=35.96s)]
*  It was very exciting. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=37.879999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I really liked having the opportunity to talk to him a little bit afterwards and [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=38.879999999999995s)]
*  to listen to him. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=42.56s)]
*  It was hilarious. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=44.239999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, he's a big fan of what you guys are doing. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=45.239999999999995s)]
*  As is everybody. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=48.28s)]
*  You know, I think what you guys are doing at MAPS is one of the most important things [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=49.28s)]
*  for society and culture and just consciousness in general that's happening today. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=54.0s)]
*  And I'm very, very happy that you're doing that. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=60.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=62.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=63.28s)]
*  Yeah, I'm pretty extremely lucky that 51 years ago when I was 18 in 1972 and I decided to [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=64.28s)]
*  focus my life on psychedelics that now I'm 69 all these years later and it still makes [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=70.6s)]
*  sense. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=75.92s)]
*  Well, back then it must have been a big risk because in the 1970s when you focused your [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=76.92s)]
*  life on psychedelics, that was like right after that whole sweeping schedule one psychedelics [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=82.36s)]
*  act was passed, right? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=87.75999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that was in 1970. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=88.96s)]
*  Yeah, things look grim. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=90.44s)]
*  Didn't look good. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=92.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=93.16s)]
*  Well, I was a draft resistor. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=94.16s)]
*  I thought that I would serve my country by going to jail, which is kind of a funny way [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=96.96s)]
*  to say it. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=102.19999999999999s)]
*  But I had felt that I'm not a conscientious objector. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=103.19999999999999s)]
*  In order to do that, you have to be a pacifist. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=107.19999999999999s)]
*  And so I'm not a pacifist. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=110.17999999999999s)]
*  I think there are sometimes you need to fight and defend yourselves. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=111.72s)]
*  So the only options for me as I studied how to respond to Vietnam was to I didn't want [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=116.0s)]
*  to pretend I had bone spurs or run away to Canada or anything like that. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=124.0s)]
*  And I studied Tolstoy and Gandhi and nonviolent resistance and decided that the thing that [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=131.12s)]
*  I would do would be to not register for the draft. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=137.92s)]
*  And I was paying taxes. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=141.96s)]
*  I had a social security number. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=143.35999999999999s)]
*  I had a driver's license. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=145.12s)]
*  I was in high school. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=146.88s)]
*  I figured the government knows who I am and knows where I am and knows my age. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=148.68s)]
*  And so I assumed that I would go to jail and that that would be a way to drain the system [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=153.35999999999999s)]
*  of energy and to register my protest that way. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=158.72s)]
*  Martin Luther King actually said a great thing. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=162.56s)]
*  He said the person that thinks the law is unjust and violates it and is willing to [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=164.08s)]
*  suffer the consequences as an example to others about the unjust nature of the law actually [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=168.32000000000002s)]
*  has the highest respect for the law. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=174.0s)]
*  He was trying to reframe civil disobedience as patriotism. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=177.0s)]
*  And it made sense to me. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=181.28s)]
*  And so when I talked to my parents about it, they were like, well, OK, you know, we don't [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=182.46s)]
*  think you should go to Vietnam either. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=186.96s)]
*  We don't think it's in America's best interest. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=188.60000000000002s)]
*  That you're never going to be a doctor or lawyer. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=192.08s)]
*  My dad was a doctor because you'll be a felon. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=194.0s)]
*  And I'm like, that's a price I'll have to pay. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=196.64000000000001s)]
*  What am I going to do with my life? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=199.0s)]
*  I can't have a normal job in a way. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=201.0s)]
*  So then when I stumbled on psychedelics, I was like, great, I could be an underground [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=203.4s)]
*  psychedelic therapist that doesn't need a license. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=208.24s)]
*  Whatever happened? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=211.96s)]
*  Did you wind up getting in trouble? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=212.96s)]
*  No, it's astonishing. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=213.96s)]
*  I think a lot of times we overestimate the efficiency of the government. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=215.8s)]
*  So nothing happened at all. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=221.04s)]
*  I mean, I turned 18. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=224.08s)]
*  Later was the lottery. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=226.76000000000002s)]
*  I did have a higher lottery number, but nothing ever happened. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=227.76000000000002s)]
*  And I just was shocked by that. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=231.48000000000002s)]
*  And later what happened was that Jimmy Carter, on his first day in office, he pardoned all [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=233.6s)]
*  the draft resistors. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=238.68s)]
*  And that made me sort of move from my identification as a counterculture drug using criminal to [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=240.96s)]
*  somebody who wasn't quite a criminal in that same way. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=246.9s)]
*  What year was that? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=250.38s)]
*  76? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=251.38s)]
*  Yeah, well, as soon as he got inaugurated, 77, when he did that, the first day in office. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=252.38s)]
*  And I later read there was about 60,000 people that never registered for the draft. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=258.26s)]
*  But enough people were going in that they were able to find enough bodies and people [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=262.78000000000003s)]
*  to send to Vietnam. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=269.18s)]
*  Yeah, it's one of the rare military operations in history that's universally regarded as [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=270.82s)]
*  a terrible thing. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=278.46s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=279.94s)]
*  I mean, nobody today defends the Vietnam War. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=280.94s)]
*  There's still some people that think it was a good idea that we got Saddam Hussein out [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=283.78000000000003s)]
*  of power despite all the horrible collateral damage and the million people that are innocent [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=287.62s)]
*  that wound up dying in Iraq because of that invasion. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=294.14s)]
*  But nobody thinks Vietnam was good. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=296.62s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=299.65999999999997s)]
*  It was starting to be this imperial overreach. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=300.65999999999997s)]
*  And we've had a fair amount of that. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=305.02s)]
*  Based on a false flag. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=306.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=308.41999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, which is very scary. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=309.41999999999996s)]
*  It's very scary that that was just, you know, 1960s. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=311.47999999999996s)]
*  It just happened. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=313.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=314.9s)]
*  Well, one of the people also quite interested and supportive of psychedelic therapy is Daniel [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=315.9s)]
*  Ellsberg, who was the person that released the Pentagon Papers. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=319.85999999999996s)]
*  But the false flag began with the Gulf of Tonkin incident. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=324.21999999999997s)]
*  And so we're we we're told that our ships were being attacked. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=327.42s)]
*  And he was I've gotten to spend some time talking to him. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=332.06s)]
*  And he said that he had just started the National Security Administration at that time was looking [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=336.34s)]
*  at some of these cables and realized it didn't make sense. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=342.94s)]
*  But he thought somebody above him knew more than he did. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=346.62s)]
*  And he didn't feel like he should say anything about it. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=349.38s)]
*  And then all these years later, when he released the Pentagon Papers and people think of him [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=352.94s)]
*  as a hero because he was willing to go to jail for decades and decades, potentially [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=357.98s)]
*  the rest of his life, which is what the government was trying to do for him, went all the way [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=362.14s)]
*  up to the Supreme Court and he won the case. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=365.92s)]
*  Or the New York Times also won the case. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=368.58s)]
*  But he thinks of himself not just as a hero, but that he should have had more courage early [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=371.26s)]
*  on. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=376.74s)]
*  And if he would have done something early on, maybe more people would have realized [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=377.86s)]
*  that this wasn't the way the government was saying it was. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=382.14s)]
*  But I do think that there is patriotism in civil disobedience. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=386.34s)]
*  Yeah, certainly. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=391.41999999999996s)]
*  Especially when you feel it's morally wrong to participate in whatever this thing that [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=394.14s)]
*  you're being obligated to do. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=398.65999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=400.38s)]
*  And I think it's really remarkable for me now that because I was not a pacifist and [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=401.38s)]
*  a conscient subjector, I always felt that the freedom that I had was defended by our [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=407.34s)]
*  military in World War II. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=413.65999999999997s)]
*  If we had lost and I'm Jewish, I probably would have been killed along with others. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=415.7s)]
*  So I always felt that the military was essential and it was protecting my freedom. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=420.09999999999997s)]
*  And so now all these years later, to have so much work to be done with veterans and [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=425.94s)]
*  the veterans administrations and with special operators and all sorts of people with PTSD, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=432.41999999999996s)]
*  it feels right in a way that a draft resister should form an alliance with suffering veterans. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=440.02s)]
*  Yeah I think that's one of the best aspects, at least publicly, of what you guys are doing [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=448.7s)]
*  is that you are working with all these soldiers. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=455.26s)]
*  And so you've got a lot of support from people that traditionally wouldn't be invested in [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=458.42s)]
*  psychedelics, which has really kind of opened up. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=463.1s)]
*  It used to be that a lot of people on the right thought of psychedelics as a way to [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=466.18s)]
*  waste your life and you're going to be a hippie and a loser. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=470.38s)]
*  But because of the benefits that it's been showing to people with PTSD and people coming [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=473.90000000000003s)]
*  back from all these various foreign conflicts, then now you're getting support from veterans. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=478.72s)]
*  You're getting support from the people on the right and people that know veterans that [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=486.14s)]
*  have had incredible experiences with psychedelics, where it's completely changed their life and [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=489.34s)]
*  sort of reset their mind. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=494.14s)]
*  Yeah, just several days ago I was in Nashville with Sean Ryan doing his podcast and he is [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=495.86s)]
*  a former Navy SEAL and CIA contractor. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=502.38s)]
*  And he was just talking about how much he had benefited from his experience with Ibogaine [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=506.5s)]
*  in Mexico and how it's changed his views about things. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=511.58s)]
*  And we've heard this a lot. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=516.26s)]
*  But he still said that if he were to be attacked, if America was to be attacked, he would defend [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=517.74s)]
*  it. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=522.66s)]
*  It doesn't turn people again into pacifists necessarily in that same way. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=523.66s)]
*  And there's something noble and honorable about willing to serve your country and be willing [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=528.12s)]
*  to give your life to protect others. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=532.18s)]
*  I think it's a problem in some cases when the political leadership makes terrible choices [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=535.1s)]
*  and you've enlisted to do that. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=540.74s)]
*  But I think the other part, last week I was in Dallas and we had an event that Governor [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=542.6999999999999s)]
*  Rick Perry attended and Marcus Capone and Jeff George, who's the chair of the board [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=549.6999999999999s)]
*  of directors of our MAPS Public Benefit Corp. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=556.86s)]
*  And then also Amy Emerson, who's the CEO of that. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=560.78s)]
*  And we have Governor Perry's support because he's heard from so many veterans. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=563.4599999999999s)]
*  He's also talked about Marcus Luttrell, who lived with him at the State House when he [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=569.54s)]
*  was very emotionally damaged from his time in the military. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=575.38s)]
*  And then he saw Marcus get a lot better when he went down to Mexico and got Ibogaine. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=579.9399999999999s)]
*  And so Governor Perry, there's people that I have never thought that I would find common [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=586.3399999999999s)]
*  ground with. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=591.38s)]
*  And one of the ones that I thought was the most far that I couldn't imagine building [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=592.98s)]
*  a bridge. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=598.16s)]
*  One of our themes is be the bridge. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=599.78s)]
*  But it was with Ted Nugent. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=601.9599999999999s)]
*  And I thought, you know, how would I build a bridge with Ted Nugent? [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=604.1999999999999s)]
*  Well, Rocco Moon, his son, connected us. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=610.16s)]
*  And Rocco is interested in being a psychedelic therapist. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=614.9599999999999s)]
*  And he's been doing a lot of work educating his dad. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=619.42s)]
*  And we had a really remarkable conversation. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=623.3399999999999s)]
*  Ted actually said that he could be extremely effective for helping us because he's known [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=626.88s)]
*  as being so anti-drug. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=632.6s)]
*  And yet he can see, even he can see that in a therapeutic setting for veterans, that's [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=635.68s)]
*  what he cares about the most, but others, that these things can be helpful. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=641.08s)]
*  So this idea of building bridges. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=644.92s)]
*  There was one point in time, one of the most important lessons I learned was actually from [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=648.3199999999999s)]
*  a Supreme Court justice where I was sitting next to him at Passover Seder and Passover. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=656.12s)]
*  This is Stephen Breyer. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=661.92s)]
*  And I had accepted a donation from Rebecca Mercer. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=663.9399999999999s)]
*  Now Rebecca Mercer, her father and she, they own Cambridge Analytica, they own Breitbart. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=668.9599999999999s)]
*  You know, she's very much a supporter of Republican causes. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=674.8399999999999s)]
*  And she gave us a million dollars and said that it was restricted to use in veterans. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=679.5999999999999s)]
*  And I thought this is really a good thing to do to take this. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=685.52s)]
*  But I've gotten more criticism from taking that donation from Rebecca Mercer than most [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=689.72s)]
*  anything I've done in the entire 37 years of MAPS. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=694.6s)]
*  And so at this Passover Seder, I was sitting, my wife and I got there late, our friends [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=697.96s)]
*  were somewhere else. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=702.6999999999999s)]
*  There was this old couple sitting next to us and I didn't know who they were. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=703.6999999999999s)]
*  And I thought, oh, this will be boring, you know. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=708.12s)]
*  And so I talked to this guy and I said, well, everybody else was pretty much scientists. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=710.1s)]
*  And I said, are you a scientist? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=713.8s)]
*  He said, no, I'm a judge. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=716.24s)]
*  And then his wife started talking about how she had written a book about grieving parents [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=717.8399999999999s)]
*  who have illnesses that their kids have, fatal illnesses, and how to handle grief. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=723.0s)]
*  And so we had this incredible conversation about MDMA therapy and about how it can be [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=729.0s)]
*  helpful for grief and all. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=734.28s)]
*  And then after hours, Passover Seder, take hours and hours, I finally realized that there [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=736.04s)]
*  was something more going on. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=741.52s)]
*  And I thought, this guy is not just a judge. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=743.6s)]
*  I think he's Stephen Breyer, the Supreme Court judge. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=746.92s)]
*  And I said, are you Stephen Breyer? [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=750.04s)]
*  And he said, yes. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=752.0799999999999s)]
*  And I said, well, I have an ethical question to ask you. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=754.0s)]
*  You know, I have taken this resources from Rebecca Mercer and she's very much supporting [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=758.0799999999999s)]
*  Trump and supporting Bannon and others. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=763.6s)]
*  What do you think about that choice ethically? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=766.9200000000001s)]
*  Was that a wise idea? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=769.0400000000001s)]
*  And he said that the essence of democracy is trying to find common ground with people [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=771.7s)]
*  with whom you may disagree on everything else. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=778.6s)]
*  And he said, in our hyper partisan polarized world, there's not nearly enough of that. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=781.32s)]
*  And so he supported that. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=786.8000000000001s)]
*  And so I felt that that was like the judgment of the Supreme Court. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=787.96s)]
*  It was okay what I did. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=791.5200000000001s)]
*  At least one. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=793.24s)]
*  At least one. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=794.24s)]
*  But I like that concept is that we need to find common ground. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=795.64s)]
*  I mean, I thought that was one of the things that Dave Chappelle was saying. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=799.8s)]
*  And you know, I thought it was very interesting. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=802.76s)]
*  Dave is he very much is in tune with that and speaks about that all the time. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=805.08s)]
*  It's very important to him because there's just it's just too easy to just dig in your [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=809.08s)]
*  heels and embrace the conflict and push away any ideas that are connected to the other [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=813.88s)]
*  side. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=819.88s)]
*  You can get someone who's a Republican, who's a Trump supporter to engage in psychedelics, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=820.88s)]
*  understand the benefits of psychedelics for whether it's for soldiers or whether it's [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=826.6s)]
*  for grieving parents or anyone. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=830.98s)]
*  If that can make it into their life and perhaps they can have an experience. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=833.4s)]
*  I think a psychedelic experience is one of the greatest ways that someone can relax any [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=838.28s)]
*  dogmatic ideas that they might have that restrict them from taking in some of the opinions of [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=846.2s)]
*  the left. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=851.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=852.84s)]
*  Would you feel comfortable sharing some of your own experiences? [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=853.84s)]
*  Well, I've never been a right wing person. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=856.76s)]
*  I'm very left wing for the most part, other than support for the Second Amendment and [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=859.88s)]
*  some some other things and just a general distrust of government. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=865.44s)]
*  I was raised by hippies. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=872.08s)]
*  I lived in San Francisco during the Vietnam War when I was a little kid. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=876.9200000000001s)]
*  My stepdad had long hair when I was a kid. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=883.1600000000001s)]
*  But then I also grew up and I was a fighter. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=889.2s)]
*  So I was always around these hard nosed, very tough, no-nonsense people. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=892.0s)]
*  And a lot of them were very right wing. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=898.8000000000001s)]
*  I knew a lot of cops from martial arts. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=901.36s)]
*  And people have these ideas about what drugs are and that blanket term, which I really [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=903.24s)]
*  don't like the term drugs and drug users, what drug users are. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=909.8000000000001s)]
*  And one of the things that I'm kind of proud of is that if anybody wants to say that people [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=914.84s)]
*  who enjoy psychedelics or people that enjoy marijuana are lazy and they don't contribute [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=920.72s)]
*  or they don't like, what about me? [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=927.6800000000001s)]
*  All right. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=929.44s)]
*  It's on me. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=930.84s)]
*  Like I work hard and I work a lot and I work out a lot. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=931.84s)]
*  And I have a lot of friends that are very much like me. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=934.5600000000001s)]
*  And they're very open minded people that are they embrace all cultures and ideas and all [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=937.2800000000001s)]
*  kinds of different things. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=945.2800000000001s)]
*  But they're also, you know, these hard nosed, determined, very disciplined people that you [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=946.5600000000001s)]
*  would sort of automatically, maybe callously lump in with people who are cruel or unkind [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=953.6s)]
*  or not embracing, you know, other ideas. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=963.36s)]
*  And I just think that these ideas that we have of people, it's so convenient to push [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=967.4s)]
*  people into one category or another. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=974.9200000000001s)]
*  And it's also very convenient to embrace one category and adopt their sort of predetermined [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=977.24s)]
*  pattern of ideas. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=984.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=985.32s)]
*  But would you be comfortable sharing some of your own psychedelic experiences? [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=986.32s)]
*  Sure. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=990.6s)]
*  Sure. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=991.6s)]
*  I mean, the DMT experiences are by far the most profound. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=992.6s)]
*  And those are the ones that have really made me, every time I've done it, it's just completely [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=996.48s)]
*  made me rethink how I interface with people, what life is and what that experience, what [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1003.6800000000001s)]
*  is that? [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1012.6s)]
*  Is that a well of souls you're entering into? [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1013.8000000000001s)]
*  Is it another dimension? [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1016.24s)]
*  Is it some sort of parallel dimension of disembodied consciousness that you seem to be engaging [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1018.08s)]
*  with life forms, with things that know you, that can see your thoughts and see resistance [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1027.04s)]
*  and see bullshit in you? [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1034.48s)]
*  I mean, it's every time I've done it, it's sort of just like in one way or another, just [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1036.28s)]
*  removed one layer of the onion, you know, one layer of bullshit that keeps you from [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1042.72s)]
*  just embracing the great mystery of this existence, whatever it is. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1048.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1054.12s)]
*  And it's built on these layers and layers of billions of dollars, billions of dollars, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1055.1999999999998s)]
*  billions of years of evolution and sort of from the single cellular organisms. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1058.9199999999998s)]
*  It's all in a still. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1063.84s)]
*  And that our prefrontal cortex, our brain has kind of helped us focus on what we need [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1066.0s)]
*  as humans in our transition from birth to death. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1071.0s)]
*  But that when you sort of, well, we talk about the default mode network, which is sort of [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1074.36s)]
*  the part of the brain that's identified as the sense of self. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1078.9199999999998s)]
*  And the classic psychedelics weaken that part. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1082.1s)]
*  And then more information floods. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1084.52s)]
*  So I think we can get back through all of the intercellular knowledge that is stored [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1086.08s)]
*  in our bodies and connect with this deeper, unitive sense. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1090.8799999999999s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1096.84s)]
*  Yeah, it's also they help so much to abandon preconceived notions and just sort of we don't [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1097.84s)]
*  realize how much of the way we sort of see ourselves and see the world is kind of a convenient [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1103.76s)]
*  set of armor that we put on to try to protect us from uncomfortable thoughts and protect [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1112.8000000000002s)]
*  us from, you know, just just mystery, the mystery of. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1118.2s)]
*  But there is a lot of mystery in life. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1123.96s)]
*  It's mostly mystery. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1126.1200000000001s)]
*  You know, and I think psychedelics are the greatest mystery. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1127.88s)]
*  And there's something about them that's just the idea that it exists, that you can smoke [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1131.24s)]
*  and then 15 seconds later be transported into an impossible realm and that that exists. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1137.56s)]
*  And no one's discussing it. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1144.2s)]
*  Every day on the news, they're talking about a million different things that seem so trivial [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1146.96s)]
*  once you've had a DMT experience. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1152.56s)]
*  Yeah, you're reminding me of my five MEO DMT experience that I had. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1154.2s)]
*  And it felt like I went sort of back to the moment of creation. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1159.08s)]
*  But that I realized that so much of our life is patterns, like you're saying, that we [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1164.04s)]
*  have these habits and we have these patterns and we take them as fixed, but they're not [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1168.32s)]
*  actually fixed. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1173.04s)]
*  We have put them into motion. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1174.04s)]
*  And this five MEO, by bringing me back to this moment of creation, it helped me realize [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1176.2s)]
*  that the new can enter at any moment, that there's a way. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1181.72s)]
*  And so I've I've actually felt that that experience has, which I had one time back in 1985, has [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1185.92s)]
*  been a big part of our success to get to the place that we're at now with psychedelic research, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1192.1599999999999s)]
*  with MDMA therapy, because it helped me to realize that whenever I felt blocked or stuck, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1200.28s)]
*  that I could try to find something new to enter into the picture, that there's this [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1206.36s)]
*  perpetual ability to connect with creation, to connect with the new. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1211.32s)]
*  And so much of our life is on cruise control, is on these patterns. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1215.9199999999998s)]
*  It's easier to do it that way. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1220.0s)]
*  And there's advantages to that. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1222.0400000000002s)]
*  So we don't have to rethink things all the time, but it also narrows our vision. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1223.44s)]
*  Yeah, it very much so does. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1227.5600000000002s)]
*  It's just so easy to fall into patterns. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1229.6000000000001s)]
*  You know, you fall into the patterns of the group that you hang out with, you fall into [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1231.0800000000002s)]
*  patterns of accents and, you know, dress and the way people behave and think about [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1234.48s)]
*  things and the concepts that they adopt. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1240.0s)]
*  And when you have like a real breakthrough psychedelic experience, it just makes all [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1243.2s)]
*  that seem so trivial. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1246.8000000000002s)]
*  My DMT experience, my first five MEO experience, I've done both multiple times, but the [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1249.24s)]
*  first five MEO experience, I thought I fucked up. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1254.88s)]
*  I thought it's over because I can't. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1258.64s)]
*  There was a moment when you're entering into whatever that great white field of [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1260.84s)]
*  geometry is, you know, where where you go, oh, my God, am I dying? [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1268.84s)]
*  Like it feels like there's no way I'm coming back from this. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1273.44s)]
*  Like, like I've gone so far and then that fear, that fear subsided once the experience [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1277.12s)]
*  just fully kicked in. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1285.6s)]
*  Like the fear was at the big, like the doorway to the experience, like, oh, no, what have [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1287.2399999999998s)]
*  I done? [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1292.8s)]
*  And then you go into that with the weirdest thing about five MEO, too, is the lack of [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1293.8s)]
*  visuals. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1300.1999999999998s)]
*  It's just this great white pattern, this thing where you don't have any memory, you don't [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1301.56s)]
*  have any, you're you're barely a conscious entity and you're experiencing what seems [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1309.16s)]
*  to be like the source code of the universe. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1315.0s)]
*  I mean, it's just a gap. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1318.72s)]
*  It's like I felt like I was shot through a rocket to the center of everything. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1320.32s)]
*  And yet there is an aspect of memory and there is an aspect of us paying attention. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1325.96s)]
*  There's still this observer in some ways. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1332.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's pretty it's pretty compromised. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1335.4s)]
*  But there's something that you come back with. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1337.92s)]
*  But it's also very difficult to hold on to. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1340.3600000000001s)]
*  Right? [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1342.28s)]
*  It is. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1343.28s)]
*  And that's this process of integration that's necessary. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1344.28s)]
*  But also for the five MEO, it's so brief. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1346.08s)]
*  So that's where the I began experience can be 12 hours or more or the MDMA experiences. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1348.8s)]
*  And then we make them into eight hour sessions. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1354.42s)]
*  I haven't done Ibogaine. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1356.3000000000002s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I've heard really great things from people that have addiction problems, like [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1357.6200000000001s)]
*  people that are addicted to pills in particular, have gone to Mexico. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1364.22s)]
*  And one of them was my friend, Ed Clay, who went down to Mexico because of a pill problem [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1367.8200000000002s)]
*  he had. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1372.54s)]
*  And then he wound up opening up an Ibogaine center down there once he had been cured of [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1373.54s)]
*  it. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1377.1000000000001s)]
*  There is that phenomenon where people once they get healed, they want to help others. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1378.1000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1381.7s)]
*  And you're in the military, you're trained to leave nobody behind. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1382.78s)]
*  And many people have said that, that once they've gotten help, now they want to bring [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1385.6200000000001s)]
*  all their brothers to have help as well. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1389.7s)]
*  That there's something about this feeling that it can help not just them, but many other [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1392.8600000000001s)]
*  people. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1398.54s)]
*  And I think the other part there's been about why Governor Perry is so interested in a sense [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1399.8600000000001s)]
*  is that there's been now around 800 Navy SEALs and others that have gone down to Mexico for [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1404.5s)]
*  Ibogaine for both PTSD, depression, traumatic brain injury, addiction. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1410.6999999999998s)]
*  And he's heard just remarkable stories. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1416.34s)]
*  But now that you mentioned, or that we're talking about Ibogaine, I just would like [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1418.86s)]
*  to say a bit of we have a mutual friend, Aubrey Marcus, and I've been texting him this morning. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1421.84s)]
*  And it's a bit sad, his father died. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1429.1999999999998s)]
*  And so he's sitting Shiva, which is this Jewish tradition where for a week after someone dies, [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1433.1399999999999s)]
*  you come over to the house and you just mourn for a week. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1439.14s)]
*  So I'll be there tomorrow morning. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1442.14s)]
*  But his father, Michael Marcus, actually helped start Ibogaine research. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1443.6200000000001s)]
*  And so I'd like to explain that just a tiny bit. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1448.44s)]
*  So Michael had studied a bit of holotropic breathwork with Stan Grof. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1450.64s)]
*  So Stanislav Grof is the world's leading LSD researcher. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1456.3400000000001s)]
*  He's almost 92 years old, but he worked at Johns Hopkins. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1459.0200000000002s)]
*  He was did LSD research in the Czech Republic. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1463.5s)]
*  And when the Russians came in in 68 to crush their rebellion, he escaped and came to the [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1466.22s)]
*  U.S. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1470.5s)]
*  But Michael got to know Stan and did work with him where once psychedelics were criminalized, [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1472.3400000000001s)]
*  Stan realized that you can catalyze similar experiences through hyperventilation without [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1479.94s)]
*  a drug. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1485.8600000000001s)]
*  And that, I mean, it is like a drug. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1486.8600000000001s)]
*  It changes the chemistry in your brain. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1489.0600000000002s)]
*  And so I got to know Michael. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1492.04s)]
*  And at one point he was a stock trader and he felt like he was losing his edge. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1494.02s)]
*  And this is probably 15 more years ago. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1500.6599999999999s)]
*  And what he said was he wondered maybe a psychedelic experience could be helpful for him. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1504.12s)]
*  And I suggested Ibogaine. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1510.3999999999999s)]
*  And he went down to Mexico for an Ibogaine experience and it helped him. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1512.48s)]
*  And then he felt like he regained his confidence. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1516.6399999999999s)]
*  And then he bet that there was going to be a massive stock crash. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1519.44s)]
*  He shorted the market and then there was a major crash. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1523.8s)]
*  And then he contacted me and he said this Ibogaine really helped him and he would like [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1528.3200000000002s)]
*  to know how he might pay it back. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1532.3200000000002s)]
*  And I said, well, we've got this project. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1535.74s)]
*  We're trying to start for a long time. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1538.52s)]
*  It's the first project where we're going to look at a clinic in Mexico and test people [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1541.0800000000002s)]
*  do before and after just how are they doing. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1546.04s)]
*  It'd be a long term follow up because Ibogaine for no good reason at all other than the drug [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1548.5600000000002s)]
*  war is illegal in the United States. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1553.64s)]
*  And it's not a drug of abuse. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1556.42s)]
*  It helps treat drug of abuse. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1557.74s)]
*  But it is legal in Mexico and in Canada. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1559.48s)]
*  And so just the day before I had gotten a matching grant offer of $10,000 for a $20,000 [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1562.8600000000001s)]
*  study. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1569.0400000000002s)]
*  And I said, Michael, would you be willing to match this? [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1570.0400000000002s)]
*  And he said, sure. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1574.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1575.4s)]
*  Great. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1576.4s)]
*  Now we're going to have this first Ibogaine study. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1577.4s)]
*  And then he said, what else do you have? [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1578.4s)]
*  And I was like, well, OK, if you want to know more, I'd say the most difficult thing for [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1581.8000000000002s)]
*  us to fund, the most idealistic thing we're doing. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1585.48s)]
*  This was at the time was we're trying to start research in Jordan. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1589.0400000000002s)]
*  We have research in Israel. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1592.8400000000001s)]
*  We have research in Canada. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1594.0400000000002s)]
*  We have research, but we've no research in the Arab countries. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1595.0400000000002s)]
*  And I thought if we could do something in Jordan, and I had incredible connections in [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1598.48s)]
*  Jordan with the mayor of Amman, whose son-in-law actually had found LSD helpful for cluster [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1603.28s)]
*  headaches. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1610.76s)]
*  And anyway, I went to Michael. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1611.76s)]
*  I said, the most idealistic thing, the most far reaching is at this point would be to [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1613.0s)]
*  do this study in Amman. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1617.8s)]
*  And he said, well, how much does that cost? [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1620.12s)]
*  And I said, well, it's about $85,000, something like that, $90,000. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1621.8799999999999s)]
*  And he said, all right, I'll do that too. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1626.96s)]
*  And so that started the first project with Ibogaine. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1629.56s)]
*  And then we eventually did another long-term follow-up in New Zealand. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1634.44s)]
*  And now there are people now, there's a project in Spain with a group called ICERs, and it's [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1637.44s)]
*  to take increasing amounts of Ibogaine to help people withdraw from methadone. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1644.56s)]
*  There's projects in Brazil with Ibogaine. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1649.6399999999999s)]
*  There's a company, Atay, that's one of the for-profit psychedelic companies that's working [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1652.32s)]
*  with Deborah Mass from Demarac. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1658.36s)]
*  They've merged and they're interested in Ibogaine. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1660.9199999999998s)]
*  So Ibogaine is one of the classic examples of disastrous drug policy. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1664.06s)]
*  It turns out that there were LSD dealers in the 60s who got busted, and they happened [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1670.28s)]
*  to have Ibogaine. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1677.8799999999999s)]
*  And so the government made Ibogaine illegal. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1679.1399999999999s)]
*  But these LSD dealers, Howard Lotsoff, was also experimenting with opiates. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1681.32s)]
*  And when they tried Ibogaine, they felt no desire for opiates, and they went through [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1686.92s)]
*  the withdrawal without any pain. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1690.28s)]
*  It's just remarkable what opiates do for you when you go through withdrawal. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1692.7s)]
*  It's terrible. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1697.28s)]
*  But if you have Ibogaine, you can go through it in a couple days, and you have a lot of [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1698.44s)]
*  psychological experiences about why you might want to run away from your problems into opiates. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1701.92s)]
*  Isn't there something that happens with Ibogaine where it literally rewires? [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1707.1200000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1712.48s)]
*  Now, that's true with other psychedelics as well. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1713.48s)]
*  It's called neuroplasticity. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1716.04s)]
*  And so what that means is that there is this ability for our neurons to have new synaptic [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1718.12s)]
*  connections. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1726.72s)]
*  And that's what we mean is neuroplasticity. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1728.12s)]
*  Our brain is constantly being rewired. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1730.1599999999999s)]
*  Every time we do anything, we have memories, and the memories are encoded. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1733.36s)]
*  And sometimes they get encoded in harmful ways, like with trauma, with PTSD. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1737.6399999999999s)]
*  The memories are so painful that they never really get fully processed. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1743.04s)]
*  They never really get put into long-term storage. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1746.8799999999999s)]
*  There's a lot of changes in your brain when you have PTSD, but this idea that you can [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1751.04s)]
*  then rewire your brain once you experience them. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1759.52s)]
*  And so there's researchers at Gould-Dolan is at Johns Hopkins. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1762.84s)]
*  He's done studies in mice with MDMA and showed that it releases oxytocin, which is the hormone [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1768.1999999999998s)]
*  that we have for love and connection, nursing mothers. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1775.1999999999998s)]
*  But it also promotes this new neural growth. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1777.52s)]
*  So Ibogaine does that. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1779.9599999999998s)]
*  LSD does that. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1781.4399999999998s)]
*  psilocybin does that. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1782.6399999999999s)]
*  And what Gould has found, which is really interesting, is that the longer you're in [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1783.6999999999998s)]
*  the psychedelic state, the longer afterwards this period of neuroplasticity lasts, where [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1789.28s)]
*  you can do more integration work, where you have this enhanced ability to reroute patterns [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1795.84s)]
*  in your brain. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1802.8s)]
*  And so Ibogaine opens up this period of neuroplasticity for several weeks after, because the experience [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1804.12s)]
*  can last for more than a day or two. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1812.1599999999999s)]
*  Is there any headway that's being made on bringing Ibogaine to the United States? [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1814.56s)]
*  Because if you think about the opiate crisis that we have here, that seems like one of [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1819.72s)]
*  the very best sort of remedies for that. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1824.8s)]
*  It is. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1827.84s)]
*  And this is where, if you were to look back over the last 50 years, I doubt that there's [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1828.84s)]
*  more than five cases that the government has about anybody abusing Ibogaine, if at all. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1835.28s)]
*  It's a 24-hour drug, right? [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1841.72s)]
*  I've never done it, but I'm... [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1843.8799999999999s)]
*  It knocks you down. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1845.52s)]
*  I would highly recommend it. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1846.52s)]
*  But I would rec... [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1849.36s)]
*  I've had, I'd say, one of the most important experiences of my whole life was Ibogaine. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1850.36s)]
*  Yeah? [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1856.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1857.36s)]
*  What happened? [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1858.36s)]
*  Well, so there's a fellow named Leo Zeff, who is the... [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1859.36s)]
*  We called him the secret chief. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1865.22s)]
*  So he was the leader of the underground psychedelic therapy movement. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1867.52s)]
*  And he worked closely with Sasha Shulgin. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1871.3999999999999s)]
*  And Sasha Shulgin was the chemist that invented hundreds of psychedelics. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1873.96s)]
*  He worked for Dow in the 60s, and he invented a biodegradable insecticide. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1878.68s)]
*  And they rewarded him with his own lab to do whatever he wanted. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1884.42s)]
*  And so Sasha tried to do more psychedelics. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1887.88s)]
*  And they're like, well, maybe these are not going to lead to products. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1889.8400000000001s)]
*  So he realized he had to leave. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1893.48s)]
*  And he set up a lab at home, and he taught. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1895.44s)]
*  But they would have this process of inventing new drugs, new psychedelic drugs, looking [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1897.76s)]
*  for new therapy drugs. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1902.64s)]
*  They would then... [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1905.68s)]
*  Sasha would take it into himself. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1906.68s)]
*  And then if he thought it was okay, he would give it to his wife, Ann. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1908.52s)]
*  They're now both... [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1911.72s)]
*  And they would do these together. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1913.64s)]
*  And then they had a group of 12 people that would meet once a month, and they would try [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1914.94s)]
*  these new drugs. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1918.66s)]
*  Sasha, by the way, did go to the Bohemian Grove, where he was a musician there. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1919.66s)]
*  And so he was able to go. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1924.8400000000001s)]
*  But he would test new drugs with people at Bohemian Grove. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1926.2s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1928.72s)]
*  So presidents and bankers? [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1929.72s)]
*  Different kinds of people like that. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1932.5600000000002s)]
*  They would try these new things. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1933.96s)]
*  They'd go for walks in the woods. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1935.32s)]
*  Because you go to Bohemian Grove for a week or two. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1936.84s)]
*  And so it's not like you're there for a day or so. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1939.42s)]
*  So this small group of 12 people decided that MDMA had incredible potential. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1942.64s)]
*  This is in the middle 70s. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1948.0s)]
*  And they gave this to Leo Zeff. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1950.1200000000001s)]
*  And Leo said, wow. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1952.48s)]
*  He was about to retire. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1953.82s)]
*  He was a clinical psych PhD. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1956.2s)]
*  And he was getting up there in years. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1958.4s)]
*  And he was about to retire. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1961.0s)]
*  He trained a lot of people with LSD and other things. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1962.12s)]
*  And so he did not retire in order to bring forth MDMA. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1964.84s)]
*  And so he really pioneered the use of therapeutic use of MDMA. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1968.98s)]
*  And this is now MDMA being a therapy drug before it became ecstasy as a party drug. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1973.36s)]
*  And that a lot happened in Dallas at the Star Club, which is a public place where incredible [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1979.36s)]
*  stories of the Star Club. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1985.68s)]
*  There's going to be a documentary by Michael Cain is working on a documentary about the [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1987.6s)]
*  Star Club. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1991.84s)]
*  But that attracted Lloyd Benson, the senator from Texas. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1994.24s)]
*  He heard about this. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1996.6s)]
*  And then he complained to the DEA. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1997.6s)]
*  And then the DEA moved to criminalize. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=1998.6s)]
*  We knew that this public use of MDMA was going to eventually result in DEA crackdown. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2001.9599999999998s)]
*  This is Nancy Reagan and Ronald Reagan and all of that. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2007.8799999999999s)]
*  And so we had a jumpstart in a sense that the DEA didn't know we were there. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2011.32s)]
*  They only knew the party drug. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2016.32s)]
*  They didn't know the therapy parts. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2017.32s)]
*  But we knew that the DEA was there and they were coming after us. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2019.04s)]
*  So I started a nonprofit before MAPS in 84. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2022.0s)]
*  And that was to prepare and gather this community together in order to defend MDMA once the [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2025.64s)]
*  DEA moved. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2032.16s)]
*  And so Leo Zeff came to me and he said, you're starting to be an advocate and I'd like to [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2033.16s)]
*  offer you and I begin experience because we need to own our own shadow, own our own weaknesses, [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2037.48s)]
*  own our own things that we're not comfortable with and also have spiritual connections and [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2045.32s)]
*  things like that. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2053.24s)]
*  And he said, if I can help you, this might help in your political work because then you'll [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2054.24s)]
*  see that we're mixtures of good and bad. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2059.04s)]
*  Everybody is and that you won't demonize the DEA and that you may be able to find a way [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2061.36s)]
*  to build a bridge. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2066.52s)]
*  And so he offered me this I began experience and I said, great, I would love to do this. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2068.72s)]
*  And so we had this whole long day to set aside to do this. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2074.24s)]
*  And I began in plant form takes a while to take an effect. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2079.2799999999997s)]
*  So Leo said, I'd like to give you a bunch of LSD at the same time. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2082.16s)]
*  It was 350 micrograms of LSD, which is a pretty hefty dose. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2086.8399999999997s)]
*  The first LSD experience that we know of Albert Hoffman April 19th, 1943 was an amount that [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2093.04s)]
*  he thought would have no real effect because it would be so small, 250 micrograms, which [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2102.06s)]
*  is a major existential challenge. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2107.2599999999998s)]
*  So 350 micrograms is pretty good as well. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2111.2599999999998s)]
*  And so I actually got administered, I began a bunch of it in plant form and then also [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2114.62s)]
*  the LSD at the same time. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2119.24s)]
*  And I could tell the differences between the drugs. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2121.74s)]
*  I could tell coming up on the LSD and moving towards this kind of ego dissolution and opening [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2124.86s)]
*  up and different my emotions and how am I going to do this political work and who am [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2132.26s)]
*  I and am I qualified and all of this. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2136.54s)]
*  And I sort of had a lot of experience with LSD, had never done ibogaine before. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2141.1400000000003s)]
*  And I was able to open up pretty well for the LSD. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2145.1400000000003s)]
*  But then this sort of low guttural rumble started from the ibogaine. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2148.6s)]
*  The LSD peaks around three hours or so. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2153.58s)]
*  And I could feel this ibogaine building and building and building. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2156.38s)]
*  LSD is also very much in your head, very ethereal, more so than psilocybin mushrooms, which are [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2159.46s)]
*  more embodied. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2164.7s)]
*  And so this ibogaine started coming up, this experience, and I started feeling like if [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2167.34s)]
*  I could just let go, if I could just fully have this experience and if I didn't have [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2173.96s)]
*  this fears and anxieties, then I would be a better advocate. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2178.38s)]
*  And I needed to. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2181.66s)]
*  So much was at stake. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2182.8999999999996s)]
*  But then I felt I couldn't let go because I was too scared. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2184.8199999999997s)]
*  And then I would be hating myself. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2187.9399999999996s)]
*  So I felt that there was this cycle of, oh, I'm not as good as I should be. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2190.9399999999996s)]
*  I wish I could let go. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2196.9799999999996s)]
*  I do have these emotions of fear. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2197.9799999999996s)]
*  And then I would feel that and get nauseous. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2200.8999999999996s)]
*  And then I would vomit. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2202.8799999999997s)]
*  And then I would feel relief for like a minute or so. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2205.12s)]
*  And then the swirl would begin. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2208.3399999999997s)]
*  Each of them is like 15 or 20 minute cycles and stuff. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2210.3399999999997s)]
*  And then I would get to this peak and then I would vomit again and over and over and [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2212.9s)]
*  over. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2217.7s)]
*  And for a Jewish person, the imagery that I had was that I was being crucified on the [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2219.2s)]
*  cross of self-perfectionism, that I didn't want to be human in a way. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2225.5s)]
*  I wanted to be perfect. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2230.94s)]
*  I wanted to be more than I was. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2232.2999999999997s)]
*  And I was so excited about that and that this idea that I was not perfect, that it just [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2233.98s)]
*  was this connection between self-criticism and self-hatred. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2241.7400000000002s)]
*  And I could see that. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2245.42s)]
*  And that just made me sick. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2246.7400000000002s)]
*  And I wished I could do more. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2247.86s)]
*  But I couldn't get out of it. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2249.86s)]
*  And I had like a 12-hour cycle of that over and over and over. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2251.42s)]
*  I mean, I was like dry heaving. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2254.7400000000002s)]
*  I had nothing left to throw up anymore. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2256.62s)]
*  And I just so saw this connection between wanting to be perfect, not wanting to be human, [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2259.1s)]
*  being super self-critical, leaning to self-hatred and shutting myself down. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2265.9s)]
*  And so at the end of that day, I was so exhausted. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2269.62s)]
*  I called it transcendence through exhaustion. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2274.82s)]
*  You know, I just gave up. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2278.86s)]
*  I just beat myself up so much. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2280.7s)]
*  I just gave up. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2282.02s)]
*  And I had the most blissful night. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2283.02s)]
*  It was so beautiful. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2284.02s)]
*  It was like no struggle, completely open, everything. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2285.02s)]
*  And I realized that what I needed to do was keep the self-criticism, because that is the [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2288.54s)]
*  drive for quality. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2292.7799999999997s)]
*  You need access to the self-critical part of your mind. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2294.22s)]
*  But if it's connected to self-hatred, you don't listen as much, because then you're [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2297.9s)]
*  a bad person. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2302.14s)]
*  So I sort of severed the connection between self-criticism and self-hatred. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2303.54s)]
*  I accepted myself as a flawed human being that had a lot of room to grow. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2308.14s)]
*  And that I had made friends in a way. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2314.34s)]
*  I made an ally out of the self-critical part of my brain. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2316.06s)]
*  And it, I think, has helped me to learn and grow, because we're doing things that have [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2320.2999999999997s)]
*  never done before. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2324.82s)]
*  We're doing things I've never done before, nobody's never done before, bringing this [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2325.82s)]
*  through the FDA, psychedelic psychotherapy. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2328.94s)]
*  And we're constantly making mistakes. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2331.34s)]
*  I like to say that I'm just a fuckup who just keeps on trying. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2333.14s)]
*  And so this, and then, but I told myself this story. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2339.22s)]
*  This was the most beautiful night. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2342.08s)]
*  All night. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2343.62s)]
*  I was awake, I was on the floor alert, didn't sleep at all, and just saw the stars. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2344.66s)]
*  But I told myself a story. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2347.66s)]
*  And so much is governed by stories, as you know. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2349.58s)]
*  But the story was that I was telling myself that I had not earned this. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2352.92s)]
*  I hadn't had a breakthrough. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2356.66s)]
*  I just exhausted myself. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2357.9s)]
*  So I said, when the sun comes up, I'll be back stuck in this nausea space. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2360.06s)]
*  I don't know why I told myself that story, but I did. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2364.8599999999997s)]
*  And the sun comes up, and then I was like stuck and nauseous again. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2368.2599999999998s)]
*  And I couldn't move for a day. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2371.06s)]
*  I actually had to sit there, or lie there, really, in a fetal position. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2373.06s)]
*  A friend was supposed to come pick me up. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2376.06s)]
*  I said, I can't move. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2377.3s)]
*  Do you think you brought that on yourself? [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2378.3s)]
*  In a way, I do. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2380.38s)]
*  I think the stories we tell ourselves, I mean, that's sort of PTSD or depression. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2381.7s)]
*  The story, and that's what we're saying about you get in these grooves. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2386.38s)]
*  And that's where the psychedelics can shake things up. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2389.48s)]
*  And the neuroplasticity is what really permits you to see it in a different way. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2392.9s)]
*  So I spent the whole next day just curled in a puddle, basically. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2397.68s)]
*  Occasionally, they'd bring me a banana to eat or something like that. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2401.02s)]
*  And then by the third day, finally, I was able to stand up without being nauseous. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2404.9s)]
*  And a friend came and picked me up and ended up driving me away. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2409.7s)]
*  And as we were driving, I'd only been there once. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2416.74s)]
*  This was at a house I'd never been to before. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2419.22s)]
*  And we were going back to where I was familiar ground in the same way. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2421.42s)]
*  And I had this sense in my mind that I knew what was around the corner. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2425.9s)]
*  And I would say, oh, I think we're going to see this. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2430.76s)]
*  And a couple of times we did. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2432.6000000000004s)]
*  And so what I think happened is that I was taking it in peripherally, but I wasn't paying [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2434.6600000000003s)]
*  attention to it when I was going there. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2439.28s)]
*  It wasn't like I was telepathic in a way or anything like that. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2441.1600000000003s)]
*  It was just that all these experiences had sort of been there but hadn't registered. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2445.8s)]
*  And I think I cleared out a lot of space in my mind from this constant self-criticism. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2450.84s)]
*  So I had more openness in space and I could remember things. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2457.08s)]
*  It was the fourth day that I could finally drive. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2461.44s)]
*  But I felt that ever since then, I've had this increasing ability to be self-critical [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2464.8s)]
*  without it being so connected to self-hatred and so painful. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2472.58s)]
*  And I really feel that that I began experience, although I've not done it since because it [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2477.24s)]
*  was pretty heavy and exhausting and painful. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2483.48s)]
*  And I've had other psychedelic experiences since. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2490.32s)]
*  But that, I think, was one of the pivotal ones of my mind. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2492.6s)]
*  And so here we have an open epidemic. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2495.36s)]
*  Over 100,000 people died last year with overdoses connected sometimes with fentanyl and others. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2498.12s)]
*  And a tool that can be tremendously helpful is something that is not being studied at [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2504.14s)]
*  all in the United States and we're forcing people to go to other countries. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2510.28s)]
*  So MAPS is developing what's called an investigator brochure. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2513.32s)]
*  And what that means is that any time a pharmaceutical company wants to develop a drug through the [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2519.2000000000003s)]
*  FDA, you have to summarize the world's literature in the peer-reviewed journals. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2525.1600000000003s)]
*  And you look at it from a safety and efficacy perspective. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2530.0800000000004s)]
*  And so we prepare this brochure for the FDA and it will bring us to what is the latest [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2534.04s)]
*  science. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2540.76s)]
*  So we're going to do a study that ICERS is doing in Spain with ibogaine for helping people [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2542.2000000000003s)]
*  withdraw from methadone or studies in Mexico also for opiate addiction. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2547.8s)]
*  And then we will propose a new study. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2554.0400000000004s)]
*  Ibogaine is in some ways one of the most dangerous of the psychedelics in that there are a small [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2557.96s)]
*  group of people that can have problems with the heart. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2563.5200000000004s)]
*  And so some people have died from taking ibogaine. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2566.44s)]
*  But if you do it under medical supervision, particularly for people who are in weaker [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2570.56s)]
*  physical states because of drug addiction, that nobody needs to die and you can reverse [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2573.98s)]
*  it if something does happen. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2578.8999999999996s)]
*  So we're probably going to propose and we're working with Joe Barsuglia and Martin Polanco [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2580.8999999999996s)]
*  who have developed a company to try to make ibogaine into a medicine. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2591.1s)]
*  They ran a lot of the clinics also in Mexico. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2597.54s)]
*  So a medicine like a pharmaceutical medicine that will be available for prescription? [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2601.2599999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2604.86s)]
*  That's the, well there's two tracks again and this is, that's one track. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2605.86s)]
*  But the other track is from a policy point of view. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2609.74s)]
*  So MAPS, you know, our nonprofit, we have a policy and advocacy team. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2612.22s)]
*  So if ever there was a drug that we could make a strong case that should be removed [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2617.2s)]
*  from schedule one. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2621.66s)]
*  Schedule one is a drug high potential for abuse, no accepted medical use. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2622.94s)]
*  It's the worst drugs according to our scheduling system. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2627.7000000000003s)]
*  You know, if we make MDMA into a medicine, what's going to happen is that we'll have [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2631.46s)]
*  what's called bifurcated scheduling. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2636.54s)]
*  And that means is that our particular product in this particular capsule for PTSD would [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2638.6s)]
*  move out of schedule one, potentially schedule three or schedule four. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2644.7400000000002s)]
*  But MDMA itself would still stay in schedule one. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2648.62s)]
*  So getting MDMA out of schedule one so that it's hopefully, you know, more accessible, [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2653.2999999999997s)]
*  not just for medicine is part of our goal as well. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2659.66s)]
*  Drug policy reform, post prohibition world. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2663.0s)]
*  But Ibogaine, there's no reason for it to be in schedule one or schedule two. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2665.86s)]
*  Schedule two is drugs that have a high potential for abuse but also have a medical use. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2671.42s)]
*  So I think we need to have a two-pronged strategy with Ibogaine. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2676.46s)]
*  One is to try to work through the FDA to make it into a medicine. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2681.1s)]
*  But other is to try to make the case that it never should have been criminalized in [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2684.42s)]
*  the first place. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2687.62s)]
*  And it's not a drug of abuse. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2689.2599999999998s)]
*  And at a time where we have so many people dying from opiate overdoses and so many other [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2690.66s)]
*  people suffering even if they're not dying from this, that this is something that a logical [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2695.7s)]
*  rational country would make this available. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2700.98s)]
*  And we should have clinics right here in Austin and all over the country because we have a [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2703.12s)]
*  massive problem. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2708.42s)]
*  And yet it's this remnant of the drug war which, and again I would say Nixon, well John [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2709.86s)]
*  Ehrlichman who was Nixon's domestic policy advisor came out in the late 70s and he said [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2716.6200000000003s)]
*  that the Nixon White House had two main enemies. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2722.02s)]
*  Those were the blacks for civil rights and the hippies, the anti-war. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2725.46s)]
*  And what Ehrlichman said is we realized that if we could criminalize the drugs that they [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2729.42s)]
*  did, we could bust them up, we could arrest their leaders, we could bust up their meetings. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2733.86s)]
*  And then Ehrlichman said, did we know we were exaggerating the risks of those drugs? [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2739.56s)]
*  Of course we did. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2743.38s)]
*  So I think we could make a good scientific and rational case now that Ibogaine never [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2744.7999999999997s)]
*  should have been criminalized and it should be legally available but by trained therapists [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2750.88s)]
*  in proper circumstances so that the safety is fine. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2755.88s)]
*  But I think what has happened and what we've seen with medical marijuana leading to marijuana [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2761.36s)]
*  legalization, changing people's attitudes, we see that a lot of the psychedelic research [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2766.44s)]
*  with MDMA and psilocybin has led to Oregon decriminalizing drugs and making the Oregon [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2771.12s)]
*  psilocybin initiative with a sort of state legal program that they're trying to implement [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2776.56s)]
*  with local guides. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2781.52s)]
*  Colorado in November, the last election, legalized the natural plant medicines. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2782.64s)]
*  So I think with Ibogaine we will see a similar kind of a thing, that there will be a lot [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2789.18s)]
*  of hopefully research over the next couple of years and that will change people's attitudes [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2794.2s)]
*  and then maybe we can remove Ibogaine from schedule one. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2800.08s)]
*  And then the bigger question is, you're saying like nobody really looks back and thinks Vietnam [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2803.8399999999997s)]
*  was a good idea. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2811.04s)]
*  I'm going to pause you right here because I have to pee so bad. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2812.04s)]
*  I'm really sorry. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2814.04s)]
*  Just hold on one second. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2815.04s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2816.04s)]
*  So, Vietnam. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2817.04s)]
*  Yeah, so nobody looks back and thinks Vietnam was a good idea. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2818.04s)]
*  I think it's going to be the same way for the drug war. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2824.8s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2826.8s)]
*  And so I think we will think of it as a massive tragic experiment that has been exported all [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2828.52s)]
*  over the world, caused enormous violence. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2834.5s)]
*  And I think the idea of Ibogaine getting it removed from schedule one could be really [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2836.7s)]
*  important. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2843.64s)]
*  But I have a little pee joke if I could tell you. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2844.64s)]
*  People will know that you just went out to pee and come back, but that's what brought [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2847.48s)]
*  this to mind. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2850.3s)]
*  So I actually was very lucky. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2851.3s)]
*  I had prostate cancer and I was caught early. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2854.2799999999997s)]
*  And so I had prostate surgery and now I'm fine. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2858.16s)]
*  But it affects your ability to control your bladder for a while. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2862.0s)]
*  So I had to wear and still do these sort of basic depends and pads and all this kind of [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2866.24s)]
*  stuff. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2871.3199999999997s)]
*  But there was a time shortly after the operation, this is very short, I was at Burning Man. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2872.3199999999997s)]
*  And we have a village at Burning Man. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2876.72s)]
*  We do psychedelic harm reduction there. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2879.08s)]
*  So a group of us were in this sort of cuddle puddle in this, you know, I was not doing [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2880.88s)]
*  MDMA at the time, but other people were. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2887.32s)]
*  And it was like three in the morning and we'd been there for hours and we're just like 14 [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2890.4s)]
*  of us or something just talking. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2893.96s)]
*  And this one woman goes out to pee and comes back. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2895.36s)]
*  And you know, other people do that. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2897.92s)]
*  And then she, this woman turned to me and said, I don't understand you. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2899.6000000000004s)]
*  You just had this operation, you're supposed to, you know, pee more often. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2903.08s)]
*  And you know, what's up with you is like you're just sitting here the whole time. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2906.32s)]
*  I said, I've been peeing the entire time. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2910.4s)]
*  Doesn't matter. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2915.44s)]
*  So, you know, diapers at Burning Man is like a new fashion trend. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2916.56s)]
*  Have other people adopted this? [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2924.04s)]
*  People were joking about it. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2926.2000000000003s)]
*  This would be the thing. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2927.28s)]
*  Oh my God, you started a trend. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2928.28s)]
*  That seems like it would be uncomfortable. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2930.44s)]
*  Like it would be better to just go pee somewhere. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2932.2000000000003s)]
*  It would be. But then you interrupt the conversation for all that stuff. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2934.6800000000003s)]
*  Like I just did. Maybe I should do podcasts with a diaper on. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2938.48s)]
*  Well, it wicks it away. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2940.92s)]
*  It's not even that uncomfortable. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2942.04s)]
*  I mean, anyway, I just had to do the pee joke. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2943.56s)]
*  I'm sorry. No worries. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2948.44s)]
*  So back to this idea that in the future, we're going to look at the drug [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2950.0s)]
*  wars being an overall negative thing and a mistake for sure. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2955.7200000000003s)]
*  I think the biggest thing is going to be this blanket definition of drugs. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2959.8s)]
*  You know, that there's especially things when you have things like psilocybin [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2965.64s)]
*  in schedule one where it can help people in so many ways. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2970.56s)]
*  And we're denying that help. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2975.04s)]
*  And I think one of the keys, just like Rocco was the key to get the TED. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2976.96s)]
*  Yeah, I think that someone's son having a bad experience with opiates, [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2982.24s)]
*  someone in a great position of power, someone who's a politician or a governor [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2987.6s)]
*  or someone like that who sees a big turnaround from someone using ibogaine [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2992.2s)]
*  or using psilocybin like that's going to aid us. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=2997.16s)]
*  It's when people see members of their family or somebody that they care about [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3000.64s)]
*  that suffering that gets better. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3005.2799999999997s)]
*  That's when change really happens. Yeah. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3007.52s)]
*  And I think it's sad that it takes that, that you can't sort of look at [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3010.04s)]
*  look at the world and think, you know, those might not be me or my friends, [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3014.3599999999997s)]
*  but but something new should change. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3018.3199999999997s)]
*  Well, it's just not having an understanding of what it actually is. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3020.12s)]
*  And it's because of that term drugs. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3024.88s)]
*  The term drugs is almost always associated with someone being foolish, [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3027.56s)]
*  wasting their life, doing something dumb. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3032.68s)]
*  And the word hallucinogen, too. Yeah. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3035.68s)]
*  I mean, it's a delusion. It's fake. It's not real. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3037.6s)]
*  It's like pink elephants when you're, you know, on alcohol or something. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3040.16s)]
*  It's it's not real. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3044.24s)]
*  And so I think it's very pejorative, the language that we use about it. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3045.48s)]
*  We try to talk about these things as medicines instead of drugs. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3049.0s)]
*  And I think that the way in which we have drugs [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3052.64s)]
*  have become scapegoats. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3058.68s)]
*  So, you know, they become the shadow. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3060.4s)]
*  They they become the source of all the problems. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3063.48s)]
*  And the fundamental mistake, I would say, of the drug war [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3066.64s)]
*  has been to say that certain things themselves are good or bad. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3070.8399999999997s)]
*  These are bad drugs and they have to be illegal. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3074.8799999999997s)]
*  These are OK drugs or these are good drugs. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3077.32s)]
*  Of course, good drugs have included tobacco and alcohol. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3079.48s)]
*  But but we make the thing itself good or bad. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3083.2400000000002s)]
*  And what we miss is that it's about the relationship [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3087.1200000000003s)]
*  that we have with the thing and that it's not the substance. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3090.28s)]
*  It's the relationship. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3094.04s)]
*  And so by focusing on the thing, then we say, oh, we got to reduce the supply. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3095.28s)]
*  We got to, you know, do all this kind of [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3099.6000000000004s)]
*  work to make it so difficult or expensive for people to get to. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3102.96s)]
*  And then we have to threaten them that there's a man named Carl Hart, [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3106.28s)]
*  who is on our Dr. Carl Hart. Yeah, he's on our. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3110.1600000000003s)]
*  He's fantastic. He's on our board of directors. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3113.44s)]
*  And he's a neuroscientist. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3116.88s)]
*  And he is, you know, in New York City, and he's a drug policy reformer. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3122.32s)]
*  And one time we're talking and we were talking about drugs. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3127.28s)]
*  And I said, you know, I think that the more dangerous the drug, [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3131.4s)]
*  the more important it is that it be legal. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3135.4s)]
*  And he said he'd like to say that and that he believed that also. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3138.64s)]
*  And what I mean by that is that the the dangerous drugs [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3142.64s)]
*  are ones which when people get into problems with them, [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3147.16s)]
*  we need to offer them help as soon as possible. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3151.2799999999997s)]
*  And then we stigmatize them and drive them away. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3154.48s)]
*  The more dangerous drugs also get mixed with other things. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3157.3599999999997s)]
*  So like fentanyl mixed with opiates, and that's where you have the overdoses. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3160.52s)]
*  So people don't get pure drugs. They don't get support. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3164.84s)]
*  They don't get help. They're not treated as humans. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3168.1200000000003s)]
*  They don't get really access to treatment. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3171.1200000000003s)]
*  We just punish, punish, punish. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3173.8s)]
*  So our goal is to make drug users, particularly these people, [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3175.08s)]
*  feel worse off so that they're an example. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3178.48s)]
*  So nobody will want to do it. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3180.52s)]
*  But that's not a really good example. People won't do that. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3181.6800000000003s)]
*  So I think this idea of the more dangerous the drug, [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3184.52s)]
*  the more important it is that it be legal, I think makes a lot of sense. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3187.6800000000003s)]
*  And we need to really offer treatment on demand and peer support. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3192.32s)]
*  And and when we think about drug policy, too, [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3196.16s)]
*  you know, people don't understand as much lost opportunities. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3199.96s)]
*  You can see things that have gone wrong, but lost opportunities are like invisible. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3204.36s)]
*  But when I think about MDMA having been criminalized in 1985 [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3209.92s)]
*  by the DN on an emergency basis for bogus reasons about neurotoxicity, [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3215.6s)]
*  but they use that as a rationale. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3220.32s)]
*  Then the hearings that we had going on with the D.A. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3223.32s)]
*  Administrative Law Judge, they said that it should stay as a medicine. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3225.92s)]
*  And the D.A. overruled them. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3229.5600000000004s)]
*  And we sued them twice in the appeals courts and won. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3231.6800000000003s)]
*  And on the third time, D.A. lawyers figured out how to satisfy the courts [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3234.52s)]
*  to keep it illegal. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3239.0s)]
*  And that's why, again, in 86, I started maps to go through the FDA. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3240.0s)]
*  But that when I think of the number of suicides that have happened [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3243.5600000000004s)]
*  in both veteran communities and everywhere since 1985. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3247.44s)]
*  Hundreds and hundreds of thousands, I think, of lives. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3252.6000000000004s)]
*  We should talk about this while while we're being brought up, [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3256.0s)]
*  because there's a common misconception about MDMA that has been proven to be false. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3258.48s)]
*  And it was that it makes holes in your brain. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3263.8s)]
*  Well, yes. Yeah. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3268.0s)]
*  Oprah is a big person responsible for that, actually. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3270.2400000000002s)]
*  So there was it started on MTV and went to Oprah. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3275.2400000000002s)]
*  This is around 2001. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3280.88s)]
*  So what had happened was that there was a young woman who [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3282.76s)]
*  her mother worked at a drug abuse treatment center and she had problems with cocaine. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3287.96s)]
*  She had problems with marijuana. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3292.0s)]
*  She had problems with ecstasy, other things. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3293.04s)]
*  And so they arranged. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3295.56s)]
*  And this was for this MTV show that this woman would go and do a brain scan, [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3298.16s)]
*  a spec scan, which is blood flow in the brain. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3302.64s)]
*  And then they would reveal the results to her live on TV. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3306.0s)]
*  And this was at this drug abuse treatment center that her mother worked at. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3311.28s)]
*  And they revealed the results and the results showed these holes in the brain. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3316.8s)]
*  And it was a graphically manipulated image. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3320.92s)]
*  So spec scans show blood flow through the brain. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3325.32s)]
*  And there's certain areas that light up when you have more blood flow than others. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3328.4s)]
*  And so they took an arbitrary cutoff. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3331.76s)]
*  Any place that had lower than a certain amount of blood flow, they showed as a whole. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3333.84s)]
*  And it was just complete propaganda. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3339.08s)]
*  It was to scare this young woman to supposedly do it. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3341.0s)]
*  She'd done all these other drugs and ecstasy anyway. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3343.6s)]
*  So short time after that, Oprah decides that she's going to do a show. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3345.8s)]
*  And she contacts me and us because we are now advocates. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3349.44s)]
*  And she knew about what we're doing and we're trying to start MDMA research. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3352.88s)]
*  She says she her team says that they want to do two shows on ecstasy. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3356.4s)]
*  It's such a big thing. They want to do one on the risks and one on the benefits. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3361.64s)]
*  I like great. Sounds great. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3365.44s)]
*  And they say, well, we're going to do the one on the risks first. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3366.88s)]
*  And they they brought this woman who had all these holes in the brain, [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3369.76s)]
*  supposedly, to be on the show. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3373.12s)]
*  If you had all the holes in the brain that they showed, [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3376.76s)]
*  you wouldn't be walking and talking. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3379.08s)]
*  You would be just big holes in her brain. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3380.6s)]
*  So nobody seemed to put it together here. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3383.8s)]
*  This woman, she seems fine, but this is her damaged brain. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3385.68s)]
*  And we told Oprah's team, don't show this. This is fake. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3389.64s)]
*  This is not real. And and they did it anyway. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3392.08s)]
*  And they had one woman who was a 24 year old woman. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3396.2s)]
*  That was a raver. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3400.7999999999997s)]
*  But she had positive experiences about MDMA. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3402.04s)]
*  So they said, OK, she would be the one that would sort of [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3405.44s)]
*  say something positive about MDMA. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3409.3999999999996s)]
*  And then Oprah said to her, [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3411.68s)]
*  do you know what you might be doing to your brain with all these holes in the brain? [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3414.84s)]
*  We'd like to offer you a brain scan. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3418.44s)]
*  And if your brain scan looked like hers, [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3420.2400000000002s)]
*  would you I think it was Lynn Smith was her name that had the holes in the brain. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3424.36s)]
*  Would you stop using if your brain looked like that? [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3428.92s)]
*  And and she said, well, I'd be willing to do a brain scan. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3431.32s)]
*  But the very next day, she contacted MAPS. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3434.7200000000003s)]
*  She contacted us and said that should she do this brain scan? [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3436.8s)]
*  And I said, you definitely should do it, but do it with different people. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3441.0s)]
*  Don't do it with the people that there. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3444.4s)]
*  But definitely do this brain scan and then you'll be on the show again [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3445.96s)]
*  and you can show what the results are. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3449.12s)]
*  So she did the brain scan. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3451.3199999999997s)]
*  And then she wrote me back and she said, well, no holes. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3454.24s)]
*  And they've canceled the next show. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3458.04s)]
*  There's no show on the benefits. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3460.0s)]
*  And they're not bringing me back. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3462.0s)]
*  And I'm like, they tricked you. They did. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3464.24s)]
*  And then years of normal Hollywood producers. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3466.8399999999997s)]
*  It was just and no show on the benefits. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3470.16s)]
*  But then years later, over a decade later, [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3473.1600000000003s)]
*  when Oprah was just a short time from closing her her show, [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3476.48s)]
*  but she had O magazine. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3481.48s)]
*  So she decided she would do a story on [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3483.1200000000003s)]
*  she would assign a senior editor to do a story on on MDMA and the therapeutic use. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3486.2000000000003s)]
*  And it was it was like Oprah doing atonement. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3491.1200000000003s)]
*  I said, would you be willing, though, to do another show on your TV show [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3493.4s)]
*  and bring this woman back who had all these holes in the brain? [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3497.2000000000003s)]
*  And let's see what she's doing now. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3500.0800000000004s)]
*  And she actually did show some some signs of brain damage [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3502.12s)]
*  and that she was working for the Partnership for a Drug Free America. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3507.04s)]
*  And she was as the exhibit of, oh, you know, MDMA is terrible. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3511.7999999999997s)]
*  They scared her with the holes in the brain to the point [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3515.8399999999997s)]
*  where she thought that drugs are ruining her life and she wanted to save other people. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3518.72s)]
*  I think I think there was that. Yeah. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3522.12s)]
*  And I think that she wanted to get back in the good graces with her mother [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3524.0s)]
*  and that then she gets supported and then she gets a job and this whole thing. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3526.8399999999997s)]
*  And so Oprah said, no, no, she's not willing to do another show. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3530.7599999999998s)]
*  But this article would go forward in magazine. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3534.7599999999998s)]
*  And the article was great. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3537.48s)]
*  And the woman who was the reporter ended up [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3539.64s)]
*  going for an underground MDMA experience, which I helped arrange. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3543.8799999999997s)]
*  And it was very successful. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3549.24s)]
*  And that's how the article ends. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3551.52s)]
*  But it's great because it didn't like make a big deal of, oh, this is illegal underground. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3553.4399999999996s)]
*  It was just like, here's what happened to her to the MDMA. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3557.0s)]
*  But it was in some ways propaganda in the positive way. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3560.7999999999997s)]
*  It was like, can a single pill save your life? [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3565.4399999999996s)]
*  You know, before it's like this is going to like cause holes in your brain. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3569.08s)]
*  Now, one pill is all you need, a magic pill, and then you're going to be better for everything. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3572.16s)]
*  Ignores the whole point that it's about the therapy and the context and the relationship. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3576.3599999999997s)]
*  It seems like, unfortunately, because of those kind of television shows [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3581.4399999999996s)]
*  and because of up until podcasts on the Internet, [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3587.7200000000003s)]
*  you you had a limited sort of ability to fully express the pros and the cons [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3592.1200000000003s)]
*  and explain the nuance of what these experiences are about. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3599.36s)]
*  And you're you're instead dealing with this sensationalist perspective [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3603.0800000000004s)]
*  where they're just trying to, you know, just trying to highlight whatever the most [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3607.6800000000003s)]
*  wildest aspects of the experience pro or con would be [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3613.08s)]
*  so they can get a lot of people to pay attention to it. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3617.8s)]
*  It's like it becomes prostituted. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3619.76s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3622.32s)]
*  And I think that like long form podcasts where you can have the whole story, [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3623.2400000000002s)]
*  you can get the whole story out unedited by people that are wanting to do it. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3627.2000000000003s)]
*  But I will say in terms of educating people about psychedelics, [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3631.2000000000003s)]
*  what we're doing is a lot of maps is about public education. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3634.2400000000002s)]
*  And so we're hosting the world's largest conference on psychedelics ever. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3639.0s)]
*  And it's going to take place June 19th to the 23rd. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3643.96s)]
*  How many DEA agents do you think will be in the audience? [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3647.2s)]
*  Well, I think some. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3649.88s)]
*  We also have some police officers who are we have one. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3653.08s)]
*  Sarco Gagarin is a full time police officer in Winthrop near Boston. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3657.2799999999997s)]
*  But he's also a psychotherapist. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3662.48s)]
*  And he's been through our training program [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3664.12s)]
*  in order to give MDMA therapy to other police officers. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3667.6s)]
*  We just had an incredible the first psychedelic conference in Iceland. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3671.6s)]
*  And Sarco came and also did his police chief came. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3675.92s)]
*  And we met with the Minister of Justice in Iceland. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3680.6s)]
*  The conference was phenomenal, the psychedelic conference in Iceland. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3683.2799999999997s)]
*  And now the Minister of Justice is interested in having Iceland [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3686.88s)]
*  fund a study to give MDMA to prisoners [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3690.16s)]
*  to work with them to see about dealing with their traumas, to reduce recidivism, [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3695.44s)]
*  also with victims of crime, to help them deal with their petes. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3699.56s)]
*  And also with prison guards and police. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3703.44s)]
*  So we have this opportunity in Iceland [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3706.56s)]
*  to potentially make it a example of a countrywide approach. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3711.16s)]
*  Our new big vision and I'll get back to the psychedelic science conference [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3716.88s)]
*  in just a second, but our new big vision is a world of net trauma. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3720.72s)]
*  By 2070. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3725.08s)]
*  So this idea of every year, we're adding to the burden of trauma [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3727.44s)]
*  that people are experiencing and and then it lasts. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3732.32s)]
*  There are some people that get better, but there's many people that get stuck in PTSD. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3735.72s)]
*  And then there's multigenerational PTSD. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3739.48s)]
*  There's what's called epigenetics, which is, [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3741.6s)]
*  you know, biological evolution takes place over long periods of time. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3745.24s)]
*  But what turns the genes on and off is epigenetics above the genes. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3748.92s)]
*  That can change from your own experience. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3753.48s)]
*  And there's a woman, Rachel Yehuda, at the Bronx VA, [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3755.4s)]
*  that has done studies with Holocaust survivors and their children [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3758.2400000000002s)]
*  and has identified an epigenetic mechanism by which this is passed on [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3761.8s)]
*  from parent to child. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3766.48s)]
*  And it could be either from the father or the mother line. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3768.0800000000004s)]
*  It's in either of our genetics. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3770.32s)]
*  So this idea that we are increasing the burden of trauma by [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3772.56s)]
*  there's some estimates that by 2050, that if climate change continues as it does, [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3777.04s)]
*  that there will be about a billion climate refugees from droughts [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3782.04s)]
*  and poor crops and, you know, lack of water and all of this. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3786.64s)]
*  So that it feels like the humanity is going to be burdened more by trauma. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3791.2s)]
*  We have incredible problems with mental health because of both the covid [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3797.16s)]
*  and other things, so that what we want to do [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3802.7599999999998s)]
*  is reduce the burden of trauma every year and get to net zero trauma. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3806.0s)]
*  And that that's and it will take multi generations. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3811.2799999999997s)]
*  And the end goal is the mass mental health and a spiritualized humanity. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3814.3999999999996s)]
*  And that's the hope for the for the future. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3819.24s)]
*  And we will be talking about this at the psychedelic science conference. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3822.16s)]
*  So it's going to be at the Denver Convention Center. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3825.08s)]
*  We have the entire Denver Convention Center. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3827.8799999999997s)]
*  We already have. Yes. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3829.8399999999997s)]
*  Be part of the breakthrough. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3832.4399999999996s)]
*  Yeah. And it's we've got over 5000 people coming. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3834.4399999999996s)]
*  We hope there'll be about 10,000. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3837.96s)]
*  And we'd also like to say that we have [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3839.32s)]
*  a special discount code for people who are listening. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3843.0s)]
*  So it's psychedelic science, dot org. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3846.88s)]
*  And if you just put in Rogan 20, it's a 20 percent discount. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3848.84s)]
*  And so we think if people really want to get involved in this field [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3853.1200000000003s)]
*  in any way to be a therapist or to run clinics or to manufacture drugs [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3858.0800000000004s)]
*  or start new companies or just how do you blend this with meditation? [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3863.32s)]
*  Anything there's going to be over 300 speakers. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3867.6s)]
*  We have incredible opportunities for people to to learn and grow and get involved. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3870.72s)]
*  We have this the Denver Convention Center. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3877.24s)]
*  We have enormous number of exhibits from, you know, probably 150, 175 [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3879.92s)]
*  different exhibits and, you know, Deepak Chopra will be there. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3884.92s)]
*  I mentioned Aubrey Marcus. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3890.4s)]
*  He's coming with Aaron Rodgers, the football player who's used [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3891.64s)]
*  Iwaska, which is DMT and T-Forum. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3894.92s)]
*  Michael Pollan is going to be there. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3899.6s)]
*  Paul Stamets is going to be there. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3901.16s)]
*  You know, pretty much the research community from around the world [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3902.52s)]
*  doing psychedelics research and also drug policy reformers. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3905.52s)]
*  And Denver was the first city that made mushrooms the lowest enforcement priority. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3910.2400000000002s)]
*  So we're going to have experiential opportunities for people [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3915.2000000000003s)]
*  that will be federally legal. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3918.96s)]
*  I think Denver was also the first city that decriminalized marijuana. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3920.88s)]
*  They've yeah, they have done. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3924.4s)]
*  It was a long time ago when marijuana was not state legal. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3927.24s)]
*  Yeah, I think Ann Arbor might have been one of the. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3930.6s)]
*  Oh, really? Yeah. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3932.84s)]
*  Well, just because the college there. Oh, yeah. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3934.2799999999997s)]
*  But Denver and Colorado is very progressive. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3937.16s)]
*  The mayor is going to help us open the conference. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3939.84s)]
*  We've got the support of the governor. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3941.52s)]
*  We're actually doing a project with the Denver police [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3943.48s)]
*  because mushrooms are the lowest enforcement priority. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3947.36s)]
*  And we want to educate police on what happens when you [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3950.24s)]
*  encounter somebody with a difficult trip. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3953.72s)]
*  You know, you could make it worse for them [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3955.52s)]
*  or you could sort of treat them in a certain way so that you calm them down. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3957.96s)]
*  And, you know, they don't need to be tased or, you know, however. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3961.88s)]
*  So we're trying to educate police on how to deescalate people [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3965.6s)]
*  with difficult psychedelic experiences. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3969.16s)]
*  So the conference is going to be the theme. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3971.4s)]
*  We've had this is our fourth psychedelic science conference [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3975.4s)]
*  that we call that where we bring everybody together. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3978.92s)]
*  The first was in 19 is 2010. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3981.04s)]
*  And we had about 400 people, something like that. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3984.12s)]
*  But that was enormous for us. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3987.12s)]
*  And that was in San Jose. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3989.6s)]
*  The second one was in 2013. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3990.64s)]
*  And we had at this point about a thousand people. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3992.8s)]
*  And that was in Oakland. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3996.24s)]
*  And then in 2017, we had another one, and that was over 2000 people. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=3997.8s)]
*  And that now is still the world's largest [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4002.76s)]
*  conference. We had like 2500. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4006.76s)]
*  And now this one, we think, is going to be way more. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4008.28s)]
*  So and the theme of it, why we've waited so many years between 2017 [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4010.52s)]
*  now is that we are now at the doorway to a new world. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4015.28s)]
*  And what I mean, what I mean by that is that we are at an incredible [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4019.64s)]
*  moment in time where there have been [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4024.0s)]
*  probably two and a half or more billion dollars have gone into for-profit [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4028.8s)]
*  psychedelic companies. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4033.4s)]
*  They haven't done so great in the stock market. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4035.0s)]
*  Bunch of them have gone broke. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4037.68s)]
*  What is the idea behind these companies? [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4039.12s)]
*  Were they trying to accomplish? [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4040.6s)]
*  Well, some of them were trying to develop new drugs. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4041.3199999999997s)]
*  A lot of them were trying to set up networks of clinics. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4044.04s)]
*  We also have ketamine, which has now been as ketamine. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4047.3599999999997s)]
*  An isomer of ketamine has been approved for treatment of depression. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4050.3199999999997s)]
*  You know, we ended up. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4054.6s)]
*  In November 29th, 2016, [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4057.64s)]
*  we had what's called an end of phase two meeting with the FDA [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4060.8399999999997s)]
*  about our research with MDMA assisted therapy for PTSD. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4064.2799999999997s)]
*  So it took us 30 years from the start of MAPS 1986 to 2016 [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4067.36s)]
*  where we presented our data to the FDA and they said, yes, you can go into phase [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4073.1600000000003s)]
*  three. Phase three is the final stage of research where you need to do [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4077.56s)]
*  safety and efficacy. And if you prove that to the satisfaction of the FDA, [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4082.76s)]
*  you get permission to market. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4086.0s)]
*  So some of the new for-profit companies, Compass Pathways is one, [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4087.96s)]
*  and USONA is a nonprofit, are trying to develop psilocybin [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4091.8s)]
*  into a method of treatment with therapy. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4095.8s)]
*  Compass for treatment resistant depression, USONA for [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4100.24s)]
*  major depressive disorder. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4104.68s)]
*  And so a bunch of these companies are trying to develop new drugs. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4107.28s)]
*  And I think some of them are thinking, well, the classic psychedelics [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4110.32s)]
*  like LSD, MDMA, psilocybin, MDMA, we wouldn't say classic, [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4115.16s)]
*  but the classic psychedelics like, you know, Ibogaine, Mescaline, [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4119.4800000000005s)]
*  psilocybin, LSD, DMT, all these are in the public domain. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4124.68s)]
*  And so there's no patents on them. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4128.96s)]
*  So people have tried to say, well, we'll patent the manufacturing process [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4131.6s)]
*  or we'll do something. But there's also use patents. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4135.280000000001s)]
*  But the use of psychedelics for therapy in different conditions is also [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4138.76s)]
*  in the public domain. So a lot of these companies are going to try to [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4143.200000000001s)]
*  develop new molecules that they can patent. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4147.96s)]
*  So that's sort of a classic pharma strategy. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4150.96s)]
*  Sounds horrible. Well, I think the good thing is that it'll be legal. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4153.12s)]
*  The bad thing is it'll be owned by pharmaceutical companies. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4157.16s)]
*  Well, I think they're make it's true. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4160.68s)]
*  It will eventually these new drugs. But no one should own them. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4163.24s)]
*  That doesn't make any sense. Anybody should get a patent. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4167.32s)]
*  I understand that we're trying to undo 53 years of, you know, [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4170.32s)]
*  what decriminalization. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4174.16s)]
*  But I just think that that's a bad strategy and you're getting in bed with some [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4176.64s)]
*  demons. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4180.56s)]
*  Well, there is that tendency. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4181.5599999999995s)]
*  And then you see what pharma does to try to protect the patents. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4183.28s)]
*  Exactly. It's just not... [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4186.0s)]
*  And on the other... [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4187.64s)]
*  It deserves to be legal. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4189.48s)]
*  Well, the classic ones that are off patent do. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4191.12s)]
*  I mean, I am supportive of people patenting original ideas. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4193.92s)]
*  Sure. And so if somebody develops some new molecule and, you know, for us, [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4198.5599999999995s)]
*  it's going to cost us hundreds of millions of dollars to make MDMA into a medicine. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4203.2s)]
*  And so we've done that. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4207.96s)]
*  So we've done that in an incredible set of ways. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4211.28s)]
*  And I think this is why what I explained to you just a couple of weeks ago and [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4214.32s)]
*  why you were so gracious to invite me back now is because I talked about this [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4219.16s)]
*  crossroads that we're at. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4223.72s)]
*  And so MAPS has raised about one hundred forty five million dollars in [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4225.84s)]
*  grants and most of the donations in our history. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4231.64s)]
*  And we have gotten enormous value in people's donated time, [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4236.64s)]
*  expertise of all sorts. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4241.2s)]
*  And it's hard to even put a dollar number on that, but it's been tremendous. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4242.5199999999995s)]
*  And so we have used that to do this MDMA research. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4246.44s)]
*  A couple of years ago, [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4249.76s)]
*  with the rise of all these for-profit psychedelic companies, it became more [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4252.88s)]
*  difficult for us to raise donations because people are like, why should I [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4256.0s)]
*  donate now? You know, you can I can just invest over here. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4259.72s)]
*  And you've got a story now. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4262.96s)]
*  Your story is that it looks like you're moving into phase three. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4264.24s)]
*  Maybe you can get investors. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4267.5199999999995s)]
*  And so we didn't want to sell equity at the time. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4270.5599999999995s)]
*  And so we do have, as I said, about one hundred forty five million in grants and [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4275.0s)]
*  donations and a lot of free donated time. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4278.88s)]
*  But we also have forty three million dollars in what's called a royalty share. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4281.32s)]
*  So it is money from investors. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4286.72s)]
*  They're mission aligned investors. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4288.92s)]
*  Ryan Zur organized it as the lead one called Vine Ventures, and they have about [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4290.56s)]
*  three point eight percent of North American revenues once from MDMA. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4296.040000000001s)]
*  Once we make it into a medicine for about eight to ten years afterwards. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4300.8s)]
*  And if we don't give them a certain amount of money back, then it continues. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4303.88s)]
*  But they don't have ownership and they don't control what we do. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4306.68s)]
*  And we can end up, you know, prioritizing public benefit over profits. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4309.88s)]
*  So we also have around 20 million dollars in a in a loan that's potentially [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4316.879999999999s)]
*  convertible into equity if we don't repay the loan. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4324.04s)]
*  And we've got a couple of years there. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4326.959999999999s)]
*  But we have reached this spot where we have the nonprofit maps, which has about [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4328.04s)]
*  35 people, is the 100 percent owner of the maps public benefit corp, which is [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4335.04s)]
*  about one hundred and thirty five people, something like that. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4341.28s)]
*  And so we have this situation. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4344.240000000001s)]
*  We also tried to do something new with Pharma so that and something new with [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4346.68s)]
*  capitalism so that capitalism, when you have for profit companies, you're [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4354.0s)]
*  supposed to maximize profits. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4358.4400000000005s)]
*  And if minority shareholders don't like the fact that the management isn't [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4360.6s)]
*  maximizing profits, they can try to throw them out. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4364.160000000001s)]
*  And so that that produces a prioritization of profits over people, [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4367.56s)]
*  profits over social benefit. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4371.88s)]
*  And so capitalism has been modified in a way with the public benefit corporation. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4375.08s)]
*  So that's a new corporate structure, maybe 20 years old, but relatively new. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4381.6s)]
*  And there's thousands, you know, not hundreds of thousands, not tens of [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4386.92s)]
*  thousands, I don't think, but there's thousands of these public benefit [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4390.52s)]
*  corporations. And what you do is you can maximize public benefit over profit so [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4392.88s)]
*  that you cannot be sued by minority majority by by minority shareholders to [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4399.04s)]
*  try to force out the executives because you're not maximizing profits because [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4404.32s)]
*  your goal is public benefit over profit. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4408.24s)]
*  So we want to create a new model for how pharma drugs can be distributed. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4410.44s)]
*  So we have this remarkable moment where we have the nonprofit is a hundred [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4416.28s)]
*  percent owner of a for profit but public benefit pharmaceutical company. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4422.72s)]
*  But we need to raise additional capital. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4427.96s)]
*  We are now at a place where we recently announced that our second phase three [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4430.28s)]
*  study was successful and was confirmatory. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4435.08s)]
*  Our first phase three study was incredibly successful. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4439.5599999999995s)]
*  And to give you a sense of how successful and we published this in Nature [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4443.799999999999s)]
*  Medicine, the FDA looks at statistical significance. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4447.96s)]
*  So there's efficacy and safety. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4452.759999999999s)]
*  So efficacy is determined by basically statistical significance. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4454.76s)]
*  And you have to have point oh five, which means one in 20 chance that it's random, [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4460.360000000001s)]
*  that it's not from what you think it was, you know, that your intervention, your [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4465.64s)]
*  experiment said, yes, it's statistically significant. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4469.56s)]
*  That means it's one in 20 or lower chance that it's your finding is random. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4472.12s)]
*  And you have to have two of those. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4478.08s)]
*  And the and so if you have one in 20 and then you multiply them another one in 20, [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4480.400000000001s)]
*  it's one in 400 chance that that these two independent studies have produced [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4486.320000000001s)]
*  results that are random and then the FDA will approve it. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4491.400000000001s)]
*  Our first study was one in 10,000 chance that it was random. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4494.52s)]
*  It was just incredible. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4502.72s)]
*  Now, how do you do that? [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4504.08s)]
*  How do you get such great statistical significance? [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4505.240000000001s)]
*  You get it because you have a big difference between the two groups and you also have [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4508.12s)]
*  not that much variability. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4515.280000000001s)]
*  So what it means is the people that got MDMA, pretty much of them got major benefits [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4516.72s)]
*  and the people that got the therapy without MDMA. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4523.0s)]
*  So I should say the people got therapy with MDMA did great. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4526.200000000001s)]
*  Pretty not very much variability. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4530.52s)]
*  It doesn't work for everybody, but we had 88 percent responders. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4532.360000000001s)]
*  We had 67 percent no longer had a diagnosis of PTSD. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4536.5199999999995s)]
*  These are severe PTSD patients that had PTSD, an average of 14 years, one third over 20 [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4539.959999999999s)]
*  years. And then we had just another 21 percent had what's called clinically significant [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4547.32s)]
*  response. And they still have PTSD, but over time they might get better. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4557.08s)]
*  They could have had a four session. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4563.2s)]
*  They might get better. And we had a great safety record. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4564.36s)]
*  We had nobody. We had actually nobody in the MDMA therapy group tried to kill themselves, [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4567.16s)]
*  tried to hurt themselves. We enroll people that have previously attempted suicide. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4573.16s)]
*  We did have one woman try to kill herself twice during the study, but she was in the [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4577.16s)]
*  placebo group. She got therapy without MDMA. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4581.12s)]
*  We had another woman. It was so difficult for her to confront her trauma that she [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4583.839999999999s)]
*  checked herself into a hospital to not self-harm. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4588.679999999999s)]
*  She also was in the placebo group. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4591.36s)]
*  So the results were phenomenal. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4593.639999999999s)]
*  And science, the journal Science, one of the most important journals in the world in [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4595.72s)]
*  science, at the end of every year, they publish a list of what they think are the top 10 [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4601.4s)]
*  scientific breakthroughs of the year. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4608.04s)]
*  And they chose our study in nature medicine as one of the world's top 10 breakthroughs of [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4610.88s)]
*  the year. It was phenomenal. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4615.88s)]
*  And we had special appreciation for what science was willing to do, because you talked [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4618.08s)]
*  about beforehand about holes in the brain. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4626.36s)]
*  So 20 years before, science had published this article that they never should have [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4629.28s)]
*  published. And this was by researchers at Johns Hopkins that had been funded by the [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4633.36s)]
*  National Institute on Drug Abuse. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4638.44s)]
*  And what they claimed is that MDMA could hurt dopamine. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4639.6s)]
*  This was a study in primates. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4643.16s)]
*  And they said, oh, my God, MDMA can hurt dopamine. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4644.76s)]
*  And it could cause Parkinson's and that this could be a real danger. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4647.76s)]
*  Now, this was around 2002, 2003. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4653.12s)]
*  And they had since 1985, it had all been about MDMA supposedly hurting serotonin and [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4656.679999999999s)]
*  causing holes in the brains from serotonin. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4663.08s)]
*  And we had done studies in primates before with these same researchers where none of [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4665.76s)]
*  the primates died from overdoses. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4669.96s)]
*  There didn't seem to be any problems with dopamine. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4672.76s)]
*  But the narrative of the anti-drug people, the National Institute on Drug Abuse about [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4675.08s)]
*  serotonin neurotoxicity was sort of diminishing. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4679.8s)]
*  People weren't showing problems. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4683.4s)]
*  And so what they were saying was, well, you're reducing your cognitive reserves. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4685.24s)]
*  And so you don't show problems now. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4691.08s)]
*  But when you get older, you're going to show problems. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4692.32s)]
*  So the time bomb theory. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4694.6s)]
*  Did they have evidence of this? [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4695.64s)]
*  No. And not only did they not have evidence, but a lot of older people took MDMA and they [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4696.56s)]
*  were fine. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4700.24s)]
*  So if they had had this, you know, decline of aging, age-related decline, they were [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4701.12s)]
*  already. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4705.64s)]
*  But it does drop your dopamine levels, right? [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4705.84s)]
*  Or serotonin levels. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4708.4400000000005s)]
*  In a short term. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4709.4400000000005s)]
*  Yes. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4711.2s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4712.2s)]
*  It does. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4713.360000000001s)]
*  But it doesn't do this kind of damage to the brain in that way. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4713.88s)]
*  They recover within a day or so. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4716.28s)]
*  And there's mitigation techniques like with 5-HTP. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4717.68s)]
*  We don't use those. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4721.4800000000005s)]
*  But people do use those. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4722.400000000001s)]
*  Why don't you use those? [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4723.400000000001s)]
*  Because we don't think it's necessary. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4724.400000000001s)]
*  So what we first proposed in 1988, we had a study that was done in the United States [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4725.92s)]
*  in 1992 is when we got permission for the first study with MDMA. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4730.76s)]
*  And people had been using 5-HTP after MDMA. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4735.400000000001s)]
*  But there is a benefit to using 5-HTP. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4739.08s)]
*  It boosts your serotonin levels quicker, correct? [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4742.08s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4744.52s)]
*  It can be helpful. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4745.52s)]
*  But what we do in a therapy context. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4746.52s)]
*  So the FDA, we said, should we try administering with 5-HTP or something like that? [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4748.2s)]
*  They said, they said, don't do that. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4752.88s)]
*  You know, let's do everything under observation and see what the problems are. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4755.72s)]
*  And if you need, if you see problems, then we should figure out how to mitigate the problems. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4760.0s)]
*  So the key thing that we do is to say to people that when you take MDMA, it's a two day experience. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4764.0s)]
*  It's not a one day experience. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4771.0s)]
*  And the second day is for rest and for reflection and have no obligations, no appointments, [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4772.68s)]
*  nothing that you need to do. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4778.36s)]
*  Just take the second day and rest. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4780.92s)]
*  And that's where people would take 5-HTP if they wanted to. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4783.6s)]
*  But we don't see this dip in mood any more in the MDMA group than in the group that gets [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4786.76s)]
*  therapy without it. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4792.72s)]
*  So this people talk about suicide Tuesdays or, you know, this depression after you've [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4793.84s)]
*  used up serotonin. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4798.6s)]
*  But I think the rest part is part of the therapeutic process. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4801.04s)]
*  And so we have never felt the need to recommend that people do 5-HTP. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4805.92s)]
*  I don't think it's a bad idea to do. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4810.64s)]
*  I mean, if people wanted to do it, it can be helpful. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4812.56s)]
*  But we just feel that the rest is just as helpful and it's more therapeutic. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4815.24s)]
*  So what? [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4821.08s)]
*  But they're not mutually exclusive. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4822.08s)]
*  No, we could do both. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4823.4s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4824.639999999999s)]
*  For sure. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4825.639999999999s)]
*  But we don't in the research. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4826.639999999999s)]
*  We haven't found the need. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4827.639999999999s)]
*  But what science had. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4828.92s)]
*  So this idea of serotonergic neurotoxicity and holes in your brain and time bomb theories [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4832.32s)]
*  just wasn't working anymore. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4836.679999999999s)]
*  It wasn't persuading people. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4838.88s)]
*  It wasn't persuading the FDA. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4839.96s)]
*  So NIDA funded this study, Uno McCann and George Riccardi, and it was in primates. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4842.0s)]
*  And as it turned out, a bunch of the primates died of overdoses. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4849.28s)]
*  And they published the paper in Science that said that MDMA could cause Parkinson's that [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4854.28s)]
*  could hurt dopamine. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4858.4800000000005s)]
*  And the editor of the, Science is published by the American Association for the Advancement [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4860.76s)]
*  of Science. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4867.72s)]
*  The president of that was Alan Leshner. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4868.72s)]
*  He used to be the head of NIDA. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4870.68s)]
*  And he fanned the fears of MDMA. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4872.68s)]
*  And he did that in Congress. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4875.16s)]
*  And it was great because then he got more money for NIDA. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4876.52s)]
*  Got him over a billion dollars a year. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4878.72s)]
*  So he published a press release about this article. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4880.8s)]
*  And it said that taking MDMA was like playing Russian roulette with your brain. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4884.52s)]
*  So it didn't seem right, this article. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4889.96s)]
*  We knew that we'd given MDMA to primates for research and nobody died of overdoses. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4893.38s)]
*  None of them did. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4898.6s)]
*  So we wrote a letter to the editor and we questioned it. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4900.0s)]
*  They didn't give it the way people take it, which is orally as well. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4903.8s)]
*  And so we kept... [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4907.200000000001s)]
*  How did they give it? [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4908.200000000001s)]
*  They gave it subcutaneously. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4909.200000000001s)]
*  So they injected it subcu. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4910.52s)]
*  And so we ended up forcing them in their minds to try to replicate their results. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4912.280000000001s)]
*  Can I pause you for a second? [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4918.320000000001s)]
*  How did these primates die of overdoses? [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4919.64s)]
*  They would just have like heart attacks or something like that. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4922.0s)]
*  Is that common with humans? [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4926.4400000000005s)]
*  No, no. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4928.200000000001s)]
*  So here's how this continues. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4929.2s)]
*  Also you get more neurotoxicity in crowds for some reason when animals or people are [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4933.16s)]
*  together than when they're alone. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4939.599999999999s)]
*  And when the temperature is higher, there's more neurotoxicity. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4941.36s)]
*  So they tried giving more MDMA to primates with higher temperatures, more crowded in [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4944.96s)]
*  the cages, and they couldn't replicate their results. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4950.48s)]
*  But they kept defending it in public. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4953.84s)]
*  And finally, a year later, they said that... [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4955.2s)]
*  And this was super embarrassing. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4958.72s)]
*  They had to retract the study because they were puzzled why they couldn't replicate the [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4960.0s)]
*  results. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4964.08s)]
*  And so they took some of the tissue from one of the animals that had overdosed and died, [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4965.08s)]
*  and they discovered that they had mistakenly given methamphetamine instead of MDMA. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4971.32s)]
*  And that the bottles, they said, that were labeled MDMA actually had methamphetamine [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4978.04s)]
*  in them. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4982.639999999999s)]
*  So they got these bottles from a group called Research Triangle Institute in North Carolina. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4983.72s)]
*  They provide all the schedule one drugs for all the NIDA-funded researchers. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4990.0s)]
*  So the Hopkins people blamed the people at Research Triangle Institute and said they [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4993.68s)]
*  switched the labels on the bottles. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=4998.160000000001s)]
*  The people from Research Triangle Institute said they never do that. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5000.72s)]
*  They always test it. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5004.200000000001s)]
*  They have quality control. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5005.200000000001s)]
*  They think that it got switched something or other at the site at Johns Hopkins. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5006.200000000001s)]
*  The National Institute of Drug Abuse didn't want to find out what was going on, or if [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5010.36s)]
*  they did want to find out, they never made it public. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5014.12s)]
*  So it's never clear how did this happen. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5016.719999999999s)]
*  But they had to retract this data and retract their papers. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5019.639999999999s)]
*  And it was the high watermark of neurotoxicity fears. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5025.599999999999s)]
*  And at the same time, Peter Jennings was doing a documentary called Ecstasy Rising. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5031.84s)]
*  And this was the first documentary that really had a bunch of people talking about the benefits [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5036.58s)]
*  And he also talked about this problem with the methamphetamine. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5040.88s)]
*  The other thing about methamphetamine versus MDMA is that, you know, for people that know [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5045.44s)]
*  about Adderall and other things, 10, 15 milligrams is a hefty dose. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5049.48s)]
*  But MDMA, it's 125 milligrams, is a full dose. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5053.16s)]
*  And so they were giving the wrong drug in MDMA quantities. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5056.92s)]
*  And that's why they knocked off a bunch of these primates. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5062.639999999999s)]
*  And that's why they claimed that they saw this dopaminergic problems. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5064.92s)]
*  And so ever since then, and that's been 20 years ago now. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5069.12s)]
*  Do you think, do you have speculation that was sabotage? [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5072.5599999999995s)]
*  Somebody sabotaged it somewhere. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5076.12s)]
*  I don't think it was from research trying to do it. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5077.68s)]
*  Do you think it's accidental sabotage? [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5079.76s)]
*  Or do you think it? [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5081.5599999999995s)]
*  I don't. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5082.76s)]
*  I think that the researchers wouldn't have done that intentionally. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5083.76s)]
*  But maybe somebody in the lab did it or something. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5088.62s)]
*  But I do think that the researchers were fundamentally irresponsible to put the paper out because [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5091.72s)]
*  they should have known that there was prior primate studies where dopamine hadn't been [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5097.8s)]
*  damaged. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5103.72s)]
*  So the other thing is in the late 1980s, early 1990s, we were trying to talk about, [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5104.72s)]
*  yeah, MDMA, serotonergic neurotoxicity. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5112.72s)]
*  And so I went to George Riccardi, the same researcher that did the primate study with [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5115.4800000000005s)]
*  the methamphetamine instead. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5119.360000000001s)]
*  And I said, I want to buy you some monkeys. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5120.88s)]
*  You've just done studies in rats. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5122.76s)]
*  And you study this in monkeys, in primates. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5124.16s)]
*  And he said he did. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5128.12s)]
*  And again, there was no evidence of overdoses or dopamine. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5130.2s)]
*  Also, this was before brain scans came in. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5135.08s)]
*  And so the most sophisticated way that was available at the time to look at what's going [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5138.48s)]
*  on in the brain was to do spinal taps and to take spinal fluid and look for metabolites [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5144.28s)]
*  of neurotransmitters in the brain. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5149.5599999999995s)]
*  And I felt like I could not recommend, try to get other people to volunteer for it unless [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5152.0s)]
*  I did it myself. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5158.84s)]
*  So I was the first one to get a spinal tap. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5160.4s)]
*  And it was really hard. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5163.84s)]
*  But the imagery that I did, and again, this is kind of this idea about storytelling. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5165.12s)]
*  So the story I was telling myself as this big needle is going into my spine to try to [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5169.34s)]
*  draw out the spinal fluid was that if a woman could give birth to a child, I could at least [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5174.0s)]
*  give birth to my spinal fluid. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5179.0s)]
*  It was like way less painful, much shorter, but I could do it. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5181.5s)]
*  And so the imagery was I'm giving my birth to my spinal fluid to these researchers so [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5185.96s)]
*  that we can understand what's really going on with MDMA and hopefully make it into a [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5191.52s)]
*  medicine. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5195.7s)]
*  And it didn't hurt terribly. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5197.06s)]
*  And there was spinal headaches that you get afterwards. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5199.86s)]
*  So a couple of days afterwards, I had headaches, but I felt like I could enroll other people. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5201.98s)]
*  I can encourage other people to do it. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5207.38s)]
*  So I was going to New College in Sarasota, Florida, which, by the way, DeSantis is now [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5209.06s)]
*  trying to kill and has fired the president. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5214.3s)]
*  It's the most it's the Honors College of the state of Florida. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5217.5s)]
*  And it is. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5220.780000000001s)]
*  Why is he trying to kill it? [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5221.780000000001s)]
*  It's just what he's doing to public education. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5224.22s)]
*  I mean, this was the symbol of the most what he called the most woke school and a bunch [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5226.700000000001s)]
*  of transgender people, a bunch of open minded people. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5230.96s)]
*  It started as a private school in the 60s, merged with the state when they ran out of [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5236.34s)]
*  money. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5239.860000000001s)]
*  So he fired the president. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5240.860000000001s)]
*  He stacked the board of trustees and he's made he wants to turn it into a conservative [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5241.860000000001s)]
*  school. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5246.7s)]
*  He's doing it for political purposes to try to show that he's anti woke and that he is [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5247.7s)]
*  wanting to. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5252.14s)]
*  What's going on in public education in Florida is really frightening. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5253.66s)]
*  George Soros is actually interested in trying to help out at New College because George [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5260.22s)]
*  Soros actually, even though he's the boogeyman for a lot of the right wing, he funded the [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5265.74s)]
*  Central European University in Hungary as after communism. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5270.38s)]
*  And it was killed also by Orban in Hungary. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5276.0599999999995s)]
*  So you go after public education as a way to try to control intellectual narratives. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5278.82s)]
*  But anyway, I was at New College's school and we were experimenting with MDMA. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5284.66s)]
*  And so I got about 35 people or so to get spinal taps, not just from New College, but [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5289.42s)]
*  from all over. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5295.219999999999s)]
*  And the spinal taps showed that there was no problems with dopamine. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5295.94s)]
*  It was there was a little bit less serotonin metabolites, but also lower serotonin has [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5299.099999999999s)]
*  been linked to risk taking behavior. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5305.299999999999s)]
*  And so taking drugs is risk taking behavior, particularly when they're heavily criminalized. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5308.0199999999995s)]
*  So it was not evidence that it was serotonin neurotoxicity from MDMA, but it cleared dopamine. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5312.179999999999s)]
*  So these researchers should never have ignored their prior data. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5318.46s)]
*  They were just so willing to demonize MDMA to get more grant money. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5323.46s)]
*  So they were addicted to grant money. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5329.38s)]
*  Yeah, that seems to be the case with a lot of scientific studies, isn't it? [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5331.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5335.78s)]
*  It's a real problem when you're not just you're not just trying to find out what the truth is. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5336.78s)]
*  You're trying to find data that would reinforce whatever idea that you went into it looking [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5342.42s)]
*  to find in the first place and throw out information that is contrary to that. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5347.78s)]
*  Yeah, I'll say the best example of that for me was that I've done long term follow up [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5352.42s)]
*  studies to the work that Timothy Leary did at Harvard. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5357.9400000000005s)]
*  So the Good Friday experiment was in 1962. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5362.5s)]
*  The Good Friday experiment? [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5366.02s)]
*  Yeah, the Good Friday experiment is incredible. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5367.02s)]
*  So this was Aldous Huxley had written The Doors of Perception and was talking about [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5369.1s)]
*  mescaline and spiritual experiences. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5373.5s)]
*  And a lot of people who are doing work with LSD with alcoholics and others in the 50s [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5376.58s)]
*  would have these spiritual experiences as poor and Bill W. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5380.74s)]
*  who started Alcoholics Anonymous actually had an LSD experience in the 50s. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5385.38s)]
*  And what he's actually his first place getting sober was Belladonna. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5390.42s)]
*  So Bill W., the founder of AA, had a psychedelic experience that got him sober in the first [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5395.7s)]
*  place. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5400.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5401.58s)]
*  And then later about a decade or more later, he experimented with LSD and he felt that [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5402.58s)]
*  this LSD could be tremendous for. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5407.74s)]
*  What was his initial psychedelic experience that led him to get sober? [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5410.94s)]
*  Well it's Belladonna. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5414.099999999999s)]
*  What is Belladonna? [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5415.099999999999s)]
*  It's kind of when you think about what drugs did the witches use in the Middle Ages, it's [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5416.54s)]
*  a disorienting psychedelic. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5420.5s)]
*  I think it's scopolamine. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5423.38s)]
*  Oh, that stuff is crazy. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5425.34s)]
*  That's that devil's dust shit. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5428.98s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5430.34s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5431.34s)]
*  And that's the stuff that's supposed to turn people essentially into zombies that are like [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5432.34s)]
*  very easy to suggest. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5436.34s)]
*  Yeah, Wade Davis has done studies about the voodoo cults in Haiti and what drugs they [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5437.34s)]
*  use and they kind of tranquilize people, they bare them alive. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5443.660000000001s)]
*  They think that they're... [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5446.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they blow dust in their nose. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5447.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5449.34s)]
*  Scopolamine is also the stuff they use to stop people from getting motion sickness on boats, [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5450.34s)]
*  which is really crazy, like dramamine patches. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5454.1s)]
*  Well that illustrates the exact point though, that it's not the thing itself, it's how it's [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5457.42s)]
*  used. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5462.34s)]
*  It's the relationship you have with it. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5463.34s)]
*  It's the dose. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5464.5s)]
*  It's the route of administration. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5465.62s)]
*  It's how you do it. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5467.26s)]
*  So yeah, scopolamine helped him get off of alcohol. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5469.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5472.78s)]
*  You have this terrifying experience, things come to the surface, and it did help him. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5473.78s)]
*  And then when he did LSD in the 50s, and I met one of the women that gave him the LSD, [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5479.34s)]
*  Sydney Cohn was the man. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5485.46s)]
*  What he felt was that... [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5490.1s)]
*  We talk about in AA about hitting bottom. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5492.66s)]
*  That people's lives, when they hit bottom, then they're finally ready to make a change. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5496.46s)]
*  But that means that they've destroyed their families, they've destroyed their jobs, their [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5501.3s)]
*  health. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5506.9s)]
*  And so what Bill W. felt is that you could give LSD to people and they could psychologically [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5507.9s)]
*  hit bottom while they still had some intact relationships that would then help support [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5512.52s)]
*  them as they tried to move to sobriety. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5519.56s)]
*  And he felt that this could have a major role to play in AA. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5522.6s)]
*  But... [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5526.4400000000005s)]
*  Why didn't he ever incorporate it? [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5527.4400000000005s)]
*  It became too controversial. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5529.02s)]
*  And so he ended up... [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5531.8s)]
*  Working with cruder tools. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5533.360000000001s)]
*  Working with cruder tools. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5534.820000000001s)]
*  But there was a lot of work with LSD in the 60s for alcohol use disorder. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5536.42s)]
*  And it proved to be quite effective when supported. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5541.42s)]
*  So that these substances can be extremely helpful, again, used in a careful way. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5545.76s)]
*  So the Good Friday experiment was an attempt to understand, do... [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5552.36s)]
*  Can psychedelics produce a mystical experience? [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5560.2s)]
*  Walter Panky was a doctor and a minister and he was getting a PhD at Harvard. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5564.96s)]
*  And he was interested in looking at the spiritual potential of MDMA. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5571.52s)]
*  I mean of psilocybin. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5577.92s)]
*  And he worked with Timothy Leary and they did this experiment. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5579.4800000000005s)]
*  And they did it with a Reverend Howard Thurman. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5583.280000000001s)]
*  So Howard Thurman was an African American minister at Boston University's Marsh Chapel. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5586.240000000001s)]
*  Howard Thurman is someone who deserves a lot more attention because he studied with Gandhi. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5594.1s)]
*  He studied nonviolence with Gandhi. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5600.900000000001s)]
*  And then he became Martin Luther King's mentor. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5603.14s)]
*  And Martin Luther King got a PhD at Boston University. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5606.38s)]
*  And Howard Thurman was his mentor. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5609.42s)]
*  So Howard Thurman really helped the American Civil Rights Movement adopt the strategy of [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5610.900000000001s)]
*  nonviolence that he got from Gandhi. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5617.1s)]
*  And that's what we see in all of the stories about people being beaten by police, trying [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5621.18s)]
*  to protest, different things. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5628.8s)]
*  And they try to react. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5630.52s)]
*  So nonviolent resistance was a key to the American Civil Rights Movement. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5631.52s)]
*  And Howard Thurman was very interested in this connection between the mystical experience [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5635.92s)]
*  and political action. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5641.4800000000005s)]
*  So the mystical experience, you move beyond your sense of, I'm this biographical person. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5643.52s)]
*  I'm my tribe. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5650.76s)]
*  I'm my country. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5651.76s)]
*  I'm my religion. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5652.76s)]
*  There's something deeper that we're part of humanity. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5653.76s)]
*  We're part of energy. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5656.84s)]
*  I mean, if you look at the quantum level, we're all energy. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5657.84s)]
*  We're all connected in these different ways. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5660.16s)]
*  So when you feel that, and Rita Marley has this incredible album about Marley's wife, [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5662.320000000001s)]
*  and it's called Who Feels It Knows It. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5669.4400000000005s)]
*  Who Feels It Knows It. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5674.08s)]
*  So you can say this, and I can say this, and people can hear it. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5675.22s)]
*  But if you have an experience that you feel it, then you know it. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5678.08s)]
*  And so Howard Thurman was very interested in this idea of what are the political implications [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5681.88s)]
*  of this mystical experience. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5688.32s)]
*  And so Walter Panky was willing to work with him. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5691.62s)]
*  And Howard Thurman said, I will let you come to my church, Marsh Chapel, on Good Friday, [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5697.48s)]
*  and you can do an experiment with 20 divinity students from Andover Newton Theological Seminary. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5703.68s)]
*  And you can give them all a pill. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5709.360000000001s)]
*  And half will be psilocybin, half will be placebo, which was nicotinic acid, which gives [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5712.88s)]
*  you a flush. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5717.84s)]
*  And so this was done, and it was considered to be the most eloquently designed experiment [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5720.08s)]
*  ever done on whether psychedelics could produce a mystical experience. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5728.04s)]
*  And it showed that nine out of the 20 people had a mystical experience, eight out of the [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5733.76s)]
*  nine had the psilocybin, and then they did some long term, like six month follow ups, [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5739.0s)]
*  and they said it impacted their lives in certain ways. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5745.240000000001s)]
*  And then Walter Panky died in a terrible scuba diving accident in 1971. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5747.92s)]
*  And so a lot was ended with him. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5756.42s)]
*  And then the 1970 and the backlash against psychedelics. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5760.040000000001s)]
*  So now it's in the 80s, and I'm an undergraduate. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5762.92s)]
*  I dropped out of college for 10 years from 1972 to 1982. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5767.84s)]
*  And you have to do a thesis, a senior thesis at New College. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5774.04s)]
*  And I wanted to do psychedelic research, but psychedelic research was wiped out at the [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5776.8s)]
*  time, nothing to do. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5780.28s)]
*  You couldn't get permission to give psychedelics. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5781.8s)]
*  But I thought, if I go back to the Good Friday experiment, that I could do a long term follow [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5783.4800000000005s)]
*  up that is just asking people what happened to them when they took the psilocybin and [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5789.280000000001s)]
*  how do they think about it now. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5794.400000000001s)]
*  And I wouldn't have to get permission from the FDA or the DEA. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5796.320000000001s)]
*  I would just have to get permission from what's called an institutional review board, which [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5799.6s)]
*  our college had, just about the safety of the subject. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5803.02s)]
*  But I'm just asking them questions. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5805.52s)]
*  So that was the only way that I could do psychedelic research. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5807.64s)]
*  And it was incredible because in the mystical literature, the real test of the validity [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5811.360000000001s)]
*  of a mystical spiritual experience is called the fruits test. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5817.6s)]
*  Means what are the consequences in your life? [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5822.0s)]
*  What are the fruits of the experience? [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5824.4400000000005s)]
*  Does it make you more peaceful, more loving? [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5825.9400000000005s)]
*  Does it make you more reduce your fear of death? [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5827.6s)]
*  Does it give you more spiritual sense of how we're connected? [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5830.320000000001s)]
*  So that's the fruits test. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5833.14s)]
*  And so what I, you know, because people can describe all sorts of things, but what impact [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5834.84s)]
*  does it have in your life? [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5839.240000000001s)]
*  So I figured I can do a long term follow up. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5840.9800000000005s)]
*  And that's the fruits test. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5843.8s)]
*  And Walter Panky would have done it if he hadn't died. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5845.12s)]
*  But nobody else was doing it. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5850.4s)]
*  So I ended up trying to figure out how to do it. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5851.72s)]
*  I went to Andover Newton School and I said, nobody knew who the subjects were in the study. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5855.92s)]
*  So I went to the school and I went, which is outside of Boston, and I said, I'd like [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5862.12s)]
*  to put a note in the alumni newsletter. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5866.22s)]
*  Would you be willing to do that? [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5869.1s)]
*  And they said no. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5871.5s)]
*  They refused. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5872.56s)]
*  I said, this is the most important experiment ever in the history of mystical experiences [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5873.92s)]
*  and psychedelics with your students. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5877.52s)]
*  And I just want to ask them questions. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5879.84s)]
*  Would you let me put something in the alumni newsletter? [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5881.4400000000005s)]
*  And they said no. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5884.200000000001s)]
*  This is now 1986. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5885.200000000001s)]
*  And so I was like, oh, God, I was blocked. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5888.1s)]
*  Nobody, Tim Leary, nobody had the list. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5892.360000000001s)]
*  So I went to their library and I thought, maybe I'll see some books or something on [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5894.06s)]
*  this experiment. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5898.400000000001s)]
*  Nothing. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5899.400000000001s)]
*  The thesis that was done at Harvard, nothing. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5900.400000000001s)]
*  They had zero about this experiment. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5902.8s)]
*  It's like cultural amnesia. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5905.04s)]
*  But I'm wandering through the library and I noticed that they've got some books of the [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5906.92s)]
*  alumni and one of them had the list of all the students that were in school in 1962 and [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5910.4800000000005s)]
*  their names and their addresses. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5917.0s)]
*  I was like, wow, this is bonanza. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5918.4800000000005s)]
*  So I photocopied it all and then there was like 350 of them and I wrote a postcard to [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5921.28s)]
*  every single one of them. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5925.7s)]
*  And that led me to three of them wrote back saying that they were in the study. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5927.24s)]
*  And over years and years it took me but I identified 19 out of the 20 and I was able [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5930.7s)]
*  to go see them in person and interview them. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5937.54s)]
*  And this really validated my theory of change. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5940.42s)]
*  So my theory of change also, which you've shared a bit, is that if you have these spiritual [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5943.5599999999995s)]
*  connections, these spiritual experiences, that will make you think about the world in [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5949.3s)]
*  a different way, think about others in a different way. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5953.34s)]
*  And so what people said is that their mystical experiences really did reduce their fear [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5956.46s)]
*  of death, made them feel more connected to other people from different faiths, made them [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5961.58s)]
*  more ecumenical in a way, deepened their faith in their own religion. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5965.58s)]
*  It didn't turn them away but they saw it in a more symbolic rather than literal way. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5968.78s)]
*  But what I discovered, so it validated the results, but what I discovered is a big mistake [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5974.18s)]
*  that one of the persons in the study had heard the, Howard Thurman, by the way, the audio [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5983.099999999999s)]
*  of that service is up on our website. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5989.46s)]
*  If you go Good Friday Experiment, you can listen to Howard Thurman's Good Friday Experiment [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5992.099999999999s)]
*  speech, his sermons and stuff from 1962. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5996.58s)]
*  One of them was you have to tell people there's a man on the cross. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=5999.98s)]
*  You must tell people there's a man on the cross. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6003.18s)]
*  And one of the students under the influence of psilocybin said, yeah, I got to tell people [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6005.34s)]
*  there's a man on the cross. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6010.94s)]
*  I'm going to do it right now and I'm going to run out of this room and I'm going to run [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6012.259999999999s)]
*  down the road and I should tell the president, but the president is in D.C. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6014.7s)]
*  So I'll tell the president of the university. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6017.98s)]
*  And he goes running down the street and Walter Pankey and Houston Smith go running after [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6020.299999999999s)]
*  him. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6026.139999999999s)]
*  It's a busy street on Commonwealth Ave. in front of the Mars Chapel. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6027.139999999999s)]
*  And they finally catch him and he doesn't want to go inside. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6030.339999999999s)]
*  He's outside, he's tripping, he's like, got this mission. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6033.98s)]
*  And they give him a shot of Thorazine to tranquilize him, to bring him back inside. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6037.66s)]
*  And they never mentioned that at all. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6043.22s)]
*  Completely not mentioned it. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6046.02s)]
*  So I had this decision when I'm going to write this follow up study, you know, I said, I [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6047.02s)]
*  can't hide that. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6051.58s)]
*  So I did report that. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6052.820000000001s)]
*  And what was going on, I think, was in the culture was this exaggeration of the risks [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6054.9800000000005s)]
*  and suppression and minimization of the benefits. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6064.1s)]
*  And I think what Timothy Leary did in response was the opposite. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6067.740000000001s)]
*  He's like, OK, I can exaggerate the benefits. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6070.740000000001s)]
*  One dose, you're enlightened, you know more than everybody else. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6073.5s)]
*  And then he would minimize the risks. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6076.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's not good. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6078.620000000001s)]
*  It's terrible. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6080.42s)]
*  You can't do that. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6081.42s)]
*  You know, I think I had, I don't know if you ever saw the podcast, I had Alex Berenson [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6082.42s)]
*  on who wrote a book called Tell Your Children and it's all about the dangers of marijuana. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6087.14s)]
*  And I had him on with Dr. Mike Hart, who is a cannabis doctor in Canada. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6092.78s)]
*  And you know, one of the things that he was talking about was people for whatever reason, [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6099.38s)]
*  when they have a high dose of marijuana, there's something that happens to some of them where [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6106.139999999999s)]
*  they have like a schizophrenic break. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6113.219999999999s)]
*  And I have heard of it. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6115.46s)]
*  I know people who have had this. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6116.82s)]
*  And the pro marijuana people do not want to acknowledge this danger. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6119.7s)]
*  They want to paint marijuana as a completely innocuous substance that no one should worry [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6124.099999999999s)]
*  about. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6130.0599999999995s)]
*  And I think it's way too powerful for that. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6131.099999999999s)]
*  And I think too many people are psychologically or physiologically vulnerable. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6133.3s)]
*  We're not all the same. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6139.62s)]
*  And if someone is particularly vulnerable, whether it's towards schizophrenia or whatever [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6141.62s)]
*  mental illness it might be, there's something about these experiences that seem to send [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6147.26s)]
*  them over the edge. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6152.820000000001s)]
*  And that's something that we should be concerned with. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6154.14s)]
*  We should talk about it. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6155.820000000001s)]
*  We have to because if we become what we, the opposite of what we are worried about, or [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6156.820000000001s)]
*  actually we don't become the opposite, we become like them. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6163.42s)]
*  We just do the same. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6165.58s)]
*  So I think it's the same thing. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6166.58s)]
*  It's like we become the polar opposite. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6167.780000000001s)]
*  We just justify things that we find morally reprehensible. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6169.5s)]
*  We find ethically terrible. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6174.9s)]
*  And we justify it because we're doing it for the right side. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6177.86s)]
*  You can't. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6180.34s)]
*  You can't do that. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6181.34s)]
*  It's completely wrong. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6182.34s)]
*  So what we have to be... [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6183.34s)]
*  With anything, right? [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6184.34s)]
*  People talk to me a lot about where might the backlash come from. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6185.34s)]
*  For now we're very close. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6188.74s)]
*  We think now with two successful phase three studies, the second one was confirmatory. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6190.5s)]
*  So it's millions of chances that it was random and not real. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6196.08s)]
*  It's incredible results. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6200.92s)]
*  So we think by potentially June of 2024, we should have FDA... [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6202.74s)]
*  We have a good chance of having FDA approval. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6209.0599999999995s)]
*  I have a question for you. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6211.04s)]
*  Are there people, I've heard of people, that are for whatever reason resistant to DMT experiences? [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6212.72s)]
*  It doesn't work with them. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6220.46s)]
*  I think there are some and it could be biological. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6222.5199999999995s)]
*  We don't know. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6226.88s)]
*  It could be that they're just so... [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6227.88s)]
*  It could be that they're so resisting the experience. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6230.2s)]
*  So Stan Grof actually talked about work with obsessive compulsives that he did with LSD. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6232.5199999999995s)]
*  And he had some that he could give over a thousand micrograms of LSD, enormous amounts [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6237.5199999999995s)]
*  of LSD and they could still play chess. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6241.4s)]
*  So there's a way where you can control your mind so much that even psychedelics won't [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6243.8s)]
*  happen. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6250.64s)]
*  Wow. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6252.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6253.04s)]
*  So I think... [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6254.04s)]
*  I wonder, but there are people like... [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6255.04s)]
*  Jamie has a thing about edibles. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6256.8s)]
*  Like Jamie can kind of eat like a foot long sub from Subway. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6259.52s)]
*  I'm not kidding. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6267.08s)]
*  He can put down extraordinary amounts of edibles and he feels nothing. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6268.280000000001s)]
*  1350 is the highest I've gone. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6271.8s)]
*  Do you know how crazy that is? [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6274.8s)]
*  It's amazing. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6276.56s)]
*  1350. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6277.56s)]
*  Dude, 200 will put you on the moon. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6278.56s)]
*  I was at a concert, watching a concert, having conversations. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6281.08s)]
*  Well what about when you smoke? [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6284.64s)]
*  Is it different? [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6286.16s)]
*  No, sure. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6287.16s)]
*  Smoking works just fine. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6288.16s)]
*  Smoking works by the edibles. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6289.16s)]
*  It is a different drug when it's passed through your digestive system. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6290.16s)]
*  And that's right... [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6294.4s)]
*  We've talked about adenosium. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6295.4s)]
*  It's an 11-hydroxy metabolite. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6296.4s)]
*  So I'll just tell a funny story about my wife, Lynn, which was that her mother had pain. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6299.4s)]
*  Mary Ann, her mother had pain. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6305.12s)]
*  Lynn thought that, and I suggested actually, maybe small amounts of THC or CBD might help [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6308.240000000001s)]
*  her mom. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6314.360000000001s)]
*  And so Lynn was like, okay, I will try it first before I give it to my mom. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6315.76s)]
*  So she took a... [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6320.0s)]
*  I brought home edible, some chocolates, and she took one square, which was 10 milligrams [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6321.0s)]
*  of cannabis. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6326.320000000001s)]
*  She took it at her mom's assisted living place about an hour, about a mile away from where [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6328.4800000000005s)]
*  we live. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6332.52s)]
*  And then she's ready to drive home. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6334.200000000001s)]
*  And so she's driving home and she thinks nothing much is going to happen. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6335.36s)]
*  So the road starts tilting. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6338.639999999999s)]
*  She starts having a terrible time. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6340.24s)]
*  She barely gets to our house. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6342.48s)]
*  And then she's got this panic reaction because she is thinking that she might forget to breathe. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6344.4s)]
*  She might die because she's going to forget to breathe. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6350.5599999999995s)]
*  And our daughter Lila and our daughter Ellie were there with us and we were trying to cheer [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6354.2s)]
*  her up and like, you're not going to die. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6358.4s)]
*  But we're also massaging her feet and laughing at her. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6360.48s)]
*  But it was a horrible experience. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6362.719999999999s)]
*  So some people have edibles and they just have horrible experiences. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6364.8s)]
*  And other people get edibles and nothing happens. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6369.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6372.04s)]
*  It depends on so many factors, right? [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6373.04s)]
*  I think there's biological factors, there's your current level of anxiety. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6374.56s)]
*  But to just claim that it's innocuous, I think is just so foolish. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6378.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6381.68s)]
*  I think if there is a backlash where... [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6382.68s)]
*  The backlash in the 60s was political against psychedelics and hippies and stuff. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6384.56s)]
*  The backlash that happened in the late 70s, early 80s when it looked like marijuana might [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6389.4800000000005s)]
*  be legalized to his parents against the... [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6394.04s)]
*  Right. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6397.96s)]
*  Well, it's also all that Nancy Reagan, just say no shit. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6398.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6402.0s)]
*  That was when we have to really, for a person that's alive today, to understand the influence [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6403.0s)]
*  that media had on you when you were a child, it's almost impossible for you to wrap your [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6409.6s)]
*  head around. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6414.56s)]
*  But I want you to try. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6415.56s)]
*  The kids of today, you kids with your internet and your Google and being able to watch whatever [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6417.0s)]
*  you want to watch on television at any given time. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6421.44s)]
*  When I was a kid, when you saw something on television, everybody talked about it. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6424.08s)]
*  Those just say no commercials. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6429.32s)]
*  This is your brain on drugs. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6431.5199999999995s)]
*  Any questions? [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6433.36s)]
*  Had someone fry an egg? [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6434.36s)]
*  Well, it led to a lot of funny standup comedy bits, like Bill Hicks had a funny bit about [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6435.5199999999995s)]
*  it. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6441.0s)]
*  But it also led to a lot of people thinking literally you're going to fry your brain with [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6442.0s)]
*  drugs. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6446.28s)]
*  And it worked. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6447.28s)]
*  It worked on us. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6448.28s)]
*  It worked on a lot of fucking people. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6449.28s)]
*  The influence that they had by being able to do those kind of things and put them on [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6451.84s)]
*  television back then, it sets things back. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6454.76s)]
*  Everything takes a whole generation for people to get over. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6460.16s)]
*  If we go back to the early days of cannabis prohibition, when you watch the Reef of Madness [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6463.24s)]
*  films and you find out about this whole Harry Anslinger, William Randolph, Hearst connection, [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6469.44s)]
*  that it had a lot to do with that. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6478.2s)]
*  It actually had a lot to do with commodities like hemp versus nylon. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6480.32s)]
*  There's so many aspects to it that you would have never guessed. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6485.16s)]
*  But the point is that that propaganda from the 1930s turned something that had thousands [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6487.72s)]
*  of years of human use, demonized it, created a new name for it, used a Mexican slang name [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6494.4s)]
*  for tobacco. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6502.4s)]
*  And they turned it into this new drug. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6504.4s)]
*  And they labeled it saying that it was Mexicans and black men were raping white women on this [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6507.16s)]
*  drug. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6513.639999999999s)]
*  And then they have the guy smoking pot and jumping out a window. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6514.639999999999s)]
*  Reef of Madness is hilarious. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6517.08s)]
*  It is. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6518.08s)]
*  I have a poster of it. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6519.08s)]
*  But it worked for so long. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6520.08s)]
*  It does. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6521.08s)]
*  I have a poster from Reef of Madness. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6522.08s)]
*  Think about that time. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6523.88s)]
*  So that's the 30s. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6526.08s)]
*  And then you've got to get into the 60s before marijuana is popular again. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6527.08s)]
*  Literally, it has to burn through a generation of propaganda. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6531.92s)]
*  Their children have to learn from their parents' mistakes and realize that their parents are [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6536.14s)]
*  dumbasses. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6540.22s)]
*  And then they experiment with things and they have to learn from other people that are doing [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6541.58s)]
*  it. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6545.780000000001s)]
*  And then it goes to a point where it's at now, where now because of the internet, these [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6546.780000000001s)]
*  conversations are just everywhere. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6551.26s)]
*  There's so many maps videos. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6553.38s)]
*  The work that you guys have done is so extraordinary and so important. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6555.06s)]
*  Guys like Dr. Carl Hart, all these different people, Michael Pollan and his amazing book, [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6558.820000000001s)]
*  all these people that are talking about these experiences now, there's just this flood of [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6564.54s)]
*  information. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6568.9s)]
*  So you can't demonize it the same way. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6569.9s)]
*  But it's very important that the people that are on this side don't bullshit anybody. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6572.46s)]
*  It's so important. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6577.9s)]
*  And all of these people will be at psychedelic science too. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6578.9s)]
*  And I think that the trap that we have to avoid falling into is, and where the backlash [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6581.58s)]
*  will come from now if there is, is if we exaggerate the results and minimize the risks. [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6586.98s)]
*  And we have to be very careful that we don't do that. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6592.74s)]
*  It should be honest across the board. [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6595.54s)]
*  And I think if it is, there'll be an understanding by most people that you should be able to [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6597.5s)]
*  make educated informed decisions as to what to do with your consciousness because there [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6602.0199999999995s)]
*  might be a significant benefit available if you do that. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6605.94s)]
*  Yes. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6609.66s)]
*  Now, how will you educate your own kids? [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6610.66s)]
*  I know they're little, but how will you educate your own kids about drugs? [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6612.099999999999s)]
*  I tell them. [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6615.3s)]
*  I talk to my children the same way I would talk to a regular grown person. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6617.22s)]
*  I mean, I treat them with much more gentleness and kindness and as much love as I have. [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6622.62s)]
*  But I try to talk to them about things. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6627.66s)]
*  I'm like, there are drugs that are very, very dangerous. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6629.42s)]
*  They can kill you. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6632.5s)]
*  And one of the reasons why they can kill you is because they're illegal. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6633.5s)]
*  And I explain the whole thing. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6636.740000000001s)]
*  I explain that if drugs were legal, then you would know what the dose is, you would know [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6638.14s)]
*  who's making it, and it would be taxed. [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6642.84s)]
*  Because these drugs are made in these other countries where no one's watching. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6646.46s)]
*  And so they're bringing across drugs. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6651.26s)]
*  And to make these drugs cheaper for them and make it more potent, they mix in fentanyl. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6652.900000000001s)]
*  And I was explaining fentanyl. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6659.72s)]
*  And I was explaining that fentanyl is not just in cocaine, but it's also in fake ambience. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6661.18s)]
*  Somebody might give you a sleeping pill, fake Xanax. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6667.04s)]
*  So we talk about these things. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6670.28s)]
*  That's so good. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6671.42s)]
*  And the stand-up comedy community has gotten contaminated with fentanyl, and people have [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6672.5s)]
*  died from that. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6676.18s)]
*  In the stand-up comedy community, there's a group of guys who died from fentanyl-laced [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6677.18s)]
*  cocaine, I believe. [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6682.82s)]
*  That was what it was proven to be, was it, Jamie? [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6684.78s)]
*  I think, pretty sure. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6687.9400000000005s)]
*  It's a real problem. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6689.9800000000005s)]
*  It's a real problem. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6692.1s)]
*  So I talk to them about it, and I explain that we have stuck our heels in the sand. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6693.1s)]
*  We've dug our heels in on something that is objectively not just ineffective, but very [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6700.66s)]
*  detrimental to society as a whole. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6706.36s)]
*  And that's having drugs be illegal. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6709.38s)]
*  Because if you have drugs illegal, you're not going to stop people from taking drugs. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6712.14s)]
*  What you're going to do is funnel all the cash to criminals. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6716.06s)]
*  It's what happened in Prohibition, the 1900s in America, and it's what's happening right [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6719.78s)]
*  now in Mexico. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6724.8s)]
*  And after Prohibition ended of alcohol, shortly after that, marijuana became prohibited. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6726.5s)]
*  We had the police apparatus. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6730.620000000001s)]
*  They needed something to prohibit. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6731.620000000001s)]
*  And they said, oh, we'll go after Mexicans and blacks and cannabis, and no, marijuana. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6733.820000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6739.3s)]
*  It was literally right after Prohibition ended, then the marijuana prohibition began. [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6740.3s)]
*  It was very closely connected. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6744.620000000001s)]
*  And such a coordinated effort. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6746.780000000001s)]
*  But back then, if you had the newspaper, if you were William Randolph Hearst and you had [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6749.0s)]
*  the newspaper, you could write whatever the fuck you wanted. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6753.86s)]
*  You could just make up the news. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6757.0599999999995s)]
*  Well, we've got a lot of that going on right now. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6758.46s)]
*  We do have a little bit of that going on right now. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6760.299999999999s)]
*  But at least now, you have enough people that can point that out and say, that's not true. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6761.82s)]
*  But back then, you had nothing. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6766.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but people may not be willing to go to multiple sources. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6767.66s)]
*  A lot of times, people only stay with it. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6771.299999999999s)]
*  It's also when you find out that someone that you respect, like a newspaper you respect, [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6773.54s)]
*  is bullshitting, which does happen. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6778.58s)]
*  You go, god damn it, why are you guys bullshitting? [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6780.58s)]
*  You can't bullshit. [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6783.1s)]
*  I love you. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6784.1s)]
*  I trust you. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6785.1s)]
*  You're the journalist. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6786.1s)]
*  You're the real journalist. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6787.1s)]
*  We need them. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6788.360000000001s)]
*  We need the New York Times. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6789.360000000001s)]
*  We need these people. [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6790.360000000001s)]
*  But they have to be real journalists. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6791.360000000001s)]
*  You can't be an ideological soldier who hides certain information to protect what you think [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6793.58s)]
*  is right. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6799.740000000001s)]
*  OK, so that gets me to the Concord Prison Experiment. [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6800.740000000001s)]
*  That was the other thing that Timothy Leary did. [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6803.58s)]
*  So what he said was that, yeah, people talk about their mystical experiences, and then [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6806.02s)]
*  maybe they can say how that's changed their lives, but that's sort of subjective. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6811.22s)]
*  But if we can give psilocybin to prisoners and then help them have these pro-social experiences, [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6815.780000000001s)]
*  work through their traumas, and then when they're released, then we can reduce their [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6821.9400000000005s)]
*  recidivism. [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6825.780000000001s)]
*  They will now be ready to make a new reentry into society, and that that's an objective [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6826.780000000001s)]
*  thing. [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6831.860000000001s)]
*  So the next thing that Timothy Leary decided to do was the Concord Prison Experiment. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6832.860000000001s)]
*  And this was a tremendous experiment. [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6837.22s)]
*  They gave about 35 people psilocybin experiences inside prison. [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6839.5199999999995s)]
*  Timothy Leary and others, the researchers would go into the prison, and half the researchers [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6846.639999999999s)]
*  would also take psilocybin. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6851.0s)]
*  And with the prisoners in prison. [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6853.599999999999s)]
*  And this was a way to try to help them to reduce the experiment or experimente kind [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6855.72s)]
*  of idea. [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6861.2s)]
*  And the Concord Prison Experiment was considered to be one of the most successful psychedelic [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6862.48s)]
*  experiences and studies of the 60s that ever there was. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6867.72s)]
*  And unfortunately, all the records were lost of who was in the experiment. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6872.2s)]
*  So after I did the Good Friday experiment follow up after 25 years and found 19 out [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6877.96s)]
*  of the 20, I went to Tim and others and like, do you have any idea who was in the Concord [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6883.76s)]
*  Prison Experiment? [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6887.6s)]
*  They had no records whatsoever. [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6888.6s)]
*  So I didn't think I could do anything. [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6890.62s)]
*  1991, I published a paper in the Journal of Transpersonal Psychology about the Good Friday [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6892.400000000001s)]
*  experiment. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6897.2s)]
*  And there was an editorial in the Boston Globe about it, op ed. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6898.639999999999s)]
*  And I got a call afterwards from a fellow, Michael Forsythe, and he said that he worked [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6902.7s)]
*  for the Department of Corrections. [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6907.12s)]
*  And they had a special room where they collect the records of their famous and interesting [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6908.88s)]
*  prisoners. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6912.92s)]
*  Like they had Malcolm X and his records and others. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6913.92s)]
*  And they had the records of all the people from the Concord Prison Experiment. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6917.8s)]
*  And he said, Would you like to do a follow up study? [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6922.08s)]
*  I said, I would love to do it. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6924.28s)]
*  It took us a whole year to get permission. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6927.200000000001s)]
*  We had to go all the way up to the governor. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6929.400000000001s)]
*  It was Governor Weld at the time. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6930.64s)]
*  And the paper that came back was hilarious that said that we got permission because somebody [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6932.52s)]
*  had scribbled on it, No psilocybin. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6937.400000000001s)]
*  Like we were not planning to get psilocybin. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6940.280000000001s)]
*  We were just going to look at their prison records. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6941.68s)]
*  But they were like, No psilocybin. [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6943.4400000000005s)]
*  For sure. [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6945.160000000001s)]
*  Isn't that funny? [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6946.160000000001s)]
*  It was just. [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6947.160000000001s)]
*  Imagine if they had done psilocybin. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6948.160000000001s)]
*  They would have never written that. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6950.160000000001s)]
*  They would not have. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6952.040000000001s)]
*  Never. [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6953.040000000001s)]
*  It's only people that haven't done it. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6954.040000000001s)]
*  They must be curious. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6955.8s)]
*  Well, I have had a lot of good conversations with DEA people and police because what they're [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6957.04s)]
*  taught about drugs, if they believe it, nobody would ever do these drugs. [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6962.24s)]
*  Right. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6965.64s)]
*  And so why is why is everyone doing if they're not awesome? [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6966.64s)]
*  If they're horrible. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6969.12s)]
*  So I've tried to explain to them and I could. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6970.12s)]
*  Oh, I did it when I was legal. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6971.4800000000005s)]
*  But you try to do it in a way where you don't encourage them to react in a negative way. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6972.4800000000005s)]
*  So I did this follow up to the good to the Concord Prison Experiment. [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6977.64s)]
*  All right. [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6980.56s)]
*  While I'm doing this experiment and tracking people's criminal justice system records in [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6981.6s)]
*  the decades, this was like a 34 year follow up. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6987.6s)]
*  It started becoming clear to me that the experiment wasn't a success. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6990.84s)]
*  But it was. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6995.92s)]
*  And I was the one that was like wanting to do the follow up to bring attention to it [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=6996.92s)]
*  because I thought it was a success. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7000.68s)]
*  Now was it. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7003.360000000001s)]
*  Here's a thought. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7004.96s)]
*  Were these people still in jail? [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7006.72s)]
*  They free. [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7008.120000000001s)]
*  Some of them were in jail. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7009.120000000001s)]
*  Some of them were in jail. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7010.12s)]
*  Some of them were free. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7011.12s)]
*  But what I discovered was a trick that Leary had done to try to make the results look good. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7012.599999999999s)]
*  And and then it was like and the trick is simple is that just think about this. [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7020.48s)]
*  When you're in jail, the first day that you get off jail, you probably have nobody goes [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7025.2s)]
*  back to jail. [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7030.84s)]
*  You know, but if you look two years out, more people will have had a chance to commit crimes [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7031.84s)]
*  to go back to jail. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7036.64s)]
*  So the longer you're out of jail, the more likely you are to go back. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7037.64s)]
*  So the group of people that had been in this experiment had been on average, they'd been [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7041.04s)]
*  out of jail 10 months when they looked at their recidivism. [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7050.12s)]
*  Some had been longer, some had been shorter. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7053.54s)]
*  And the researchers, Ralph Metzner and Tim Leary, they had done a base rate study of [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7056.4400000000005s)]
*  all the people that got released from the Concord Prison Experiment in the years before [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7061.04s)]
*  they did it. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7064.4800000000005s)]
*  And they published their results. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7066.14s)]
*  So they compared it was a little bit historical. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7067.92s)]
*  But so things don't always say the same exactly in history. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7069.5199999999995s)]
*  But that was the best that they could do to compare it. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7072.08s)]
*  But what I discovered is that they had published the results of this base rate study in a really [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7074.679999999999s)]
*  obscure journal, a British criminology journal. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7079.08s)]
*  And you know, I had to go down in the dusty libraries of Harvard Law Library, the Widener [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7083.08s)]
*  Library to even find this journal. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7088.28s)]
*  And when I read it, what I learned is that they had taken data from people that were [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7090.5199999999995s)]
*  out of prison for 30 months and compared it to people that were out of prison for 10 months. [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7095.38s)]
*  Complete scientific fraud. [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7102.179999999999s)]
*  And so then I'm like, shit, how is it that all the people that hate psychedelics didn't [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7104.28s)]
*  discover this? [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7110.78s)]
*  And everybody has thought, including me, that this is a great experiment and tremendously [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7112.38s)]
*  successful. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7116.179999999999s)]
*  And now what do I do? [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7117.38s)]
*  And I'm like, I've got to report what I find. [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7119.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7122.58s)]
*  So I ended up. [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7123.28s)]
*  What were they pretending they had done? [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7124.28s)]
*  They were pretending to have reduced recidivism. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7128.08s)]
*  Then they were also pretending that. [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7130.28s)]
*  By a significant amount? [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7132.679999999999s)]
*  By a substantial amount, yeah. [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7133.88s)]
*  And they were just monkeying with the numbers. [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7136.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7138.28s)]
*  Well, the farther away it was in time from the original experiment, the better the results [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7138.78s)]
*  were reported over and over in time. [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7144.48s)]
*  So what they'd also said is that some of the people that had gone back to prison who'd [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7146.88s)]
*  gotten psilocybin didn't go back to prison for new crimes. [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7151.78s)]
*  They'd gone back because they had violated their probation for something. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7155.28s)]
*  Could I? [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7158.98s)]
*  Here's a thought on this. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7160.28s)]
*  What the like the recidivism stuff is definitely fraud. [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7162.28s)]
*  But asking for someone to not go back to a life of crime after they've been incarcerated [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7165.78s)]
*  is a tremendous ask. [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7173.679999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7175.38s)]
*  And I think that if you're measuring the success of a psychedelic experience for the normal [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7175.98s)]
*  person, if a normal person doesn't have a pattern in their life of committing crime [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7181.68s)]
*  and being incarcerated, the problem with becoming sort of institutionalized and you become accustomed [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7187.780000000001s)]
*  to certain patterns of behavior, to ask someone to just stop doing that forever is a huge [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7194.4800000000005s)]
*  life shift. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7202.58s)]
*  Like even if they had a positive net benefit of their psychedelic experience, asking them [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7203.58s)]
*  to not commit crime, if you know a guy who's been in jail a couple of times and he grows [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7209.38s)]
*  up in a terrible neighborhood and there's crime all around him, his parents are committing [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7215.08s)]
*  crime, it's normal to just do crime. [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7218.88s)]
*  And if you have a psychedelic experience, getting you to stop doing any crime ever again [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7221.38s)]
*  is a big ask. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7226.48s)]
*  It's a big ask. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7228.08s)]
*  Yes. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7229.28s)]
*  The recidivism rate is really high for a lot of criminals, right? [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7229.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7234.179999999999s)]
*  And Leary and Ralph Metzner, they realized that what they needed to do was to provide [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7234.780000000001s)]
*  support and aftercare after people got out of prison. [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7240.9800000000005s)]
*  And just as they realized that, they started creating support groups, that's where they [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7244.88s)]
*  got kicked out of Harvard. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7248.780000000001s)]
*  And so those support groups fell apart. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7250.58s)]
*  And so what kind of an experiment we would need to do today would be to both, see this [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7253.38s)]
*  was an overvaluation of the psychedelic experience by itself. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7260.18s)]
*  And it didn't really understand the social support that you need and all the cultural [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7263.98s)]
*  determinants of people that go back to prison. [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7267.68s)]
*  And so the experiment that needs to be done is helping people have these psychedelic experiences, [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7270.08s)]
*  move through their traumas, kind of have these powerful positive experiences of connection, [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7276.68s)]
*  but then the support that you need afterwards. [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7282.18s)]
*  And this is the same way in our research. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7284.08s)]
*  You do the therapy with MDMA and then you do integrative work without the MDMA afterwards. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7285.88s)]
*  And that's what makes it last. [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7293.38s)]
*  And so what we're going to try to do in Iceland will be with the Minister of Justice, it will [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7296.28s)]
*  be the proper kind of experiment. [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7301.48s)]
*  And so it would be both work inside prison and then support afterwards. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7303.78s)]
*  And so I think there is this tendency, yeah, to overvalue the psychedelic experience and [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7307.98s)]
*  separate it out from the therapy and from the aftercare and from the integration. [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7313.18s)]
*  And I think that, so I felt like I had to report and debunk this experiment that was [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7317.38s)]
*  considered to be one of the best examples of the power of psychedelic therapy. [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7324.08s)]
*  I'm glad you did. [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7328.48s)]
*  It's very powerful. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7329.68s)]
*  And that's absolutely the correct thing to do. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7330.68s)]
*  I feel like having one psychedelic experience for someone who's gone through a lifetime [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7333.38s)]
*  is currently incarcerated or just got out of jail, is like someone having a terrible [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7338.68s)]
*  staph infection and giving them a small amount of antibiotics and going, oh, it didn't work. [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7344.38s)]
*  Like you don't have the right dose, you don't have the right duration, and you don't have [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7350.9800000000005s)]
*  the right care. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7354.38s)]
*  I think someone who's in that bad, like there's people that have pulled themselves out of [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7355.38s)]
*  being incarcerated and become exemplary human beings, right? [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7361.18s)]
*  Bernard Hopkins, one of my favorite boxers of all time, is a great example of that. [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7364.9800000000005s)]
*  He learned how to box in jail, got out, and became like just all-time great and was super [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7368.18s)]
*  disciplined, never drank, never smoked, just ate clean. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7374.08s)]
*  But to get someone out of that life and have them reincorporate into society, it's a task. [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7378.18s)]
*  I think it's a task. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7385.4800000000005s)]
*  And I think it's a task that could be accomplished with the right tools. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7386.9800000000005s)]
*  And I think the right tools are psychedelics along with counseling. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7390.9800000000005s)]
*  If they could do, I mean, they do that with drug counseling, right? [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7395.18s)]
*  Where someone has an addiction, they'll put them in a rehab, they have this rehab place [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7397.78s)]
*  they stay at for three months. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7402.58s)]
*  They do that to people all the time. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7403.98s)]
*  Why can't they do that the other way? [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7406.179999999999s)]
*  Like rehabilitate them back into society, not just... [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7408.98s)]
*  Well, and not just that, but when people get out of the military. [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7411.98s)]
*  Yes. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7414.78s)]
*  Right? [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7415.78s)]
*  You could do all the boot camps to get into the military, and then when you're done, you're [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7416.78s)]
*  just like, okay, you're done. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7419.179999999999s)]
*  Especially guys that have seen violent combat. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7420.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7423.179999999999s)]
*  Well, that raises another issue, which is that we're now starting research in about [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7425.18s)]
*  eight different VAs with different studies with MDMA. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7430.68s)]
*  Actually, one thing I did last night, which was tremendous, and what I really like to [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7434.9800000000005s)]
*  do, because I got here early so I could be here on time today, is that I love to smoke [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7441.18s)]
*  pot and go wandering around cities after midnight. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7446.280000000001s)]
*  Whoa. [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7450.18s)]
*  You're a risk taker, Rick Doblin. [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7452.18s)]
*  Well, you kind of get a feel for the city a little bit different at night than during [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7454.18s)]
*  the day. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7459.18s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7460.18s)]
*  Okay, so what I did is I went from the hotel, I just wandered, and I wandered to the Capitol. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7461.18s)]
*  And I just walked around. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7466.780000000001s)]
*  The Capitol is a beautiful building, but nobody was there. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7467.780000000001s)]
*  Nobody was there at all. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7471.1s)]
*  Occasionally, I would pass people who were homeless or people talking about crack or [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7472.1s)]
*  something to get there. [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7476.46s)]
*  They were talking about crack? [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7478.18s)]
*  Were they offering it to you? [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7479.58s)]
*  No, I heard somebody across the street yelling about crack. [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7480.98s)]
*  But I get to the Texas State House, and I'm just like, it's gorgeous, it's beautiful. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7485.58s)]
*  I noticed that there was a lot of scaffolding on it. [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7493.9s)]
*  But I thought here in the middle of the night, but well after midnight, in a place where [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7496.879999999999s)]
*  conservative policies are coming out of it, the Texas legislature is currently considering [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7507.66s)]
*  a rider to allocate $2.1 million to a study of MDMA at the Houston VA with veterans with [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7513.34s)]
*  PTSD. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7521.94s)]
*  And two years before, they have allocated a similar amount of money for a psilocybin [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7523.94s)]
*  study in veterans with PTSD at the Houston VA. [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7530.7s)]
*  And Lynette Averell, who's going to be the principal investigator, she hasn't started [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7535.38s)]
*  the psilocybin study quite yet because she got pregnant and had a child, and now she's [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7538.62s)]
*  getting back to it. [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7542.7s)]
*  But it's going to Baylor College of Medicine and the Houston VA. [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7543.7s)]
*  So I just had this feeling of the legislature is under repair with all of the scaffolding, [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7547.06s)]
*  but in this place out of which so much conservative policies are coming, so is support for psychedelics. [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7553.5s)]
*  And it just gave me such a warm feeling. [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7560.22s)]
*  And again, it's like not demonizing everything's all bad, but it was really a nice way to feel [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7562.54s)]
*  the grandeur of the building and to think that, yeah, we need to do a lot of renovation [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7569.54s)]
*  of our policies. [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7574.9s)]
*  And this work that's being done, yeah, Governor Perry is helping with it. [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7578.26s)]
*  Well, that's great. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7582.22s)]
*  Someone in the people of his generation in particular get invested like people like Nugent. [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7583.66s)]
*  But it seems like we're on the right end of this cycle because of the Internet. [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7588.9s)]
*  I don't think you're ever going to experience this is your brain on drugs moment again. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7593.139999999999s)]
*  That's not going to work anymore. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7597.259999999999s)]
*  I don't think so. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7598.339999999999s)]
*  I know you're right. [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7599.339999999999s)]
*  So because of the information that's available, because of the work you guys have done, because [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7600.339999999999s)]
*  of all the various videos and podcasts and books, and there's so much work documentaries, [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7603.339999999999s)]
*  there's so much work that's been done that people kind of understand there's real great [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7609.299999999999s)]
*  benefits. [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7613.62s)]
*  I think the Michael Pollan's book, How to Change Your Mind, and then the Netflix series, [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7614.62s)]
*  the Four Seers, that has changed lots of people's minds. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7618.54s)]
*  Well, he's such a respected journalist, you know, from doing the Omnivore's Dilemma was [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7620.94s)]
*  amazing. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7625.5s)]
*  And then to sort of get him invested in something like this is very, very powerful, very influential. [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7626.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7632.9s)]
*  So again, like what you're saying is so important. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7633.9s)]
*  Everything has to be completely honest. [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7636.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7639.0199999999995s)]
*  And it doesn't work for everybody. [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7640.0199999999995s)]
*  We don't have to say it works for everybody. [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7641.58s)]
*  And we shouldn't get in the trap. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7643.22s)]
*  It doesn't even mean it doesn't work. [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7644.22s)]
*  It just didn't work that way. [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7645.54s)]
*  And also there can be risks. [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7647.18s)]
*  It didn't work by itself. [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7648.18s)]
*  Because it's always a benefit risk balance. [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7649.18s)]
*  We don't have to pretend there's no risks. [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7652.14s)]
*  So the moment that we're at is just this incredible moment. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7654.22s)]
*  So now we have two successful Phase 3 studies. [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7657.02s)]
*  We have a nonprofit that is 100% owner of a public benefit corp. [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7660.22s)]
*  We do have some money from investors. [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7663.9400000000005s)]
*  But our challenge now over the next couple months is where do we get the money to get [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7667.3s)]
*  us to two different points? [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7674.5s)]
*  The first point is from here to FDA approval. [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7675.94s)]
*  We think that's going to be potentially, if all goes well, something like June 2024. [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7678.5599999999995s)]
*  But then there's going to be about another year and a half or a bit more potentially [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7684.98s)]
*  till we reach what's called sustainability. [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7689.219999999999s)]
*  And so sustainability is when income from the sale of MDMA equals what all of our costs [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7692.379999999999s)]
*  We start amassing resources for more research, for more studies, for work that MAPS is doing. [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7701.3s)]
*  Because MAPS would still be the... [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7707.54s)]
*  So what we have this chance to either keep MAPS as the sole owner of the public benefit [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7708.9400000000005s)]
*  corp or we may have to turn it into a publicly traded company if we don't find the philanthropy [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7716.7s)]
*  that we need and we need to take investors and these investors want us to turn this into [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7725.28s)]
*  Yeah, that was a wild conversation that we had the other night at the bar. [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7729.54s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7732.74s)]
*  And one of the things that you said struck me and I thought about a lot is you said these [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7733.74s)]
*  are sacred substances. [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7736.42s)]
*  And when you get them mixed with commerce, you have to be really careful. [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7738.54s)]
*  It's very dangerous. [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7743.06s)]
*  You're mixing something that could potentially change the way the whole world looks at life. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7745.38s)]
*  And you're mixing them with something that doesn't give a fuck about anything other than [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7753.56s)]
*  profit. [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7756.84s)]
*  And that's just what the nature of that thing is. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7758.22s)]
*  That's the nature of corporations and capitalism. [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7762.02s)]
*  They constantly want to make more money. [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7765.62s)]
*  Every quarter, every year, more money, more money. [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7769.740000000001s)]
*  And they're trying to figure out a way to benefit their stockholders. [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7772.66s)]
*  That's their primary concern. [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7776.38s)]
*  Yes. [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7777.38s)]
*  Unless you got some... [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7778.38s)]
*  Well, it would have to be private. [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7779.38s)]
*  It would still have to be some genius benefactor who's some Elon Musk type character who comes [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7781.38s)]
*  along and decides to fund it, which could happen and would save you from that. [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7786.92s)]
*  But if you just went public, my worry is that you're getting involved in commerce with psychedelics. [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7791.28s)]
*  And that just doesn't feel like the way to do it. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7800.76s)]
*  It feels like all that stuff should be completely legal. [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7806.04s)]
*  And we should kind of wait until you guys and the way your work kicks in and all the [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7810.16s)]
*  influence and the people that vote get an understanding of what the real landscape is. [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7816.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7822.28s)]
*  Now, there's a fellow that Jeff George is on our... [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7823.28s)]
*  He's the chair of the board of the MAPS Public Benefit Corp. [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7827.5599999999995s)]
*  And he used to be the CEO of Sandoz, which is one of the world's largest generics. [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7830.66s)]
*  was where Albert Hoffman invented LSD and where Albert also first synthesized psilocybin. [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7836.22s)]
*  So Jeff has got incredible pharmaceutical experience. [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7842.780000000001s)]
*  And he's been trying to help educate me about that we have a tremendous opportunity in a [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7847.08s)]
*  way if we do need to take investors and do need to become a publicly traded company, [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7854.52s)]
*  that we could be an example for the entire pharmaceutical industry. [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7860.02s)]
*  We could be an example of a public benefit psychedelic pharmaceutical company with majority [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7864.36s)]
*  control. [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7869.48s)]
*  Hopefully we could remain a majority control owner of a nonprofit. [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7870.48s)]
*  And so I appreciate your reaction to this because he said there may be several different [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7874.84s)]
*  ways in which there could be benefits from going public. [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7879.639999999999s)]
*  I got to pee again. [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7883.08s)]
*  I hate to say it. [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7884.759999999999s)]
*  But I want to hear these benefits though. [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7885.759999999999s)]
*  So when I come back, we'll go over these benefits. [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7887.42s)]
*  The diaper idea. [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7889.599999999999s)]
*  No, no, no diapers. [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7890.599999999999s)]
*  I'm just drinking a lot of water. [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7891.599999999999s)]
*  Sorry. [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7892.599999999999s)]
*  Sorry folks. [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7893.6s)]
*  We're back. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7894.6s)]
*  Okay. [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7895.6s)]
*  So where were we? [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7896.6s)]
*  We were the benefits of taking your company maps public. [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7897.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7901.400000000001s)]
*  So and I'd appreciate your reaction. [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7902.400000000001s)]
*  My reaction and my initial knee jerk reaction in the bar and even now is like idealistic. [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7904.0s)]
*  You know, like I'm looking at it like, man, don't mix. [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7910.72s)]
*  Don't mix love with money, man. [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7913.9800000000005s)]
*  You know, so I recognize my own bias in it, but I just get nervous when you're talking [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7916.64s)]
*  about. [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7920.96s)]
*  But then there probably is some upside. [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7921.96s)]
*  And one of the upsides is maybe that would accelerate the path to legalization. [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7924.56s)]
*  Well, I my preference is philanthropy. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7929.64s)]
*  And so I'd like to appeal to anybody who's listening if they want to donate substantial [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7933.38s)]
*  amounts of money. [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7938.36s)]
*  How much do you need? [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7939.36s)]
*  Well, we are currently developing a budget in the range of seventy five million dollars [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7940.72s)]
*  to FDA approval. [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7946.08s)]
*  And then after FDA approval, there is going to be another raise that we're going to need [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7949.36s)]
*  to make to get to this sustainability point. [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7955.5199999999995s)]
*  But once we have FDA approval, there's many options that we will have that we're not so [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7958.799999999999s)]
*  much open to us now. [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7963.0s)]
*  So for example, we've been approached by people, big company in Korea that was interested in [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7965.0s)]
*  buying the rights for Asia for a Jimmy. [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7971.88s)]
*  So we're trying to narrow them down to Korea. [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7975.7s)]
*  But we could with FDA approval, it'll be pretty clear that other countries will give reciprocity [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7978.42s)]
*  that we can make it. [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7983.58s)]
*  So we might be able to sell rights to different countries so that we can keep the nonprofit, [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7984.68s)]
*  the 100 percent owner of the public benefit corp. [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7990.34s)]
*  We would have more options to do royalty shares because then there are people that the mission [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7992.660000000001s)]
*  related people that have through Ryan Zura that have given us this forty three million [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=7999.280000000001s)]
*  dollars. [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8002.900000000001s)]
*  They're gambling that we may get it approved. [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8004.54s)]
*  And then the royalties come only if we get it approved. [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8008.34s)]
*  Post approval, it will be able to get a much better deal. [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8010.0599999999995s)]
*  Our valuation will be higher. [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8013.099999999999s)]
*  We could get loans potentially on this income form that looks like the downside of going [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8014.96s)]
*  public. [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8022.78s)]
*  OK, so well, the downside for me is right now, the potential downside is right now with [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8023.78s)]
*  With MAPS as the 100 percent owner of the benefit corp, net zero trauma by 2070 is the [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8030.62s)]
*  new vision. [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8037.58s)]
*  And what that means is we've talked about working with prisoners. [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8038.58s)]
*  But I want to work with refugees. [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8042.96s)]
*  I want to work with people in Rwanda that have been traumatized by genocide. [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8044.22s)]
*  I want to go all over the world and try to globalize MDMA assisted therapy in a way where [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8048.0599999999995s)]
*  we go where the trauma is, not necessarily where the money is. [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8054.62s)]
*  And that we put this global perspective of net zero trauma by 2070, mass mental health, [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8058.62s)]
*  spiritualized humanity. [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8063.48s)]
*  You know, we're destroying the environment. [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8064.48s)]
*  We've got incredible proliferation of nuclear weapons. [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8066.599999999999s)]
*  You know, whether humans survive is not a sure thing. [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8071.24s)]
*  And so I think if we're more stable, if we're not seeing the world through all these filters [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8075.3s)]
*  of pain and past traumas. [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8078.92s)]
*  So I think one of the upsides, you could say, of having the public benefit corp be wholly [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8081.12s)]
*  owned by the nonprofit is that we can focus on public benefit and that that's the thing. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8087.160000000001s)]
*  I think that when you start having publicly traded companies, you could say there's no [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8092.22s)]
*  one it's not pure public benefit or pure returns to investors, but it's somewhere along the [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8097.9800000000005s)]
*  line. [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8103.900000000001s)]
*  We're along this line. [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8104.900000000001s)]
*  Some ethical capitalism balance. [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8105.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8108.42s)]
*  And so I think that with all the money from philanthropists, it will be towards public [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8109.68s)]
*  benefit. [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8114.5s)]
*  We're really trying to prioritize giving returns to the returns to the donors are in a better [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8115.86s)]
*  world. [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8121.1s)]
*  That's the return. [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8122.46s)]
*  The the and that's I'd say the advantage. [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8123.58s)]
*  The the the risk, depending on where the capital comes from and what kind of conditions they [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8126.86s)]
*  put on it, is that we start now maybe need to think about more returns to investors. [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8132.38s)]
*  And where does the where do we go for the money rather than where do we go to reduce [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8139.14s)]
*  the trauma? [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8144.14s)]
*  But I think we can have a good example of a public benefit corp, hopefully at least [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8146.18s)]
*  majority owned by the nonprofit, that can do an enormous amount of good in the world. [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8153.7s)]
*  But I just think that we could do an enormous amount of good plus if it's funded by philanthropy. [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8158.54s)]
*  So I think the worst loss of public benefit for us would be to run out of money and to [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8163.46s)]
*  never make it into a medicine at all. [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8169.02s)]
*  So if we have to take money from investors, I think we should do that. [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8172.26s)]
*  And so we're exploring different options. [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8177.46s)]
*  Is it biotech investors? [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8179.78s)]
*  All the hippies are definitely going to push back. [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8182.34s)]
*  Right. [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8184.7s)]
*  They will. [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8185.7s)]
*  But and I hope that some of those wealthy hippies decide to donate to make it into a [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8186.7s)]
*  philanthropy. [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8193.7s)]
*  So but I do think that it's our obligation to make it into a medicine one way or another. [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8194.7s)]
*  Even if we do take it from investors to do it in structured in such a way where it's [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8200.7s)]
*  still within a public benefit structure. [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8207.1s)]
*  And so we will try to develop metrics to evaluate public benefit. [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8210.18s)]
*  We will try to ensure governance controls so that it does stay more focused on public [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8214.42s)]
*  benefit. [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8219.18s)]
*  But, you know, it would be a lot easier if we could do this in a way through philanthropy. [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8220.18s)]
*  And also, we are the leading. [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8226.22s)]
*  There's hundreds of psychedelic for-profit companies and a few nonprofits, but we're [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8228.220000000001s)]
*  the only one that has completed phase three. [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8231.7s)]
*  So we have two successful phase three studies. [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8235.5s)]
*  I'd like us to be a model for the entire field. [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8237.74s)]
*  And again, what you're saying about telling the truth or underestimating, you know, risks [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8241.060000000001s)]
*  or overestimating. [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8246.220000000001s)]
*  I would like us to be a model. [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8247.220000000001s)]
*  And that was my dream from when I first started MAPS in 1986, because I assumed, erroneously, [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8248.82s)]
*  that MDMA would immediately become generic if it was made into a medicine, because I [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8257.74s)]
*  knew it was invented by Merck in 1912, and so the molecules in the public domain. [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8262.82s)]
*  And I also knew that the use of MDMA for PTSD was going on before I even knew about MDMA. [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8267.9s)]
*  You know, I worked with the first person with PTSD. [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8275.38s)]
*  I talked about it in my TED talk. [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8277.42s)]
*  In 1984 is the first person that I actually saw suicidal with MDMA, no other options. [[02:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8279.34s)]
*  And she was able to get better. [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8286.380000000001s)]
*  And Marcelo Tullor is her name, and now she's one of our lead therapists and trains other [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8288.58s)]
*  therapists. [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8293.14s)]
*  But I thought it would be coming generic. [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8294.14s)]
*  I did my PhD. [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8296.98s)]
*  I got it in 2001 focused on how to FDA regulation of psychedelics and marijuana. [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8297.98s)]
*  I took a class at Harvard Law School around 96 from the leading pharmaceutical expert, [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8304.82s)]
*  Peter Barton-Hutt. [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8310.98s)]
*  He wrote the textbook, Food and Drug Law, and he later became on my dissertation committee. [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8312.619999999999s)]
*  He's with Cummington-Berling. [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8317.06s)]
*  He's in his 80s. [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8318.06s)]
*  He represents us pro bono. [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8319.06s)]
*  But throughout my entire education, I still thought that MDMA would immediately become [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8321.1s)]
*  generic. [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8327.14s)]
*  It wasn't until 2014 that I went to a party, in a way, and ran into a patent lawyer. [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8328.14s)]
*  So, this was, my wife was head of what's called Foundation for Belmont Education, which is [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8336.14s)]
*  a local group that raises money to supplement the money that goes into public education. [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8341.5s)]
*  And so she was president. [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8346.18s)]
*  She had to give a little talk. [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8347.18s)]
*  And it's mostly a lot of food and silent auction and stuff. [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8348.18s)]
*  So I'd worked all that day, and I thought, okay, great. [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8351.34s)]
*  I'm just going to get super high. [[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8354.86s)]
*  I'm going to get the munchies. [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8355.86s)]
*  I'm going to go eat all this food. [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8356.86s)]
*  I don't have to talk to anybody. [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8358.9s)]
*  My wife can do the speech, and I'm done working. [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8360.74s)]
*  So this moment where I was done working and just going to munch on all this food is where [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8365.22s)]
*  I ran into a patent attorney who I had known. [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8370.26s)]
*  He was from locally, and he had previously gotten patents for bromo LSD, which is a non-psychedelic [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8373.7s)]
*  version of LSD. [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8379.94s)]
*  And bromo LSD... [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8383.220000000001s)]
*  What's the benefit of it? [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8384.220000000001s)]
*  For cluster headaches. [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8386.1s)]
*  So people that have cluster headaches had discovered that LSD or psilocybin breaks the [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8387.7s)]
*  cycle of cluster headaches. [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8392.52s)]
*  Cluster headaches are suicide headaches. [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8394.48s)]
*  They're way worse than migraines, and there's not many good treatments for it. [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8395.7s)]
*  They had approached me around 2004, 2005, saying, we don't want to be criminals anymore. [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8399.86s)]
*  What can we do? [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8404.26s)]
*  And I started doing work with them at Harvard, and they did medical records of all these [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8405.26s)]
*  people and they verified that they had terrible cluster headaches. [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8410.02s)]
*  Then they didn't, and intervening was LSD or psilocybin. [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8414.460000000001s)]
*  So it's just one trip to break a cycle, or is it... [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8418.04s)]
*  Well, they do it three times every three days. [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8420.94s)]
*  So over nine days, you'll do the psilocybin or the LSD. [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8425.22s)]
*  I mentioned about this project in Jordan that Michael Marcus helped fund. [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8431.5s)]
*  It was because a young Jordanian came by to McLean Hospital at Harvard to learn about [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8437.179999999998s)]
*  the cluster headache study, and it turned out that his cycle began. [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8443.58s)]
*  They weren't giving psilocybin or LSD at the time. [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8449.22s)]
*  They were just studying it. [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8452.06s)]
*  And so his cluster headaches started, and they referred him to me. [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8454.34s)]
*  And so I thought, okay, I'll give him LSD. [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8458.42s)]
*  But I thought, he's never done LSD before. [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8462.58s)]
*  And I said, we have no idea why LSD works. [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8467.46s)]
*  We have no idea why psilocybin works. [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8470.8s)]
*  And I thought, he's scared of these drugs. [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8473.5s)]
*  You have to give it in a fairly... [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8475.9s)]
*  It's not microdosing. [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8478.06s)]
*  So I thought, maybe give him MDMA too at the same time. [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8480.42s)]
*  The MDMA will calm him down, and maybe whatever LSD does, it won't be blocked by the MDMA. [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8483.3s)]
*  I didn't know, but I thought, let's give it a try. [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8488.619999999999s)]
*  And it worked. [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8491.74s)]
*  It worked, and it was incredible. [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8492.859999999999s)]
*  So anyway, he goes back to Jordan. [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8494.38s)]
*  And after a bunch of months, he said, my life has changed. [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8496.74s)]
*  I feel much better. [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8500.02s)]
*  It was a terrible burden. [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8501.02s)]
*  I've met this girl, and we've fallen in love. [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8502.02s)]
*  We're going to get married. [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8503.94s)]
*  And I would like you to come to the Patrolo ceremony. [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8505.42s)]
*  Turned out her father was the mayor of Oman. [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8507.54s)]
*  And I'm like, great. [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8509.7s)]
*  Now we can do research in Jordan. [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8512.22s)]
*  We can finally get into an Arab country to do Arab-Israeli stuff. [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8514.74s)]
*  So that's what I talked to Michael Marcus about, and that's why he supported that project. [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8518.14s)]
*  But in any case, the Harvard people said, oh, Timothy Leary was here. [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8522.7s)]
*  And this is like, we're not going to let you do psychedelic research unless it's the last [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8526.78s)]
*  resort. [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8530.74s)]
*  So Torsten Passe, John Hopern were the two that were doing this. [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8532.380000000001s)]
*  Torsten was at Hanover University in Germany. [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8536.98s)]
*  And they said, all right, let's do bromo LSD. [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8539.32s)]
*  We don't know why it works, but bromo LSD is a non-psychological version of LSD. [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8542.04s)]
*  And we'll give it to a bunch of people, and it won't work. [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8547.380000000001s)]
*  And then we'll come back to Harvard and say, we've got to start giving LSD or psilocybin [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8549.84s)]
*  to people. [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8552.9s)]
*  So I said, great idea, great plan. [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8554.02s)]
*  So I keep waiting for the results and waiting for the results and waiting for the results. [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8556.14s)]
*  And they're not telling me. [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8559.9s)]
*  They're not telling me. [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8560.9s)]
*  So I'm like, what the hell is going on here? [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8562.46s)]
*  Finally, they told me that they thought I would be terribly disappointed, but bromo [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8563.46s)]
*  LSD worked. [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8568.34s)]
*  And not only did it work, but it worked better than LSD or psilocybin. [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8571.9s)]
*  So they were hiding it from you. [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8575.539999999999s)]
*  They were hiding it from me because they thought I would be really disappointed. [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8576.619999999999s)]
*  And I'm like, it's not psychedelic therapy. [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8579.22s)]
*  I'm about the patients. [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8581.619999999999s)]
*  If this helps the patients. [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8583.02s)]
*  Because LSD you give in micrograms. [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8584.46s)]
*  Psilocybin you give in milligrams. [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8587.94s)]
*  But bromo LSD, because it's not psychedelic, you can give it in grams. [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8589.86s)]
*  So whatever it does floods the brain. [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8594.220000000001s)]
*  So it works better than LSD or psilocybin. [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8595.86s)]
*  Because you just, we still don't know why. [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8598.140000000001s)]
*  Anyway, so Harvard then gets a patent on bromo LSD for cluster headaches with the University [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8600.18s)]
*  of Hanover. [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8605.980000000001s)]
*  And a fellow, Kerry Turnbull, is now trying to move this through the FDA. [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8607.380000000001s)]
*  So the patent attorney for Harvard was also part of this local. [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8612.060000000001s)]
*  So he was there at this party. [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8618.18s)]
*  And so I go to him, again, keep in mind, I'm super stoned, just munching on all his food. [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8620.060000000001s)]
*  And I'm like, oh, it's very interesting. [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8624.460000000001s)]
*  How's this going with the patent for bromo LSD? [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8626.220000000001s)]
*  And I said, too bad there's nothing like that for MDMA. [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8629.300000000001s)]
*  And he said, well, there is something. [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8633.66s)]
*  It's called data exclusivity. [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8635.32s)]
*  I'm like, data exclusivity, what's that? [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8637.220000000001s)]
*  He said, well, it turns out in 1984, Ronald Reagan signed a bill to provide incentives [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8639.86s)]
*  to develop drugs that are off patent. [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8644.66s)]
*  What it means is that if you are the first to produce the evidence to make a drug into [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8647.98s)]
*  a medicine, even if there's no patents, you have exclusive use of your data for five years. [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8652.82s)]
*  Now, it's different from a patent in that another person, another company, can develop [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8658.26s)]
*  their own data. [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8663.66s)]
*  So it doesn't block anybody like a patent would block anybody. [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8664.82s)]
*  Then if you do studies in pediatric populations, so the FDA has right now forbidden us to do [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8668.62s)]
*  studies in people that are younger than 18. [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8675.6s)]
*  We can only work with 18 or older. [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8678.76s)]
*  We've had a mother with a daughter who'd been terribly raped and was mute and wanted to [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8681.16s)]
*  be in the study. [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8685.76s)]
*  And the FDA said no. [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8687.24s)]
*  But what they did say is that if you succeed in adults, if we do give you permission to [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8688.64s)]
*  work in adults, you must do studies in adolescents and you get an extra six months data exclusivity. [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8693.4s)]
*  So that's five and a half years. [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8699.779999999999s)]
*  Then it blocks the FDA from reviewing a generic applicant's file until the five and a half [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8701.66s)]
*  years is over. [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8707.66s)]
*  And it takes FDA an average of two years to review a file. [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8709.1s)]
*  So there's this period of data exclusivity that we would have a monopoly potentially [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8712.64s)]
*  on the sale of MDMA for PTSD. [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8719.02s)]
*  Europe, the European Medicines Agency, after Ronald Reagan signed the Senate 84, they said, [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8721.94s)]
*  yeah, this is a good idea. [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8727.78s)]
*  We should provide incentives for drugs that are off patent. [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8728.78s)]
*  So it's 10 years data exclusivity in Europe. [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8731.38s)]
*  So everything changed. [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8734.3s)]
*  I thought, how does it that I took the class from the expert? [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8735.58s)]
*  I read the textbook. [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8738.4s)]
*  My whole dissertation is on it. [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8739.4s)]
*  And I never even heard about this. [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8741.3s)]
*  And the reason is Pharma doesn't use it. [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8744.16s)]
*  They only want drugs that they have patented. [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8746.0s)]
*  And we've had a bunch of potential biotech investors tell us that they don't really want [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8748.539999999999s)]
*  to invest because they don't like the fact that data exclusivity isn't as long as a patent. [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8753.539999999999s)]
*  But that changed everything for me. [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8760.46s)]
*  Now that's why we created the MAPS Public Benefit Corp. [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8763.42s)]
*  Because now it's not going to necessarily go generic. [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8766.88s)]
*  We can then have this period of time where we can make an income. [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8769.92s)]
*  And then what I can tell- [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8773.44s)]
*  And how much is left on that time? [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8774.44s)]
*  Well, it doesn't start until the FDA says yes. [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8776.38s)]
*  So June 2024 is when it starts. [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8780.5s)]
*  Now I'll say that the DEA then has to reschedule. [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8782.74s)]
*  And that will take a maximum of 90 days. [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8787.24s)]
*  DEA by law must reschedule within 90 days after FDA has said yes. [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8789.68s)]
*  So there will be this five and a half years. [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8794.88s)]
*  And then it could be a year and a half, two years, or six months, or who knows how long [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8797.14s)]
*  it will take the FDA to actually review this file. [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8800.36s)]
*  But I think that we have this period of time where we have this opportunity for income. [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8805.82s)]
*  So that's the story to the donors has been- and the story to the investors. [[02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8810.699999999999s)]
*  Well, donors is, if you help us make MDMA into a medicine, we're not going to be coming [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8816.039999999999s)]
*  to you for money all the time. [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8820.14s)]
*  Because we will be able to make money to use to more research. [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8822.0s)]
*  MDMA is not just good for PTSD. [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8825.119999999999s)]
*  It's tremendous for couples therapy. [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8827.359999999999s)]
*  It's tremendous- we think it would be tremendous for eating disorders, for postpartum depression. [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8829.64s)]
*  Of course we have to do all the research to see if this is really the case. [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8833.84s)]
*  Has to be data driven. [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8837.0s)]
*  But we have this opportunity to become self-sustaining. [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8838.119999999999s)]
*  So that's the situation that we were able to tell both donors and then also investors. [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8843.04s)]
*  That we can return money during this period of data exclusivity. [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8847.84s)]
*  Do you feel confident about this? [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8851.68s)]
*  You feel like this is an inevitability? [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8853.2s)]
*  You automatically get it. [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8855.8s)]
*  Yes, you don't have to apply for it. [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8856.8s)]
*  You automatically get data exclusivity. [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8858.48s)]
*  No, no, that's not what I mean. [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8860.52s)]
*  I mean, them deciding to let- [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8861.52s)]
*  Oh. [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8864.68s)]
*  Like, how much- [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8865.68s)]
*  Okay, no, I don't think it's inevitable. [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8866.68s)]
*  But I do think it's extremely likely. [[02:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8868.64s)]
*  Why so? [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8872.52s)]
*  Okay, so we've done this very patiently step by step. [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8873.52s)]
*  And so there's a big methodological problem from a scientific perspective. [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8879.0s)]
*  You have to do double blind studies. [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8883.960000000001s)]
*  And that's required. [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8886.56s)]
*  You need randomized placebo control, double blind studies. [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8887.56s)]
*  That's the gold standard for phase three studies. [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8891.16s)]
*  So well, Jamie, you may get these edibles and nothing happens, you know, but most people [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8894.04s)]
*  that get MDMA or LSD know they've got it or psilocybin. [[02:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8900.32s)]
*  So the double blind doesn't work too well in these kind of studies. [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8904.56s)]
*  So the FDA offers what they call special protocol assessment. [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8908.64s)]
*  And that's a process where you can opt in once you've been approved to go to phase three [[02:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8914.08s)]
*  and you negotiate every aspect of the design with the FDA and all the other material and [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8918.52s)]
*  scientific studies, all the other data that they want to see in the review package. [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8925.16s)]
*  And the goal is to have these special protocol assessment negotiations to end up with what's [[02:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8930.64s)]
*  called an approval letter, an agreement, yeah, a formal agreement that they agree with this [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8936.28s)]
*  special protocol assessment. [[02:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8942.88s)]
*  Often you don't get that. [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8945.76s)]
*  And Big Pharma doesn't use this a lot of times anyway because it delays things by quite a [[02:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8946.76s)]
*  long time. [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8950.76s)]
*  But they often don't need to do it because they're not doing something novel. [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8952.42s)]
*  They're not doing something controversial. [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8955.619999999999s)]
*  They're not doing something that's a challenge with the double blind. [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8957.539999999999s)]
*  So we decided to elect to do this. [[02:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8960.42s)]
*  So we went through this special protocol assessment and it took us eight months. [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8962.339999999998s)]
*  And in the end, we did get an agreement letter. [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8967.599999999999s)]
*  And we brought the FDA brought in the old wise man of the FDA, a fellow named Bob Temple, [[02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8969.859999999999s)]
*  who was at the FDA since 1972, their Office of Science Policy. [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8975.46s)]
*  And what we said to them is it was kind of funny. [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8980.74s)]
*  We said to them that there's a quote from an early president of Harvard which says, [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8984.699999999999s)]
*  never forget, there's always a Harvard man on the wrong side of every issue. [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8990.42s)]
*  All right. [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8996.58s)]
*  So I opened the meeting and I said, this is the quote and the person on the wrong side [[02:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=8998.3s)]
*  is me because my dissertation was, I thought I solved the double blind problem. [[02:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9002.32s)]
*  And it would be therapy with low dose MDMA versus therapy with full dose MDMA. [[02:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9008.26s)]
*  And people would be confused about what they got. [[02:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9013.14s)]
*  And our challenge would be to find the dose of the low dose that was high enough to cause [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9015.58s)]
*  confusion but not so high that it caused so much benefits that we'd never be able to see [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9020.34s)]
*  the difference between the two groups. [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9026.1s)]
*  So over the course of from 2000 to 2016, when we did all these phase two studies, we tested [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9028.36s)]
*  inactive placebo, 25 milligrams, 30 milligrams, 40 milligrams, 50 milligrams, 75, 100, 125, [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9035.34s)]
*  and 150. [[02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9041.220000000001s)]
*  And what we discovered, which was again a little bit difficult for me to discover, is [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9043.28s)]
*  my dissertation was wrong. [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9047.62s)]
*  I was not right. [[02:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9049.380000000001s)]
*  I was partially right, is a better way to say it, that it did cause confusion between the [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9051.58s)]
*  low dose and the high dose, but it made people uncomfortable. [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9056.02s)]
*  So the low doses, it's like turbulence when you take off of an airplane. [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9060.66s)]
*  At the very beginning, there's more turbulence. [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9064.14s)]
*  And then when you get above the clouds or so, your cruise control, it's smooth. [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9066.019999999999s)]
*  So early small doses of MDMA, they have an activating effect without as much of the fear [[02:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9070.18s)]
*  reduction. [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9076.779999999999s)]
*  So what we showed is that people who got these low doses, they all still got better, but [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9077.939999999999s)]
*  they didn't get as much benefit as if we gave them an inactive placebo. [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9085.099999999999s)]
*  If they got therapy with nothing, they did better than if they got therapy with low dose. [[02:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9090.26s)]
*  And we discovered that the 75 milligram dose group was actually surprisingly helpful and [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9094.859999999999s)]
*  beneficial. [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9099.5s)]
*  So it's a narrow range between when you're in the turbulent zone to when you're getting [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9100.82s)]
*  benefits, when you're cruising. [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9105.82s)]
*  So there's no practical way to do that. [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9107.82s)]
*  So we went to the FDA at this final meeting for this special protocol assessment, and [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9110.82s)]
*  we said, I'm wrong. [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9115.699999999999s)]
*  We'll do whatever you want. [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9118.84s)]
*  You can tell us what you want us to do, but we can give you blinding. [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9119.84s)]
*  But you're going to make it easier for us to tell a difference between the two groups, [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9123.28s)]
*  because the people with the low dose don't do as well as the people that got nothing. [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9127.76s)]
*  And the real challenge is to show if we can do this with therapy, why bother at a drug? [[02:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9132.68s)]
*  So we said to the FDA, we suggest you make it harder for us to find a difference by letting [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9137.36s)]
*  us use inactive placebo. [[02:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9142.98s)]
*  What they said is that oftentimes, what Bob Temple helped them come to this conclusion, [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9145.86s)]
*  is that oftentimes the double blind doesn't actually work anyway. [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9151.300000000001s)]
*  Like there's sexual side effects from SSRIs. [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9155.16s)]
*  So you can learn from side effect profiles that people talk to you. [[02:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9157.82s)]
*  If you're giving it, you're doing an experiment and you're collecting adverse events, they'll [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9161.02s)]
*  tell you what the problems are. [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9165.42s)]
*  And you'll say, oh, this is probably this or that. [[02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9166.42s)]
*  So they said there's two main ways to reduce experiment or bias. [[02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9168.640000000001s)]
*  The first is random assignment. [[02:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9173.12s)]
*  That means everybody is similarly motivated. [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9177.16s)]
*  They come from the same kind of background. [[02:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9179.220000000001s)]
*  They all fit the inclusion criteria. [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9181.2s)]
*  And then they're all willing to do whatever and then half get your treatment, half get [[02:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9182.68s)]
*  the control. [[02:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9186.12s)]
*  The other is a robust system of independent raters to evaluate the outcomes. [[02:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9187.720000000001s)]
*  We don't want the therapist to say how well people did, because they will most likely, [[02:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9192.86s)]
*  over 90% of the time, they can tell who got MDMA, who didn't. [[02:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9198.32s)]
*  There still is some confusion. [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9201.52s)]
*  Sometimes people are not responding very much. [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9203.300000000001s)]
*  Maybe like Jamie, they have something biological where MDMA doesn't do that much or they're [[02:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9205.26s)]
*  controlling or something. [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9211.42s)]
*  But most of the time, people are able to tell the difference. [[02:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9213.78s)]
*  And what the question is also that the side effect profile will be better if it's no MDMA [[02:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9218.94s)]
*  as well. [[02:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9227.300000000001s)]
*  When I said that we had one woman try to kill herself twice and she had the placebo, it's [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9228.439999999999s)]
*  from the therapy. [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9233.519999999999s)]
*  If she had gotten low dose MDMA, maybe it's this low dose MDMA that made her uncomfortable. [[02:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9234.8s)]
*  But now we know if you have severe PTSD and you go into therapy and you're starting to [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9239.859999999999s)]
*  uncover things, that's a risk because you've got some balance. [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9244.939999999999s)]
*  It's difficult. [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9250.0s)]
*  It's not healthy. [[02:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9251.0s)]
*  But when stuff comes to the surface, it can make you really disturbed. [[02:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9252.0s)]
*  So Bob Temple came and said, we will approve this idea of therapy with inactive placebo. [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9255.74s)]
*  So we got an agreement letter from the special protocol assessment. [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9263.619999999999s)]
*  So we have a situation now to gesture a question, how likely is it that it's going to be approved, [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9266.96s)]
*  is that the FDA is legally bound to approve our drug if we get statistical significance, [[02:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9273.199999999999s)]
*  which we've got in spades, tremendous, if we have an excellent safety record, which we [[02:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9279.76s)]
*  do, and if we've gathered the data in a proper way so that the FDA considers it valid. [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9284.34s)]
*  And we've recently had a big inspection by FDA and Health Canada. [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9289.74s)]
*  We've had loads of people from the Public Benefit Corp who did a phenomenal job to try [[02:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9294.480000000001s)]
*  to respond to all the questions from the FDA. [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9299.08s)]
*  And we got some findings, but nothing serious. [[02:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9301.380000000001s)]
*  So we know that they're going to consider the data to be valid. [[02:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9304.68s)]
*  So I do think that the chances are they cannot say we don't like your design because the [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9308.1s)]
*  double line didn't work because we have prior agreement to use that design. [[02:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9313.68s)]
*  There's no safety issues that they can point to of significance. [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9318.88s)]
*  I mean, there's acute effects from MDMA. [[02:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9323.119999999999s)]
*  Most of it was like sweating or muscle tension or these are transitory side effects from [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9326.44s)]
*  the MDMA, all more from the MDMA than the placebo. [[02:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9331.68s)]
*  So I think that the other big factor that makes me somewhat confident is that we have [[02:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9334.2s)]
*  bipartisan support. [[02:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9340.6s)]
*  It's not a political issue. [[02:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9342.54s)]
*  So much in America is politicized, is part of the culture wars. [[02:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9345.720000000001s)]
*  But we have managed somehow, well, consciously, intentionally, and a lot of it is working [[02:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9350.240000000002s)]
*  with veterans and others, is to take the psychedelics out of the culture wars. [[02:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9355.320000000002s)]
*  So I don't think there's going to be political efforts to... [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9360.6s)]
*  There's actually, I won't mention names or anything, but there is a member of Congress [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9366.44s)]
*  that has PTSD that's a Republican that wants to go through, if possible, a study in the [[02:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9371.78s)]
*  open, a legal study, then to publicize the effects of MDMA therapy for PTSD. [[02:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9378.78s)]
*  So it's amazing. [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9385.300000000001s)]
*  So I think that we're in good shape. [[02:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9387.42s)]
*  I think the how it gets regulated is going to be more of an issue than if it gets approved. [[02:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9388.94s)]
*  What kind of controls are put on it? [[02:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9395.56s)]
*  If it does get approved and if MDMA does get rescheduled, how quickly do you think [[02:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9397.68s)]
*  that would open up the door for other similar substances? [[02:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9403.34s)]
*  Well, the other similar substances, the next one in the line is psilocybin, and they're [[02:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9406.78s)]
*  going to have to generate their own data. [[02:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9411.06s)]
*  So we got breakthrough therapy designation in 2017. [[02:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9413.9s)]
*  Right after we completed the special protocol assessment, we got breakthrough therapy, and [[02:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9421.5s)]
*  we were the first one for any kind of psychedelics. [[02:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9425.62s)]
*  And then a year or two later, the psilocybin compass got breakthrough therapy for psilocybin [[02:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9428.800000000001s)]
*  for treatment resistant depression, and then USONA got breakthrough therapy for psilocybin [[02:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9435.0s)]
*  for major depressive disorder. [[02:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9439.800000000001s)]
*  So I think that the psilocybin people are going to be the next through the FDA system. [[02:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9441.240000000002s)]
*  They're just starting their phase three studies. [[02:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9446.28s)]
*  So I think by 2026, maybe psilocybin will be there. [[02:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9448.62s)]
*  So we're opening the door politically, but they have to come through with their own data. [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9452.56s)]
*  And then there will be other people trying to work with 5-MeO to make that into a medicine, [[02:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9456.42s)]
*  potentially for depression or something. [[02:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9460.019999999999s)]
*  I begin, hopefully we can get. [[02:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9461.619999999999s)]
*  So I think that we are the leading example. [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9463.46s)]
*  That's why I would like to ideally do it through philanthropy, but I think that we've got a [[02:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9466.619999999999s)]
*  real hope that this will be approved. [[02:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9474.06s)]
*  Well, listen, you just shot out the bat signal. [[02:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9476.019999999999s)]
*  So we'll see who responds in terms of philanthropy or what hardcore capitalists think that you [[02:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9479.54s)]
*  could save the world this idea and make a shitload of money. [[02:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9485.640000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9488.800000000001s)]
*  And all those that want to go to the Psychedelic Science Conference, Rogan 20 to get a discount. [[02:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9489.800000000001s)]
*  But I'd like to read you these potential benefits. [[02:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9493.720000000001s)]
*  Just to see what you think about that. [[02:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9496.800000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[02:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9498.640000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[02:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9499.640000000001s)]
*  So the first potential benefit is that it permits us to scale to reach our full potential. [[02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9500.640000000001s)]
*  Now what that is assuming, I'll say, is that there's more access to capital from going [[02:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9508.14s)]
*  public than from philanthropy. [[02:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9514.779999999999s)]
*  Right. [[02:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9516.779999999999s)]
*  That's not necessarily true. [[02:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9517.779999999999s)]
*  Now, I'm writing this, by the way, my notes are on Allen Institute. [[02:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9518.779999999999s)]
*  So it's Paul Allen, who is the co-founder of Microsoft. [[02:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9522.66s)]
*  And he started this Allen Institute for Brain Science. [[02:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9526.66s)]
*  And he's donated almost a billion dollars to that. [[02:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9529.939999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[02:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9532.5s)]
*  So if we can, you know, Paul Allen, this was one of my frustrations years ago. [[02:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9533.5s)]
*  Paul Allen donated $25 million to the SETI project, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. [[02:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9537.9s)]
*  And I'm like, where's the intelligence on Earth? [[02:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9544.26s)]
*  Why don't you give us 25 million to find if there's intelligence on Earth? [[02:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9547.06s)]
*  Let us do psychedelic research. [[02:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9550.74s)]
*  But you're wanting to see if there, you know. [[02:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9552.1s)]
*  Well, how about both? [[02:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9553.539999999999s)]
*  Both. [[02:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9554.539999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9555.539999999999s)]
*  Both are interesting. [[02:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9556.539999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9557.539999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9558.539999999999s)]
*  So, okay. [[02:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9559.539999999999s)]
*  So I think that this idea of scale to reach full potential. [[02:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9560.539999999999s)]
*  Do you know what this list sounds like? [[02:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9561.539999999999s)]
*  You have kids? [[02:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9563.14s)]
*  I have three kids. [[02:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9564.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9565.14s)]
*  And then you, your kids say they want to do something and you don't think it's a good [[02:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9566.539999999999s)]
*  idea. [[02:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9569.939999999999s)]
*  We'll say, well, why don't you give me three examples of why I should let you spend the [[02:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9570.939999999999s)]
*  night at Cindy's house? [[02:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9576.42s)]
*  And then they go, because I think it'll teach me responsibility. [[02:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9580.46s)]
*  And even though sometimes I stay up late with her, this time I definitely won't. [[02:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9584.9s)]
*  That's what it sounds like. [[02:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9588.74s)]
*  That's funny. [[02:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9590.14s)]
*  Well, before I get to the rest of this, just about kids. [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9591.14s)]
*  So I've got Eden is 28, Lila is 26, and Ellie is 24. [[02:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9593.42s)]
*  But when they were their Bar Mitzvah age, and this is where I'm curious more how you're [[02:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9599.18s)]
*  going to teach your kids, is that I remember my Bar Mitzvah as being a massive disappointment. [[02:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9603.66s)]
*  Why? [[02:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9609.82s)]
*  Because you thought it was going to, you feel different when you went through it? [[02:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9610.82s)]
*  I thought I would be different. [[02:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9613.74s)]
*  You'd be a grown man? [[02:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9614.74s)]
*  Yeah, I did. [[02:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9615.94s)]
*  I'd skip adolescence. [[02:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9616.94s)]
*  I'd have spiritual experience. [[02:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9617.94s)]
*  God would come. [[02:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9619.18s)]
*  I would be, I'm the oldest of four kids in my family. [[02:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9620.18s)]
*  So I had no older siblings to tell me it doesn't happen that way. [[02:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9623.02s)]
*  I just thought, oh, okay, great. [[02:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9626.5s)]
*  But in the bed in the morning after my Bar Mitzvah, I'm like, God didn't come. [[02:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9629.460000000001s)]
*  I'm still the same. [[02:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9635.18s)]
*  Still the same. [[02:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9636.74s)]
*  I like the party. [[02:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9637.74s)]
*  Well, yeah, it's a rites of passage ritual. [[02:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9638.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9641.82s)]
*  So when each of our kids turned 13, my wife and I, we went to them and we said, if you [[02:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9642.82s)]
*  want marijuana or MDMA, we think you're old enough for it and we'll do it together and [[02:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9648.02s)]
*  you can have it. [[02:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9654.66s)]
*  And all of them were freaked out. [[02:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9656.58s)]
*  Like, no, no, we're not ready. [[02:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9658.460000000001s)]
*  Do drugs with my parents. [[02:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9660.48s)]
*  No way. [[02:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9661.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9662.48s)]
*  It turned to be the best anti-drug strategy we could have thought of. [[02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9663.48s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[02:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9667.42s)]
*  Just give it to them and they're like, oh no. [[02:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9668.42s)]
*  Now they did come around later, I will say. [[02:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9669.7s)]
*  So I'm curious for your own kids, are you going to say don't do it when you're teenagers [[02:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9673.5s)]
*  but do it later? [[02:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9677.7s)]
*  Or how do you think that? [[02:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9678.7s)]
*  Well, we're going to have that conversation. [[02:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9680.460000000001s)]
*  I think my concern is I don't want them doing things with people they don't know the source [[02:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9683.7s)]
*  of those things. [[02:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9689.140000000001s)]
*  That's very important. [[02:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9690.140000000001s)]
*  My concern is they understand there's a giant difference between different types of substances. [[02:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9692.52s)]
*  And these are the kind of conversations I think everybody has to have with their kids. [[02:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9699.78s)]
*  Like, there's a giant difference between smoking pot with your friends and doing coke. [[02:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9702.62s)]
*  It's a giant difference. [[02:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9706.140000000001s)]
*  And it's not just the cocaine, it's the potential for it to be laced. [[02:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9707.5s)]
*  It's very high. [[02:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9711.18s)]
*  That's the most dangerous thing about drugs today. [[02:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9712.74s)]
*  I mean, really, what we said earlier is the illegality. [[02:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9715.58s)]
*  That's the most dangerous thing. [[02:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9720.46s)]
*  So what are the other fake reasons on this list? [[02:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9722.5s)]
*  Well, dad. [[02:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9727.14s)]
*  Okay. [[02:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9729.62s)]
*  Well, the other is that there'll be more support for MAPS. [[02:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9730.62s)]
*  If the benefit corp does well and MAPS is the owner, then we'll have more reason. [[02:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9734.619999999999s)]
*  Sure, to make money. [[02:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9737.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9738.9s)]
*  Now, I think that these two arguments for me at least are true whether you have access [[02:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9739.9s)]
*  to capital. [[02:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9745.22s)]
*  It's all about access to capital. [[02:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9746.22s)]
*  And if we get it from philanthropy or we get it from investors, it's the same reason. [[02:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9747.22s)]
*  Right. [[02:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9751.58s)]
*  Okay. [[02:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9752.58s)]
*  The third one I think is somewhat different. [[02:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9753.58s)]
*  It supports the organizational maturation and development. [[02:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9755.66s)]
*  So we may have investors that have lots of pharma experience or something and then they [[02:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9759.74s)]
*  may help us to improve our operations in some ways. [[02:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9764.5s)]
*  Now, I think that potentially that these external capital partners, we can get expertise in [[02:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9772.06s)]
*  other ways, but there's something there to it. [[02:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9781.08s)]
*  And then the discipline of the marketplace. [[02:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9783.4s)]
*  But that's the discipline of the marketplace is about efficiency and maximizing profits. [[02:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9785.34s)]
*  It's not necessarily about maximizing public benefit, but that's something. [[02:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9790.34s)]
*  Then the other part is attract outside talent. [[02:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9794.58s)]
*  So this argument is this idea that we don't have stock bonuses for anybody. [[02:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9801.58s)]
*  Without equity investments, then we can't use that as incentives for the staff. [[02:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9809.38s)]
*  So this idea is that if you do go public and then people get invested or vested in stocks... [[02:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9817.779999999999s)]
*  You get killers. [[02:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9823.26s)]
*  You get aggressive people. [[02:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9824.26s)]
*  On the other hand, I think that there are other ways to reward people through royalty [[02:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9825.66s)]
*  share. [[02:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9831.38s)]
*  It doesn't have to be equity. [[02:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9832.38s)]
*  The same way that we could do royalty share to investors, we should be able to do that [[02:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9834.26s)]
*  to staff. [[02:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9837.66s)]
*  So this, I think, is the best argument of what might be a benefit of going public. [[02:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9839.18s)]
*  And it's that we could build a new public benefit-driven, mission-led model for the [[02:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9847.26s)]
*  entire pharmaceutical industry. [[02:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9852.38s)]
*  Because most of the pharmaceutical industry is for profit. [[02:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9855.14s)]
*  It's not run by nonprofits. [[02:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9857.38s)]
*  Most of it is not public benefit. [[02:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9859.06s)]
*  But we could become a model for the industry. [[02:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9861.02s)]
*  So I think there's a lot of merit in that idea. [[02:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9867.380000000001s)]
*  Well, I hope you figure out the right path. [[02:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9869.380000000001s)]
*  I do not know what it will be, but I appreciate everything you guys do. [[02:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9873.26s)]
*  And I think that once we talked about it a couple weeks ago, why you invited me back [[02:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9878.460000000001s)]
*  is because you wanted to help us highlight this crossroads that we're at. [[02:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9883.34s)]
*  Yeah, it's fascinating. [[02:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9888.1s)]
*  Because, look, I'm not the person to ask about business. [[02:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9889.1s)]
*  Again, my reaction to it was completely knee-jerk. [[02:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9892.86s)]
*  I don't mix business and psychedelics. [[02:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9896.34s)]
*  Those things are sacred. [[02:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9898.34s)]
*  And I think they should just be legal. [[02:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9899.86s)]
*  That should be the primary concern, that we're being deprived of these experiences because [[02:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9902.460000000001s)]
*  of ignorance and because of propaganda and because of whatever fucking weird political [[02:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9906.220000000001s)]
*  reasons. [[02:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9912.58s)]
*  I've got to wrap this up. [[02:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9913.58s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[02:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9915.58s)]
*  I've got another quick thing to get your reaction to. [[02:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9916.58s)]
*  Okay. [[02:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9918.7s)]
*  Okay. [[02:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9919.7s)]
*  So, Dan Grossman is also on the board of the MAPS Public Benefit Corp. [[02:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9920.7s)]
*  And he is from the Boston Consulting Group. [[02:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9926.380000000001s)]
*  So he's a managing director, senior partner, and he does a lot of biofarm stuff. [[02:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9929.220000000001s)]
*  So I'll just say that there's various theories of pricing. [[02:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9935.02s)]
*  So once we make it into medicine, whether we do it even in a public benefit with only [[02:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9939.220000000001s)]
*  philanthropy or if it's investors, we still are going to be looking at how do we price [[02:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9945.980000000001s)]
*  the drug. [[02:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9949.74s)]
*  And it's interesting ways to do this. [[02:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9951.04s)]
*  So the first is called price to value. [[02:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9953.74s)]
*  And when you consider the value, and this is how insurance companies will often look [[02:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9956.9s)]
*  at it, it's both to the individual, the family, and the society. [[02:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9960.82s)]
*  So there are substantial values in taking people who have severe, moderate to severe [[02:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9965.18s)]
*  PTSD. [[02:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9971.300000000001s)]
*  They can't work things like that. [[02:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9972.300000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9973.300000000001s)]
*  But you also want it to be available for everyone. [[02:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9974.300000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9975.54s)]
*  Okay. [[02:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9976.54s)]
*  Right? [[02:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9977.54s)]
*  Very much. [[02:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9978.54s)]
*  The key challenge that we have is that when you look at pharmaceutical ads on TV, they'll [[02:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9979.7s)]
*  say, oh, if you can't afford the drug, we'll give it to you. [[02:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9985.34s)]
*  We have a patient assistance program and apply to us. [[02:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9989.300000000001s)]
*  So our situation is fundamentally different because the treatment is therapy augmented [[02:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9992.78s)]
*  by the drug. [[02:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9997.34s)]
*  So if we give people MDMA, it's not going to do them any good whatsoever if they can't [[02:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=9998.76s)]
*  afford the therapy. [[02:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=10002.740000000002s)]
*  Right. [[02:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=10003.740000000002s)]
*  The therapy will be $10,000, $15,000. [[02:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=10004.740000000002s)]
*  So in order for us to really have an effective patient assistance program, we can't just [[02:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=10007.7s)]
*  give people the drug. [[02:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=10013.34s)]
*  We also have to give them $10,000 or $15,000 worth of therapy, and the drug is going to [[02:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=10014.92s)]
*  cost a tiny, tiny, tiny fraction of that. [[02:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=10020.820000000002s)]
*  So that's one argument for making it equitably available. [[02:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=10024.140000000001s)]
*  The other, I think, is the drug legalization. [[02:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=10028.86s)]
*  We need to make it available for people outside of medicine, outside of religion, at a low [[02:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=10030.7s)]
*  cost. [[02:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=10035.18s)]
*  And that way, also, it doesn't encourage people to sell it illegally. [[02:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=10036.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=10039.94s)]
*  Which is going to be a problem if it becomes legal. [[02:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=10040.94s)]
*  If it becomes legal and you're the only ones manufacturing it. [[02:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=10043.300000000001s)]
*  Well, I don't think it'll be a problem because, again, the difference is that it's not a take-home [[02:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=10046.300000000001s)]
*  medicine. [[02:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=10049.66s)]
*  So it's only administered under direct supervision of a therapist. [[02:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=10050.84s)]
*  We've heard about ketamine sometimes is available. [[02:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=10055.220000000001s)]
*  But don't you think that just opening up the door to legality is going to make it more [[02:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=10057.06s)]
*  prevalent? [[02:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=10061.300000000001s)]
*  Well, not our supplies. [[02:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=10062.300000000001s)]
*  It's going to put it more in the public zeitgeist. [[02:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=10063.300000000001s)]
*  It will. [[02:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=10066.060000000001s)]
*  It will. [[02:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=10067.060000000001s)]
*  Which will potentially open up the door for criminal activity, right? [[02:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=10068.060000000001s)]
*  I think so, yes. [[02:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=10071.1s)]
*  I think that there'll be more demand. [[02:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=10072.1s)]
*  Right. [[02:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=10073.62s)]
*  Once we... [[02:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=10074.62s)]
*  Rick, I really have to end. [[02:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=10075.62s)]
*  I'm really sorry. [[02:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=10076.62s)]
*  I've got to get out of here. [[02:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=10077.62s)]
*  I have a hard out today. [[02:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=10078.62s)]
*  Okay. [[02:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=10079.62s)]
*  Could I just say, one more minute, I'll just list these things. [[02:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=10080.62s)]
*  Okay. [[02:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=10082.86s)]
*  So one is price to out-of-pocket, which is really good, meaning that you just make it [[02:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=10083.86s)]
*  so that people don't have to pay more. [[02:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=10087.36s)]
*  Whatever the price is, insurance companies pay, but you price to make sure. [[02:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=10088.94s)]
*  That is the lower profits, the least. [[02:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=10092.82s)]
*  Then there's price to savings. [[02:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=10095.779999999999s)]
*  That's to the payers. [[02:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=10097.64s)]
*  So you try to make it so that insurance companies... [[02:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=10099.06s)]
*  Then there's price to ROI, return on investment. [[02:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=10100.939999999999s)]
*  So that's where you profit maximize. [[02:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=10103.82s)]
*  We get some in the financial weeds. [[02:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=10105.259999999998s)]
*  I really do have to wrap this up. [[02:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=10106.98s)]
*  But I appreciate you very much. [[02:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=10108.66s)]
*  Thanks. [[02:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=10109.98s)]
*  Thanks for coming on here, man. [[02:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=10110.98s)]
*  And thank you for all that you do to legalize psychedelics. [[02:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=10111.98s)]
*  Thank you, Joe, to have my thanks. [[02:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=10115.619999999999s)]
*  Tell everybody the website and the social media. [[02:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYfAhupxaTs&t=10116.619999999999s)]
