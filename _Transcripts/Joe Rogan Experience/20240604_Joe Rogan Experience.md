# Joe Rogan Experience #2160 - Billy Carson
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=livgMzeO-ZY)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day.
*  Yeah, so the thing is about that photo of the moon that they do with the phones, they found out that that's kind of bullshit.
*  No, I took, let me show you some of mine.
*  I know, I took it too, but what it is is it's AI.
*  And so what someone did on-
*  What, you mean this is AI?
*  Yeah, what someone did online, one of them clever kids.
*  Yeah.
*  They took a very blurry photo of the moon and they put it on a screen across the room.
*  Okay.
*  And then they zoomed in on it as if it's the moon and the camera showed detailed craters.
*  Oh, well, that's not what I'm talking about.
*  I'm talking about like this, you know.
*  Oh, okay.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  That's a real picture.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  So that you just used the 100x zoom.
*  Yeah.
*  You didn't use the moon photo thing.
*  No, yeah, no.
*  Because there's a moon shot.
*  Just me standing outside.
*  There's a moon shot aspect to that.
*  That's a little-
*  Oh, I got to check that.
*  I don't know about that one.
*  Yeah, if you zoom in on it, if you zoom in on the moon-
*  Yeah, this is just me.
*  Okay, I don't think that's real.
*  See, that's what I'm talking about.
*  I think that's AI.
*  The AI recreates it?
*  Yeah.
*  Really?
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  I know.
*  I was showing off to my family.
*  It's pretty incredible.
*  Yeah, listen.
*  It's incredible.
*  I have the 22, I think the S22 Ultra.
*  Yeah.
*  I had the older one and I would take photos of the moon.
*  I'm like, look, iPhone's bullshit.
*  It can't do this.
*  But it turned out it looks like I got fooled.
*  Oh, man.
*  I mean, you can't hide stuff like that on the internet, technology stuff.
*  Those guys are too good.
*  They know everything.
*  They know everything.
*  Yeah.
*  But we were just talking about the difference.
*  I'm really thinking about switching to Android.
*  I'm just tired of being trapped.
*  And it's just like this resistance.
*  Everybody's like, don't do that.
*  I'm like, oh my God.
*  It's like a mind virus.
*  Everybody's culturally locked in having a blue bubble.
*  But when you tell them you're going to switch from Apple, then Agent Smith shows up from
*  The Matrix.
*  And he inhabits their body.
*  And they try to tell you to stop doing it.
*  Don't do it.
*  Like try to convince you not to leave.
*  It's like if you were a Catholic and you said, I'm going to become a Baptist.
*  Right.
*  People are going, don't do it.
*  Right.
*  Don't do it.
*  Like, what are you talking about?
*  Yeah.
*  It's not that much different.
*  I know.
*  It's crazy.
*  It's weird.
*  People get, they get weird with everything.
*  They get weird with their beliefs.
*  They get weird with what they subscribe, what group they attach themselves to.
*  So true.
*  It's so strange.
*  And I think this is a good way to segue into like what you do.
*  Because these subjects, so many of these subjects, so many people have like an instantaneous
*  reaction.
*  Yeah.
*  That instantaneous reaction is, oh, hogwash.
*  If this was true, I would already know about it.
*  It would be taught in universities.
*  It would all be.
*  But then you find out like no one is really just kind of trying to piece stuff together,
*  specifically talking about these ancient tablets, which are to me, some of the most
*  interesting things about ancient history, particularly what came out of ancient Sumer.
*  Yeah.
*  Ancient Sumer, when you look at their tablets and like what are they saying and why would
*  they dedicate so much time to talking about this stuff?
*  Exactly.
*  Why do they have pictures of giant, enormous people looking things with like a humanoid,
*  with a tail sitting on their lap?
*  Like, what is this?
*  Just fiction?
*  Yeah.
*  Like, why would they detail this?
*  And how do they have a representation of the solar system with the correct amount of planets
*  and relatively the correct order and size?
*  You know, it's not exact, but it's an artistic version of the real thing.
*  And how the hell, how the hell, how the hell 6,000, 5,000 years ago do they know that?
*  Yeah.
*  So what explanations do we have?
*  Like what's the conventional explanations when people tried to dismiss what they knew
*  in ancient Sumer?
*  Well, the conventional explanation is always going to the term mythology.
*  They throw mythology around, you know, left and right to cover up the fact that they have
*  no clue or idea.
*  So they turn it into mythology so they can kind of say it's all fantasy and fairy tales.
*  And this is how they express themselves or how they understood the universe.
*  It's all mythology.
*  It's all fake.
*  In reality, it's not all fake.
*  These people left behind such detailed records and information.
*  It's a time capsule of information on stone tablets for us today to be able to decipher,
*  break down and understand.
*  And that's what we're here to do now.
*  When you look at these ancient languages like cuneiform, can you read that?
*  Do you know how to read it?
*  Yeah.
*  A small amount of it.
*  Yeah.
*  Studying it from books that I have bought right off of Amazon.
*  Oh.
*  Yeah.
*  So basically you take a, you take a stick.
*  It looks like a stick with a kind of a curved end, right?
*  Almost sharpened.
*  It's called a stylus.
*  Oh, just like a stylus for an iPad.
*  Exactly.
*  Very similar, right?
*  And then you take a piece of wet clay and right before it's too wet or too dry, right
*  in the middle stage, you then start wedging, making these incredible lines into the clay.
*  And then from that, you get this cuneiform text.
*  So this text, literally, you know, some of them, some of the letters actually relate
*  to complete ideas, but it's incredible work and it takes a long time to do.
*  And then you have to let this thing dry and then it becomes stone.
*  So, you know, if people were supposed to be trying to worry about how to, how they're
*  going to get their next meal, shelter for the night and all these kinds of things, who
*  has time to sit down and write these incredible works of art like the Epic of Gilgamesh, for
*  example?
*  Yeah.
*  So they were writing down and also they were transcribing information that was given to
*  them by these quote unquote gods with a lowercase g.
*  So when you're reading things like the Epic of Gilgamesh, the Epic of Gilgamesh, for people
*  who don't know, is one of the oldest versions of a lot of the stories that you hear in the
*  Bible.
*  Very similar to them.
*  Yes.
*  They seem to be, there always seems to be a great flood.
*  There's a few heroes.
*  There's angry gods.
*  There's a bunch of stuff going on.
*  And Zechariah Sitchin's work was like the most controversial on the Sumerian text, right?
*  Because there's a whole website called Sitchiniswrong.com.
*  People go crazy about him.
*  But when he starts talking about it, when you read some of the things that they wrote,
*  and when you see like some of the images that they created, the images that look like the
*  double helix of DNA, and there's a bunch of the, like that now we represent, the caduceus,
*  which represents pharmacies and drugs, like that's the old version of an image of the
*  double helix of DNA, or at least it looks super similar to that.
*  Oh, it definitely is, because it's referenced even in the Egyptian Book of the Dead and
*  other ancient texts.
*  So there's no coincidences here.
*  Now, Zechariah Sitchin, you know, I don't particularly go by his work, not because it's
*  controversial.
*  I believe he was one of the greatest researchers of all time, and the reason why is because
*  he laid out so much information for us to begin to scratch our head and ask questions.
*  But what I figured out was that by going through the UCLA CDLI online cuneiform digital library,
*  say that fast 10 times, I was able to take stone tablets and decipher them myself.
*  So anyone can go online to the UCLA CDLI online cuneiform digital library and read these stone
*  tablets for themselves.
*  You don't need Zechariah Sitchin.
*  You don't need anyone else.
*  And as I began to break these tablets down...
*  Do they have them transcribed, or are you reading the actual tablet?
*  They transcribe them.
*  They actually transcribe them into English for you.
*  Is there controversy as far as, like, are there different versions of the transcription?
*  Like, do some people think it's interpreted differently?
*  Is, like, some debate about that?
*  Only where it comes to where some of the text is missing.
*  There could be pieces shipped off of tablets.
*  You see that corner missing from that tablet right there in the epic of the book of medicine.
*  Just look how wild is that.
*  Just how wild is that that exists and that this was...
*  It's so hard for people to put in their brain 5,000 years of time and that there's these people
*  that have this very bizarre language.
*  Like, when you look at that language, we don't even know what it sounds like, right?
*  Right, no.
*  And the language popped up out of nowhere.
*  You know, you're talking about a civilization that appeared out of nothing.
*  It looks like computer code.
*  It does.
*  Doesn't it?
*  Yes, it does.
*  Just imagine, like, a human being deciding that they were going to write down in these very bizarre...
*  And they all agreed that all these things mean a certain thing.
*  So they had to somehow or another have a Rosetta Stone or something where they're documenting it
*  so that people can learn it and teach it.
*  And then we're looking at it 5,000 years later.
*  Yeah.
*  It's so amazing.
*  It is.
*  And what's incredible is this text was translated in the 1800s,
*  long before Zachariah Sitchum was born.
*  So there are some rumors that, oh, he was the only one that could decipher these tablets.
*  Well, no.
*  George Smith, who worked as a seriologist and wrote many books,
*  deciphered these Sumerian tablets in the 1800s.
*  So we're talking about texts that have been deciphered for a few hundred years,
*  nothing that was just deciphered recently.
*  So what are the first decipherings?
*  Like, what year was the first deciphering?
*  It was in 1800.
*  I don't have to, I think around 1850, George Smith.
*  He actually worked at the, I think it was Cambridge.
*  What was his take?
*  Like, when he's reading all these wacky stories and all the Anunnaki stuff,
*  what's his take on it?
*  He is literally subscribing to this information the way almost that you and I see it today.
*  These people saw something, experienced something, interacted with something,
*  and he catalogued it, and it inspired him to write a complete translation of the Enuma Elish
*  and the seven tablets of creation.
*  And he talks about the fact that that information was copied right from those tablets
*  and put into the Old Testament of the Bible.
*  And so, you know, not exactly like it was going to go from here to the Bible,
*  but it went to other ancient papyruses and scriptures and so forth.
*  And then later on when it was discovered in caves, people took those and then said,
*  okay, we got to put this into a book.
*  And then it became the Bible much later, around 100 AD.
*  But he subscribed to the theory that these people interacted with beings in some way,
*  shape, or form, and that also this information is so incredible
*  that it became part of the biblical text.
*  Did you ever read the Dead Sea Scrolls?
*  Yes, yeah.
*  So the Dead Sea Scrolls, what was it found in?
*  What year was that?
*  It was in Qumran, right?
*  It was Qumran, but I think, again, this was awesome.
*  This was also, I believe, in the late 1800s or early 1900s.
*  This is when they found them.
*  So these things are written on animal skins, and this is the only,
*  I mean, this is a very old version of those exact same stories or some of similar stories.
*  There's a lot of weirdness in the Dead Sea Scrolls.
*  I haven't read it, but is there any references to anything that's similar,
*  like Anunnaki-type characters, the Nephilim or anything like that in the Dead Sea Scrolls?
*  They show up everywhere, and the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Enuma Elish and the Epagobotrae Cis.
*  Of course, even in the Bible, they're known as the Anak, A-N-A-K.
*  We were grasshoppers in their eyesight, it says, in the biblical text.
*  So no matter where you go in any culture, you're going to discover that these beings,
*  in some way or shape or form, engaged mankind, brought knowledge, teaching, building techniques,
*  and just so much more wisdom and information, esoteric wisdom, alchemy.
*  All these things came from these people.
*  So the craziest version of this story is that they genetically engineered us out of lower primates
*  and put us here to mine gold, and then established different types of civilizations
*  and taught us how to build things, taught us all these different things,
*  and enough time has passed that we've kind of forgotten.
*  Enough time has passed. That's the wackiest version of it, right?
*  Right, right, right. That's the bare bones minimum.
*  Yeah, the wackiest version is that they made us, which is, we've talked about this a couple of times,
*  but how bizarre it is that human beings have this incredible fascination for gold.
*  We're fascinated with gold. This fascination with gold is really weird.
*  Like, why back when it was basically useless? You couldn't make a knife out of it, you couldn't,
*  you know, like, it didn't make sense that this would be so valuable.
*  Just because it's rare, you're barely alive. You know, we're going, you know, right?
*  We're going back to full-on hunter-and-gatherer ancestors with spears and stone chip,
*  and then after that, gold emerges, and it stays. It stays forever.
*  Now, when you read Zecharai Sitchin's book, he talks about this in the 1970s.
*  His description of it was that they needed to suspend gold particles in the atmosphere
*  because their atmosphere was being destroyed.
*  Then you move to, like, somewhere around the 2000s when climate scientists start proposing this idea
*  of suspending reflective particles in the atmosphere.
*  And then when you realize the unique properties of gold, how unusual it is in terms of, like, a building material,
*  you can coat things. The reason why things are, like, coated in gold, silver-plated, gold-plated, rather,
*  you can take a tiny piece of gold and cover an enormous area with it. It's a strange metal.
*  Like, really weird. And what, you know, suppose the story is, it's very common on Earth, very rare on Nibiru.
*  Right. Yeah, that's the story. And then when I started looking into this gold thing myself,
*  and here's what I came up with. So when you start analyzing the text, you discover that there was a camp,
*  an encampment in a place called South Africa at Adam's calendar, okay?
*  Now, at Adam's calendar, there's actually the very first gold mines discovered.
*  They're dating them back to about 200,000 years ago. And that's incredible because there's a building there
*  that looks like a worn-down structure. Now, in the tablets, it talks about the fact that the Igigi,
*  who were the working-class Anunnaki beings who were cleaning out the Euphrates and Tigris River
*  so they can create irrigation and, you know, create a bustling civilization.
*  Also, what they were doing, the actual construction themselves, no people needed, just them working.
*  They were like the construction workers. And Anu and Enki and Enlil, these leader gods, were like, you know,
*  the foremen, the master architects and so forth, right, the boss. So these people were working,
*  but they weren't supposed to be enslaved. They were volunteers.
*  They got tired of doing the work according to them for about 250,000 years of labor on Earth
*  and also according to them on Mars. This is in the text. They call it Lamu.
*  And so they decided to go to war against Enki and Enlil and Anu because their demands had not been met.
*  So they went to meet them in the Epic of Atra-Hasis. They go to Adam's Calend.
*  They go to that same structure that was discovered where that gold mine is located.
*  I was like, holy crap, there is some link here to gold, specifically, exactly, I don't know,
*  but I know if you're an advanced civilization, you need gold. And the people that you have working it for,
*  you probably think, you know, it's to adorn or to adorn yourself or in recognition of the gods.
*  So they'll wear it and they'll utilize it, but not for technology.
*  What's crazy is they go to war, they go to get ready to go to battle.
*  And then Enki says, I have an idea that will stop this war. There's an existing being on this planet,
*  existing, not something that doesn't exist, existing. We can add our essence to it with a slain god.
*  So they're talking about taking the DNA or genetics from one of themselves
*  and mixing it with the DNA of the hominy that was here. It's not specified whether it was, you know,
*  an ape man or anything, but they don't specify in the tablets, but to create a worker being.
*  And they began to do this genetic modification, probably disconnecting some of our DNA,
*  making genetic modification to us to get us to take orders from them.
*  They inserted something called a worship gene, which was just discovered recently
*  that human beings have a gene inside of them that can be turned on and turned off.
*  It can be turned off in a laboratory setting. It can also be turned off with a magnetic field around your head.
*  And when it's off, you don't want to worship anything outside of yourself.
*  You look inside and when it's on, you look to get something from the outside.
*  So this is incredible. And so they made us worship people.
*  So they engineered a gene inside of us to make us worship them. How genius.
*  It's incredible because then you're not a slave anymore. You're doing this for the honor of the gods.
*  And for people who think this is all this talk is really crazy.
*  I want to put into perspective that we talked about this the other day that during the was it which war was it
*  where the Soviet Union was experimenting? Was it was scientists in the Soviet Union? Correct.
*  They're experimenting with creating a chimpanzee human being hybrid that they would probably send to war.
*  Yeah. So instead of having regular people, we would make this monster.
*  This freak ape man and send him to war and have him crush the enemies.
*  Yeah. How crazy is that? They knew how strong chips are.
*  I got an idea. Let's turn a chimp human. And that way if he dies, who gives a fuck?
*  We made him get him to go to work for us. Yeah.
*  And now if you're a supremely enlightened being, wouldn't you think of human beings with all of our folly and all of our chaos
*  and all of our war and bullshit and the Internet and disinformation, misinformation?
*  Wouldn't you think of us kind of the same way we would think about that chimp hybrid thing?
*  If I was a you know, I was the president of Russia.
*  I want my cousins to go to war or I want to send this freak that I made in a lab.
*  Yeah. And what's interesting, I'm glad you said made in a lab.
*  They had talked briefly in that text about fashioning people.
*  In other words, almost like they say it, they said the word fashioning, fashioning a being.
*  What was the do you remember the actual quote?
*  I got it. I would have to look it up the actual the actual quote.
*  But they describe it as fashion.
*  Fashion because they said even the lamb hadn't been fashioned yet.
*  So they had fashioned lambs. So they fashioned.
*  And it's also an epic of Gilgamesh. They fashion the friend that Gilgamesh went on the journey with.
*  He wasn't born from a woman's womb. They created him.
*  They created him an artificial being to go on this journey in the epic of Gilgamesh.
*  So they used that phrase several times in the tablets.
*  But they said, no, wait, that was almost like that's not a good idea because in some ways it seems as if they had known that the idea of making these artificial too many artificially created people wouldn't be a good idea.
*  Now, they didn't go deeper than that.
*  But you can see where we are today with AI and everything else.
*  And these, you know, these robots that are coming, maybe they knew something about that.
*  But they decided to take a biological being and genetically modifying program that to do the work.
*  And that's exactly what they did.
*  Well, if they really knew what we would be capable of and that we would be illogical overpopulation be a gigantic issue.
*  And in many parts, I mean, it's not really that big of an issue here, except for in cities.
*  But in many parts of the world, it's the whole country.
*  The whole country is New York City, which is just fucking bonkers.
*  You know, and you've got a one. It's actually not true.
*  It's like it's not even that bad, even in China.
*  China has a lot of open space. But when you're in those cities, they are massive and they are filled with people.
*  And that is probably what you'd imagine a higher being would do if it was like us, like kind of illogical and kind of a little bit reckless and has a little bit too much technology for the average person that didn't develop the technology.
*  But also you got some 85 IQ dope who has access to all the things that all these geniuses have created.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  I mean, you could you could figure it.
*  We talked to Michio Kaku. He built a nuclear reactor in his house.
*  Right. He was a kid.
*  I heard about that. It was crazy.
*  That's crazy. Yeah, I know.
*  That's so crazy.
*  But there's a lot of different stuff that you can do and have access to technology that is beyond anything you would ever be able to invent with your own mind.
*  But because we share things across the board where you would imagine that if you were an enlightened being from another planet that's a million years more advanced than us, you go, I see where this one's going.
*  You know, like that cousin who's an alcoholic and then he wins the lottery like, oh, shit, Derek just won the lottery.
*  Yeah. This is going to be crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  He's got 200 million dollars.
*  Right.
*  It's going to be fucking insane.
*  That's crazy. And they knew they were they were going outside their own guidelines and their own laws, their parameters, because they made a statement in the text.
*  They said the creator of all is going to punish them or they would have to answer to the creator of all for what they did here.
*  So that lets you know they weren't really gods.
*  They knew themselves that they weren't the creator of the universe, but that they they masqueraded as gods on this planet.
*  Just like we did when, you know, when different versions of human civilization would find primitive tribes like the cargo cults, the cargo cult that you talked about in your documentary.
*  That is so fascinating that during World War Two, planes landed on these remote places and these people built mock planes to show like what the thing was that came to visit them that they thought were like gods.
*  Wild.
*  Do you think that if the Anunnaki are real and if Nibiru really exists and there's another planet with highly intelligence beings that are far more advanced than us, if that's the case, do you think there's more advanced and more advanced and more just like we are to chimpanzees, they are to us, and then another races to them, and then it just keeps going on and on forever until you're god?
*  Absolutely.
*  There's levels to the game, just like there's levels in terms of how we live on this planet.
*  Yeah, we have the first world, second world, third world, just here on Earth.
*  Now, magnify that as a fractal, as a universe as a whole.
*  You have civilizations that are million, two million, maybe even a billion years ahead.
*  And every civilization progressing within the universe at a specific rate.
*  So you can have beings that have already maybe even shed the corporeal bodies and only exist as beings of energetic light.
*  And then you have everything all the way back down towards us.
*  In the Emerald Tablets of Thoth, he actually says that he has achieved the ability to incarnate at will on and in the plane he desires.
*  He claims to be able to incarnate whenever he wants and even into other dimensions, which is wild.
*  That's next level.
*  Yeah, that's next level.
*  But it does make sense that if we're capable of doing what we're doing, we're talking about your phone, the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra with zooms and all this different shit, that's magic to someone just 200 years ago.
*  And if we keep if it keeps going and you keep like playing this out as far as possible, it kind of makes sense.
*  There would be levels to the kind of intelligent life that exists in the years beyond our comprehension.
*  Yeah.
*  What do you have?
*  You talked to Terrence Howard.
*  Do you know his theory about how planets are created, that it's just things ejecting from the sun over billions and billions of years and that there's a Goldilocks zone where you can create life?
*  Right. And that's where the people are.
*  And then as this Goldilocks zone gets you have to be super technologically proficient in order to control your environment to the extent that you no longer require the sun in order to keep you alive.
*  That kind of makes sense if the bureau is out there past Pluto.
*  Oh, it makes a lot of sense.
*  It makes sense that they because I just talked to him a couple hours ago.
*  OK. Yeah.
*  I mean, so we were talking about web conjugations and everything.
*  Fuck me up for three days.
*  I left this podcast for three days.
*  I was like, yeah, damn.
*  First of all, how the fuck is he so smart?
*  Like, how would you ever imagine that a dude who's an actor on a television show or in a movie is that smart?
*  Like, freaky smart.
*  Right.
*  But but his theory about the creation of planets, I was like, oh, that makes sense.
*  Oh, it makes a lot of sense.
*  We watch stuff fly off the sun all the time.
*  And if that this matter over time would coalesce and become a planet.
*  Yeah, Chris, an accretion disk and everything in space creates accretion disks.
*  So once that matter word accretion, accretion.
*  Yeah.
*  So once you have a certain amount of mass in space, it instantaneously on its own wants to create this circular like the shape of our Milky Way galaxy wants to start circling and swerving around itself.
*  And then as it does that, it creates begins to create friction as that that friction increases.
*  The the the matter begins to collapse in towards each other.
*  All right. Based on its own energy.
*  And then it then forms a ball and that then builds and attracts more mass until it builds into a moon or a planet or whatever.
*  What do you do when you encounter flat Earth people?
*  Oh, man, I just I just try to be quiet.
*  I just tell them, look, it's not my thing.
*  You know, I remember a flat Earth society offered me money years and years ago.
*  And I was like, no, I don't believe the Earth is flat.
*  I'm not getting involved with this.
*  And they really attacked me hard.
*  Death threats and everything else.
*  They get very upset.
*  Yeah, I do not understand.
*  I just think it's people committing to an idea.
*  Yeah, it just doesn't make sense.
*  What's the religion now?
*  They turned it into a religion.
*  Anytime that people can attack you so brutally over that.
*  I mean, you're talking on live talking about quantum physics in their end of chat.
*  The Earth is flat.
*  They're just I mean, so that's that's like, I mean, one guy was fascinated by it because it's interesting.
*  Yeah, because it's the ultimate conspiracy theory.
*  The ultimate conspiracy theory is that we are all on a set and that the world, the Earth is flat.
*  It's a disk is a wall.
*  The government's aware of it.
*  They won't let you pass.
*  The ice walls.
*  Yeah, there's ice walls.
*  Yeah.
*  And that space is just lights in the sky.
*  Right.
*  That's it.
*  And if the sun is a bulb and all this kind of stuff, it's wild.
*  And it's attached to a version of Christianity, which is very interesting.
*  It is.
*  It's tied into Christianity.
*  The six thousand year old theme.
*  The only six thousand year old reason why people think they're up to six thousand years old is because most of the tablets are six thousand years old.
*  And the Bible was written from the information that came from tablets.
*  So that's as far back as anybody's quote unquote knowledge seems to extend.
*  That's what a six thousand year old theory comes from.
*  But they've taken that thing and turned it into a religion.
*  I remember one guy DM me and he was going off and telling me he was going to shoot me in the head and all this stuff.
*  And I said, let me ask you a question.
*  If there's no atmosphere, then what are you breathing right now?
*  He goes, what do you mean?
*  I'm breathing oxygen.
*  I said, well, that's a gas.
*  Gas doesn't exist.
*  I said, well, then you should be dead then because you're breathing a gas.
*  What else are you inhaling when you breathe?
*  He goes oxygen.
*  I said, well, no, you're breathing in helium, Krypton, you know, nitrogen.
*  I said, you're breathing in all these other gases.
*  Oxygen is only about 21 percent of that.
*  Otherwise, you'd be dead.
*  So he didn't know.
*  He couldn't say, did you graduate from high school?
*  He said, no, I stopped talking.
*  That's when I realized don't waste your energy on these people.
*  Well, there's a lot of dudes, unfortunately, who just get on YouTube and they listen to very charismatic people talk.
*  They don't know what they're talking about, which I do all the time.
*  But they do it in a way where they pretend they know something is true that's not true.
*  And people get sucked into it.
*  And I just don't understand why you would think that Earth is the only one out of all these things that we've observed that's flat.
*  It just doesn't make any sense.
*  And I think this is respectfully to all these people that believe that.
*  I think it's a giant waste of time.
*  I think concentrating on the shape of the earth, even if it was flat, who fucking cares?
*  Look at what's going on out there.
*  It would be kind of crazy if it was flat.
*  That would kind of like bolster the idea that we're the shit and that we're just so much more powerful and advanced and special than everything else in the universe.
*  We're the only ones that exist on a flat plane.
*  But the whole thing is just so insane.
*  Just what we know about the physical universe itself and about atoms and just what we know about all the matter that exists in our lives is insane.
*  Yeah, it's insane.
*  I mean, obviously they haven't tapped into it.
*  Forget quantum.
*  Standard physics, they don't comprehend it.
*  And so because of that, they're lost.
*  I mean, satellites don't exist, obviously, to them.
*  That's a kooky one.
*  I remember Hurricane Maria.
*  The satellites don't exist.
*  That's a kooky one.
*  Bro, you can watch them.
*  I mean, it's crazy.
*  Hurricane Maria comes and destroys the Caribbean.
*  And unfortunately, I have some loved ones that were involved in that.
*  And I posted a picture of the hurricane because I was raising money for hurricane supplies and they were commenting and attacking.
*  That's a fake image.
*  It doesn't exist.
*  I'm like, wow.
*  But let me ask you this.
*  How much of that is bullshit?
*  Like how much of that is government, either entities from other foreign governments where they jump into these subjects to make people seem really stupid?
*  And when people say something really stupid, one of the things they like to do is put a foreign flag, like an American flag rather, in their profile.
*  And they're just saying, that dumb as shit.
*  And I'm going, I don't know if this is a real person.
*  I think it's not.
*  I think it's one of those things that's designed to muddy up any discourse about anything.
*  Yeah, it's a Psyop.
*  I'm telling you, I told people a long time ago this whole flutterer thing was a CIA Psyop.
*  I think it was.
*  Drop it in there and see what happens.
*  It wasn't a CIA Psyop.
*  It was someone from 4chan who just wanted to be silly and went so hard with explanations that a lot of gullible people without science degrees like me, they went along with it.
*  And it's just one of those things where it's just, man, what a giant waste of time.
*  It is.
*  It's a waste of energy.
*  And there's so much more we can learn like these ancient texts.
*  And people say, why are you always focused on the ancient past?
*  Well, because the past is prologue.
*  If we don't understand what happened back then, we're doomed to continue to repeat these cycles of time that we've been in for quite some time, for eons.
*  Yeah, I mean, it's just direct evidence that civilizations don't last when they go kooky.
*  Yes.
*  You know, and the things go sideways and there's natural disasters and wars that reshape landscapes.
*  Look, it's all there and it's happening right now.
*  And if we're not aware of it, it'll happen to us.
*  And then we'll be a footnote of history.
*  We'll be one of those things.
*  There was this amazing country called America.
*  They got crazy.
*  They created all this art and culture and they did amazing things that they went fucking sideways.
*  They sold out the money.
*  They got involved in wars.
*  And then the next thing you know, the world is operating essentially like communist China, the whole world.
*  Yeah.
*  That's possible, too, kids.
*  All right.
*  You got to be you got to fight for this.
*  Whatever this thing is that we have, this is like super fucking unique.
*  But if you don't want to look at the past, if you're not fascinated by ancient structures, if you're not fascinated by what's going on in the past,
*  you're not fascinated by what kind of technology and knowledge that they have.
*  Four thousand five hundred plus years ago to make the pyramids.
*  Who are these people?
*  Exactly.
*  What were they doing?
*  Yeah.
*  How did they do that?
*  And what was that thing?
*  Was that a power plant?
*  Right.
*  I mean, I know you know that theory.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  That is a crazy theory that sounds so it sounds completely wackadoo.
*  But then when you have it laid out to you, Christopher, what's his last name?
*  Done.
*  Christopher Dunn.
*  He was on my podcast a few weeks.
*  I just had him a couple of weeks ago.
*  I just had a brain fart.
*  His depiction of the mechanisms that would be involved in turning this giant structure into some sort of a power plant.
*  You hear about you.
*  Wait a minute.
*  Whoa.
*  Yeah.
*  It makes a lot of sense.
*  And him and I have very similar theories on how the power generation occurred.
*  And I believe that the Nile, you know, when it used to run up close to the pyramids and the water would run underneath the pyramid.
*  And that would create something called physiostatic electricity as it ran underneath that magnetized crystal granite.
*  Those ions would pour up into the chamber, move up the grand gallery where there used to be resonating rods.
*  You can see the slots where the rods used to be.
*  They're removed now, but the slots are still there.
*  Then it would be pushed into the king's chamber where it would be amplified and some type of fusion would take place, then forced up through the apex.
*  And then the crystal granite obelisks around the region would capture that ambient wireless electricity.
*  And then if you had something called a jet, which looks like a Tesla coil, you can you can capture that energy and you can transfer it into a device for gold electroplating for any other electrical tools you need, like some of the tools they had to have used to create some of these incredible works of art.
*  We can see the tool marks.
*  So we know they had the tools.
*  But they had wireless electricity way back then.
*  That's insane.
*  That is, if that's true, that's insane.
*  Because you would think there would be some kind of physical evidence of a device like something left over.
*  Some sort of ancient chainsaw, like something.
*  Yeah, they did a great job cleaning up.
*  I mean, they poured sand over Giza to bury another couple hundred pyramids there at Giza.
*  Do you think they poured sand?
*  Do you think that's just natural erosion over time?
*  Because when Giza, when the pyramids existed, it was a very different place, right?
*  Like, if you go back before the pyramids, like 9000 years ago, it was a lush rainforest, right?
*  Yeah.
*  And then over time, it became sand.
*  And the same with the entire Sahara Desert, which is really crazy.
*  We just were talking about the other day, they find whale bones in the Sahara Desert.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  I'm going to the Valley of the Whales in a few weeks in Egypt, actually.
*  It's incredible that there's whale bones out there also.
*  So we're going out there to the Valley of the Whales.
*  Whale bones?
*  Yeah.
*  Whoa.
*  But so the point being that this place has changed radically, like absolutely radically over time.
*  So who knows what's, do you know why those things were covered up?
*  Is it possible that it was just sand over time?
*  Well, if you look at the tablets again, they talk about this war, right?
*  And this war that occurred, there's a lot of wars, obviously, but this one particular war,
*  it seems like the same one that damaged the area or the region of the Giza Plateau,
*  also Mohenjandaro in the Indus Valley up there by Pakistan.
*  And the reason why it's interesting is if you look at the war in the Texan and Goethe's areas,
*  it looks now almost you can begin to see, oh, wait a minute, it looks like war.
*  Mohenjandaro in this valley, the buildings turned to glass.
*  The sand turned to glass and the bodies are still laying in the street right now today, holding hands.
*  Never been scavenged by animals.
*  Wait a minute, where is this?
*  Mohenjandaro.
*  Are there photos that we can look at?
*  Oh yeah, look it up.
*  Mohenjandaro in this valley, dead bodies still laying in the street thousands of years later.
*  Nobody, they just lay there?
*  No one's covered them up?
*  No one's covered them up.
*  Yeah, when you put a Geiger counter over them, higher than background level radiation.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  But aren't stones higher than background level radiation?
*  Some stones are, some stones are, especially like diorite and crystal granite.
*  But these bodies, these are just bones.
*  How come they're higher than background level radiation?
*  I can't wait to see this.
*  I haven't ever heard of this.
*  Mohenjandaro, M-O-H-E-N, there you go.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah, this is evidence of a nuclear war or nuclear type of a war.
*  Oh, the other, the one, that one there, that one's insane.
*  Yeah.
*  There's bodies that are sitting on the edge of steps next to their own buildings that they lived in.
*  The building is turned to glass.
*  That's 3,000 plus degree temperature weapons fire.
*  So there's a bunch of people that seem to die all at once just scattered around?
*  Yeah.
*  And what's the conventional explanation for how these people died?
*  They have no idea.
*  They have zero idea.
*  The only thing that you can...
*  That was just a couple, Jamie.
*  Jamie, go to the other, just the Mohenjandaro mythical massacre.
*  Yeah.
*  So did they think it's a massacre?
*  Is there any...
*  Look at their bodies.
*  Yeah, look at the guys just laying there.
*  Just laying there.
*  And that building, those stones are vitrified, which means 3,000 plus degree temperature.
*  Oh, shit.
*  What kind of, you know, what could have caused that level of temperature, energetic release?
*  Well, it could have been a low atmosphere asteroid.
*  It could have been.
*  It could have been.
*  That's possible.
*  Tunguska.
*  Yeah, it could have been a low...
*  But then their bones would have been splattered apart and broken into pieces.
*  Good call.
*  Yeah, that's good call.
*  Yeah, because they don't seem to be broken apart.
*  No, they're not broken apart.
*  Right.
*  That impact would have shattered the bones and spread them out over a great distance.
*  Right, but without impact, even if you just look at the one that burst in the atmosphere
*  in Tunguska, it just flattened trees.
*  Flattened everything.
*  All the trees.
*  I think it's some insane, like a million acres or something crazy.
*  Yeah, it's incredible.
*  How big was the Tunguska explosion?
*  That one's...
*  Yeah, so those bodies would be toast because the trees were ripped apart.
*  The buildings would have been flattened.
*  The legs would have flown off.
*  There's no way they would just be laying there like that.
*  Exactly.
*  That's interesting.
*  And they don't seem to be like chopped up.
*  No.
*  Did they have any evidence of stab wounds or anything on them?
*  They don't have any evidence of any injury, of any kind of attack or any cutting or like
*  swords or anything.
*  They just all got cooked.
*  Right.
*  And then in the tablets it says that the evil wind moved over to land after they released
*  these weapons.
*  And then Enki goes to his father.
*  I mean, yeah, Enki goes to his father Anu and says, hey, can you stop the evil wind?
*  Because he had fallen in love with some people down there.
*  And he's like, there's nothing I can do.
*  He said, get in your sky ship and forebow.
*  That means get the hell out of here.
*  And he said that people's hair was falling out.
*  Their eyes were bleeding.
*  Their nose were bleeding.
*  Their fingernails were curling off.
*  That sounds like radiation sickness.
*  So do you think it's radiation sickness that did this to all these people or was it an
*  impact that did this to all these people?
*  Nobody knows.
*  Nobody knows.
*  But they're not blown apart.
*  Right.
*  They're not blown apart.
*  It seems like whatever struck or whatever energetic weapon it was, it might not have
*  been a weapon.
*  Whatever it was, it seems like that shock wave reached them at some point.
*  And whatever was in that wave just killed everybody.
*  That's what it did.
*  Yeah.
*  And they just don't know what it is.
*  How does a conventional archaeologist describe it?
*  Do they just say it's a massacre?
*  They just call it a mythical massacre and they stay away from it.
*  When you look in the other texts, the Mahabharata and the Bhagavad Gita, you find out about these
*  wars also.
*  They're recorded.
*  They have weapons called the Brahma Astra and the Brahma Handa weapon.
*  And these weapons, what they describe them as doing, duplicate what you saw there.
*  How do they describe them?
*  They describe them as weapons that once released can't be revolted or can't be turned back
*  and that they will obliterate any area, any city.
*  And they say that some of the one of the weapons can destroy any man on three worlds.
*  It's crazy stuff.
*  This is where Oppenheimer got his famous quote when he obviously tested the nuke, right?
*  Right.
*  Now I have become death, destroyer of worlds.
*  He got that from the Mahabharata.
*  Yeah.
*  What a great quote to say after you detonate the first nuclear bomb.
*  Oh man, crazy.
*  What a great quote.
*  So the idea is that there were beings that were having wars on this planet.
*  Do you believe they were having wars with people that were revolting or were they having
*  wars with other beings?
*  They were fighting with each other.
*  And evidence of these wars can be found in the book of Deuteronomy in the modern day
*  Bible.
*  These gods, I didn't mean gods with an S, because everywhere in the Bible where it says
*  God's singular, it's actually a mistranslation.
*  The actual, if you backwards look up the translation in Arabic and down to Aramaic and
*  everything else, you find out it's God's plural.
*  They were fighting each other over resources and people and control of control of the planet.
*  And so that's why in the book of Deuteronomy, God tells people go to this city and it's
*  like a far city where they don't even know these people exist.
*  They go over there to kill him.
*  He says, kill the women, kill the children and bring the spoils of war back to me.
*  And you see these wars in the Mahabharata, the Bhagavad Gita, the Bible, the Sumerian
*  tablets.
*  And these wars are just non-savvy.
*  The Indian Vedas.
*  And it's always about attacking another city and even talk about Trojan horse methods to
*  get behind the gates and then to utilize that to attack and kill and bring back these spoils,
*  which is pretty crazy stuff.
*  It's like they were attacking each other.
*  They had gone awry.
*  They had gone rogue out here on this planet and then began to fight over people and populations
*  and resources.
*  And we would hope that we would get past that, but there's no evidence that we have so far.
*  So why would we think that as AI gets implemented and technology escalates and all we're going
*  to be able to do in the future in terms of being able to go visit other planets and duke
*  it out on other planets?
*  There was a whole story today about China just landed on the far side of the moon.
*  So they landed a probe over there.
*  It says, you know, China-America war on the moon.
*  What if America claims a spot and China lands and plants a flag there and they're like,
*  hey, fuck you, that's ours.
*  Now that's what's going to happen.
*  Especially if there's like something on the moon they can mine.
*  It's very valuable.
*  Oh, this stuff up there.
*  I researched the Clementine mission years ago.
*  NASA and the United States military sent a military at that time.
*  It was a top secret mission called Clementine.
*  It was a low lunar orbiting satellite to go to the dark side of the moon.
*  And when I saw the name Clementine, I knew right away this thing ain't coming back.
*  And as I began to dig deeper into the declassified documents, of course, it never came back.
*  Oh, my darling Clementine, you were lost and gone forever.
*  Forever.
*  Wow.
*  And I was right.
*  And sure enough, it hit something on the dark side of the moon, which is really just the backside.
*  It's not really dark there, but it hit something.
*  But it sent back about 20 gigs of data.
*  And these images are available to the general public.
*  They've been declassified.
*  And there are strange anomalies on those images.
*  This is pre-Photoshop, pre-everything.
*  Things that shouldn't be there that look like broken structures and junk and things that just seem to be laying around.
*  So I think it was a reconnaissance mission to gather intel and data, which is probably why China's gone to that far side of the moon as well, because they're probably going to...
*  It's a race to see who can capture ancient technology and then reverse engineer it and then weaponize it.
*  Well, that's the most fun theory ever.
*  The most fun theory ever is that there's bases on the moon, on the dark side of the moon, that aliens have abandoned.
*  Jamie, are there any photos of these anomalies?
*  That's the most fun.
*  I can provide you some with links to the sources, too.
*  Okay. That'd be cool. But Jamie will probably find something.
*  So what do these structures look like to you when you look at them?
*  There's dome structures there.
*  A dome?
*  There's domes.
*  As a matter of fact, one of the astronauts, I think it was Neil Armstrong, if you get the declassified from the Freedom of Information Act documents that are the black box audio and the black box redacted text statement from NASA, which is available to the general public,
*  Neil says, look at those convex structures down there.
*  I bet that people in there never get out.
*  And he's talking about dome structures on the moon.
*  And this is an exact statement that was made that's in the black box audio, which I can provide you to link to that as well.
*  Okay. So where are these structures?
*  Do you see any of these that you find compelling?
*  You need to look for anomalies on the backside of the moon.
*  We utilize a lot of these on our Facebook groups.
*  On Facebook, we have these groups, anomaly hunting groups.
*  We formed the United Family of Anomaly Hunters and we've cataloged about 60,000 anomalies now.
*  A lot of them are on the dark side of the moon.
*  But type in Clementine Moon photos anomaly.
*  You may be able to find some.
*  If not, I'll send you the link to some resources where you can look them up and you can take a look at some of these crazy objects that are there.
*  Is that one right there in the upper right hand corner?
*  Yeah, that one's there.
*  That's a structure that kind of looks like two pyramids onto the left of it.
*  And then another structure, which almost seems like has geometry.
*  Underneath that, you see the blur?
*  That looks like obfuscation.
*  Directly, if you go back up to that top right.
*  Top right?
*  Yeah, top right B.
*  Okay, you see that where his hand is?
*  I move to the left going down slowly.
*  See that? Go back up again.
*  See that? Where his hand is over right now?
*  It looks like obfuscation.
*  Sometimes you can take these images and put them into a Photoshop and take away the contrast and all of a sudden structures pop right out.
*  But right above that, you see those shadows of those pyramid structures?
*  Right above that.
*  You see those pyramids? You can see this dark shadow.
*  I see two lines.
*  I see the arrow that's pointing to that one straight line and then I see what looks like two superimposed arrows.
*  Okay, do you see?
*  Yeah, those things.
*  Okay, yeah.
*  Those are superimposed, right?
*  No, those are shadows.
*  But look, those are the same things that are in the bottom.
*  Aren't they just pointing at something? Aren't those pointers?
*  I think they may be highlighting something.
*  Right, I think it's a cursor mark or something.
*  So, I see what they're pointing to.
*  They're pointing to that thing in the upper right hand corner that kind of looks like a pyramid.
*  Yeah, you see that right there?
*  Yeah.
*  It kind of looks like a pyramid.
*  It's cleaned up a little bit there in C. C is more clean.
*  But those things don't look like they belong there.
*  Well, it's hard to tell.
*  Yeah, it's hard to tell.
*  But that pyramid right there is very famous.
*  That's a very old image that's on the moon.
*  There should be a link to that.
*  There's a lot of that particular one that's been around for years and years and years.
*  It's kind of hard to think that that were formed by natural.
*  Now, what happens is we're not saying we know exactly what these things are.
*  We're just saying that we feel like they don't belong there.
*  Jamie, go back to that image that you were just looking at, the thing that looked like a pyramid.
*  That one, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, get that one big.
*  Hmm.
*  That one's crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  That one's very strange looking because the way it points at the top and has flat sides, like, yeah, you're like, yeah.
*  So if that's real, that's interesting.
*  Yeah.
*  But it's all that is.
*  That's a good question.
*  There's a measuring tool.
*  We don't have it.
*  Obviously, access to it right here.
*  So there's a measuring tool.
*  You can see the shadow, which gives you an idea of the height.
*  I'd like to see in real life, though.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like sometimes things fuck with you.
*  It's just but the angles so unnatural looking.
*  Yeah, definitely looks unnatural.
*  We just try to catalog things that appear to be anomalies, things that appear to be out of place.
*  Right.
*  It could be anything.
*  And in the Sumerian Tavis, there's this time where Enlil takes his son to the moon and he says, well, grab your eagle's mask because you're going to need it.
*  They were referencing that the atmosphere was harsh.
*  So when you see the anunnaki with the eagle's head, that's actually their helmet.
*  It's a helmet.
*  So they can breathe air.
*  Exactly.
*  They talk about it twice, once to go to the moon and the second time to go to Mars.
*  Yeah.
*  And there's been other depictions of ancient gods and people that look like they're wearing some kind of mask.
*  Right. Yeah, exactly.
*  I mean, one of the cooler ones is the bubble space head looking guys in the cave.
*  Yes.
*  And you're like, what did you guys say?
*  Right.
*  Like, what did you guys see in the middle of like hunting gazelles, trying to stay alive, trying to make a fire?
*  And then you decided to draw that thing?
*  Right.
*  What is that?
*  And we know they can draw it because they can show you what a gazelle is.
*  They can show you what a cat with cattle is.
*  They can show you what a person looks like.
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  And then they draw that and you have to think, well, why?
*  Right.
*  Why is that the only thing you drew that's fake?
*  Right.
*  Exactly.
*  They just have to prime the waist.
*  And it looks like a dude in a suit with a helmet on.
*  Right.
*  And here's the question.
*  How many different things are visiting us?
*  And from how many different places?
*  Oh, a lot.
*  We can't just think everything's going to look exactly the same.
*  That seems just as silly as thinking that all of our animals should look exactly the same.
*  Correct.
*  I think we have three different levels of visitation going on simultaneously.
*  One is corporeal beings in a physical body, most likely anatomically similar to us, you
*  know, a bilateral bipedal organism with two forward-facing eyes, maybe one or two sets
*  of hands.
*  Do you think it's what we eventually become?
*  That what they are?
*  It's possible that maybe we already are them.
*  Just, you know, Earth could be an abandoned seed colony.
*  Every culture that I've talked to, indigenously, around the planet, all say they were seeded
*  on this planet by Pleiadians or other beings, star brothers in various different places.
*  Like the Dogons.
*  It's pretty interesting.
*  Like the Dogons, the Nomo, the Hopi and the Lakota tribe, the Star Brothers, the Aboriginal
*  elders say that they were seeded here by Pleiadians.
*  All of a sudden, why is everybody having the same story that we were brought here?
*  We could be genetically, I don't believe we're even from Earth, to be quite honest with you.
*  Our psychotic rhythm doesn't even match Earth's rotation on its axis.
*  We're slightly off.
*  It's actually better tuned to Mars orbit on its rotation on its own axis.
*  What do you mean?
*  How does that work?
*  The psychotic rhythm of a human body, the wake and sleep cycle, is actually more tuned
*  to Mars rotation on its own axis.
*  A Mars day versus an Earth day, which is pretty weird.
*  That we aren't synced to our own planet after all these thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands
*  of years.
*  Is that the same as our circadian rhythm?
*  Circadian rhythm, right.
*  So when, how do they calculate it's more tuned to Mars?
*  Like how does that work?
*  Well, it's just, they, geneticists and scientists discovered that our day, our perfect wake
*  and sleep cycle is more tuned to Mars rotation on its axis, which is about 23 and something
*  minute hours, versus Earth being 24 hours.
*  And so they said, wow, this is incredible.
*  The more they tested it and the more they studied it, they realized we're more tuned
*  to the Mars than we are to Earth, which is pretty strange.
*  Well, we are weird.
*  We have, we accept shit like leap year.
*  Right.
*  Like what kind of whack calendar do you have where-
*  Here's makeup stuff.
*  If some years the month is longer, what the fuck are you doing?
*  I know.
*  Make a better calendar.
*  Isn't there a better calendar?
*  Yeah.
*  Shouldn't there be like a digital calendar that represents exactly what's going on and
*  not go January?
*  Come on, fuck out of here.
*  It's so dumb.
*  I know, it's pretty bizarre.
*  But you know what's interesting, if you want to say, oh, human beings could be aliens,
*  well, actually every person on this planet is an alien.
*  Even our planet itself is an alien.
*  Scientists just discovered something interesting.
*  I've never talked about this yet on a podcast.
*  You guys should look this up.
*  So our Milky Way galaxy is pretty interesting because it's absorbing another
*  galaxy at this exact moment called the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, not the
*  Sagittarius constellation.
*  That's something totally different.
*  We are absorbing the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy at this exact moment.
*  People thought for all these decades, looking up, even hundreds of years, looking up in
*  the night sky, seeing that swath of stars going across, that's the Milky Way.
*  Guess what?
*  We've been wrong the whole time.
*  This is now being taught in universities and astrophysics.
*  So what you're looking at, you're looking at the absorption or the merging of the
*  Sagittarius with the Milky Way galaxy.
*  And the exact point where it merges and drops into the Milky Way is right where our
*  solar system is located, which would explain the rogue planets that we know that are out there.
*  There's millions of rogue planets that have no sun that are just floating free around.
*  There's planets and solar systems that are orbiting far beyond the orbit of Pluto in our inner
*  Oort cloud, admitted by astronomers now, that there's other solar systems within this inner
*  Oort cloud area orbiting our sun every 4,200 years.
*  So all of a sudden, that's Corey Powell, the astronomer at Discovery magazine, by the way,
*  who said that.
*  So this is pretty interesting.
*  We're talking about the fact that our solar system itself is an implant into the Milky Way
*  that we come from Sagittarius.
*  We're not even part of the Milky Way galaxy.
*  Whoa.
*  Okay.
*  So when they're looking at our own solar system, they have an understanding that there's a
*  thing called the Kuiper Belt that's out there, and there's so many objects in there that are small.
*  And that's one of the reasons why they decided to declassify Pluto as a planet, because
*  there's other objects real similar in size.
*  Yeah, Maki Maki and all those other planets.
*  But they think there's something large out there.
*  They think there's something large out there that they haven't yet identified because of the way
*  that gravity is responding.
*  What is the reason for it?
*  Well, what happens is they discovered that in some way, millions of years ago, something moved
*  through our solar system and captured its own weird orbit around our sun.
*  And what's crazy is the evidence is in our solar system.
*  So Saturn and Neptune switch locations because of a gravitational field.
*  Uranus has flipped on its side and orbits its equator.
*  It's orbiting north and south, not east and west.
*  And they know that...
*  Like it got hit.
*  Like it got hit or something gravitationally just tugged at it so hard that it flipped sideways.
*  And it never stops.
*  Never stop.
*  And it moved through our solar system way out beyond the orbit of Pluto, and this thing
*  captured its own orbit.
*  This is in the Enuma Elysium, the seven types of creation.
*  This exact process that's been described now by astrophysicists and astronomers is
*  an ancient text that we can read and we can see, oh my God, this is exactly what this
*  text is saying.
*  It's talking about the creation of our solar system.
*  It even talks about the creation of Earth in that text.
*  It says that when Marduk, aka Nibiru, a moon of Nibiru, crashed into Tiamat, it broke into
*  pieces and became the hammered bracelet.
*  That's the asteroid belt.
*  So it's pretty crazy that the creation of this planet itself, and it says that it pushed
*  the net force, pushed Mercury closer to the sun and pushed Venus closer to the sun, and
*  then we took the third spot in place around our orbit, around our sun.
*  Then, of course, we have Mars, which used to be a moon, a habitable moon of Tiamat,
*  a planet that was four to six times larger than Earth, and it slung into this crazy orbit.
*  That's why Mars has this weird orbit, and you have to rendezvous with it if you're NASA
*  or anybody trying to rendezvous with Mars every two years.
*  When it's an apogee or perigee, you have to, apogee or perigee, one of them is further
*  away than the other.
*  One is 80 million miles and the other one's closer.
*  So if you rendezvous every two years, you can capture the orbit of Mars and you can
*  actually get there in four months.
*  Then they looked at it and said, wow, they meaning astrophysicists, this looks like this
*  Mars wasn't originally in this type of orbit.
*  It must have been orbiting something else in our solar system, which it was.
*  One side is charred black and the other side is smooth.
*  So the side where Tiamat exploded, those chunks hit Mars on one side, created a very charred
*  side, and the other side is the smoothest surface in the solar system, which is because
*  of the global flood that that created.
*  And then Mars' axis on its equator is tilted 45 degrees on its axis, which means the mass
*  shifted it down 45 degrees.
*  They had a major global catastrophe there on Mars.
*  And then after Mars, you have another little planet that survived called Ceres, C-E-R-E-S,
*  which is also a result of this Tiamat exploding.
*  People don't even talk about Ceres.
*  It has the most fresh water out of any other planet in our solar system.
*  And where is its location?
*  That's the next planet after Mars, Ceres.
*  Really?
*  C-E-R-E-S.
*  How big is it?
*  Is it like pull-on sized?
*  It's about maybe two-thirds smaller than Mars.
*  And guess what?
*  It's a dwarf planet.
*  So they don't, it's, it follows an orbit between Mars and Jupiter near the middle of the asteroid
*  belt with an orbital period.
*  Click on that, Jamie?
*  When they flew by it about...
*  You heard about this before?
*  I didn't know there was another planet out there.
*  Listen, when they flew by it a few years ago, the lights were on.
*  They sent the probe out there.
*  What?
*  The lights were on.
*  I'm sorry, I'm trying to say it was ice particles glistening in the sunlight.
*  So when they got to the dark side, guess what?
*  The lights were on on the dark side.
*  So they couldn't use the ice particle explanation anymore.
*  So they just said, we don't know what it is.
*  What?
*  Ceres' small size means that even at its brightest, it's too dim to be seen by the naked eye,
*  except under extremely dark skies.
*  Its apparent magnitude ranges from 6.7 to 9.3, peaking in opposition when it's closest to Earth.
*  Once every 15 to 16 month in...
*  How do you say that word?
*  Synodic?
*  I don't know where you're at now.
*  16 month synodic period.
*  Oh, yeah, synodic.
*  Synodic period.
*  Synodic.
*  Synodic.
*  As a result, its surface features are barely visible even with the most powerful telescopes,
*  and little is known about it until the robotic NASA spacecraft Dawn approached Ceres for its orbital mission in 2015.
*  And we have high resolution images of the surface.
*  There are strange things there as well, which is pretty crazy.
*  What are the images of the surface?
*  You have to go to nasa.gov and go to the Dawn images, and you can download, or sometimes the European Space Agency has them as well, E.S.
*  And then you can grab those images.
*  It's pretty crazy.
*  Some things just don't look right there.
*  But there's a lot...
*  What doesn't look right?
*  Well, you know, if you look at Mohenjandara or areas of Egypt, or even Iraq where there used to be Sumeria, structures that used to be there that are now worn down and weathered,
*  they have similar looks there, similar things.
*  They look similar there.
*  Not saying that they are.
*  I'm just saying that they look strange.
*  We have a lot of strange things on Earth that aren't natural.
*  That's true.
*  We sure do.
*  We even have octagons and straight lines on Earth that are natural as well.
*  That was one of the craziest ones that Terrence brought up was the octagon on Saturn.
*  Yeah.
*  Was it Saturn?
*  Yeah.
*  Saturn.
*  Saturn.
*  That when you look at the octagon on Saturn, it's mimicked in the model that they created by using...
*  The whole idea that he really blew my mind with was the Goldilocks Zone idea.
*  That planets reach a certain distance from the sun and that's when life starts happening and this is a normal force that happens everywhere in the universe.
*  As time goes on, that planet is going to get further and further from the sun and it's going to lose its ability to do that and then a new planet will move into the Goldilocks Zone.
*  And that is also going to become like us.
*  And then so if you are following this idea, if this idea makes sense, it means that this is just this sort of natural process that these intelligent creatures go through.
*  And even though we're looking at AI and we're looking at technology, it's like, oh my God, we can't even be people anymore.
*  Guess what?
*  We can't be people anymore because we're not going to make it if we don't.
*  There's a timeline.
*  It seems like you're only going to live 100 years so it's no big deal.
*  But humans, if we keep going a few million years, we're going to have a real problem.
*  A billion years from now, we're not going to be around anymore.
*  And then there's going to come a time where the sun doesn't exist anymore.
*  Exactly.
*  So if you get so intelligent that you can escape the boundaries of the physical world and you can move throughout the cosmos wherever you want, then you've escaped.
*  You've escaped this fear.
*  But it's almost like there's an intelligent test, an intelligence test that life goes through.
*  We're going to give you all the tools just like you're in the womb.
*  You're in the womb of Mother Earth.
*  We want to give you all the tools, but you got to get out of the house.
*  At a certain point in time, you got to get out of the house.
*  You're 24, still living at home.
*  Get the fuck out of the house.
*  They're waiting for us to grow up.
*  Human beings are like babies right now as a civilization, trying to learn how to walk.
*  And right now we're barely crawling.
*  And then we plop down on our stomach and everybody screams and cries.
*  But we're getting to the point eventually where we'll go to the edge of a table and pull ourselves up.
*  And then we'll take a couple of steps.
*  And then we'll fall again.
*  Everybody will think it's all over.
*  Oh my god, we were doing so good and it collapsed again.
*  But no, that's just a fall.
*  The baby will pull itself back up.
*  It'll cry less and it'll take more steps until it falls again, until it can get this controlled fall.
*  And that's the definition of walking, controlling your fall.
*  So we're in that process now.
*  Like you said, this is a proving ground for us to be able to develop consciously, spiritually, ascend to higher levels.
*  And eventually, I believe, I'm pretty optimistic for mankind that we will get through this period.
*  Well, that's a beautiful thing to hear.
*  I love when people are optimistic because I'm always like, I don't know which way I go.
*  I tend to be optimistic.
*  Well, you know, it proves what these ancient beings were doing.
*  They were creating breakaway civilizations throughout the entire Milky Way galaxy because of what you just said.
*  The fact that, you know, planets won't be habitable forever.
*  Even Earth, let's say Earth never moved and stayed right where it's at in the Goldilocks zone.
*  We're going to lose our control over the weather because the moon is moving away at a few centimeters every single year.
*  And as the moon backs off of Earth, our weather patterns are going to get more hectic and chaotic and the wobble is going to be uncontrollable
*  to the point where life won't be able to exist, not our kind of life won't be able to exist on this planet.
*  So just losing the moon alone in a few million years is going to destroy us.
*  So we have to create breakaway civilizations.
*  We have to get out of here, which is what all these other advanced civilizations in these ancient texts have done.
*  Well, it only makes sense if Terrence is correct about this idea of the Goldilocks zone.
*  It only makes sense.
*  And if there are other planets somewhere in another galaxy or ours that have the same exact sort of features,
*  water, the same temperature, the same mixture of amino acids and whatever the hell else is here that makes life.
*  And then it happens there, too.
*  It just makes sense that some places are going to be more stable.
*  So they're going to have less natural disasters.
*  So like people will evolve faster and longer, they'll exist longer.
*  But then, you know, there's the argument that the natural disasters are actually good because the natural disasters knock us back down.
*  If we're about to destroy everything, knock us back down to some much more primitive version of ourselves,
*  and then we have to rebuild society again over thousands of years, which to the universe is a blink of an eye.
*  That's a blink of an eye. You're right.
*  That's exactly what happened in the Emerald Talbots.
*  You know, 36,000 years ago, Thoth, he arrives in this place called the Land of Chim, ancient Chimic before it was known as Egypt.
*  His father sent them on a mission to rebuild civilization back up to a high level,
*  meaning that it already was at a high level prior to this flood situation.
*  And he says he gets into the great ship of the Master and he takes off into the sky until the Earth disappears.
*  And then he goes to the plane appointed and he sees beneath him the children of the Land of Chim and he descends down.
*  He doesn't sail in. He descends down.
*  And when the ship lands, he opens his doors and he comes out with his crew.
*  And he says the barbarians came at him to attack him with clutches and spears.
*  He says, I raised my staff and sent out a ray of vibrations, stopping him still as fragments of stone of the mountain.
*  So he had a stun gun.
*  He had a weapon that was not lethal, non-lethal weapon that can freeze you in your tracks.
*  And we have something just like that now in the military called the active denial system.
*  They can send a beam at a crowd coming to attack and make them stop still right in their tracks.
*  They can make you feel like you're on fire, make you feel like you want to vomit.
*  They can even put voices in your head. They can make you be an extreme, extreme pain.
*  It's called the active denial system.
*  So he's talking about technology back then that we have right now.
*  Dude, look up that. Do you think that's what that Havana syndrome thing is?
*  It's possible, man.
*  This thing, if you put it above, like in the sky and aim it at an area and a beam spreads a little bit, you can create mass illness, mass sickness, mass hysteria.
*  You can have everyone running around thinking that they've got somebody talking to them and telling commanding them to do certain things.
*  It's out of control.
*  This weapon can be fully weaponized in a lethal way and a way that can make people become psychotic.
*  You can make somebody think they're burning it on fire.
*  Whoa. Active denial system demo.
*  Can we listen to what this guy's saying?
*  It can deter individuals on a military perimeter all the way up to a riotous crowd, all without permanent harm.
*  It only penetrates one sixth of an inch of your skin, goes very shallow into where your nerve receptors are.
*  They can't take the pain.
*  Whoa.
*  And there's no permanent injury caused by it.
*  So what does it do to them?
*  It's kind of a frequency, a beam of frequency, just like Thoth says in the Animal Tablets.
*  I put this in my book because it's important.
*  Wow, he said fuck it.
*  He said fuck it.
*  Wow.
*  So that's what he used on them thousands of years ago.
*  Holy shit.
*  Or something like it.
*  2012?
*  Now they turned you into a statue.
*  Oh yeah, absolutely.
*  Now it's over.
*  Medusa.
*  Yeah.
*  Medusa.
*  Holy shit.
*  Same technique.
*  What do you think Medusa was?
*  Frequency technology.
*  Imagine that.
*  Imagine that story.
*  We always thought that was just some crazy story.
*  Imagine there's a technology back then that can actually turn you into stone.
*  Right.
*  Now that we know that people can do things like that and that we would imagine a thousand
*  years of evolution, ten thousand, five hundred thousand, whatever these people are, whatever
*  these things are that have the ability, it's kind of disappointing that they're still waging
*  a war there.
*  I've got to tell you that.
*  That's crazy.
*  That's a bummer.
*  That's a real archaic mindset.
*  You know, we have to find a way to rise above.
*  This is why we need to understand exactly what happened and how do we overcome what's
*  been embedded into our epigenetic memories because we're suffering from epigenetic mental
*  hysteria, which is psychosis and this war psychosis.
*  We've been programmed as human beings to have consumption and fighting and competition
*  over collaboration.
*  Yeah.
*  Everything is designed to keep us separate.
*  Dividing conquer is the main mission and it works so well for so many thousands of years.
*  And this dividing conquer tactic that's been burnt into our DNA and our code has put us
*  in a situation where we are not advancing as we should be.
*  We're getting now this technology leaked out to us.
*  And yes, that's advancing pretty fast.
*  But consciously and spiritually, it's holding us back.
*  Because everyone's putting themselves in boxes and saying, I'm a part of this thing and I'm
*  a part of that thing.
*  And then we don't work together.
*  No, that's such an important point and it needs to be drilled into people's heads.
*  We're distracting ourselves by getting involved in these stupid arguments over stupid things.
*  There's really important issues with the world and those aren't being addressed.
*  And one of the big ones is how do you stop people from killing each other?
*  How do you stop war?
*  How do we stop this insane practice of having groups of people go up against groups of people
*  they've never even met and killing them?
*  Exactly.
*  And then we're all okay with this?
*  We talk about how this is normal and this has to be done and this war is ugly and it's
*  unfortunate but we have to do it.
*  Okay, are you fucking sure?
*  Who's pulling the strings here?
*  People with $10,000 suits that don't get on the front line.
*  They send poor kids and young kids, young men and women to die.
*  Exactly.
*  And it's all about money.
*  It's all about money.
*  And, you know, Smedley Butler wrote about it in 1933.
*  War is a racket.
*  Yeah.
*  That's right.
*  Read that.
*  Read that from 1933, folks.
*  And this was a general who, was he a general?
*  He was a general.
*  Yeah.
*  A general.
*  Who was retiring and he wrote this piece about how he thought he was preserving democracy.
*  He was really just making the place safe for bankers.
*  It's just, it's an ugly business that Eisenhower tried to warn us about and is leaving from
*  office speech.
*  That's right.
*  When he stepped down or when he was no longer the president, he left office and gave a speech
*  about warning about the military industrial complex and its influence.
*  He sure did.
*  And I don't think they knew back then that people would be able to have YouTube and just
*  watch that.
*  Yeah.
*  If that's how they did it back then, imagine how good they are at it now.
*  Oh, man.
*  They're masters at neuroscience.
*  Applying neuroscience to the general population, they are masters at it.
*  And they know how to get into the psyche of a human being and they know how to turn them
*  against, turn us against each other while they themselves chop it all up.
*  Like I always say, there is no Democrat or Republican.
*  Doesn't exist.
*  The only thing that exists is a group of elite oligarchs that torture men, women and children
*  worldwide.
*  That exists.
*  They capitalize and monetize us and they put their boot on our neck.
*  But the thinking is left wing and right wing, I think it's the same bird.
*  Yeah.
*  It's all just money.
*  Yeah.
*  It's all money.
*  They're just people who are in control of their personal issues, whatever they are,
*  whether it's Christianity or abortion rights or whatever it is, they just use those as
*  little moves that they put in their little game.
*  And really what it's about is enriching themselves and staying in power.
*  And the best way to stay in power is control narratives and control influence and make
*  people believe a very specific thing and drill it into their head.
*  But the problem is like, I think human beings are more awake now than ever before and they
*  are more aware of the game now.
*  At least a large number of us know this game.
*  It's shifting so fast.
*  Yeah.
*  It's shifting like incredibly fast, which is great.
*  How old are you Billy?
*  I'll be 53 in September.
*  You look great.
*  Thanks man.
*  So you and I are basically close to the same age.
*  I'm 56.
*  And when we were kids, this version of the world was never discussed.
*  You would have to be a complete kook to think that money is why wars are started.
*  Oh, come on.
*  No one would ever do that.
*  Right.
*  You would be a complete kook to think that the pharmaceutical drug companies lie about
*  their drugs.
*  What are you talking about?
*  They can't do that.
*  They would be arrested.
*  Yeah.
*  You'd be a kook.
*  Yeah.
*  And now, especially after the pandemic, that's how everybody feels.
*  And then watching these wars go on between Ukraine and Russia and Palestine and Israel,
*  you're like, what the fuck is going on?
*  In the 21st century, this is still happening right now.
*  Yes.
*  In large scale.
*  And people are having debate over the acceptable amount of numbers of women and children that
*  are allowed to die in a war.
*  Right.
*  It's insane.
*  It's insane.
*  It's insanity.
*  It's insane.
*  Earth is, you know, partly, it's a giant mental facility.
*  Mental health is a major issue on this planet.
*  When a person can look at someone and say they deserve to die because of their beliefs
*  or their non-belief, that's a major problem.
*  That's a sign of mental illness.
*  It's also a sign of like a spoiled child.
*  It's almost like we skipped the line, right?
*  We didn't really do, we didn't pay our dues to become people.
*  We got turned into people.
*  You know, like, because if we, there's, anthropologists are looking at chimpanzees now and they're
*  looking at them saying they're entering into the Stone Age.
*  Yeah.
*  Like they're using tools now.
*  Now if you watch that same chimpanzee and you went a few million years in the future,
*  who knows what it looks like?
*  Probably looks like an upward looking human that has much more intricate tools.
*  Who knows if it's created stone weapons, structures, houses, they may develop a language.
*  True.
*  You could watch chimpanzees over the course of evolution, but that's too slow.
*  Yeah.
*  And so if you were another highly intelligent being from another planet, you're like, they're
*  going to get there.
*  Give them a little push.
*  Give them a little something.
*  Give them a little something.
*  And the evidence of that is in tablets called the Myth of Adapa, which means first man.
*  The Myth of Adapa, an ancient Sumerian text.
*  It's a tablet.
*  And in this tablet, you can buy the book Myth of Adapa on Amazon.
*  You can read it for yourself, completely translated.
*  And translated by scholars, by the way.
*  And it's talking about the fact that according to the Anunnaki, human beings were created
*  in a way that genetically, we were supposed to become more superior than them.
*  They didn't know this was going to happen.
*  And Lil was angry at his brother Enki because Enki put a little extra in the sauce.
*  Yeah, a little extra.
*  And he said that the mysteries to unlock the secrets of the universe is hidden within our
*  bodies, and that we ourselves can rise to be even higher than them.
*  This is a major thing to be putting into text like this.
*  Now who sits around and writes this?
*  That sounds insane.
*  Yeah.
*  How do they specifically describe that?
*  They describe it just like that.
*  It says that human beings, or man, Adapa, Adapa was created to be even higher than us.
*  And that all the secrets of the universe, the mysteries, are within our body.
*  And I believe that because when I started studying DNA, that took me into a whole DNA
*  study, I discovered this scientist called George Church.
*  He created this e-book that he was able to take from a digital format, and he was able
*  to download it onto one drop, one gram of DNA, a digital book.
*  He converted it from A, Cs, Ts, and Gs into, from zeros and ones, I'm sorry, he converted
*  it from zeros and ones into A, Cs, Ts, and Gs, read, write, put it on the DNA.
*  Then he said, wow, this is incredible.
*  DNA can store information in a volume.
*  Then he said, okay, this is what we're going to do.
*  Let's replicate this book.
*  So he replicated the book 80 billion times on one gram of DNA.
*  This is not just a regular e-book.
*  This book had graphics and images and everything else in it.
*  So then he said, let's see if we can get it back.
*  So he converted, he created a read, write, again.
*  He converted it from A, Cs, Ts, and Gs back to zeros and ones and uploaded it back to
*  the server.
*  So now he knows that DNA can upload and download information.
*  Crazy.
*  Whoa.
*  So now they said, okay, well, how much data can be stored on one drop?
*  Over 433 petabytes of data.
*  A petabyte is a thousand terabytes.
*  What an unfortunate name.
*  I know, right?
*  I know, that's a crazy name.
*  I was like, why'd y'all name it this?
*  That's a bite.
*  But anyway.
*  But anyway.
*  That's so insane.
*  So they said, now they discovered recently on holmium atoms, scientists have now written
*  information data onto an individual holmium atom.
*  And they discovered that we can store information.
*  They can read, write directly onto the surface of an actual atom.
*  Oh my God.
*  Now, think about that for a second.
*  Oh my God.
*  So they're saying that a human body can store 13.5 billion years or roughly of data, which
*  is roughly around the time they believe the universe probably exists.
*  So that myth of adapa text could be accurate.
*  The secrets of the universe is probably encoded into our body because we're just recycled
*  atoms.
*  Right.
*  And then as we evolve technologically and biologically, we develop a higher and higher
*  ability to access that information.
*  Exactly.
*  That's exactly what it is.
*  The longer we go, the more we're able to tap in to this information, tap into who we truly
*  are.
*  We'll begin to walk in our power, look inside, go to inner space, not outer space.
*  We'll begin to tap into this.
*  And they discovered now that junk DNA is no longer junk.
*  They're taking the term junk off of it, that it really has function.
*  It always had function.
*  It was never junk.
*  That's just a word to keep us programmed to thinking that we're junk.
*  Well, I think it was a way for them to explain something that they couldn't explain.
*  Right.
*  But when you use the word junk, if you understand affirmations, it's a weird word to use for
*  you.
*  I would never call myself junk.
*  So that's a weird way to do it.
*  But now they're finding out that that's, and again, in the myth of Adapa, it's saying that
*  we're going to tap into this.
*  So I believe that all of our innate abilities that we used to have are going to start to
*  come back over time, like accessing Earth's magnetic field with the magnetite crystals
*  in our brains.
*  We all have billions of magnetite crystals in our brains.
*  And they put a guy into a laboratory, and they put a giant bar of magnet and moved it
*  around the room.
*  And they put an EEG cap on him and a scanner.
*  And they saw that they were orienting themselves to the magnetic field.
*  So we still have the ability to navigate magnetic fields.
*  We just don't even know.
*  We're unaware of it.
*  Well, we know it exists in animals.
*  Yeah.
*  So we have it in our body as well.
*  So all these things are going to begin to come back.
*  There's so little true understanding of how birds migrate, like how they all know when
*  to do it, what is calling them, what a very specific direction.
*  Are they using landmarks on the ground?
*  Or are they just using some sort of a magnetic field?
*  Are they just tuned in to where the North Pole is?
*  What are they doing?
*  How are they doing it?
*  It's incredible.
*  What is the organ that's allowing them to do it?
*  Is that something that humans have?
*  It went away just like I can't remember anybody's phone number anymore.
*  Right.
*  I have so many phone numbers in my head.
*  We had to have them because we're 70s babies.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm a 60s baby.
*  Yeah, I'm 70s.
*  71.
*  Yeah, but what happened was if you look at the tablets again, this is why I love these
*  tablets, man.
*  They talk about the fact that they had created this being, not created from scratch, but
*  genetically modified.
*  They add their essence to it, is what they say, added our essence.
*  So by adding the essence, you can see where all of a sudden maybe our ancestors were in
*  tune with the magnetic field and were able to communicate psychopathically, maybe even
*  had telekinesis and these other innate abilities, weren't technologically advanced, but maybe
*  more spiritually advanced.
*  And they tinkered with us and took away our memory, took away our ability to tap into
*  that so we can focus solely on them.
*  I guess if you were going to ... Have you ever seen the movie Prometheus?
*  Oh, yeah.
*  When the alien dies and its DNA goes into the water.
*  If you were going to play a real long game and seed life in the universe, and then you
*  I mean, especially with us, if you were going to create something that's very sophisticated
*  and encode inside of it enough information that they could figure out everything.
*  Just it's going to take time.
*  It's like you have to earn this information, but it's in there.
*  It's such a compelling theory.
*  The problem is I get so wrapped up in these that I hope they're true.
*  And when I hope they're true, it's time to stop thinking critically because I'm like,
*  that's the most fun.
*  It's the most fun to think that we were created by aliens.
*  The most fun to think there's a base on the north side of the moon.
*  But the undeniable stuff that to me is equally compelling, I think, even than the aliens,
*  is like how did they make the pyramids?
*  Who did that?
*  Who did that?
*  What was that culture like?
*  If I could go one place, I would go to Egypt, Giza, when it's thriving.
*  When it's thriving, whatever ... I don't even know what the number is.
*  I don't know if it's a John Anthony West number or if it's a more conventional number of 4,000.
*  Whatever it is.
*  Just get me there.
*  Let me see what that was.
*  What were you guys doing?
*  How the fuck did you make that thing?
*  How did you get those stones from 500 miles away?
*  How did you cut them so perfectly?
*  How did you get them all the way up in the ceiling of this giant king's chamber?
*  What was that damn thing?
*  Why did it have a gold cap on the top?
*  What did you guys do?
*  How did you make the gold cap?
*  What did you guys do?
*  It's wild.
*  John Anthony West there.
*  I'm closer to his timeframes.
*  Rest in peace, John Anthony West.
*  He was amazing.
*  Amazing man.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  Magical Egypt, folks.
*  I think there's two versions of the video series that you can get online.
*  Go find it.
*  It's incredible.
*  The first one I watched 10 times.
*  Forget about speculation.
*  Forget about timelines.
*  It's the undeniable majesty of the construction of those structures and the statues and what
*  they built.
*  It's like, my God, nothing else.
*  Nothing else in the world.
*  No one's even in a distant second place.
*  No, not even close.
*  It's wild.
*  Egypt can just stand above all of it.
*  And it was so long ago.
*  Yeah, it's super ancient.
*  What I like about John Anthony West, his theory aligns with the Emerald Tablets' date range
*  because when he talks about the Great Sphinx being built two processional periods back,
*  it takes it back to around 36, 38,000 years ago, around the same time that Thoth claims
*  to have written the Emerald Tablets.
*  And in these tablets, he talks about building the Great Pyramid.
*  He said, build it, I, the Great Pyramid, patterned after Earth's force so that it too might remain
*  through the ages.
*  So he claims to be the master architect of the structure of the Great Pyramid.
*  And what he did was he incorporated into it advanced science.
*  It's not just a power generator.
*  It's also, in my opinion, it also could be a multifunctional stone computer.
*  And this thing calculates the orbits of the planets in the inner solar system, which is crazy.
*  How does it do that?
*  Well, if I have some, can I open up this, just read some notes?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  I got some incredible notes that I did, some math that I did years ago.
*  I'm amazed at how much you don't need notes.
*  There's a few people that come on this podcast that blow me away without notes.
*  Terrence is one of them.
*  Yeah, he's one of them.
*  Rhonda Patrick, she's another one of them.
*  I just want to get the numbers exact.
*  So one thing, the equatorial circumference of the Earth can be calculated by the Great
*  Pyramid because the Great Pyramid itself is one by 43,200 scaled down.
*  So if you take the Great Pyramid and scale it up 43,200 times, it fits directly inside
*  the sphere of the Earth and it touches the equator.
*  So meaning the dimensions of how the angles of it would fit inside of a sphere.
*  Inside of a sphere.
*  It's a representation of the Earth in a pyramidal format.
*  That's crazy.
*  And if you multiply that by the base perimeter, you get 24,734.94 miles, which is roughly
*  within 170 miles of the circumference of the planet Earth itself, which is wild.
*  You can also calculate the speed of the Earth around the sun.
*  So the Great Pyramid, basically you take a pyramid inch times 10 to the eighth power.
*  It equals the speed of Earth around the sun.
*  That's wild.
*  The problem with these kind of calculations is Flint Dibble made note of this, that you
*  could take that and you could do that with a lot of different things.
*  Like what was the one he used for 420?
*  Yeah, he had 420 and 69 in it.
*  He had a bunch of different funny ones.
*  420, a weed day?
*  Yeah, a weed day.
*  He was explaining how you take these arbitrary procession of the equinox numbers and you
*  could multiply them times whatever you want.
*  You could get a bunch of different results based on what you wanted the result to be,
*  not based on the actual calculations.
*  Some of them are hard to do.
*  Check this out.
*  Forget about multiplying things.
*  What about taking the fact that the pyramid, the Great Pyramid is located at the center
*  of land mass on Earth.
*  Not the center of the Earth, the center of land mass.
*  Now the only way you can put the pyramid at the center of land mass is you have to have
*  a polar orbiting satellite.
*  If we were to do it today, a polar orbiting satellite that's orbiting this way and as
*  the Earth spins on its axis, you're taking swaths of data and you're calculating the
*  land mass and then you're going to say, okay, this is the center point for land mass and
*  you put it there.
*  So the center point for land mass being you take the surface of the Earth, what percentage
*  of it is covered with water, where the ground is, and then you find the center of where
*  the most ground is and that's where the pyramid is.
*  Exactly.
*  The only thing is taking all the average heights of all the peaks on Earth and then dividing
*  that to get the average height and making that the height of the Great Pyramid.
*  Now you can't just randomly calculate those numbers.
*  That's the average height of all the mountains and the peaks on Earth?
*  That's right.
*  Wow.
*  That's right and that's an absolute fact.
*  The grand gallery, the latitude of the grand gallery inside the Great Pyramid leading
*  into the King's Chamber, the latitude are the exact digits of the speed of light in
*  meters per second.
*  You can't just randomly calculate that one.
*  Well you can't just get those stones down.
*  I mean there's not one thing about it.
*  You can get real crazy with numbers and mathematics but there's not one thing about it that's
*  not completely insane.
*  Every single aspect of it is completely insane.
*  The fact that we still will try to pretend today that it's not impressive or that it
*  was impressive but that they did it with sand and they did it with like, how do you know?
*  You would need more mud.
*  The mud ramp theory, you would need more mud in mass than the pyramid itself.
*  So that's a farce.
*  The mud thing, I mean it's like, just show me one.
*  Show me one.
*  Here's the problem with that mud ramp theory.
*  I don't think people realize, I take people on tour to the pyramid every single year.
*  I take people on a huge tour.
*  Last year we had 140 people on tour in Egypt for 12 days or whatever it was.
*  The pyramid itself, each individual stone at the pyramid is a different shape and size.
*  There are no two stones that are perfectly the same.
*  Each stone fits in an interlocking format.
*  So you can't say go over here and cut these stones, we're going to bring them over here
*  and we're going to throw up this pyramid.
*  It doesn't work that way.
*  Each stone is made individually specifically for the location that it's exactly in.
*  Because they all have to be at an angle.
*  Because they're all going up towards this angle so everyone has to be cut perfect.
*  So they're interlocking stones and there's no way to say just cut this cookie cutter
*  out and we're going to bring them and hoist them in the spot.
*  And all of them are perfect.
*  And if you accidentally cut the wrong size or you're off by a few inches, you can't make
*  the pyramid.
*  You can spend a week or two getting a stone to a location that don't fit.
*  It doesn't make any sense.
*  They had foreknowledge.
*  People don't take the amount of resources, energy, effort that it took to build that
*  structure and then guessing that it will work out in the end.
*  You only build that if you have a complete blueprint and you've got proven facts.
*  You have proof of concept that it works and you've done this before.
*  Now what do you think about the other pyramids that are wonky?
*  Like the ones that aren't perfect.
*  Do you think that they were trying to duplicate the Great Pyramid?
*  Do you think they were trying to make their own?
*  The deeper you go into antiquity, the more perfect construction was.
*  The further you come forward in time, the more wonky and crazy things are on, begin
*  to fall apart.
*  So do you think they just forgot how to do it?
*  The knowledge was lost.
*  You can see the evidence of the knowledge.
*  By the time we got to Alexander the Great, have you ever been to Alexandria?
*  No.
*  I thought I was going to go see this incredible place.
*  It looks like a bunch of crap.
*  A bunch of piled up rocks, buildings leaning on each other.
*  Even the people living in apartments that are leaning, buildings leaning.
*  Everything there looks just, the stones are small.
*  I could pick up those stones with my own hands.
*  They tried to duplicate the majesty of ancient Egypt, but they didn't even come close.
*  It's just so bizarre that one civilization got so much further than everybody else, and
*  no one really knows exactly how they did it.
*  Right.
*  Light years ahead.
*  Now when you hear the carbon dating of the Great Pyramid, what is your take on that?
*  The radiocarbon dating is 2500 BC, right?
*  That's what they think.
*  I just don't believe it.
*  Why is that?
*  Well, first of all, the way that the structure is made, if you look at other structures made
*  in that same time frame, they don't have the same majesty.
*  They don't have the same level of construction.
*  They don't have the same capability of withstanding time.
*  Right.
*  So why are these falling apart, but this one isn't falling apart?
*  That's not necessarily, because look, you could have a shitty house today, and you could
*  live right next to Jeff Bezos' house.
*  That's very true.
*  I mean, it's just, there's going to be different cultures and different abilities and different
*  craftsmen.
*  Within the same region.
*  I'm talking about within the same area.
*  Yeah, but even in the same area, you're always going to have people that suck.
*  If you look at the subterranean shaft, I don't know if you've ever been there, it descends
*  beneath the Great Pyramid down into the ground on a specific angle, about 65 meters, and
*  there's another 30 meter drop straight beneath that.
*  And this is where Christopher Dunn has hypothesized that there was something that was creating
*  a frequency down there, something that like pounds in the earth, creates a very specific
*  frequency and a very specific vibration that goes through the entire stone structure, which
*  theoretically could work.
*  Oh yeah, absolutely.
*  And then this whole thing about using different chemicals in these shafts that leak through
*  the limestone, and that limestone is porous, and you would have a specific amount of thickness
*  with limestone, so you'd know exactly how much chemicals to put in the shafts.
*  And the shafts did exist, and they did have openings to them, and they were sealed.
*  You could open them up and dump things into them.
*  And then the passageway that goes into the King's Chamber, the so-called King's Chamber,
*  has opening shafts that go to the heavens.
*  Yes they do.
*  And I think I know why.
*  My hypothesis on those shafts is, well, you look at the way the pyramid is designed, the
*  Queen's Chamber is technology.
*  It seems to be like an electrolysis generating machine to extract hydrogen from water.
*  And Chris Dunn had pretty close to the same hypothesis I had with that.
*  Now why hydrogen?
*  It's the most abundant element in the universe.
*  And right now today, we try to communicate with ET on the hydrogen frequency.
*  Now those shafts, imagine on certain alignments, we know for a fact that that pyramid aligns
*  with specific planets or stars, Orion, Aldebaran, Draco, these alignments.
*  And then these shafts would send out this hydrogen frequency, potentially, on my hypothesis,
*  around those alignments.
*  Why?
*  For communication purposes.
*  Updates on this breakaway civilization.
*  Because I believe there was an ancient galactic war, which I talk about on my show, my docuseries,
*  and this ancient war created these space refugees, which then spread out around the Milky Way.
*  Earth just happens to be one of the breakaway civilizations.
*  It's not outside the realm of possibility when you think about what we're doing.
*  And if we get more advanced and do this better, that we could be still involved in very similar
*  types of activities throughout the galaxy.
*  It sounds terrible, but that just might be how things get done.
*  Unfortunately, war might just be a part of our essence, and it might be a part of the
*  whole cosmic balance of good and evil, this shifting of the winds and the tides coming
*  in and coming out.
*  It needs good and bad.
*  It needs all these things.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, in the biblical text, God says in Isaiah, I create the good and I create the evil.
*  Do what I say at the Lord.
*  Right.
*  The battle, the struggle.
*  He's saying He creates good and evil.
*  Yin and Yang is what they call it in ancient cultures.
*  Good and evil, dark and light, it's all the same thing.
*  It's the most fascinating subject to me.
*  It really is.
*  The most fascinating subject is when I hear stories from the Bible or the Bhagavad Gita
*  or the Talmud or any of these stories, like what was the origin?
*  What were they trying to say?
*  What were they documenting?
*  What were they sharing in an oral tradition of the history of people and of the earth
*  and of the heavens themselves?
*  What were they sharing?
*  What were those things?
*  How much of it was myth?
*  How much of it was someone misinterpreted the original story and watered it down?
*  But at the beginning of it, even at the beginning, there was light.
*  It's literally like the Big Bang.
*  It's literally describing what the current scientists believe happened.
*  And then you think about these stories of floods.
*  And then we know there's evidence.
*  The Rando Carlson work, all his work on the flooding that existed where you could see
*  these enormous channels cut through that is indicative of just insane amounts of water
*  over a short period of time.
*  And when he describes that, you're like, what?
*  Yeah, it's incredible.
*  And then the fact that we know that there's asteroid impacts, there's comet impacts, and
*  that the Ice Age ended abruptly, and that all these areas, this is where it was.
*  This is where it went down.
*  And this might be every fucking story that you've heard from the beginning of time.
*  Epic of Gilgamesh, Noah and the Ark, all these stories.
*  Yeah, all of them.
*  I mean, obviously, the Noah story is inside of the Epic of Gilgamesh.
*  Yes.
*  I believe that is a result of the Younger Dryas incident.
*  In the Epic of Atra-Hasis, there is this strike of this, either an asteroid or whatever it
*  is that's going to hit.
*  It doesn't specifically say.
*  But they had the ability to stop it.
*  And there's this other disk that has cuneiform writing on it, which is supposedly the direction
*  that this thing took course through space to hit Earth.
*  And so it was kind of known that this was going to happen.
*  And everywhere you look on the Earth around that same time period that this is estimated
*  to happen, megalithic construction stopped.
*  What happened that everyone stopped at the same time, unfinished in the quarry, unfinished
*  in the quarry, over here, unfinished in the quarry, all of a sudden around the entire
*  planet, everything is unfinished.
*  Something happened globally that made people stop working on these structures and go to
*  maybe Deron-Kuyu underground base or in the Americas.
*  They say that the Ant people, the Hopi say the Ant people took them under.
*  If you couldn't go under and save yourself, you had a ship.
*  We know that Zeo-Zudra in the Epic of Gilgamesh was told how to build the ship.
*  But it wasn't a boat like what we know was said in the Bible.
*  It was actually a disk he was told to build.
*  We found the tablet for that.
*  So we have the tablet in the British Museum.
*  It was an actual disk that looked like pie sections on the inside.
*  He was told to collect his local flora and fauna and his local livestock, not two of
*  every kind in the world.
*  He didn't get two ticks and two fleas and two.
*  It didn't happen.
*  He had local livestock, but he built a disk, not a ship, which is pretty interesting.
*  But yeah, these stories are everywhere.
*  It's pretty crazy.
*  It is crazy.
*  And it's just so strange when you see resistance to the idea while there's still real evidence
*  of this impact.
*  Once there was real evidence of the impact, once the Younger Trius Impact Theory started
*  being discussed by legitimate scientists and they recognized when they're doing these core
*  samples that they find nuclear glass and they find all of these things like iridium that
*  are very common in space, very rare on Earth, all this very thin layer, it's real clear
*  there's a time where all this shit goes down.
*  Yeah, it happened.
*  And there's also mass die-offs in places.
*  My friend John Reeves, have you ever seen the Alaska Boneyard on Instagram?
*  No, I haven't seen that one.
*  Wow.
*  Jamie, pull that up.
*  So he has this piece of land and he's a gold miner in Alaska.
*  He's a fucking great character.
*  And he has this amazing piece of land that they've pulled out thousands of bones and
*  tusks and wooly mammoths and animals that aren't even...
*  The Boneyard Alaska is his Instagram.
*  Things that weren't even supposed to exist in that area.
*  They have absolute proof of these things existing.
*  Different cats and short-faced bears and all kinds of shit.
*  So they're pulling things out every day.
*  He just texted me the other day.
*  He asked me to come out and blow out a Macedon bone.
*  I can't make it, bro.
*  I'm busy, but I love this dude.
*  And what he's doing up there is all his.
*  This is his property.
*  So he's got it all documented.
*  He's got warehouses.
*  He's spent millions of dollars doing all this stuff.
*  And his one area is only a few acres, man.
*  It's only a few acres.
*  So imagine what's really up there.
*  Imagine what's really up there.
*  And what he thinks is that there was a mass die-off that probably happened instantaneously
*  and all these things got swept in the water and washed down into this one particular area
*  where they collected and that's where he's finding them.
*  Gotcha.
*  That makes sense.
*  So he's got two very specific areas that aren't that big.
*  Just a few acres each.
*  I think the biggest one is like six acres.
*  It's crazy.
*  And so they're using these high pressure hoses and they shoot into the permafrost and they
*  slug because it's cold as fuck up there.
*  So everything is just frozen into the ground.
*  So they blast into the permafrost and start to loosen things up and show some of the images
*  of the warehouses that he has.
*  I mean insane amounts of tusks and bones.
*  And there's even more than this.
*  What is the museum in New York that has his bones?
*  Natural History Museum from the previous owners of this property.
*  They took a bunch of these bones and they wind up dumping some of them in the East River
*  because they had too many of them.
*  So then they've sent out people.
*  What is his name?
*  Dirty Water Don?
*  Don.
*  Dirty Water Don.
*  Dirty Water Don who's this fucking scuba diver guy who goes into the East River who
*  found woolly mammoth bones.
*  And what the other one?
*  Bison bones.
*  All these different bones at the bottom of the fucking East River.
*  Exactly where he said they would be dumped off.
*  So they dumped them because they had so much of them and then they have a bunch of them
*  that are still there.
*  So now they have Alaskan politicians who are pressuring the museum to release these things
*  back to these people so they can get them in the hands of people that could fucking
*  study them.
*  Because they just have them locked up and they're just trying to say that they're theirs.
*  First they tried to deny they have them.
*  Then he provided paperwork and there's proof and then they denied there was ever any dumped
*  into the East River.
*  But now they pulled them out of the East River.
*  Now they know.
*  It's real.
*  So look at this.
*  That's incredible.
*  This is insane.
*  That's an incredible graveyard.
*  This is insane.
*  Wow.
*  Boning.
*  When you help, it's a bone yard so if you go there you become a boner.
*  So he wants to make me an official boner.
*  So all these bones.
*  This is just a small sampling of what this guy has.
*  We have one out there.
*  We have a bison head that he gave me.
*  I saw it out there.
*  Yeah, that's what that is.
*  That came from here?
*  Yeah, that's probably 15,000 years old or something.
*  Who knows?
*  I mean, that's crazy.
*  This thing is insane.
*  Look at all this stuff he's got.
*  And this is just one small area that they're chipping away at.
*  A few acres.
*  And there's charred surface.
*  There's a layer that they go through that's all completely charred.
*  And he's documented this too.
*  What the fuck happened here?
*  Look at this layer.
*  This layer is insane.
*  This whole place was up in flames.
*  See the char?
*  He's got it in his hand.
*  There it goes.
*  There's thick layers of that.
*  Could you scroll up to his caption?
*  What does it say?
*  Came in hot from out of this world, I'm thinking.
*  What you're looking at is what we found on the bedrock when we were digging the drain.
*  The bedrock is burned.
*  The gravel is burned and nobody knows why yet.
*  That's okay.
*  We'll figure it out someday.
*  So there's a whole layer of this.
*  It's clearly something was on fucking fire.
*  Definitely.
*  Well, we found charred stones just like that at the base, ejected out from the base of
*  the bent pyramid of Dozier.
*  Really?
*  If you look at this, we've been documenting this.
*  I'm putting it in my TV show, the Anunnaki series.
*  There's areas of the bent pyramid that look like they've been blown out.
*  Something hit it and blew out the stones and charred them black, just like that.
*  And there's a debris field out there and nobody is studying this stuff.
*  So we started studying these charred stones and these charred rocks.
*  And up above the area where you kind of walk in to go down into the bent pyramid, there's
*  more, look like another impact point where there's more stones blown away.
*  And as you walk out away from the face, you discover that's where they lay and you put
*  your hand in the sand and pull up these charred burnt stones, which is just wild.
*  So can we see some of that?
*  See what that looks like?
*  Look at the bent pyramid.
*  The bent pyramid.
*  If anybody goes to those corners, they'll be able to show up.
*  Is this a common theory?
*  This theory of it being hit by something?
*  Nobody's talked about it yet.
*  You know, that's why I'm trying to, we're trying to analyze and see what could have
*  happened.
*  A piece hit there, but like the bigger impact was somewhere else and it just wiped everybody
*  out.
*  And then it breaks into chunks.
*  And then a piece hits over your, yeah, see that corner there?
*  You see that corner?
*  Now that corner, I wish we could get a better color picture, but there's a debris field
*  there.
*  All those stones are just, it looks like an impact and there's out away from it, there's
*  charred burnt rocks in the sand.
*  You pick up a regular piece of rock, you can see what that is, a geode.
*  You put it up, these, it looks like charred burnt stone that came from the pyramid itself.
*  I like to see the image of the charred, because to me, when I'm looking at that, it just looks
*  like people were stealing rocks.
*  Yeah, but you know, that's exactly what it looks like, but that's not stealing rocks
*  there.
*  And the guide, the homegrown archeologist that was with us, Mohammed Ibrahim, has the
*  same exact belief, because we are able to see the broken, those areas there, the mass
*  of what's missing, the majority of it's in the sand, which is why I would send you the
*  photo.
*  Oh, okay.
*  So it wasn't stolen, it was knocked off.
*  Yeah, it's there.
*  It's still there.
*  Okay.
*  So I'll send you the photo that we have.
*  Jamie, could you please click on the one to the left of your cursor?
*  Yeah, that one.
*  Thank you.
*  Can you make that one bigger?
*  I see.
*  Yeah.
*  So all that got blown apart.
*  It's blown apart, and the mass is still there.
*  A lot of it turned into dust and powder, but the black pieces are further toward, would
*  be further toward me.
*  Can you tell us where we could find images of those, the charred?
*  I have some.
*  Can you show them to Jamie, or send them to Jamie?
*  Yeah, I'll send them to you right away.
*  Absolutely.
*  You can't airdrop it, because you're using foreign technology, not even.
*  Yeah, we'll just download them and email them to you.
*  We want to be able to do it now.
*  They're on our Google Photo Drive right now.
*  Could you just send it to him, if we got you an email?
*  We'll do it right now?
*  Absolutely.
*  Okay, Jamie, will you give him an email?
*  We'll pause here for a second, folks.
*  We'll get these images.
*  See if we can find some images now.
*  Okay, so we left off with the burnt pyramid areas that look like they've been hit.
*  So we got the photographs from your wife.
*  So let's take a look at them here.
*  So this is a video.
*  I had the videos, because they were going to give me screenshots from the videos.
*  So I figured we'd just look at the videos instead.
*  There's one that's kind of more zoomed in.
*  Yeah, it's hard to get the idea of the coloration, the discoloration there from low resolution
*  phone video.
*  Do we have any other videos?
*  Or is it just videos, Jamie?
*  Or do we have photos?
*  Oh, okay, this area.
*  You can see those areas there.
*  Those black areas on the stone.
*  If you rub them, they get very black underneath.
*  There's also other pieces that are smaller, laying further out.
*  So there's charred areas that have been covered with dust and sand over time.
*  Right, exactly.
*  But if you brush it off, you see a char.
*  You see those dark areas there on those stones?
*  Yes.
*  That's not the natural color of the stone.
*  Pause that, Jamie.
*  If you go back up.
*  That's not the natural color at all.
*  Those colors there, and the geologist and the homegrown guide that we used and the archaeologist
*  also said that's not the normal coloration.
*  They don't know what energetically happened here.
*  Okay, so now I see it.
*  Stop right there.
*  I see it in that stone right there as well.
*  So charred and then over the thousands of years covered with dust and sand.
*  But if you dust off the dust and sand, you see this charred surface.
*  Right.
*  Oh.
*  Yeah, which is crazy.
*  Well, that does kind of make sense if a little chunk hit that and a bunch hit some other
*  spots and that was just...
*  And it also makes sense if you think about how an advanced civilization like that can
*  just disappear.
*  What would have to be the moment?
*  It just doesn't make any sense.
*  I know there's the burning of the Library of Alexandria where they lost a lot of the
*  information, but...
*  I think there might have been a book heist.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, I think the burning of the Library of Alexandria was a heist.
*  The burning did happen, don't get me wrong, but that was just a distraction to steal the
*  knowledge and that the majority of that knowledge ended up in the Vatican Archives.
*  You're going to say the Vatican.
*  That's what I believe.
*  The Vatican is one of my favorites.
*  That's one of my favorites.
*  I went there with my family a few years back and I was blown away and I highly recommend
*  it to anybody that gets to go to Rome.
*  If you go to Rome, please go to the Vatican.
*  It's stunning.
*  It's stunning, all the artwork they have.
*  And they also have an Egyptian obelisk.
*  Yes, right in the center.
*  Which is crazy.
*  And you know that obelisk, that courtyard is the same courtyard as Teotihuacan.
*  If you look at Teotihuacan.
*  You mean the dimensions?
*  Not the dimensions, but just the actual shape of that courtyard.
*  It matches the courtyard of Teotihuacan.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, it's an incredible coincidence that they built it based on the Teotihuacan where
*  the Avenue of the Dead has those platforms and then you have the Pyramid of the Sun on
*  the right and the Pyramid of the Moon straight ahead.
*  That area resembles the courtyard of the Vatican.
*  Wow.
*  The Vatican is so insane.
*  I didn't know.
*  I knew that it had a lot of art.
*  I didn't know.
*  It's outrageous.
*  When you go to St. Peter's Basilica, you're just like, what?
*  What did you do?
*  How much time did this take?
*  This is so intricate and so incredible.
*  It's one of the most spectacular things I think I've ever seen in my life in terms of
*  what human beings can do with ingenuity and time and artisans and craftsmen and people
*  that artisans that just create the most insane ceiling you've ever seen in your life.
*  So intricate.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, and perfect for a house of worship because you walk in there and you believe
*  in God like immediately.
*  Right.
*  Like, this is obviously a shrine to God.
*  Exactly.
*  And the fact that they did it for so long.
*  It took hundreds of years to make that place.
*  I know.
*  It's incredible.
*  It's so amazing.
*  I'll let you know that there's time periods where people would operate within a golden
*  age in certain regions of the planet and have time to do that type of extensive art
*  and craft and beauty.
*  Create that kind of beauty.
*  Right.
*  And the only way you do that is when you've got your resources covered and your army strong.
*  That's it.
*  And that was Rome.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, that's what they were back then.
*  They tried to take over the world.
*  Yeah.
*  And the thing about what they have is they don't have to kind of tell you.
*  Yeah.
*  Like, so if they do, like there's archives that they have in Rome that haven't been searched.
*  They're not just opening them up to everyone.
*  Right.
*  So that everyone could look in and see what they have.
*  So there's always been speculation that they have some wild shit written down in there.
*  Yeah, some wild stuff.
*  I mean, they're investigating aliens.
*  Right.
*  I mean, one of the Pope's most recent speeches.
*  Astronomers, you know, they were talking about years ago, though.
*  They were talking about years ago that they wanted to, the Pope wanted to baptize the
*  first alien.
*  Now, that's an incredible statement.
*  That would be like turning Michio Kaku into a Scientologist.
*  Right.
*  Right?
*  It's like, that would be hilarious.
*  I know.
*  That would be hilarious.
*  And then they built this telescope called Lucifer to look for alien life.
*  That's not a good name.
*  Yeah.
*  You would think of anybody who would know better.
*  Right.
*  The light bearers, you know, what Lucifer means supposedly, but yeah, they built a telescope
*  named Lucifer.
*  Right.
*  But the swastika used to be a sign of peace.
*  Right.
*  You can't really use it anymore.
*  No, you can't use it anymore.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  It's like things could be stolen forever.
*  No one's rocking that Hitler mustache.
*  No.
*  That's a wrap.
*  It's over.
*  Hitler mustache, it's over.
*  No one's getting called Adolf.
*  That's over.
*  That's over.
*  It's a wrap.
*  So I guess they didn't want to, you know, cut that name loose, but they utilized that
*  name for that, the naming of that.
*  And it's actually in America.
*  I believe it's in Arizona.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  No kidding.
*  Wow.
*  Lucifer telescope.
*  How kooky.
*  I know.
*  All of the telescopes are fascinating, but what's really the most interesting to me is
*  And about how they're looking at these galaxies that seem too big, that they form too quickly,
*  and that they're starting to re-examine the timeline of the Big Bang, and that they're
*  reconsidering whether or not they were correct with this 13.9 or 7?
*  13.5 to 13.8 billion year.
*  Yeah.
*  And they think these galaxies should not exist in this.
*  I was just watching a documentary on it yesterday, or a couple days ago, where they were getting
*  into why this doesn't make sense and the size of these galaxies.
*  They were too formed.
*  And I believe it was 500 million years after the Big Bang.
*  So they're like, this doesn't make sense.
*  According to us now, with our minds.
*  We're still trying to figure out what dark matter is.
*  Right.
*  Well, Terrence Howard, the concept of stars creating planets and the planets eventually
*  getting to a goal of the lock zone, then eventually getting out, and that this is how life propagates
*  through the universe.
*  It makes so much sense.
*  And with our limited understanding of the cosmos and our adherence to very specific
*  ideas of how it all was created and the resistance to things like even the James Webb telescope
*  discoveries, you realize that science, like everything else, when it's practiced by humans,
*  humans fuck everything up.
*  They use their ego, they use arrogance.
*  They don't want to be corrected.
*  They want their initial ideas to be correct.
*  And then there's a lot of great scientists that are just looking at it and going, this
*  is amazing.
*  Let's keep doing this and let's get an even better telescope out there that maybe could
*  see even further.
*  Maybe we'll have to re-examine what we think about the birth of the universe.
*  Exactly.
*  It just keeps getting better.
*  Technology keeps getting better.
*  I remember Hubble, when it came back with the two trillion sky book, two trillion galaxies
*  is what it estimated exists within our known universe.
*  And then the web comes out and it's just showing this stuff in much more clarity.
*  And it's probably going to make discoveries that are even going to surpass, obviously,
*  Hubble in terms of the quantity of galaxies.
*  And it just keeps getting better and better.
*  We're getting a bigger and better understanding of our place in the universe as a whole.
*  And some people are scared of that.
*  This is why they don't want it to get out.
*  They don't want the information to be put forth that's going to change the paradigm.
*  But the paradigm is not to be afraid.
*  The paradigm shift is about to be embrace.
*  Embrace this new huge part of us that's connected directly to us.
*  We're part of it and it's part of us intrinsically, energetically.
*  And I think people are just afraid of what they think is the unknown because it makes
*  them feel small.
*  When I hear all this stuff going on out there, it makes me feel bigger because I know that
*  I am part of it.
*  Yeah.
*  We are part of it.
*  We like to think as individuals.
*  Right.
*  You know, oh my God, I'm not important.
*  The universe is infinite.
*  Exactly.
*  The universe is not just infinite.
*  It's so infinite that the infinite nature of the universe might be a part of an atom.
*  Right.
*  In another infinite universe.
*  That's the fractal holographic universe.
*  Yeah.
*  When you go fractals on things and you start thinking about it in that terms, you go, what?
*  It's never ending.
*  It's just this constant thing that's in you in subatomic particles and deeper than that
*  and then further out than that.
*  It just never ends.
*  It goes both ways forever.
*  Yeah.
*  You just go, oh boy.
*  I know.
*  It's hard to take yourself too seriously.
*  Listen, it's hard because I think individuality is an illusion.
*  We appear to be separate and individuals, but energetically we're really all the same
*  entity, the same consciousness, experiencing the self differently, subjectively through
*  different bodies.
*  Yes.
*  Different life experiences.
*  Exactly.
*  Different genetics, different places in the world.
*  Correct.
*  Yeah, but we're all the same thing.
*  Yeah.
*  That's the hardest thing for people to get in their head.
*  Anyone that you run into is you living another life.
*  Right.
*  We're all the concept of me.
*  When you think about it, everyone has that same feeling of me.
*  Everyone has me inside of them.
*  There's just me with less information, more information, better brain, better this, better
*  that, shittier this, shittier that.
*  Yeah.
*  There's an infinite number of examples of it.
*  Then it probably exists everywhere in the cosmos.
*  It's probably what facilitates change and growth is that there is this imbalance.
*  There is this constant struggle amongst human beings.
*  That's probably what makes us constantly try to improve.
*  Exactly.
*  It's just very disheartening to think that we improved to the point where we can travel
*  to other planets and have a war.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  We don't want that to happen.
*  We don't want that to happen, but if it really did happen here, it just makes you think,
*  is that just what we do forever?
*  When we have this utopian perspective of being able to eliminate war on Earth someday, which
*  no one thinks is going to happen, not with this current version of human beings.
*  Then you think, well, if we surpassed Earth, if we passed our genes and our civilization
*  out into the universe, are we still going to be behaving the same way?
*  If we were, if I was an alien, I'd be like, don't let those dudes in.
*  If we get to a point where we're us now, but 500 years from now, we're the same genes,
*  same wacky ass, crazy genes.
*  But now we have time travel.
*  Now we have interplanetary travels like that.
*  Then we show up with nuclear bombs.
*  They give us all your titanium.
*  Right.
*  Fuck.
*  That's a problem.
*  That could be a problem.
*  I would be really trying hard to stop us if I was from another planet.
*  A lot of these suppression and oppression of technologies, potentially, this hypothesis
*  could be that there's a hand in the background holding us back a little bit.
*  It's quite possible.
*  But then there's a theory like the Diana Pasolka's books where they talk about these
*  disks that they have found in the recovery program that apparently does exist.
*  They call them donations.
*  They think that these things are kind of left here so that we can just go, oh, fiber optics.
*  What a great idea.
*  Velcro.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  There's a lot of these things that seem to like, transistors.
*  Microships, right.
*  Yeah.
*  A lot of these things seem to have come very quickly after Roswell, which is interesting.
*  That's a fact.
*  I think that a lot of these ARVs, alien reproduction vehicles, I believe that exactly is what's
*  really going on with a lot of these UAPs.
*  I think that a lot of them are ours.
*  I believe that there's UFOs out there, but a lot of these objects that we see in the
*  sky are probably made by us by re-engineering existing alien technology.
*  But it comes to the point, are we going to be able to advance as a civilization to get
*  beyond war?
*  I just saw they released an AI fighter jet that went into a dogfight.
*  Yes.
*  Just a few weeks ago.
*  Yeah, Mike Baker was on here showing us that.
*  It beats the human piloted planes 100% of the time.
*  Yeah.
*  So that's a wrap.
*  That's Skynet.
*  Skynet is online.
*  And then on top of that, instead of just AI powered fighter jet, you could develop a fighter
*  jet that no longer has a person in it, so you have to worry about G-forces.
*  You could do wild shit.
*  Yes.
*  Yes, exactly.
*  And it's a fully AI controlled vehicle, especially as these technologies scale up.
*  I have a Tesla and my Tesla has auto drive and I can set it a destination, like a restaurant
*  I like to go to, press auto drive and navigation and it does everything.
*  Wow.
*  It hits the blinkers.
*  It stops at stop signs.
*  It stops at red lights.
*  It takes turns.
*  It changes lanes.
*  It moves around park vehicles.
*  Wow.
*  It's fucking wild, man.
*  And it's not done yet.
*  And this is the beginning.
*  Yeah, it does hit curbs though, I heard.
*  I heard it hits curbs.
*  I heard when you're taking turns for overpasses or underpasses, a few people have curbed up.
*  So keep your hands on the wheels, kids.
*  But it's not there yet, but it's a lot better than when I first got it.
*  I remember I was driving down Laurel Canyon and I was with my wife and I was playing around.
*  We were listening to Led Zeppelin and I'm moving my hand around the steering wheel and
*  I'm like, look at this, the car's driving itself, this is crazy.
*  But that was primitive back then.
*  I didn't totally trust it.
*  It was probably better than I thought it was, but every now and then it would get a little
*  wonky.
*  Now it's smooth.
*  Wow.
*  Now it's...
*  You use it at all, Jamie?
*  Nah, here and there.
*  I kind of almost forget sometimes where I was like, oh yeah, this car drives itself.
*  I do it for a goof sometimes.
*  Yeah, just randomly.
*  I've been doing it a lot lately though.
*  It's shockingly good.
*  Well, grandkids are going to, that's all they're going to know.
*  100%.
*  They won't have to drive at all.
*  Yeah.
*  People joke around about manual cars that it's a good theft deterrent device.
*  Have a manual transmission.
*  Nobody knows how to drive that fucking thing.
*  This is hard.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, it used to be the only way you could get a car.
*  That was it.
*  I learned it by accident because I was in an emergency situation and I had to drive
*  up my friend's car.
*  That was a manual.
*  I had to learn within the distance between where I was to where I had to go.
*  Oh wow.
*  Because one of my kids had got hurt doing something.
*  And the only car available was a manual.
*  That was it.
*  Yeah.
*  It's not hard.
*  I mean, you could learn it quick, but most people don't know how to do it.
*  No.
*  That's going away.
*  They're now saying that the next version of Porsche is going to be the last version that
*  they have with a manual transmission.
*  Which is crazy because Porsche, that was the one thing that people held onto was that you
*  could get that stick shift.
*  People loved that engagement of the car.
*  But that's going to be the thing of the past.
*  Everything's going to be automated because your freedom to drive that, people are going
*  to, the communist nature of especially California, they'll do it first probably.
*  is not worth the potential of you taking someone's life in an accident.
*  Right.
*  And this makes sense.
*  That's part of the problem.
*  It does make sense.
*  You can see the argument.
*  Oh yeah.
*  It makes sense.
*  And that's where everything is going to go.
*  I mean, there's going to be so many, I mean, drivers are going to disappear.
*  Like chauffeurs and so forth.
*  It's all going to go away.
*  There's a lot of that in here.
*  They cause traffic jams.
*  These wacky driverless cars, they have them here.
*  And they're not quite there yet, but they're good enough to take people around, which is
*  crazy, you know, take me to Red Ash, drives you to the restaurant, drives you out, bye,
*  thank you.
*  All on an app.
*  Everything's done.
*  It's simple.
*  It's kind of nuts.
*  And it's just the beginning.
*  I mean, we didn't have any of this 10 years ago.
*  Ten years in most time periods is not that big of a deal.
*  Technology.
*  No.
*  Technologically, rather.
*  Right now it's, well, Chad's GPT-5, when they release that, it's going to be as big
*  a leap, if not bigger, than three to four.
*  And three to four was nuts.
*  Yeah.
*  So, over 100 years we went from a horse buggy in carriage all the way to putting remote control
*  cars on Mars.
*  So, we're moving at an extremely fast pace right now.
*  And they just released this Chad GPT and other robotics on humanity, which is great.
*  It's going to do a lot of good for us.
*  But at the same time, if you're going to replace somebody's job, you have to then take away
*  their financial responsibilities.
*  You can't expect them to still have the financial responsibilities and take away the job.
*  So that's going to be the conundrum.
*  I'm waiting to see how that's going to pan out.
*  How many of us are going to stand up and say, look, wait a minute now.
*  I'm a mother.
*  I'm a single mother of three and I can't waitress anymore.
*  So what's going to happen?
*  Or even attorneys are at risk.
*  Nurses are at risk now.
*  So what are you going to do?
*  There's enough money in this country, just in this country alone, to if you did replace
*  jobs, you make it so that whatever controls that industry has to give a certain percentage
*  to ensure not just like a living wage, but a good wage.
*  Where people live well and they don't have to think about it.
*  But then you got to give people a purpose because you can't just have them laying around
*  getting free money and not having a life.
*  A lot of people, their purpose is their job.
*  That's what they look forward to.
*  They get engaged with something.
*  They have a community there.
*  They have tasks that they do.
*  They succeed.
*  They go out to dinner and celebrate.
*  That's a big part of life for people.
*  You can't just take that away.
*  So then how does that get replaced?
*  I think it's video games.
*  They're going to go into cyber world.
*  When you look into the ancient text, they had similar situations in these golden ages.
*  But people spent time working for things like service to others, traveling, arts and crafts,
*  exploring inner peace.
*  So it's about teaching people new ways to define and develop their passions and how
*  to explore those passions.
*  Well, that would be a big yoga explosion across the country.
*  That would be cool.
*  That would be great.
*  Yeah, people get into fitness, martial arts, and just be able to do, but you have to do
*  something.
*  Right.
*  If you become stagnant, you die.
*  Yeah.
*  And you still should have the ability to possibly work if you want to.
*  Yeah.
*  It shouldn't be mutually exclusive.
*  You don't get this money unless...
*  If everybody got like 200 grand a year, just imagine the entire country just gets a free
*  200 grand a year.
*  You're never going to have to worry about food.
*  You're never going to have to worry about a place to live.
*  You're good.
*  Yeah.
*  You got $200,000 a year because everything's automated.
*  Everything's done by the government.
*  Then you're going to have to find something.
*  Right.
*  You're going to have to find a purpose.
*  There's got to be a thing that you...
*  Whether it's art or writing or whatever it is, you better find something or you're going
*  to go crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  And then there's going to be a percentage of our population that's active.
*  They're going to be working out and there's going to be a bunch of us that just fuck off
*  and drink beer and play Call of Duty.
*  Just sit down.
*  Yeah.
*  Just get hammered and fucking order pizza and never have to do anything.
*  Yeah.
*  Living in a nice place.
*  You don't have to worry about money ever.
*  You can always buy a good laptop and you get together with your buddies and you all put
*  together and play games.
*  But you better have something.
*  Go bowling.
*  You better have something.
*  You better have something you like to do.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  That's where it's going though.
*  But wouldn't that be better than work?
*  Because for most people, there's a great satisfaction in working and accomplishing a hard day's work
*  and you get your paycheck and you feel like you've accomplished something.
*  But wouldn't it be better if all of your needs were met?
*  And we put an emphasis in our culture on creating and doing things that interest you and whether
*  it's competition or whatever it is.
*  But this would be financed essentially by this ability that you just get free money
*  because robots control everything.
*  They have plenty of money.
*  No more jobs.
*  There's no more jobs.
*  They don't have to pay a salary to these robots.
*  Exactly.
*  Only repair costs and management costs obviously.
*  So yeah, that would be great.
*  And the $200,000 that everybody gets, they're getting it anyway because they were going
*  to buy stuff from them.
*  Exactly.
*  It would be a wild change and shift in how human beings interact.
*  And if there was a way for us to channel that in a positive manner, it could ultimately
*  be beneficial.
*  We could be looking back on these days where people are working at Wendy's and go, what
*  the fuck was that about?
*  Yeah.
*  Well, most people are working in jobs that they're not passionate about these jobs.
*  Right.
*  And it's evident in their work, their effort and their work ethics.
*  Well, it's also evident in their success and their happiness.
*  That's right.
*  And if you do what you like, you enjoy this, you pursue this, you talk about this, you're
*  very good at it, this is a great way to live.
*  And other people can find other similar things or different things that similarly excite
*  them.
*  Yeah.
*  And if we were under that new scenario of $200,000 a year or whatever it was, I would
*  still do this.
*  Of course.
*  So people will work.
*  It's like Star Trek.
*  They work for free on Star Trek.
*  It's just a TV series, but they don't have a paycheck.
*  Kurt didn't get paid?
*  No, they never got paid any money.
*  It was all for free.
*  It was all for free.
*  Communists, they were trying to put us into Communists.
*  It's all for free.
*  But they did it because they were passionate about it and they believed in it so much.
*  And so there's things that people can still do if they're passionate about those things.
*  And it's just work, but you don't ask for a paycheck.
*  Right.
*  If there was a base paycheck for the whole country, just a base paycheck, based on, I
*  wonder if 200 grand is even possible.
*  What is $200,000 times $333 million?
*  Check that out, Jamie.
*  Only 190 million are adults.
*  190 million adults.
*  Right.
*  That's right.
*  Let's be generous.
*  Let's make it 200 million adults.
*  So 200 million times 200,000 is what?
*  So it'd be 2 times 2 is 4.
*  Add all the zeros from the 200,000 onto the 4 million.
*  Right.
*  But what is that in the word?
*  Is it trillions?
*  200,000.
*  200,000 times 200 million.
*  200 million's got eight zeros?
*  Shit.
*  So six zeros is a billion.
*  Nine zeros is a million.
*  Nine zeros is a billion.
*  It's giving me 4E13, so it's 4 13 zeros.
*  13 zeros?
*  4 times 13 zeros?
*  That's a lot of money, folks.
*  You're going to have to drain these oligarchs.
*  Tax the rich!
*  What was the numbers?
*  200,000 times 200 million.
*  40 billion?
*  That doesn't sound right.
*  That is going to be...
*  It's either 40 billion or 400 billion.
*  It's $40 billion.
*  40 billion, that's it?
*  That's reasonable.
*  That's reasonable.
*  That's so reasonable.
*  That's so reasonable.
*  That's less than the military industrial complex budget for the year.
*  100%.
*  Imagine that, folks.
*  I just want you to think about that.
*  We could give 200 million people $200,000 a year.
*  That's a good amount of money.
*  $200,000 is nice.
*  You can live in a nice house, go on vacation, you can eat well.
*  $200,000.
*  Not bad at all.
*  Not bad at all.
*  And if you did that, you could also still work.
*  You could also still make money.
*  If we just elevated every adult in this country to that amount of money, and it will be, you're
*  talking communist.
*  No, I'm talking...
*  Everything's going to be automated, folks.
*  And there should be some sort of a tax on the result that this has on society, particularly
*  when, if everything is automated, the people who run the automation, they're going to be
*  making staggering amounts of money.
*  So if a tax of $40 billion a year to keep everybody happy, keep everybody from going
*  fucking crazy, that might be...
*  It sounds crazy, because it goes against human instincts, right?
*  Human nature is...
*  It goes against our programming.
*  What we've been programmed to believe is correct.
*  And is that because we were designed to mine for gold?
*  That's right.
*  We were designed to work hard, right?
*  We're designed to work hard, man.
*  Because it's kind of in our head that we have to work hard.
*  Listen, we're so programmed to believe what happened in ancient times, that we believe
*  the government is in control of us when we're in control of the government.
*  We allow them to tell us what to do, and we should be telling them what to do and what
*  we want.
*  But we sit back and allow them to put rules in place, laws on us, and even lock us up
*  and do things to us.
*  And there's nothing we can do about it, but people think there's nothing we can do.
*  There is something we can do.
*  We've given up our power.
*  We've relinquished our power to an outside source.
*  Because of divide and conquer, it allows it to work.
*  Once we realize that divide and conquer is just a distraction, that we should coordinate
*  together and organize, then we can take back control of this planet.
*  Yeah, and this idea of the government being in control of you is literally how it works
*  with every single country in the world.
*  It's just a natural course of human nature that the people in power want more power.
*  When you're selling skateboards, you want to sell more skateboards next year.
*  When you're in power, you don't want to relinquish some of your power and make it better on the
*  people.
*  No, you want to clamp down that power more.
*  We had to get on Facebook and stop these people from tweeting about things or posting about
*  things.
*  You know, we have to, this has become a problem.
*  Let's put pressure on this company to censor certain voices on YouTube.
*  Exactly.
*  And that's the shit that happens.
*  That's really what happens because they're not acting in the best interests of humanity.
*  They're acting in their best interests, which is what every industry does when it's just
*  trying to make money.
*  Exactly.
*  Well, the United States is a company.
*  It's a corporation.
*  Right.
*  And so they're acting like a corporation.
*  That's the reality of it.
*  I agree with you too about this UAP thing, UFO, UAP.
*  Many people have said this, but I'll repeat it, that there's something about them doing
*  it always near where military bases are, that's super suspicious.
*  Come on.
*  I mean, listen, to me, what's going to happen or what potentially could happen, another
*  Gulf of Tonkin incident.
*  The incident that created the Vietnamese war, they lied about an attack at the Gulf of Tonkin.
*  False flag.
*  To create the Vietnamese war.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  So all of a sudden you see one of these UAPs, they're going to call it one of these not
*  ours.
*  We don't know whose it is.
*  And then it attacks a Navy vessel.
*  And now they've got the right to say, we need $10 trillion a year, whatever the number is,
*  to create these weapons.
*  After Iran.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  Whatever.
*  And then it generates more money.
*  So could this be why the formation of the Space Force is here?
*  So they can find a way to channel money into something else where these private corporations
*  can create these black budget projects that we've approved because we're afraid we're
*  going to be attacked by aliens now.
*  And then they take that money and they develop these projects that never see the light of
*  day and they all chop up the money behind the scenes.
*  Yeah.
*  That's the reality of the world we live in, folks.
*  And if you're clinging on to this left versus right, these culture war arguments, you are
*  getting caught up in their bullshit game.
*  Most people want the same thing.
*  They want to be healthy.
*  They want their family to be healthy and happy.
*  They want to have a pursuit that they enjoy.
*  They want to enjoy their community, enjoy their loved ones.
*  That's what most people want.
*  People want the same thing.
*  Most of the shit that you're seeing has all been stirred up by foreign governments and
*  special interest groups and a bunch of shit.
*  And if you're online, they're spoon feeding it to you.
*  If you're online and you're engaging on social media, they're shoving that down your throat.
*  They're gaslighting you every day.
*  Gaslighting you every day.
*  And it's more and more obvious now than it's ever been before because people at least are
*  aware of it.
*  They know what's going on.
*  But it is, it's shocking how much of it is going on.
*  It's allowing us to fight with each other while all this shit is going on behind the
*  scenes and all these hundreds of billions of dollars.
*  We talked about 40 billion dollars a year.
*  What is the amount of money we spent so far in Ukraine?
*  What's the...
*  They continue to raise it, right?
*  They just approved a new batch of money that's headed over there.
*  It's insane amounts of money.
*  Numbers are incredible.
*  And we have infrastructure falling apart here.
*  People on the...
*  I just came from L.A. a few weeks ago.
*  People on the streets of L.A.
*  OK.
*  So Congress passed five bills appropriating 175 billion in response to Russia's February
*  22 evasion of Ukraine.
*  So this is May 9th of 2024, which is the most recent.
*  So 175 billion.
*  That could have solved all poverty in America.
*  Literally solved poverty.
*  Which is wild.
*  If poverty and crime are our number one problem in this country, which I would say they are,
*  that would solve our number one problem.
*  The crime is a side effect of the poverty.
*  Yes.
*  And I always said this.
*  If Hal Burton can get these no-bid contracts to clean up Iraq after we bomb it, and it's
*  for profit, so they make a lot of money doing that, how about a no-bid contract to clean
*  up terrible neighborhoods?
*  A no-bid contract to develop community programs, and they'll be funded through the state, you'll
*  make a ton of money, you can do this, and also you'll have a ripple effect.
*  You'll have less crime, you'll have more people that are out there in the workforce, you'll
*  have more people that are being productive, more people that are inventing things and
*  creating music and culture and art and all kinds of other things that people like to
*  do when they're not getting locked up in fucking jail.
*  And then you just have to figure out a way to get off the grip of the military, or the
*  rather prison industrial complex, which has a vested interest in keeping people locked
*  up because that's what they...
*  The idea that we let that happen.
*  We let it be profitable to put people in fucking jail, and then we let the prison guards actively
*  campaign to make sure that certain laws stay in place so that people keep getting locked
*  up for non-violent crimes.
*  Yeah, 40% of the people that are locked up in America are locked up on victimless crimes.
*  They only hurt themselves.
*  It's so nuts.
*  And the amount of money that's generated by private prisons, that should be zero.
*  It should be zero dollars.
*  There should be no incentive to put people in a cage.
*  You can't have capitalism in everything.
*  Capitalism has to be broken into pieces.
*  You can't have it in medicine, healthcare, prison systems.
*  No.
*  Imagine if that was the way with the fire department.
*  Imagine if you had to pay to get your house put out.
*  That's the one thing that we exist, that we rather accept, universally, that we pay for.
*  It's a socialist idea.
*  The fire department is paid for by the state, and we need fire department people.
*  We need everybody well-trained and all the equipment to be working perfectly.
*  We all agree to that.
*  Why?
*  Because it's a real dilemma.
*  It makes sense.
*  It's logic.
*  So's poverty.
*  So's crime.
*  And mental health.
*  And mental health.
*  Most people on the street are mentally ill.
*  And giving kids guidance.
*  Having community programs and having education programs and giving people an avenue where
*  where they are and see a path to success so they don't feel despair.
*  They have a possibility.
*  And show and have it be run by people who have already made it through.
*  Say, I can help you just like you could teach someone how to play piano or you could teach
*  someone how to do karate.
*  You could teach people how to live life.
*  That's right.
*  Yeah.
*  And it costs a lot less than what it's costing in Ukraine.
*  And how much would it benefit our economy?
*  How much would it benefit our culture, our society?
*  How much more would get done if there was less crime?
*  A lot more.
*  And then those people of all, instead of being criminals, now they're contributors.
*  There's enough for everybody.
*  And the civilization grows the way it should grow.
*  Yes.
*  The way it should grow.
*  In the right direction.
*  The problem is it's been captured.
*  It's been captured by elites that want to keep draining money.
*  And they keep draining money and using it for their own needs and their own means.
*  And it's terrifying.
*  That's why I call it polytricks.
*  Polytricks.
*  That's what it's called.
*  We made a pretty bad math error.
*  Okay, what do we got?
*  Oh, $40 trillion.
*  $40 trillion.
*  Thank you.
*  That's much more of an issue.
*  Ladies and gentlemen, I retrained, but we're fucked.
*  We're never going to have enough money to fix this problem.
*  I forgot what I said.
*  So what is our GDP?
*  What is our?
*  Yeah, but that's a problem too.
*  It creates inflation.
*  It creates inflation.
*  What's our GDP?
*  Boy, there's a big dent in the stream.
*  $40 trillion and $40 billion.
*  How many people are yelling at their computer?
*  You fucking idiots.
*  I work backwards.
*  One of the things we did says $875.
*  Like, wait, that is not enough to get everybody out of here.
*  That's hilarious.
*  GDP increased in 2020 to $27.36 trillion.
*  That's our GDP every year?
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, so we don't even have enough money because it would take double our GDP.
*  That's the $200K if you want to go to $200K.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, you have to give people, it's only 200 million people.
*  It's not even everybody.
*  Right.
*  That's $4,000.
*  So we're fucked.
*  Back to we're fucked.
*  You just cut it down to it.
*  Cut it in half, you could do it.
*  If people have you do it, you could cut it in half.
*  Yeah, but even then.
*  You could cut it down to about $80,000 and then let people work to earn their own money
*  and other things.
*  Yeah, 200 grand was a little lofty.
*  Okay, so if it was $40 trillion, you could get it down to $15 trillion.
*  That's still most of the money we make.
*  That's still a lot.
*  It's going to increase though significantly in the next 10 years because of the AI.
*  Right.
*  Yeah, all the chips and robots.
*  When a company can lay off like Amazon, lay off a thousand people and replace them with
*  a thousand robots.
*  Right.
*  So their profit margin goes up significantly within the first 8 to 10 years.
*  Yeah, what if anything is being done to provide a safety net?
*  Because you can't give people $200 a week.
*  Right.
*  You know, whatever it is, it's got to be a significant amount of money to actually get
*  by.
*  Whatever that number is, whatever we decide that number is.
*  The number could be less if things are covered.
*  Like if AI becomes so efficient at creating power.
*  We have it in our head that power must be paid for.
*  But if AI becomes so efficient and eliminates jobs, that we decide that we're going to
*  nationalize all of our power.
*  And then we'll look at power the same way we look at the fire department.
*  Right.
*  And we'll be set it up as a socialist power system.
*  Which is not the worst idea in the world if you consider that most power is being generated
*  by the use of natural resources which really belong to the earth.
*  And like that individuals are pulling these out and profiting from them wildly.
*  Especially when they're doing like offshore oil drills.
*  Like who owns that spot?
*  How are you able to just suck all that oil and make billions of dollars out of the ground
*  that we all live on?
*  Like it seems like that should be everybody's.
*  Right.
*  But then you lose the incentive for profit that allows you to go dig.
*  True.
*  You lose incentive.
*  Yeah.
*  I think that everything is going to move, not everything, but a lot of power is going
*  to move towards hydrogen.
*  That's the big new push.
*  The Navy has vessels now that run off of hydrogen so they never have to go refuel.
*  Do you know that Bob Lazar made a hydrogen corvette in like 1990?
*  Wow.
*  Incredible.
*  That's psycho.
*  Yeah.
*  Wow.
*  He was such a freak.
*  Wow.
*  He is such a freak.
*  But I love that dude.
*  I'm fascinated by him and I don't know if he's telling the truth but boy I hope he is.
*  But you know one of the crazy stories about him was in the Los Alamos Labs days when he
*  was living there in New Mexico he developed a rocket powered Honda.
*  So he put a jet engine on a fucking Honda.
*  Wow.
*  A lot of time on his hands there.
*  Well he's just a genius.
*  Yeah he's a genius.
*  He's an absolute genius.
*  Look he talked about Element 115 before we discovered Element 115.
*  Yes.
*  So that's what sold me on him.
*  Well he also has never really varied from his story and to tell a story for more than
*  30 years until the exact same story is pretty strange.
*  Yeah.
*  And also didn't really profit off of it.
*  No.
*  It's not like a thing that he's like selling Bob Lazar t-shirts and you know Bob Lazar
*  was right, baseball hats and constantly going on podcasts.
*  No he did my podcast.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't even know if he's done another one.
*  I don't know.
*  I know you got a lot of hell for it.
*  Yeah.
*  I was trying to get him to come back on again but he's working on it.
*  Well during the Jeremy Corbell documentary the FBI raided him.
*  Yeah.
*  Which is insane.
*  It's insane.
*  And he thinks that they believe that he has a stable version of Element 115 that he has
*  a sample of it somewhere.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  And so he thinks that's what they went looking for.
*  They let me get their hands on that because the decay rate is so fast.
*  Well the video that George Knapp had, there's a video that George Knapp had from a long
*  time ago where he was demonstrating with George Knapp how this element when bombarded with
*  radioactivity could distort gravity.
*  And he showed some, he had some experiment that they did that we could show with light
*  and I don't exactly remember what the parameters of the experiment were but that thing is one
*  of the things that convinced George Knapp that maybe he's telling the truth and this
*  whole thing is crazy.
*  And then when you see like these images where it shows these crafts behaving as he described
*  that this gravity projection generator or whatever it is, this gravity generator, whatever
*  this thing is, whatever the, they weren't exactly sure how to, because they, at least
*  back then in 89, but that you would turn towards where you wanted to go sideways and that's
*  how it would travel.
*  Wow.
*  And they saw these videos of these crafts doing that, of rotating.
*  Yeah.
*  Same thing.
*  Yeah.
*  And fighter jets are locked in on them with these high speed sensors and they're locking
*  in and there's like a video where they go, finally I got it locked in.
*  Right.
*  And they're like, look at it go.
*  Yeah, I heard that.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  See if you can find that video because that video is one of my favorites because the pilots
*  are so genuinely excited about this.
*  Right.
*  When they finally lock it in.
*  I think that's the go fast.
*  Go fast one?
*  The go fast one.
*  Okay.
*  And they're like, whoo, we got it.
*  We got it locked in.
*  Like what the fuck is this thing?
*  Have you researched any of the Vamanas from the ancient text?
*  Yes.
*  That's very, very fascinating because they in the Bhagavad Gita and in what is this the
*  one?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, this is it.
*  And in the Mahabharata, they talk about these flying crafts.
*  What is this?
*  What you're about to hear is actually US fighter pilots.
*  Oh, Raytheon.
*  Displayer, pod display.
*  How come I'm not hearing any voices?
*  Oh, there it goes.
*  Yeah.
*  There it goes.
*  Oh, there's just explaining how the display works.
*  Raytheon display and how these fighter jets are using this to try to lock in on this thing.
*  So look how it zooms in.
*  Yeah.
*  They see it pass by.
*  It's going so fast.
*  They're trying to lock in on it, but they're having a hard time.
*  So they keep adjusting and they're trying to get their sensors.
*  Boom.
*  So they got it.
*  Yeah.
*  Now they're excited.
*  Yeah.
*  What the fuck is that?
*  What is that?
*  Like what the fuck is that?
*  It's wild, man.
*  Like I said, I just see these things and I go back to the Vamanas.
*  They ran on a ferrofluid vortex engine.
*  That's how it was described?
*  Yeah.
*  So they had liquid mercury.
*  Ferrofluid?
*  Ferrofluid, which is liquid metal.
*  And so they put liquid metal inside of it.
*  How do you spell that?
*  F-E-R-R-O.
*  Ferrofluid.
*  We used to have a ferrofluid lamp.
*  Really?
*  Remember, I bought you that one thing.
*  You put a magnet on it.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Where is that?
*  Is that in storage?
*  Probably in storage.
*  So if you take a Taurus.
*  We need a new one, Jamie.
*  Order us a new one.
*  If you take a Taurus and you put a ferrofluid like mercury inside of it and you magnetize
*  the Taurus in a way that creates this rotation, this RPM of the mercury moving around that
*  field, and you get it up to about 60,000 RPMs and then you actually pressurize the Taurus
*  to about 250,000 atmospheres and you electrify it, you get anti-gravity properties.
*  What?
*  Yeah.
*  Whoa.
*  So you can create a anti-gravity flying device utilizing that technique, and this is really
*  well known.
*  And how do they describe it in the text?
*  In the text, they talk about the fact that it used mercury in a rotating disk.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  And then they have some of the flight plans and some of the layout of actually the plans
*  of the actual ship itself, one of the ships.
*  And so from that, you can almost hypothesize or backward engineer what it might have been
*  able to do.
*  And in the text, it says they used to take a compliment of men to many worlds.
*  So this is incredible technology.
*  A compliment of men to many worlds.
*  Yeah.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  So do you think that the government has access to something similar to that?
*  Oh, I believe so, 1,000%.
*  I believe they've been backwards engineering information from ancient text and of course,
*  any artifacts that they found from anywhere in the world.
*  They might have even gotten information from Saddam Hussein's museum, because that's the
*  first place we went in the Gulf after the whole situation happened with wanting to
*  go take him out of power and kill him.
*  They went straight to the museum.
*  So Jamie just pulled this up.
*  It says, flying with ferrofluids to solve this problem, L. Brad King, Ron and Elaine
*  Starr, professor in space systems at Michigan Tech, is creating a new kind of micro thruster
*  that assembles itself out of its own propellant when excited by a magnetic field.
*  The tiny thruster requires no fragile needles and is essentially indestructible.
*  We're working with unique material called ionic fluid ferrofluid, King says, explaining
*  that it's both magnetic and ionic, a liquid salt.
*  When we put a magnet underneath a small pool of ferrofluid, it turns into a beautiful hedgehog
*  structure of aligned peaks.
*  When we apply a strong electric field to that array of peaks, each one emits an individual
*  micro jet of ions.
*  Whoa.
*  Exactly.
*  You have to electrify it.
*  You electrify it, you create this electromagnetic activity.
*  This is what it looks like in ...
*  Yeah, that's just on two screws.
*  I think it's just transferring itself.
*  Yeah, just giving you how it transfers itself.
*  Wow.
*  And so you could use that as something that could propel a device.
*  Yes, absolutely.
*  Wow.
*  And you don't get to reduce the gravity, the weight of an object to zero, but you significantly
*  reduce the weight of an object.
*  And the fact that they figure this out and that it's in ... Is it in the Mahabharata
*  or the Bhagavad Gita?
*  In the Mahabharata.
*  Wow.
*  And also I think it was one of the town in the Vedas.
*  What is the definition ... What's the explanation for how they figured that out?
*  Help me out.
*  Help me out.
*  How the fuck?
*  They say they have flying cities.
*  They say they have flying cities, and these cities would go to battle sometimes against
*  each other in the sky.
*  Oh my God.
*  So you're talking about massive objects flying around.
*  Right, and how do they explain that away?
*  That's what I want to know.
*  How do you explain somebody thousands of years ago sitting down to write a sci-fi epic?
*  Well, not just that, but writing about a process of creating this field that now has been documented
*  all these thousands of years later.
*  It works now.
*  How did you figure that out?
*  What were you guys doing?
*  This happens over and over again in text.
*  In the Ammo Tab, it's just a book I wrote, both talks about using semantic frequencies
*  and light waves to create, manifest solid matter.
*  And what happened about four years ago in a laboratory, they used semantic frequencies
*  and photons to create solid matter out of nothing.
*  Just happened about four years ago.
*  What did they create?
*  They just create a few particles, you know, but the fact that we can do it, but it was
*  already in ancient text.
*  Wow.
*  So now we can do it on a very small scale, just like we can create element 115 with a
*  collider.
*  Correct.
*  Same kind of thing.
*  So they created a small, unstable version of element 115 that only exists for a fraction
*  of a second, but they can measure it.
*  Right.
*  With sufficiently advanced technology, you could create it and then form a stable version
*  of that.
*  Right.
*  Imagine being able to build an entire city by manifesting the matter needed to build
*  the city instead of harvesting the city from rock.
*  3D print the city with nanobots.
*  You would use nanobots to build the whole city.
*  It would manifest as it went.
*  You could also use that to repair things.
*  Absolutely.
*  So you would never have to have construction again.
*  Everything would be self-repairable.
*  Correct.
*  Self-repairable.
*  Correct.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, of course, if you just scale up, just think about what we can do now and keep going,
*  make it much better and much more efficient.
*  We're talking about programmable matter now.
*  Programmable matter.
*  And what you were saying about DNA, the fact that you can encode into DNA and that you
*  could actually hold information in DNA.
*  Yeah.
*  So, the first step has created the very first DNA hard drive.
*  So it's a molecular hard drive that works on technology that's hardware and also biological
*  software.
*  And so a device, a hard drive the size of my cell phone can store an enormous amount
*  of petabytes of data.
*  So things like teleportation are going to be possible in the near future.
*  We've already teleported, I think, a couple of particles from Earth to the space station.
*  But what's stopping us from teleporting a human being?
*  Knowing the location of every atom and the rotation and experiment of every atom.
*  That's a lot of information, a lot of storage space.
*  Now with DNA hard drives, the storage space problem goes away.
*  We'll be able to teleport biological beings or objects, big objects into space or wherever
*  we want on the planet.
*  Like Star Trek.
*  Like Star Trek.
*  Wow.
*  Who's going to be the first guy to get beamed up?
*  Somebody's going to be a real guinea pig for that one.
*  Yeah, we're going to have to find some petaphiles.
*  Because when you teleport, you die.
*  I don't know if people know that.
*  Oh.
*  Yeah.
*  Teleport.
*  I mean, you're reborn again instantly in the other location.
*  But it's a facsimile of you.
*  Anytime you teleport, even the molecules that we teleport now, the original version, the
*  original molecule or the starting matter, it's destroyed.
*  And the data is then transmitted and then it's reformulated.
*  So a teleportation is actually the death of you and the reformation of you.
*  Maybe they could do a better job, like an histogram filter.
*  Maybe you could just tone a few things up, clean up a little bit.
*  Get rid of some scars or whatever.
*  Get rid of some body fat.
*  Maybe they can make a better version of you.
*  But you have to be willing to die.
*  But maybe that's hell.
*  Maybe you come back and you have no soul.
*  Maybe when you teleport, your soul doesn't go with you.
*  Well, they're transmitting your consciousness.
*  So everything is saved.
*  All your information is saved.
*  We know that was done also in ancient times.
*  Thoth talks in the animal tablets about being able to go into these halls of a mentee where
*  he had rejuvenation chambers, which is what I believe is the Serapium in Saqqara.
*  And he would go into these gigantic stone boxes and he would then transfer his consciousness
*  from his body into another body.
*  And he would leave the body that he left inside of one of those gigantic boxes, one of those
*  gigantic diorite stone boxes for a hundred years while it recharged itself and rejuvenated,
*  while he said he walks amongst men but unlike a man.
*  What?
*  Yeah.
*  And he would do this for eons.
*  He would transfer from body to body, not bodies he stole, bodies he created that he created
*  himself through probably some advanced form of stem cell technology.
*  And he would walk amongst men but unlike a man.
*  And he was known all around the planet because of this.
*  The guy lived for, according to the ancient Egyptians, he ruled over them for 16,000 years,
*  one person.
*  What?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  So was this those ancient texts, like the ancient hieroglyphs that show kings going
*  back like 30,000 years?
*  So that's the Sumerian Kings List located in the Oshmeruli Museum at Oxford, England.
*  I was there myself in person to check out this stonework.
*  And it's an incredible tablet that talks about the reigns of kings.
*  Some kings ruled for 28,800 years, 14,000 years.
*  I mean 20,000.
*  If the numbers are insane.
*  These are not Egyptian?
*  This is no, not Egyptian.
*  These are Anunnaki.
*  This is pre-flood.
*  This is post- sorry, anti-deluvial.
*  And then when the flood comes, it talks about, and then the flood swept over the land.
*  After the flood happens, then they descend kingship from heaven back down to humans.
*  And then the reigns of humans begin.
*  But they're not really full humans.
*  They're demigods.
*  They're half human, half Anunnaki.
*  And then their lifespans are like much shorter because their ruling times are only like a
*  thousand years, and 800 years, and 700 years.
*  And it starts to go down, down, down, down, down.
*  Which is why Noah was 600 years old.
*  Right, exactly.
*  So these tablets, what are they called again?
*  You're talking about the Sumerian Kings List.
*  Can you show me that, Jamie?
*  I want to see what that looks like.
*  It's a giant four-sided tablet located in the Oshmerling Museum in Oxford, England.
*  And so what exactly does it say?
*  It gives you the-
*  This is it right here?
*  That's it right there.
*  Those are all four sides.
*  And how old is this?
*  Oh, this is, you know, they're saying 6,000.
*  Can you make it bigger, Jamie?
*  Believe me, it's much older than that.
*  I just want to look at it.
*  Yeah.
*  Man.
*  This is a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy over tens of thousands of years, in my opinion.
*  But this text gives the reigns of kings in Shars, S-H-A-R. A Shar is 3,600 years.
*  So one Shar would be 3,600.
*  So 241,000 years of rule on that stone right there.
*  The Sumerian Kings List.
*  Yeah.
*  Now, if this is right, if this is all true, what a mind-blowing idea that humans have
*  been around, that we're engineered hundreds of thousands of years ago, and that this is
*  the reason why there's this bizarre shift between lower primates and us, which you don't
*  see in any other animal.
*  Right.
*  There's nothing like it.
*  No.
*  There's nothing like us.
*  Look, we have 46 chromosomes, right?
*  Right.
*  Chimpanzees have 48.
*  Exactly.
*  They discovered that chromosome number two was taken out.
*  They call it an artificial mutation.
*  They.
*  They mean geneticists.
*  Fused together and two telomere caps put on them.
*  One telomere cap on each side.
*  Who in the world took chromosome number two out, fused it together, and put telomere caps
*  on it?
*  And they say that it happened an estimated 200,000 years ago.
*  Right at the time that Sumerians have a say, they decided to make mankind to do the labor.
*  There's no coincidence that the tablets are lining with modern science.
*  This means that a couple things.
*  The first thing it means that we were genetically modified.
*  The second thing that it means is the telomere caps limit our lifespan to about 120 years
*  max, according to Harvard scientists.
*  Now, in the Bible, what does it say?
*  It says that my seed shall not abide in man forever.
*  His years shall be 120.
*  That was taken from the Sumerian tablets even further back than that, thousands of years
*  before the Bible was written.
*  When Yahweh, AKA, and Lil shows back up, sees the human beings building a tower into the
*  heavens, copying a tower that they themselves had built, it pissed them off.
*  And he said, whatever their hearts decide to do, they shall achieve it.
*  My seed shall not abide in man.
*  His years shall be 120.
*  And then he did a genetic modification at that point, I believe, with the telomeres.
*  And he spread mankind out around the planet, and he confused their languages.
*  He had us speaking different languages, so we couldn't collaborate.
*  Now we're in competition.
*  No collaboration.
*  Divide and conquer.
*  And there's the tower of battle.
*  That's it.
*  That's it, man.
*  So it was all done just to keep us from rising.
*  Yes.
*  We were advancing too fast.
*  And he had to slow us down.
*  If we shorten their lifespan, then they won't have enough time.
*  By the time they realize who they are and what power they have, they'll be dead.
*  And see, that's what's happened to us.
*  So if the Anunnaki are real and Nibiru is real, and Nibiru is on an elliptical cycle
*  that comes between, it's like Mars and Jupiter, right?
*  Somewhere around there?
*  Well, it's further out now.
*  It's over time.
*  Its orbit has been pushed out.
*  And that's just one planet that these Anunnaki people come from.
*  They come from many planets.
*  But do you think that this planet, Nibiru, that's on an elliptical orbit, if it's coming
*  every 3,600 years, wouldn't there be some sort of documentation 3,600 years ago,
*  at the very least?
*  Well, you have to look for geological disasters as marker points.
*  This object, this Nibiru planet, which is mentioned, by the way, in the Enuma Elisha.
*  It's not a fabricated name.
*  Just so people know, that's a real name.
*  In the Enuma Elisha, the oldest version of the Enuma Elisha says Nibiru as one of the
*  planets.
*  But you look at the timeframe when this thing gets close.
*  It orbits another planet, another star.
*  So it orbits a brown dwarf star.
*  This brown dwarf star has the same amount of mass as our sun, but it's much smaller,
*  right?
*  But it generates enough heat through friction in its orbiting planets.
*  You can see it in two-mass infrared mode coming out of the constellation of Leo if you go
*  to a worldwide telescope and download the software and all of that.
*  But the fact that modern science now admit that there's an object out there that they
*  say orbit our sun every 4,200 years, right?
*  That's Corey Powell from Discovery Magazine.
*  He's a real astronomer.
*  He's been on Fox News.
*  He said that on Fox News.
*  If I can find the clip, I'll send it to you, matter of fact.
*  We'll find it.
*  Yeah, we'll find it.
*  Yeah, Fox News, Corey Powell.
*  What's happening is we are seeing evidence that there is something out there that's orbiting
*  our sun and that our sun is a binary star system.
*  We used to think that our sun, one sun in the solar system is normal, but as they looked
*  out into space with Hubble and now the web, they discovered, no, binary is more of the
*  normal and even trinary.
*  It's like, wait a minute.
*  If binary is normal, they started looking for this object that gravitationally should
*  exist and they believe that it's out there far beyond the orbit of Pluto and that Corey
*  Powell says our solar system exists within our solar system.
*  He goes on to say, we come from there on Fox News, which is just crazy.
*  The idea, if you follow Terrence Howard's theory, is that matter comes from the sun.
*  It moves away, coalesces into planets.
*  It gets to a Goldilocks zone.
*  Life comes out of that.
*  Life becomes far more intelligent as time goes on, develops more capabilities, and then
*  is also assisted by other beings that have been through this process already.
*  Then if this scales out for hundreds of millions of years, you get to a point where this Nibiru
*  is or billions of years or whatever it takes for it to get all the way the fuck up.
*  I estimate that they're about a million years ahead of us technologically.
*  It could be-
*  Then there's things that are millions of years ahead of them.
*  Way ahead of them.
*  There's things that are far, far ahead of them.
*  This is what's hard for us to scale out.
*  We like to think that aliens are flying spaceships.
*  That's the top of the food chain, but not even close.
*  Like I was saying before, I never got to it.
*  Really, there's three types of beings I think that exist.
*  One is the physical corporeal being that could be what we see flying around in these UFOs.
*  Not all of them, some of them that visit us, that interact with us in the ancient past.
*  Not all are little green men, but they have various different body types.
*  The second kind that I believe is potentially multidimensional beings.
*  There's life in every different dimension.
*  Michio Kaku was famous for saying that the universe, they believe, has 11 dimensions.
*  That's 11 dimensions.
*  We're only in the third.
*  There's fourth, fifth, sixth, all the way up to 11 at least, or the universe, he says,
*  would collapse.
*  If you're a being in a higher dimension, you can see the past, present, and future all
*  at once in the third.
*  If you say, that's an interesting place.
*  I'd like to visit it.
*  If you can actually create a phase shift in your atomic frequency to match the atomic
*  frequency of this dimension, you can walk right in, and then you can walk right back.
*  Then you probably have something else that's outside of this entire universe that has a
*  capability.
*  Maybe it's the creators of the universe itself, which is why I wrote the book, Fractal Holographic
*  Universe.
*  Maybe there's a creator outside of this entire universe that has a hand in creating this
*  ancestral universe itself.
*  Well, it also makes sense that if you scaled intelligent life up infinitely, you're going
*  to reach a point where you have godlike powers.
*  This being or collection of beings, this hive mind, whatever it is, it could essentially,
*  if given 100 million years, harness the very power of the universe itself, or maybe even
*  create the universe.
*  And create other universes.
*  Which is the ultimate mind blower, that intelligent life is the reason why this thing exists,
*  that it creates this thing.
*  We're creating universes right now as human beings on this planet.
*  Fourteen college kids created a video game called No Man's Sky.
*  No Man's Sky is on one DVD disc, and it has 80 quadrillion planets and unlimited life forms,
*  and the game never ends.
*  We've talked about that, right?
*  Yeah.
*  That one's a weird one.
*  Yeah, but you put AI in it.
*  Right.
*  Then what's going to happen?
*  Right.
*  Scale up to a quantum computer.
*  Now all of a sudden, what happened?
*  And then have a virtual reality headset.
*  Boom.
*  Yeah.
*  The people in there, who are we?
*  Where are we from?
*  What is the Big Bang?
*  When we turn to Collins alone, that's the Big Bang for you.
*  Yeah.
*  The Sims are going to get AI now.
*  They're going to be asking questions.
*  Right.
*  They're going to be creating their own software within the software and trying to build their
*  own copy of a universe.
*  We're not even close to base reality.
*  We're literally living in a stacked reality.
*  We're just one reality out of, who knows, Googles of actual realities that exist.
*  Do you think the simulation theory has weight?
*  Oh, I believe so.
*  I just wrote a book about it.
*  That book is about the fracoholographic universe, and I believe that we're living in a simulation
*  You've got a stack.
*  How many books have you read?
*  Four.
*  The one just came out today, the Fracoholographic Universe.
*  This is the Emerald Tablets, the Epic of Humanity, and my financial book, Woke Doesn't Mean
*  Broke, financial literacy book.
*  Not the political woke either, but the real woke.
*  When did you start going down this road of exploring all these interesting subjects?
*  Well, it was a long time ago, 1977 in Miami, Florida.
*  We moved from New York to Miami next to the Opalocca Airport, living in the hood.
*  I used to go out in the backyard.
*  You know how it is back there.
*  No cable TV, no cell phones, no tablets.
*  You just go outside and play.
*  I'm outside in the backyard playing, but I'm looking at the airplanes go over.
*  This one day, this plane goes over, but it's not really a plane.
*  It clears the horizon in seconds, not minutes.
*  It just goes straight across.
*  I know as a little kid, the planes take a long time to go from one point to the other,
*  and it went straight across.
*  It was more like not a full size, not cigar, but not an egg, kind of in between the two,
*  glowing, almost like a tic tac, glowing metal.
*  Yes.
*  Then it came back and it stopped right over me, completely silent.
*  Now I can estimate about 250 meters.
*  Then it just went gone.
*  I ran in the house and I told my mom, I can't believe what I just saw.
*  My mom said to me, son, back in the day, there were advanced beings that came to this planet.
*  This is 1977.
*  Your mom doing this?
*  Yes.
*  That's why I dedicated the book to her.
*  She said they used to live on tops of mountains like in Peru and Machu Picchu, which is one
*  of the greatest places I ever went.
*  I had to go there.
*  I went to the library at Rainbow Park Elementary the next morning, and I told the teacher I
*  have to go to the library inside the school, Rainbow Park, and I said I need to get all
*  the encyclopedias on aerospace.
*  She gave me the encyclopedias on aerospace.
*  That's when I started researching from that exact moment.
*  Wow.
*  I haven't stopped since.
*  You were how old?
*  Eight?
*  Seven years old.
*  Oh my God.
*  You just got locked in.
*  I got locked in.
*  I started researching swept wing, delta wing, ballistics, intercontinental ballistics.
*  I'm looking at submarines.
*  I'm looking at hovercraft that existed way back then, flying disks that we had created
*  in the military way back then, SR-71s and all this stuff.
*  I'm trying to figure out what the hell did I see, and I couldn't find it.
*  It took me down the path of technologies and advanced technologies and aerospace information.
*  I became a quasi-aerospace historian.
*  Let me in further on down the line to studying architecture and seeing a connection between
*  the two.
*  You studied at both Harvard and MIT?
*  Harvard was for ancient civilizations.
*  I took a class and got a certificate in ancient civilizations.
*  At MIT, I took a class in applied neuroscience and got a certificate in applied neuroscience.
*  Do you just do this for your own edification just because you're interested in it?
*  Yeah.
*  Now I'm enrolled again at MIT right now for a class in AI.
*  When you first got down this road, we're talking about a time where there's no internet.
*  You're just trying to make sense of some things.
*  Just trying to make sense, man.
*  Just bring me away.
*  Have you ever seen anything since then?
*  Yeah.
*  Actually, at East Seti Ranch in 2017, I believe it was, we were out there.
*  I was out there to do a speak at this ranch in Washington State.
*  It's down from the basin of Mount Shasta in that area.
*  It's called the Seti Ranch?
*  East Seti.
*  Oh, okay.
*  East Seti.
*  It's like a private kingdom in America, actually.
*  It's a private, they've got registered as a small kingdom.
*  They don't even have mail or anything there.
*  It's a weird place.
*  I had to stay in a yurt.
*  It's really crazy out there.
*  I spoke there for a whole week.
*  I had to get used to it because nobody told me about this before I got there.
*  You had to stay in a yurt for a week?
*  Stay in a yurt for a week.
*  Did they have running water?
*  At the community bathroom.
*  Oh, boy.
*  At Seti?
*  Yeah, East Seti.
*  Oh, enlightened contact with extraterrestrial intelligence.
*  Oh, boy.
*  So they're just out there with no technology trying to talk to aliens?
*  No, just out there every night sky watching, basically.
*  Really?
*  And the video that we recorded...
*  Does that sound like Rich Crazy Person's idea?
*  Yeah.
*  I love it.
*  The video that we created that night watching those UFOs in the sky actually made it onto
*  an episode that I made on ancient aliens.
*  Oh.
*  Yeah.
*  That show's the best show to get high to.
*  You ever see Action Bronson's show where he would watch ancient aliens and they would just
*  get stoned and watch ancient aliens?
*  That show's crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  So we recorded some crazy footage in the skies there.
*  What did you see?
*  Well, they were giant disks flying around.
*  Some were changing colors.
*  You have video footage of this?
*  It's on the app.
*  But I sent it to ancient aliens.
*  See if you can find that.
*  I'm sure they played it.
*  James Gilliland, the guy who owns the ranch, licensed it and approved ancient aliens.
*  But if you go to Seti Ranch YouTube videos, you could probably find one right on YouTube
*  right now.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  It was incredible.
*  So these folks are just out there trying to make contact?
*  I'm not trying to make contact.
*  Just watching.
*  Just watching.
*  Just like I'm in amazement.
*  There's no contact attempt there.
*  And why?
*  Yeah, there you go.
*  That's it.
*  I was there that night.
*  That video, I was standing there that night.
*  And there was a lot of activity that night.
*  There was some crazy stuff going on.
*  And what does this thing look like to the naked eye?
*  We're seeing very blurry, looks like zoomed in footage.
*  Yeah.
*  What year is this from?
*  This is probably...
*  2018?
*  Yeah, 2018.
*  There you go.
*  So they didn't have the out Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra zoom.
*  We didn't have that one back then.
*  But from the naked eye, it looks like these giant glowing balls moving around.
*  Sometimes they expand and get...
*  They change colors.
*  Sometimes they descend right down by Mount Shasta.
*  And then you could see the lighting in the tree line.
*  And then they would go back up into space again.
*  It was just crazy stuff.
*  Have you seen that ball lightning that they get in Texas that comes out of the mountains?
*  No, I saw one on a railroad track though, ball lightning.
*  There's this phenomenon that happens in this one particular area in Texas.
*  What was it called?
*  Marfa?
*  Was that what it's called, Jamie?
*  I think it's Marfa.
*  It's like this bizarre artist community town.
*  And they have frequent instances of what they call the Marfa lights.
*  And it's ball lightning that flies around out there.
*  You don't think that could be that?
*  No, because sometimes they would keep going until they just went out into space.
*  And there were so many.
*  Two would come and they would encircle each other.
*  And then one would change direction and drop down by the mountain.
*  And one would just take off in another direction.
*  Some would go slower and then go, and just go.
*  How frequent does this take place?
*  I don't know.
*  I was only there for those seven nights.
*  I'd say the first night we were there was when we saw the 10 in the sky moving around
*  and doing things.
*  The second night, not too much.
*  The third night was a little bit more, maybe four or five.
*  So do you think that what it is is that this place has no light pollution and they depict
*  a very specific area that they knew these things occur in?
*  It's possible.
*  It's possible that they have no light pollution and plus also maybe that's an area where they
*  have an opening or access or I don't know.
*  Who knows?
*  I'm just now speculating now.
*  But I don't know why.
*  People came from all over the world to that location the week I was there to just camp
*  out and look up at the sky.
*  Wow.
*  Listen, man, we covered a lot.
*  Three hours.
*  I really appreciate your time and I appreciate all the stuff you put out there.
*  It's so fun.
*  So fascinating.
*  Thank you very much for being here, man.
*  I really had a good time.
*  I enjoyed it.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Please tell everybody how to find your website, all your social media, all that stuff.
*  Well, first of all, I have my own streaming TV network called Forbidden Knowledge TV.
*  It's an app on the App Store.
*  So they can just go get the Forbidden Knowledge TV app with the number four, Forbidden Knowledge.
*  They can get access to a lot of videos and stuff that you can't find on YouTube or anywhere
*  else.
*  Produce shows like the one you watched.
*  My Anunnaki series is on the Forbidden Knowledge TV app.
*  And of course, I have all my books on our website, Forbidden Knowledge TV on Amazon
*  as well.
*  And just everything forbidden knowledge with the number four, Forbidden.
*  There it is.
*  We'll do this again, man.
*  I think we could talk for like 50 days.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  For sure.
*  Thank you, Billy.
*  Appreciate you, man.
*  Bye, everybody.
*  Bye.
