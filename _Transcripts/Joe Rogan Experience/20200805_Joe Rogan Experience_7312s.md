# Joe Rogan Experience #1520 - Dr. Debra Soh
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [August 05, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9NeQTkJjIs)
*  Hello, Debra.
*  Hi.
*  We were just talking.
*  You're locked up in Toronto.
*  You were thinking about flying here, but they fill the planes now, you were saying, which
*  is a little disturbing.
*  I did not know they're doing that.
*  Yeah, they usually would leave the middle seat open, but as of about a month or so ago,
*  they book it fully now.
*  So I was super excited.
*  I'm so sad that I can't be there with you because I've been counting down the days and
*  thinking I have to at least be in LA to do Joe's show, but it was just a bit scared.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, it's scary.
*  It's weird.
*  I mean, how many people have you known that have caught it now?
*  Actually nobody.
*  Isn't that wild?
*  That's crazy.
*  Everybody I know knows at least one or two people.
*  I don't know anyone.
*  So I'm very, very lucky.
*  I'm up to nine friends.
*  Nine friends have gotten it.
*  Wild.
*  Yeah.
*  Two of them got it bad.
*  Yeah.
*  Two of them got it really bad to the point where they were hospitalized.
*  Yeah.
*  It's one of them was an older guy and one of them is a guy who was 45 who just was run.
*  My friend Michael Yo, who's just run down.
*  He was just really exhausted from too much traveling and too much.
*  I mean, it was really a crazy schedule that he was on and he wound up catching it.
*  He had it bad.
*  He was hospitalized for a week.
*  Oh no.
*  Is he doing okay now?
*  Yeah, he's fine now, but his endurance is really low.
*  Like his lung capacity suffered.
*  That's the thing, because when this happened, I felt like, okay, everything has to stop
*  and I have to take care of myself just to me.
*  Take it for granted, right?
*  When you're healthy.
*  But the minute something like this happens, this is something that I would have never
*  even thought about.
*  Are you taking a lot of vitamin D?
*  No, I'm actually, everyone has been telling me to take vitamin D. I take Omega.
*  Well that's good.
*  But you should really, vitamin C and vitamin D are critical in zinc.
*  Zinc is critical.
*  Vitamin D in particular, they did a study, several studies actually, Dr. Rhonda Patrick
*  was on the podcast talking about it and she said that there was several studies that show
*  that in the people that were in the ICU with COVID, more than 80% of them were insufficient
*  when their vitamin D levels and only 4% were sufficient.
*  So it's not a prevent all, it's not provable, but there's got to be some sort of a correlation.
*  I feel like if you're giving me personalized advice, I should probably take it because
*  I'm sure a lot of people would pay a lot of money for this.
*  I don't think they would.
*  I think you're wrong.
*  A few people would probably.
*  But I've talked to enough people that I think vitamin D, zinc and vitamin C seem to be critical,
*  but just overall health is very important.
*  It's one of the things that my friend Andrew Schultz was saying that was exposed by this
*  pandemic.
*  The vulnerabilities of our economic system and the vulnerabilities of our health system.
*  Human beings have, there's too many of us that are just not well.
*  We don't take care of ourselves.
*  So when something like this happens, you don't just get sick, you could die from it.
*  Whereas the vast majority of people that get it, they're not going to die from it, but
*  there's enough that it's a significant number.
*  It's scary stuff.
*  Yeah.
*  Who could have predicted that this was ever going to happen?
*  Not me.
*  So what's it like in Toronto these days?
*  It hasn't been bad.
*  We're almost back to normal.
*  So that's very exciting.
*  Yeah.
*  For me, I've been writing this book for the last year.
*  So my life hasn't actually changed that much, which probably sounds really crazy.
*  But when you're writing a book, you're literally inside working all the time.
*  Yeah.
*  So explain to people what the book is.
*  So the book is called The End of Gender.
*  And before I go any further, I'm going to explain the title because some people I think
*  misinterpret what I when I announced it on social media, some people were getting upset
*  because I think they thought I was taking a very, very far left progressive view.
*  And I consider myself to be a liberal.
*  I'm definitely not far left, but I have liberal values.
*  I'm pro-science.
*  And so The End of Gender, I think people thought that I meant I was saying that gender is basically
*  whatever you want it to be.
*  It's based solely in self-identification.
*  There's no tethering to biology.
*  And that is not what I'm saying with the book at all.
*  And I think if anyone's ever read my columns or seen my appearances or they listen to the
*  talk that I had with you last time I was on your show, that's definitely not what I'm
*  saying.
*  I'm saying the complete opposite.
*  That the fact that science denial and misinformation about gender is so prominent now is actually
*  affecting is really poorly affecting our ability to understand gender.
*  And that's leading to the demise of our understanding of it in an accurate way.
*  If you don't mind, just just to start things off, will you please give your credentials
*  and tell people what you do?
*  Yeah, so I have a PhD in sexual neuroscience research.
*  I made the transition from being an academic sex researcher to being a journalist.
*  So now I write about the science of sex and gender.
*  I write about the politicization of science and academic censorship.
*  And so now I have this book out and I can talk a bit about how I got here, if that would
*  be helpful.
*  Sure, sure.
*  Yeah.
*  So when I was doing my PhD, I very much I loved being a sex researcher.
*  I really thought I was going to stay in academia.
*  And in the last few years, I noticed that there had been a change in the climate in
*  terms of what people could study, what people could talk about as scientific experts.
*  And one area in particular was about gender transition in children.
*  So every single mainstream news piece was saying that for these children who say they're
*  born in the wrong body, the best approach for them would be early transitioning.
*  So that means to take on a name, a new name, identify as the opposite sex, usually get
*  a haircut, start dressing like the opposite sex.
*  But from a scientific perspective, all of the research actually shows that most of these
*  kids, the vast majority of them, are more likely to grow up to be gay in adulthood.
*  They're not going to be transgender.
*  And at that time, there's literally maybe one or two news articles that called into
*  question this narrative of early transitioning.
*  So I wrote an op-ed about this, citing the scientific research, and I asked my colleagues
*  and mentors in academia, you know, what do you think?
*  I knew that there was going to be some backlash to it.
*  And one of my mentors said to me, because I said, should I wait until I have tenure
*  to put something like this out?
*  And he said, nowadays, tenure is not going to protect you.
*  So that sealed my decision.
*  I published the piece.
*  And then from there, I made the transition to journalism, and I haven't looked back.
*  It's a very strange time when it comes to talking about certain subjects, because it
*  doesn't matter what the science is.
*  There are specific narratives that you have to adhere to in today's climate.
*  You know, I, like you, am also left.
*  But when it comes to saying, like, far left, like, far left is a different thing now than
*  it used to be.
*  Far left used to be, I mean, just 10, 15 years ago, it was a different animal.
*  And I knew a lot of people that are far left.
*  Now far left, I associate with lunacy.
*  It's like, I look at it the same way I look at far right.
*  I look at far right extremists and far left extremists.
*  But something happened where far left ideology has permeated our culture when it comes to
*  gender.
*  And I don't understand it.
*  If you don't adhere to this ideology, people want to say that you have no compassion, you're
*  evil, you're bigoted.
*  I had Abigail Shearer on the podcast recently, and she has a book.
*  I love Abigail.
*  She's great.
*  And she's very brave.
*  And I saw what happens when you go against this narrative by having her on.
*  Men's Health wrote a piece about me saying I'm fanning the flames of hate, because she
*  was talking about a 4,000% increase, 4,000% increase in teenage girls identifying as trans
*  and rapid onset gender dysphoria, which is real.
*  I mean, this is a real scientific phenomenon.
*  70 times what you would see in the general population in terms of people identifying
*  as transgender.
*  It's amazing.
*  She was talking about this in this very specific way, talking about awkward teenage girls and
*  about how these girls have, you know, really odd situations in terms of the way they deal
*  with people socially.
*  And then all of a sudden they're praised for deciding that they're trans, and then they
*  get these clusters of friends that also decided they're trans, which is very strange.
*  It's just a very strange phenomenon, but you're not even allowed to talk about it.
*  So if Men's Health, which is a fucking men's magazine, is going to write articles calling
*  you a hateful person because you're discussing it.
*  There was no hate in that podcast at all.
*  It was just discussing it, like what is causing this?
*  Why is this?
*  And what can be done?
*  And why are we so quick to just...
*  I mean, we can assume that people are troubled in all sorts of different ways, but we can't
*  assume they're ever troubled when it comes to gender.
*  It's very bizarre.
*  I think what you were saying with why it's gone so far left, I do think a lot of this
*  is coming from empathy, which is a good thing.
*  And I have to say, you know, with regard to the issue of transitioning children, I do
*  support traditioning in adults.
*  I think it can help adults who are transgender.
*  I think if you were an adult, it's your decision, it's your body.
*  It's no one's place to tell you what to do.
*  But I think a lot of this is coming from...
*  So I grew up in the gay community, and I remember seeing how homophobic people could be toward
*  my friends.
*  And I think things have changed.
*  Things have gotten better in some ways.
*  I think homophobia still exists, and we can talk about that because I do talk about how
*  that affects a lot of what we're seeing in the book.
*  But I think for a lot of people, they look at that and they say, okay, we were wrong
*  about that.
*  We were wrong to treat gay people differently.
*  We were wrong to say that being gay is something you can change.
*  So now they've gone completely in the opposite direction, saying, okay, no matter what anyone
*  says with regard to their identity, with regard to their gender, this is something that we
*  should not challenge.
*  We should fully support.
*  And if you question it in any way, even in the most nuanced or sensitive way, as I try
*  to and as I think you do, that's still not acceptable.
*  Yeah, that's what's strange.
*  It's an ideology.
*  It's rigid.
*  It's like a religion.
*  It is.
*  It is.
*  I think I find people who are, you know, middle of the road, they're not sure what to think.
*  If they read my work or they talk to me, they say, oh, wow, I never realized that.
*  I didn't know the science said that.
*  And they change their perspective.
*  But I think for some people, if they are very much invested in the identity or very invested
*  in activism, or for whatever reason, this ideology means something to them, it's you
*  cannot, you just cannot reason with them.
*  It doesn't matter what the science says, they will find something to pick at.
*  And especially with desistance, which is that the research I was mentioning where it shows
*  that most kids will not feel gender dysphoric anymore when they reach puberty.
*  They just, some people cannot accept it and they will call you transphobic.
*  They'll call you bigoted.
*  And, you know, I don't think I'm any of those things.
*  I'm really just trying to help prevent these children from making potentially a very bad
*  decision that they're going to regret.
*  And especially now, we're seeing in the UK that this is happening where more detransitioners
*  are saying, this was something I regret.
*  This was a mistake.
*  Why did the adults not challenge me?
*  I really think so right now we're in August 2020.
*  I think within the next five years or maybe a little bit longer, we're going to be seeing
*  an explosion of children coming out and saying, I did not want to transition.
*  This was a mistake.
*  And it's really going to be awful.
*  Well, we're already seeing that.
*  There's a lawsuit that was very prominent in the UK recently about a young girl who
*  transitioned to be...
*  Do you know the lawsuit I'm talking about?
*  I do.
*  Yeah, Kirra Bell.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, it's heartbreaking because she's essentially ruined her body to the point where she's not
*  going to be able to have children.
*  In many cases, a lot of these girls can't have orgasms ever again.
*  No, exactly.
*  Yeah.
*  But I think in North America, we are still very much in denial about this.
*  I mean, whenever I'm on a show, if I'm on TV and I talk about this, the backlash after
*  is just crazy.
*  And I'm thinking, people need to wake up.
*  I'm trying to stop this from happening, right?
*  The whole point of writing this book and saying these things is trying to prevent what's about
*  to happen.
*  Yeah.
*  The backlash is very strange because a lot of the backlash is from trans folks.
*  And it seems that they equate any criticism or any examination of even children, even
*  small children transitioning to transphobia.
*  You must hate.
*  And I get there has to be some trans people that as children knew that they were women
*  or they were the opposite sex, that they were in the wrong body.
*  There has to be.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  No, I don't disagree with that.
*  I think we both don't.
*  The question is how many and how do they make that decision and how many are actually being
*  influenced by other factors external.
*  Children are very malleable.
*  And that's part of the problem with making lifelong decisions as a six-year-old.
*  If you're a six-year-old male and you decide that you're a female and you go through the
*  transition and then you realize you're a gay man later in life, there's no recourse.
*  There's nothing you can do to rectify that.
*  That's what's terrifying about this and that you're not allowed to talk about it.
*  You're not allowed to say that even.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  And when I do point that out, people say that I'm using the gay community to try and as
*  a shield or something like that.
*  But medical professionals need to be the ones to do their job because it is their job.
*  They should be doing proper assessments with these children and adults too to determine,
*  you know, what is the best way for it for you.
*  And that's the only way they can really determine on a case by case basis whether transitioning
*  is going to help somebody.
*  But they can't do their jobs right now.
*  Everyone I know that is ethical in the field has left or they stop working with these patients
*  because they don't feel they can do their job properly.
*  So what you have instead is the people who are currently operating are activists and
*  they will really facilitate whatever patient wants them to do, whether or not that may
*  or may not be the right thing for them.
*  Yeah.
*  How did we get to this point?
*  Now, how did we get this point?
*  First of all, in academia, you come from academia.
*  How did we get to this point where some subjects can be discussed where like you were talking
*  to that other professor and they were saying, even if you get tenure, this is not going
*  to protect you.
*  Like what what happened?
*  Sex research in particular, I feel like sex research was the carrying the coal mine because
*  we saw this coming decades ago in that one professor, Michael Bailey at Northwestern
*  University.
*  There's been a long history that's ugly between sex researchers and transgender activists.
*  And Michael Bailey wrote a book, I think it was 2003 that really enraged some activists.
*  And I have to say, trans activists don't speak for all transgender people.
*  I have many trans people who've reached out to me over the years telling me that they
*  actually agree with me.
*  But I feel activists tend to be the most vocal.
*  They tend to be the most aggressive.
*  And so after researchers saw what happened to Mike, I mean, in the book, I talk about
*  the things that they did to him.
*  Some of them were very unethical and really they really tried to ruin him professionally
*  and and his personal reputation as well.
*  And so after that, people said, well, you know, I'm not touching the subject because
*  it's just not worth it.
*  So anyone who has tried to counter trans activists since then also face really serious repercussions.
*  So I think that's been part of it.
*  And I think also with more broadly with this ideology that students are being taught this
*  and they graduate, they go out into the real world, they get jobs.
*  And a lot of people, even five years ago, I would say dismissed a lot of this ideology,
*  especially around gender.
*  They would say, that's only in academia.
*  That is not something that's actually going to affect me in my real life.
*  But here it is now.
*  It affects everybody.
*  There's no way that this is not affecting you.
*  I think it's just a question of how much do you pay attention to it?
*  You know, people send me messages.
*  They tell me about when they have training at work.
*  They tell me about their kids education.
*  I'm like, at the book, I don't just talk about transitioning children.
*  I talk about the idea that gender is not a social construct.
*  It is not a spectrum.
*  I talk about how there is a relation between gender identity and sexual orientation, which
*  you're also supposed to not say, apparently.
*  I talk about sex differences.
*  You know, and these are all things that are considered taboo.
*  And I don't understand why.
*  I don't understand why we can't just have a fact based conversation.
*  We're not saying that this information justifies discrimination against people.
*  In fact, I'm always very clear to say that it doesn't.
*  Well, I think this is one of the reasons why you're so important, because you're obviously
*  a very intelligent, kind person and you're not a hateful person and you're not in any
*  way discriminating.
*  You're looking at this as a scientist and you're looking at this as a person who is
*  very frustrated by the fact that you can't discuss science, particularly when it comes
*  to really critical aspects of people's lives, which is sex and gender.
*  I would love to talk to you about what you just had, though.
*  When you said that there's not a spectrum when it comes to gender, that's a common narrative.
*  So what do you mean by that?
*  Like there's not a spectrum.
*  So there are two genders.
*  For 99% of us, our biological sex is our gender.
*  Biological sex is determined by gametes, which are either eggs or sperm.
*  So there are no intermediate gametes, so gender is either male or female.
*  So this, I do not think invalidates the existence of intersex people or transgender people.
*  I think we can advocate for equal rights for those communities.
*  We don't have to reconceptualize what gender or sex are.
*  And also for intersex people in particular, most of them want to live within the binary.
*  They want to live as either male or female.
*  They don't want gender or sex to be collapsed into a kaleidoscope or a galaxy or whatever
*  else.
*  I mean, this is what's being published in scientific papers now.
*  They refer to gender as quite literally a galaxy.
*  So I mean, it's ridiculous.
*  That's pretty crazy.
*  Not just a spectrum, but a galaxy.
*  250 billion types.
*  Is that what it's like?
*  Like all the stars?
*  That's crazy.
*  When you say there's just two genders, first of all, that's getting enraged people, right?
*  But second of all, you can see that there are very feminine men and very masculine women.
*  And if that is true, what accounts for that?
*  It goes back to the prenatal environment.
*  So I definitely don't deny that they're gender atypical people.
*  I as a woman, I look very feminine, but I'm actually very gender atypical.
*  I've always felt more masculine.
*  And even to this day, I feel much more masculine.
*  Wait a minute.
*  Wait, hold on a second.
*  You feel masculine?
*  Uh huh.
*  Really?
*  That's crazy.
*  You don't even know.
*  Oh my God.
*  You don't even seem remotely masculine.
*  Like what determines that you are masculine?
*  I would say, well, from a young age, I'd always been more like boys.
*  I looked like a boy when I was younger.
*  My friends were always boys and guys.
*  And I've always felt, I've just always felt more like a man.
*  It's like you feel like a man, right?
*  Gender is one of those things in terms of how we describe it is so personal.
*  And that's why I feel it's so important to focus on the evidence because without that,
*  what do you really have?
*  So what it really, what it comes down to is testosterone exposure in the womb.
*  Right.
*  But how are you like a man?
*  If you see, well, how can I say this?
*  It's hard for me to not go in and digging into personal examples, right?
*  But I would just say I've always been more like boys.
*  If you look at how boys behave and how girls behave, I've always been more like the boys.
*  Okay.
*  Like in like your interests and you're into fast cars.
*  I'm into fighting, right?
*  I'm a martial artist.
*  When I was young, especially, I used to always get into fistfights with the boys and I would
*  actually win.
*  But you're, that's hilarious because you seem very feminine to me.
*  That's very odd.
*  People always say that to me.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  So this spectrum that does exist, even though there are two genders in your opinion, a male
*  gender and a female gender.
*  Well, it's not in my opinion.
*  It's not in my opinion.
*  It is.
*  Okay.
*  But that, okay, scientifically, right?
*  There's two genders, but this is obviously a hot button subject, right?
*  Just saying there's two genders will get you canceled.
*  Oh, I know.
*  I know.
*  We can talk about the non-binary movement because I'm actually very concerned in terms
*  of what that movement is about.
*  And I am all for, listen, I'll use whatever pronoun someone wants me to use.
*  I'll be respectful.
*  My issues when people again say that this is backed by science when it isn't.
*  And when we're also not talking about what it's actually about.
*  So for a lot of people who are identifying as non-binary, I think it's coming from a
*  place of sexism in society or homophobia.
*  So a lot of people who identify as non-binary, especially among people who are born male,
*  they will normally come out as gay, as a gay man, and then decide to be non-binary.
*  Or for people who are born female, many of them don't, they feel a lot of discomfort
*  around their bodies, the changes they experience being a woman.
*  They don't like the attention that they're getting.
*  They don't want to be sexualized.
*  For some of them, they have exposure to pornography at a young age and they think that that is
*  actually what sex is going to be like.
*  And they think, I don't want that.
*  So how do I avoid that?
*  If I become something other than a woman, I will not have to experience this.
*  And no one is saying to them, you know, number one, pornography.
*  I'm definitely not anti-porn.
*  You know, I used to write for a very prominent men's magazine.
*  So I have no issue with that.
*  I just think we have to be able to have a conversation saying, you know, if you feel
*  different, that doesn't mean you shouldn't be a woman.
*  Or with regards to pornography, it's entertainment.
*  So that's not what sex is going to be like when you get there.
*  Right.
*  Let's start with the non-binary aspect.
*  Do you think that, I mean, I know people that claim to be non-binary and I'm trying to say
*  this in a nice way.
*  I think some of them, it's a cool thing to say you are.
*  There's a thing today where if you can say you're non-binary, like, oh, like it's part
*  of being woke.
*  You know, it's part of, I mean, not saying that there aren't people who don't feel like
*  they don't fit into either male nor female.
*  Or maybe they feel asexual or maybe they just don't feel like whatever the models that exist
*  in society apply to them.
*  They don't feel like they connect with those models.
*  But the term non-binary, how recent is that?
*  Like, how long has that been around?
*  It's been around for decades.
*  But I would say in terms of the popularity, one study showed that among millennials, about
*  10% identify as a third gender.
*  So this includes, you know, non-binary, gender neutral, agender.
*  So it's really picked up recently.
*  Right.
*  Sorry.
*  I'm sorry.
*  It's good.
*  It's hard to do Skype, right?
*  It's kind of a woke thing.
*  I think it's a way for some people to signal their politics.
*  And I think I get it.
*  I get that feeling of you don't quite feel like maybe you're as if you're born female
*  that you're really feminine or girly.
*  But I think the only way to fight back against those stereotypes is to say, I'm still a
*  woman, right?
*  I don't need to be super girly to be a woman.
*  And similarly, if you're a man, if you're a feminine man, you can still be a man and
*  be a feminine man.
*  There's nothing wrong with that.
*  Right.
*  But that's where people feel like we should be describing it as a spectrum.
*  That's where they feel like if you look at, you know, Jason Momoa versus Andy Dick, okay?
*  Like obviously these are two very different kinds of men.
*  That's where people would apply the concept of a spectrum.
*  Right.
*  But why can we not just say they're both men?
*  I don't understand why just because someone is slightly different that they suddenly need
*  to be categorized as they have to reconceptualize what it means to be a man just because they're
*  different types of men.
*  Yeah, I don't feel like that's very outdated.
*  That's it.
*  It's interesting because I don't know why they do that.
*  I just think that for some people, it gives them comfort to think that they are not exactly
*  the same as other men who are different than them in radical ways, like more masculine
*  or more feminine, and they're more comfortable with this concept of a spectrum.
*  There's clearly a physical spectrum, right?
*  There's a spectrum in terms of body types and ectomorphs and endomorphs and mesomorphs
*  and there's a spectrum in terms of height and size and weight and all these different
*  things.
*  I think a lot of people would like there to be a spectrum in terms of gender.
*  The sense I get from people who identify this way is that there's some sort of discomfort
*  in their birth sex.
*  I think if we could talk about this openly and that's what they still decided, my issue
*  also with this movement is for some people, they go on and they will get surgery.
*  Double mastectomies are very common among people who are born female who identify as
*  non-binary.
*  I'm concerned about that because some of these people are very young when they're deciding
*  to get these surgeries done.
*  If we could have this conversation and if psychologists could do their job and determine
*  is this really the best outcome for you, then that's again their business.
*  We can't have this conversation at all.
*  We're not talking about whether there might be other reasons why someone feels this way
*  and that maybe just opening your mind to other possibilities would actually be helpful.
*  I hear what you're saying.
*  I think we can have this conversation and I think that's why we're having it.
*  You and I, you're very brave to have me on.
*  We are having this conversation but I feel like most people in the general population
*  would be horrified.
*  They'd be scared.
*  I don't think it's most people in the general population.
*  I think it's a small percentage of people that are very angry at these conversations.
*  I think the reason why is because they believe that these conversations equal hate or these
*  kind of conversations equal either homophobia or transphobia.
*  I think the problem is the existence of that at all.
*  If there was no homophobia, if it did not exist, if there was no transphobia, if it
*  didn't exist, if everyone like, I know that you are not those things.
*  You're not homophobic or transphobic, nor am I.
*  I think if we all knew, this is one of the reasons why you and I can have this conversation,
*  we know there's no hate here.
*  If there's no hate, you can talk about it for what it really is.
*  When you have this conversation, the problem with woke culture is that it's automatically
*  assumed that because you question the narrative, that you're doing so from a discriminatory
*  point of view.
*  You're discriminating.
*  You're doing it from some sort of a prejudice.
*  You're doing it with a negative feeling about the subject.
*  I don't think that's accurate.
*  I think most people recognize that it's not accurate.
*  It's a small, very vocal minority of people that object.
*  This is where the problem lies, is that the people that you were referring to as the activists,
*  and it's not even all the activists, it's just the really angry ones are so vocal about
*  it and they go so far out of their way to attack that it's not a subject that you could
*  even breach.
*  Because I just had this podcast the other day, it was only a couple weeks ago with Abigail,
*  and now I'm having it with you.
*  Oh my God, it's going to compound.
*  It's going to be crazy.
*  Listen, you and I had scheduled this.
*  You and I had scheduled this quite a while ago.
*  The Abigail thing came up fairly last minute because she had been on Bridget Phetasy's
*  podcast and no one else wanted to have her on.
*  She has this book about a subject that's very important.
*  As a person who has daughters, this is to me is a very important subject.
*  I also have friends who have daughters and their daughter's friends are doing this.
*  They're going through this whole transition.
*  My friend who has this daughter, he's like, I don't think your friends are trans.
*  I think they're caught up in this whole movement and when there's four or five of them that
*  are deciding that they're trans, it doesn't seem like the numbers match up.
*  It seems like there could be some other influences here.
*  This could be something that seems like a cool thing to do.
*  They're all getting praised at school.
*  This is a real psychological and cultural phenomena.
*  This is not a hateful thing to discuss.
*  And this is why I'm pushing back against it.
*  This is why I think it's so important that people like you who are academics, like people
*  say, well, hey, you want to talk about trans.
*  Why don't you have an expert on?
*  That's what you are.
*  You actually are an expert.
*  Yeah.
*  And the crazy thing is even experts are really scared to talk about this because of what
*  will happen to them if they do.
*  Because I'm not in academia and I'm very fortunate, I'm so, so grateful to the editors who will
*  work with me, people who have me on their show like you.
*  I am free to say what I think.
*  But whereas if you are tied to any sort of academic institution, medical organization,
*  even scientific organizations, you cannot say these things even though they are backed
*  fully by the science.
*  And the thing is, this should not be a partisan issue.
*  So in terms of you're saying that no one was having Abigail on, I'm actually amazed that
*  liberal journalists and liberal outlets, very, very few of them will touch this subject.
*  And it really doesn't matter what your politics are.
*  At the end of the day, it's about what is right for these kids or what's right for anybody
*  who's identifying this way.
*  It's not about being left or right.
*  Well I think I agree with you wholeheartedly.
*  I think the issue is most people that have the kind of reach that maybe my podcast has
*  are part of a large organization.
*  And when you're a part of a large organization, there's just so much politics involved.
*  There's so much, there's so many different influences and there's so many different people
*  that have opinions about this that are based on the current narrative.
*  And that you cannot disagree.
*  You must follow the ideology.
*  And if you don't, you must be hateful.
*  You must be a bigot.
*  There must be something wrong with you.
*  And that's where I'm really very thankful that there's people like you that push back
*  on this that are brave enough to do that.
*  Even with rapid onset gender dysphoria.
*  So I mean, this is documented in research, right?
*  And even still, that's considered a quote unquote myth.
*  People say, like I read about this in the book, people are saying that people who decide
*  to de-transition, they were not really trans or they didn't really have gender dysphoria.
*  Or they just dismissed them.
*  And I'm thinking this movement especially is so much into how you feel and your quote
*  unquote lived experience and being validated for who you are.
*  So how can you say that to a group of people who say this is what I experienced?
*  And the way they're being also ignored by the medical professionals and told that essentially
*  if they change their mind, well, that's your problem.
*  You deal with it now.
*  And the de-transitioners I talk to, I'm really, really aghast at what is happening because
*  they really have nowhere to turn.
*  It's also the options if you want to transition in terms of what's available today in 2020.
*  I'm trying to say this gently.
*  They're very surgically crude.
*  Like you have to, there has to be cutting involved.
*  There has to be anesthesia.
*  There's a lot going on.
*  I can't wait for the day where, whether it's through CRISPR or some other form of genetic
*  manipulation, you really can become a woman.
*  You really can become a biological man or a biological woman where we can, we have a
*  grasp of the biology to the point where science can actually alter the person's chromosomes,
*  alter who they are.
*  I mean, that's going to be fantastic.
*  I think that's going to eliminate so much and so many problems.
*  But I mean, you know, what are we, hundreds of years away from that?
*  I mean, I don't know.
*  But for now, my fear is what you have said previously.
*  And you said earlier on this podcast that you're going to see a wave of lawsuits.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's going to be really, really sad.
*  And I think these children will be saying, why did my parents allow me to do this?
*  Why did medical professionals not question me, not stop and think about this?
*  I mean, children say all kinds of things.
*  And it's really scary to me that adults are taking the things that they say at face value.
*  Yeah.
*  When Abigail told me that in some places you can self-diagnose as being trans
*  at as young as 15.
*  And you can go to certain.
*  Yeah, you can get because medical consent, it depends on the age of medical consent.
*  So if in some places like I believe Oregon, it's like 15.
*  Yeah.
*  So you can go without parental consent.
*  And even still, a lot of cases, these interventions are started even younger.
*  If the parents, the parents will sign off on it.
*  I've heard of girls, people born female as young as age 12 getting double mastectomies.
*  Wow.
*  Wow.
*  The thing that drove me crazy is the fact that you don't even have to have any
*  counseling, anything.
*  You self-diagnose and they'll give you testosterone.
*  I mean, that seems insane.
*  That seems like there's some sort of an agenda.
*  I mean, whether it's just woke ideology or whatever it is that would allow a doctor to
*  think that's a good idea.
*  I just, I don't understand what kind of a lack of understanding of young people.
*  I mean, you're not even fully formed.
*  Your frontal lobe isn't even fully formed.
*  And you're making these radical decisions at 15 years of age.
*  With testosterone too.
*  So I want to, I spoke with Buck Angel.
*  I interviewed him for the book.
*  He was amazing.
*  And he actually has a website.
*  I want to make sure I get it right.
*  Actually, I should have, I think it's ftmhealth.com.
*  He has information because he was saying to me how transgender care and health really
*  needs to be improved.
*  And a lot of medical professionals will prescribe testosterone and they do not fully
*  understand.
*  One of the side effects is uterine cramping and atrophy.
*  So for these individuals, when they start taking it, they start, they'll be cramping.
*  They'll be in a lot of pain.
*  They'll be bleeding and they don't know why.
*  And it's due to the low estrogen.
*  Well, I've had Buck Angel on the podcast before.
*  I love that dude.
*  And that's a perfect example of, you know, that's a trans man who is like clearly that's
*  way better for him than to be a female.
*  I mean, he's happy.
*  It's like when you're around him, like, oh, that makes sense.
*  Like you're a man.
*  And, you know, we even had a conversation on the podcast.
*  Would you refer?
*  He asked me, would you refer to me as a man?
*  I'm like, yeah, of course I would.
*  Like you're a man.
*  Like, yes, you're not born a man biologically.
*  Doesn't mean I don't think you're a man.
*  I mean, covered in tattoos and he's jacked.
*  Looks like a dude.
*  Seems like a dude talks like a dude.
*  I mean, I'm super comfortable with that.
*  I'm not a bigot, but I am confused.
*  I'm confused by this narrative and the fact that everyone is being really bullied into
*  adhering to it.
*  I don't understand the motivation for a lack of nuance and discussion.
*  That's what drives me crazy.
*  And for some reason, people think that if you are not personally trans, this should
*  not be a subject that you cover.
*  And I'm like, listen, I'm a parent.
*  I see what this is.
*  Children are so easily influenced and by so many different factors.
*  Whether it's culturally or socially or locally, whatever environment they're in, you can't
*  tell me that nothing is happening to these kids that is changing and affecting the way
*  they perceive things, which is fine for the most part.
*  But when it comes to radical life altering decisions, like changing your gender at 12
*  years old, like, fuck, are you sure?
*  Are you sure this is the right move?
*  And why can't I talk about this?
*  Why is this so goddamn taboo?
*  And the reason why it's so taboo is because they want to bully you into not talking about
*  it because when you do talk about it, it's exposed that it's not rock solid, that it
*  is strange and that there is a problem.
*  There are really trans people.
*  No one's in denial of that.
*  You're not in denial.
*  I'm not in denial.
*  I'm 100% comfortable with I want adults to be able to do whatever they want.
*  But we're not talking about adults.
*  You're talking about babies.
*  You're talking about children.
*  And that's when things get very, very strange to me.
*  I just don't understand how many people are adhering to this.
*  And I think they're doing it out of cowardice.
*  I think they're doing it out of fear of repercussions of these discussions.
*  Even if you are clear in your intentions and you're not hateful.
*  And you have no there's no bigotry in your heart.
*  It doesn't matter.
*  They don't want you talking about it because they have a very specific narrative and they
*  don't want anyone to stray from that.
*  And if you do stray from that, they'll attack you.
*  And I get it.
*  I get some of the concerns in that.
*  Yes, this information could potentially be used to hold trans people back.
*  Some people could take this information and say, okay, well, this means that no one should
*  be allowed to transition ever.
*  But I think we have to be realistic about it.
*  If you hide this information, what it does then for people who are not in favor of trans,
*  right?
*  It's they're going to find it and say, see, this is why this is why they hide this information
*  because it feeds into whatever negative ideas they have about the community.
*  I'm totally open.
*  I'll put it out there.
*  I'm totally happy to talk to anyone from the community who would like to speak with me.
*  I would love to build bridges and build understanding.
*  I just feel like there's a lot of animosity and a lot of mistrust.
*  And I understand where that's coming from.
*  But at the same time, I don't know how else to solve this issue.
*  Scientists also can't even do this research now because people get upset and say, if you
*  are not from this community, you should not be doing this research.
*  And the whole purpose of the scientific method is to parse out any confounding factors.
*  So it really should not matter what your identity is.
*  If you're doing a study properly and rigorously, the findings that you find are as close of an
*  approximation of the truth as you can get.
*  So it doesn't matter if you're part of the group you're studying or not.
*  I understand, again, fears.
*  I think some of the concern is that scientists have an agenda and they're doing this research
*  as a way to invalidate trans people or something like that.
*  But I think you have to have faith that that's not, especially in this climate, there's no way
*  someone can get away with doing anything like that now.
*  And in fact, legitimate studies are being pulled now just because they do not fit the
*  narrative that activists want.
*  Yeah, it's a very strange time and I don't know where we go from here.
*  I mean, I never thought we would be here in a place where there were these taboo subjects
*  that are critical to the development and the growth of human beings.
*  And you can't discuss them.
*  I mean, and how do we get past this?
*  I don't see a path out.
*  I don't see a map of the territory that makes sense to me.
*  I think what's going to happen, unfortunately, is that more of these children will be
*  detransitioning and changing their minds to the point where society is not going to
*  be able to ignore it.
*  That's what I see coming.
*  So let's talk numbers.
*  So what I was saying that Abigail had said was that there's some astounding number of
*  kids that have experienced rapid onset gender dysphoria within the last 10 years.
*  What exactly are the numbers again?
*  So within one study in particular of the individuals who were surveyed, the children,
*  40% of them had a friend group that had at least half of them identifying as transgender.
*  And so this worked out to be 70 times what you would see in the general population.
*  And I don't know how you can look at that and not think something is going on here.
*  There's something else going on here.
*  It can't just be social acceptance because if it were, why is it we don't see this also
*  happening in boys?
*  Why do we not see this happening across different ages?
*  It's very specific to adolescent girls and young women.
*  Now you're a woman and you're a woman who in many ways you say you identify as being more
*  masculine.
*  What do you think it is about growing up as a woman?
*  And maybe you could speak to this because you did grow up and felt more masculine.
*  What do you think it is that makes women more vulnerable to this?
*  I think so.
*  I have been critical of feminist orthodoxy and I'll call things as I see it, but I do
*  think on some level sexism does still exist in society.
*  I don't think it's so terrible that women can't pursue what they want to achieve in life.
*  But I think for young women, especially when they encounter situations like this
*  or they experience certain things they don't like because they are female,
*  if they have the option of opting out of that, why wouldn't you?
*  I feel like I almost can't blame them because there are certain things that women have to
*  deal with that men don't have to deal with.
*  And vice versa, I think there are certain things that boys and men have to deal with
*  growing up that women don't have to deal with.
*  But I think it's because this is so socially acceptable now and they're also, like you
*  said, they're praised when they decide that they want to come out as a man or they want
*  to identify as a third gender or they don't want to be female.
*  And I'm actually really appalled because I think especially in this time where we are
*  very much in favour of female rights and gender equality, why are we not saying, again,
*  it's okay to be a woman and it's okay to feel this way and let's support you in that
*  instead of abandoning ship?
*  Do you think this is a phase that culture is going through?
*  With this particular population or you think more broadly?
*  The leap in rapid onset gender dysphoria.
*  Do you think that in many ways it might actually be connected to transphobia
*  in that because there is transphobia, people are actively trying to combat it.
*  So they're praising people who are trans, which might encourage people who are socially awkward
*  to think they are because they get encouraged for that.
*  And then maybe when we reach a point where there no longer is this problem in our culture
*  and trans people are accepted just like people with blue eyes and brown eyes and whatever,
*  no one cares anymore.
*  Is that what it's going to take for things to balance out for us to actually find out?
*  And is there a spectrum when it comes to trans people?
*  Are there people that are mildly trans, just like there's people that are mildly masculine
*  or people that are very feminine but also a man?
*  Okay, well, let me start with the first part of your question was why do people go along with this?
*  I think the part of it might be because it's more socially acceptable, right?
*  And people don't want to rock the boat.
*  I think other people, they mean well and they think that this is going to help the community
*  and to tell people who counter this narrative that they're hateful or whatever,
*  that this is going to somehow bring about positive change.
*  I missed the second part of your question.
*  I forgot it already.
*  But then if being trans is a spectrum, I don't know because I'm not trans,
*  so I don't want to speak for trans people, but I think there are some people for whom
*  transitioning is the right choice.
*  And I think for some people, maybe they will be able to grow comfortable, right?
*  And we can't talk about that.
*  That's seen as transphobic.
*  And also this whole conversation about conversion therapy,
*  when there is no such thing as conversion therapy for gender identity.
*  There's conversion therapy for sexual orientation,
*  which I don't support because it's unethical and doesn't work.
*  But if a clinician sits down with a child who says that they want to be the opposite sex
*  or they're gender dysphoric and they ask them what else is going on in your life
*  to better understand that, that's called conversion therapy now.
*  And now that's being banned.
*  I think that's been banned in something like 20 states.
*  So now clinicians, again, can't do their job.
*  That's a critical part of figuring out who's going to benefit from transitioning.
*  Pete Slauson So, conversion therapy, when we think about it,
*  we usually think about it in terms of gay people, right?
*  Like pray the gay away, that kind of shit.
*  Right. That doesn't work.
*  Pete Slauson Of course.
*  Yeah. Well, it's usually run by gay guys too.
*  There's usually religion involved, right?
*  But conversion therapy in terms of children, like what does that entail?
*  Nicole Boucher You mean in terms of children with gender dysphoria?
*  Pete Slauson Yes.
*  Nicole Boucher Well, okay. So, activists,
*  and now this is being written into law, it's called conversion therapy because it sounds scary.
*  It's not the same thing as conversion therapy for sexual orientation because, again,
*  sexual orientation is biological, so it can't be changed.
*  But for gender, for young children especially who say they feel like they're the opposite sex,
*  gender is that can change over time, as we see in the research that they will outgrow those feelings.
*  Pete Slauson So.
*  Nicole Boucher So, it's not appropriate to call that conversion therapy because
*  that's a natural process that would have happened on its own.
*  So, for a clinician to sit down and just try to understand that,
*  it should not be seen as somehow harmful, right? But it is seen as harmful. It's seen as abusive.
*  Pete Slauson So, if some sort of a psychologist sits down
*  with a child and asks them what's going on in your life, how do you feel, that's considered
*  conversion therapy? So, are they supposed to just, on this subject only, automatically go along with
*  everything that the child says? Whereas you wouldn't do it with any other issue that the
*  child had that required therapy. Nicole Boucher
*  No, exactly. But that is what's happening. There's no differential diagnosis because
*  someone might present with, say, gender dysphoria, but there's a whole bunch of reasons why they might
*  feel that way. You know, last time I spoke to you, we talked about how autism can play a big role
*  in that sometimes people with autism, and I do think people with autism deserve love and respect,
*  but sometimes one of the symptoms is fixating and having particular interests. And so, for these
*  children especially, they might go through phases of being really into a certain toy or really into
*  something else or another hobby, and then gender might also be one of these things. And my colleagues
*  or clinicians have noticed that, that for some of these kids, they fixate on gender for a bit and
*  then they move on to something else. Pete Slauson
*  What was your motivation for writing this book? Like, what got you to actually sit down in front
*  of the computer and start banging on the keys? Nicole Boucher
*  All the questions that people have been asking me over the years about these subjects and the
*  fact that I see so much misinformation being ingrained in our society, it's not even being
*  questioned now. So, say something like gender is a social construct. In 2017, James D'Amour wrote
*  his Google memo, his infamous Google memo. I wrote a column for the Goldman Mail defending it, and
*  since then, it's just been, it's just gotten worse. I see that reported everywhere. Gender is a social
*  construct, and then there's no quantitative evidence. There's no citations, nothing to back
*  it up. People will just say that and then they'll go on to whatever else they were saying. And this
*  will be in scientific papers sometimes. This will be in journalism. And I'm thinking, that's not
*  factually accurate. So, for me, it's this feeling that I get, I think, for some people who deny this
*  science, particularly around gender, it's coming from possibly good intentions that they think this
*  is what we need to do to help move society forward. But I see there being a lot of negative
*  repercussions as a result of that. Because when you try to hide the truth, you try to suppress
*  reality, it doesn't go away. And I think we can both agree that a lot of this narrative comes from
*  this desire to avoid the criticism, desire to avoid the angry mob.
*  Yeah, I think so. So when you say- Who wants to deal with that?
*  Who wants to deal with that?
*  No, no one does. So when you say, gender is a social construct, people go, thank you. And then
*  they're like, good, you've complied. You've complied with the narrative. And that's what it is. Instead
*  of going, well, what do you mean by that? What do I mean by that? What are you, a bigot? And then all
*  of a sudden it's chaos, right? And then people are angry. Gender as a social construct is a weird
*  thing to say. And I've had weird conversations with people about it, where they deny the difference
*  between male and female. And I'm like, okay, well, if you buy a puppy, and it's a boy puppy or a girl
*  puppy, and you wanted a boy puppy, but it's a girl puppy, do you complain? Like, what happens there?
*  Do you say gender is a social construct? No, man, that's a girl puppy, bro. I mean, it is what it is,
*  but it's not with human beings. With human beings, we've decided that we are so complex,
*  we're so weird, that all the rules of standard biology that apply to all the other species on
*  planet Earth do not apply to us. Yeah. And what's also frustrating is that people will then say,
*  oh, the newest science shows that this is true. And I'm thinking, what science are you talking
*  about? Right? But people will usually at that point say, okay, well, I guess the newest science
*  shows that. So what can you say? So in the book, that's the thing. I provide citations to all the
*  science so you can read it and make up your own mind. And if people are telling you something to
*  the contrary, you can say, well, go look at this science. Yeah, that is a lovely one that people
*  love to say, the newest science. You can't just say that, but you can. With a lot of people,
*  you can. And they go, oh, I didn't know. I didn't know about that new science. Science is just data.
*  Science is repeating things and proving that they're repeatable, showing patterns,
*  showing information. You can't say the newest science without citing it.
*  No. And one of my close friends is Josh Barnett. And through the process of writing this book,
*  I would say to him, I feel like I'm standing outside and pointing at the sky and saying,
*  the sky is blue. And people are getting mad at me for saying that the sky is blue. That's what it
*  feels like. And that's what it's going to be like, I think, when people start reading this book. And
*  I ask anyone who, because the things I say are misconstrued all the time. People either, I think,
*  are misrepresenting what I say. There are certain things that people say I say that I would never
*  say. And I just ask that your audience actually read the book before making a decision about
*  where I stand on these issues. Because I think a lot of the time people, especially activists or
*  people who are really invested in this, the way things are going in our culture, they will go to
*  any lengths to push that agenda. And I'm thinking, if you really care about these populations that
*  you claim to care about, why would you not actually be going after the people who are actually hateful,
*  who are actually saying the things that you claim I say? And I think what a lot of it is,
*  is about clout. It's not actually about making positive change.
*  06 Yeah, anybody who thinks gender is a social construct needs to meet Josh Barnett. That's a
*  man. Okay. There's no argument there. 06 He identifies as one right now.
*  06 He definitely does. Yeah, this, I mean, I think we're living in a very confusing time. And I think
*  what all the reasons that we discussed earlier, in terms of the blowback that people get,
*  and in terms of when you're compliant, the support that you get is all influencing the
*  way people behave and this willingness to go along with that narrative because you're terrified of
*  being criticized, you're terrified of being attacked. That's where we find ourselves. And
*  this is not the left that I know. This is what's so strange. I mean, I guess I'm old. I mean,
*  I'm 52. When I was young, the left was tolerant, open-minded, and absolutely committed to freedom
*  of speech. That doesn't seem to be where we're at now. We've gotten into some really radical place
*  where the left is now, they've almost weaponized a lot of left-wing ideological values to combat
*  right-wing values. It's like they've gotten more loony to deal with loony people on the right and
*  don't even realize they've become their own enemy. They've become something that the left was never—
*  the left was always, when I was a young person, was always the most tolerant of the groups. And
*  it just doesn't seem to be the case now. It seems to be that they're only tolerant if you follow the
*  ideology that they follow. And if you don't, there's no discussion about it. You're a hateful
*  person and there's this immediate hot take. You hate, you do this, it's bigotry. There's
*  no room for discussion, information, no room for actual science, no room for understanding the
*  nuance of psychology and of human beings. Yeah, and I don't think it's helpful because,
*  yeah, I think the far right is a concern, but the response to that or the solution to that is not to
*  double down and go completely in the opposite direction where you're just as insane. Because
*  I think most liberals, most liberals don't feel like the far left really encompasses anything that
*  they stand for. And it's in fact alienating them from these issues. Yeah, I would agree with that
*  entirely. There's so many of us that are on the left that are so confused now. I feel like
*  we're people without countries. Like, this is not— you know what I mean? It's like, well, who am I
*  now? Because I'm not these people that want to defund the police and light the federal buildings
*  on fire. So what am I? You know, that's— you have to be— you have to be that to be left.
*  Have you had any conversations with people, trans activists or any people that opposed you or angry
*  at you, or you were able to sway them? I had one conversation. I wrote in the book, actually, there
*  was one activist who was willing to sit down with me and I interviewed her. And I was really grateful
*  for that. She was lovely. She was very civil with me. We disagreed about basically everything. But
*  I found it was a helpful conversation because I do think about— I think about the feedback. You
*  know, I try to follow what people angrily tweet at me and, you know, comment on my work and things
*  like that. Because I do think it's important to be open to other perspectives. I don't know that I'm
*  able to change anyone's mind, but that's okay. You know, I think the evidence speaks for itself. And
*  I think if people want to listen to that, that's their business. And if not, that's fine, too. But
*  I do find, like I said, people who aren't sure, they haven't made their mind up yet, seem to
*  be a little bit more— they appreciate the information, you know, whether or not they
*  agree with me or not. I think they're just grateful to that. Okay, there's someone out there who is
*  offering some information that's not being covered for whatever reason.
*  Now, when you sat down with this trans activist or this person and she disagreed with you on all
*  these things, what were they specifically that she disagreed on?
*  Well, with the pediatric transition, that's one big point. Also, things like the discussion of
*  trans women and whether trans women should be considered women full stop. And I do consider
*  trans women to be women, but I also think there are some differences and I don't think it should
*  be considered hateful to point them out. I will, again, use the pronoun someone wants me to use.
*  And there's no issue there. But in some context, it's very important that we are able to talk about
*  this because, like with fighting, there are serious implications if someone who is a trans woman
*  fights someone who is born female or something like prisons. I used to work with sex offenders,
*  both clinically and in a research capacity. And sex offenders cannot be taken at face value. If
*  they say they identify as female and they get put into a female prison, I mean,
*  how does anyone who works in forensics think that's a good idea? If you spend any time with
*  sex offenders, you know that you cannot base any decision on what they tell you.
*  Yeah, that's a very extreme example. What was her response to that?
*  Well, basically that's not reflective of everyone. And I get that. It's true.
*  That's true.
*  It's true. And I think there could potentially be cases where there are people, sex offenders,
*  who have gender dysphoria. And so, yes, their concerns should be taken into account. But
*  I feel like we've gone so far in one direction. Like you're saying, you can't even have this
*  conversation or that certain topics are taken off the table without any discussion because of the
*  fear that there's going to be some sort of backlash or people are going to think that
*  you're a bad person for even considering it.
*  And what about you said that you guys disagreed about infants?
*  Oh, with the children transitioning. Yeah.
*  What was her position?
*  I feel that's one subject that it's really... Sometimes with activists, you really can't make
*  any progress in that. It's just that we come to a standstill. And in the book, I do list a number
*  of criticisms that activists and certain groups have pointed out with regard to why early in
*  transitioning is better. There was one study that last year that got a lot of attention, say,
*  with brain imaging, saying that the brains of these children are more like the opposite sex.
*  And so this supports the idea that they should transition at a young age. But the thing is,
*  so for people who are trans, their brains do tend to be shifted in the direction of the sex they
*  identify as when you use brain imaging techniques. But the thing is, for all of these studies,
*  their sexual orientation is gay. So in sexology, which is the scientific study of sex and gender,
*  when we look at sexual orientation in the context of trans people, it's based on their birth sex.
*  So say a trans woman, she was born male, identifies as female. So if she's attracted to men,
*  that's considered gay because her partner would share her birth sex. So for all of these studies,
*  on trans people, they're conflated with sexual orientation because everyone in the study is also
*  gay. So we don't know if the brain differences we're seeing are due to them identifying as the
*  opposite sex or due to them being gay. So with this study with the children, they did not
*  report the sexual orientation. So we can't know because most kids who, a lot of kids who are
*  gender atypical, right, and who are gender dysphoric again, there's a correlation there
*  with being gay when they're older. So I don't know why that wasn't even pointed out because
*  that study got so much information, so much coverage, and anyone who knows anything about
*  sex research knows that. How do you account for the seemingly large number of men who transition
*  to become women who become lesbians? That's a very good question. And I'm not sure if you read that
*  part of the book. No, I didn't. Okay, so it's very, very controversial. And before I say anything
*  about this, I want to really make clear, I do not want this information to be used to hold back
*  trans people. I don't want this to be used to support negative stereotypes about trans women
*  in particular. But for some trans women, their desire to transition stems from sexual arousal
*  and the idea that becoming a woman is actually sexually arousing.
*  Really?
*  Yeah. And I chose to write about this because, again, I have so many people who reach out to me
*  saying that they experience this and they don't know what it is. And it's called autogynephilia,
*  which it translates, that's a Greek word to say love of oneself as a woman. And it's a paraphilia,
*  which is an unusual sexual preference. And paraphilias were my research expertise when I
*  was in academia. So I wrote about this and no one has really talked about this in the mainstream.
*  And because I want people who feel this way to be able to understand themselves and to know there's
*  a whole bunch of information out there for you. If you Google this, everything that comes out is
*  that this is not a real phenomenon. This is made up by hateful sex researchers to invalidate
*  trans people. This is quote unquote outdated medical research. This is pseudoscience. It's
*  not. Everyone in the field knows it's real, including clinicians who work with patients
*  with gender dysphoria, including people who work with adults with gender dysphoria. Just
*  no one will say it because they are absolutely terrified.
*  So when this is where it's confusing to me, because if you do transition, if you're a male
*  and you transition to female, if you are aroused by the idea of being a female and you're aroused
*  by women, so you want to become a lesbian essentially. But if you transition surgically,
*  you're going to remove your ability to have an orgasm. You're going to remove your ability to
*  even be aroused as a male would be. Not necessarily. Some people are able to
*  maintain their sexual functioning after surgery, but not everyone necessarily has bottom surgery
*  also. Some people might just choose to have top surgery or might choose to
*  undergo hormonal interventions. Okay. Okay. So we're talking about very different things,
*  right? So when, so there's, would you agree there's a spectrum in regards to trans people?
*  So there's trans people that are fully transitioned to look and appear 100% female, even naked,
*  versus someone who is trans, not denying that they're trans, but they still have a penis,
*  a functioning penis. I think there are differences in terms of outcome. Yeah. In terms of what's
*  beneficial for people. That's what I would say. But I know of at least one, no, I know of two
*  that became lesbians and did have bottom surgery. So if that was the thing that,
*  if that was what excited them, this idea of being a woman, like sexually excited them,
*  once you transition and have bottom surgery, am I right in saying that you can't have orgasms?
*  No, some people are still able to have orgasms after. How are they doing that?
*  Well, because the tissue is inverted. So it's not like you can still maintain some of the sensation.
*  But they don't have testicles anymore, right? No, but they're still, they still have the nerve
*  endings. So they still have the feeling of ejaculation. Well, no, no. So, but that's a
*  male orgasm, right? So they have a female. It can still feel pleasurable though. Right. It feels
*  good, but they don't orgasm. Because you can not say that to a woman. You can not say, oh, you
*  orgasmed. It felt good, right? Well, you did. You orgasmed. They would get mad at you, right? They
*  would say, no, I didn't orgasm. Right? I have not undergone the surgery. So I can't speak from
*  experience, but I have heard people say that they are able to maintain orgasm after. Do you believe
*  them? I do. I do. I think I don't know what that means though. Like there's, isn't there a specific
*  physiological action that happens when a female has an orgasm?
*  Right. With a female, usually it's clitoral. Right. It can be, it can be,
*  I can't think of the word now. Internal. G-spot. Yes. Yeah. It can be G-spot.
*  Is that replicable with males? Is that like, I mean, I don't know if there's any science on this.
*  I'm just going to say, is that scientifically proven, but is there any science on whether or
*  not, I mean, I don't know why I'm fixated on trans orgasms. I'm not really, I just, I just try to
*  get to the bottom of this. Is there, has, has it been proven that it's possible to have an orgasm
*  even when you're- I would, I would say that there's, sorry to cut you off. I would say there's
*  definitely a risk of losing it, of losing that sensation and losing sexual function. So that's
*  also why I think it's important to be able to talk about this because for people who experience
*  these feelings, maybe, you know, transitioning may or may not be right for them. I do think some
*  people with autogynephilia, yes, transitioning can help them. I don't think autogynephilia is
*  a reason to stop someone from transitioning, but if there's someone who can feel that way and not
*  transition, as you mentioned, they will maintain, you know, full sexual functioning. So that's
*  something that, that should be taken into account. And again, I'm sorry, this define once again,
*  autogynephilia? Autogynephilia. So it's auto as in self, gyna is woman and philia is love.
*  It's the work of Ray Blanchard, if anyone is curious to look it up. But what is it? But there
*  will be, there'll be so much pushback when you do though, just be aware that a lot of it is,
*  a lot of the information, mainstream information is going to say it doesn't exist.
*  How difficult is it to do research on this subject today? Impossible. No, it's not,
*  it's not absolutely impossible. It's very, very, very difficult. And I can probably count on
*  maybe a few fingers the number of people I know who are doing it and are not ideological and are
*  ethical as scientists and have no agenda and have no, they're not trying to push any particular
*  findings. They're just doing the research as a good scientist would to see what they find.
*  And these people that are doing this, are they primarily in the United States? Are they,
*  are there other countries that have different perspectives on this? Were they're more open
*  to this kind of research and just, just purely from a scientific standpoint,
*  trying to get an understanding of what's actually happening?
*  Most are in North America. It really just depends, I think, also on where you're able to get funding.
*  So that's one of the key issues, right? In terms of the research you do, if you can't get your study
*  funded, then you can't, you can't do anything. So we're very lucky in Canada, I would say we have a
*  really good, my colleagues have been able to get funding quite readily here, but it's more the
*  political climate, I think, that is really turning people away from studying subjects that would be
*  of interest and that I think are very important. What do you attribute when you see a culture like
*  Thailand, for instance, that has a large number of like ladyboys? What, what do you think causes
*  that? Is that an attitude difference? Is it a cultural difference? Is it a biological difference?
*  Or is it just a myth that there are a larger percentage of transsexuals in certain places?
*  If there is a larger percentage of people who are, I mean, they're known for it.
*  Transition, right. I would think it could be culturally determined in some ways too,
*  because there are some cultures where being a feminine, someone who's born male, who's very
*  feminine, may be encouraged to transition because it's more acceptable to be a
*  feminine woman. And I do think for, if we go back to the children, I do think for some of the parents
*  who are in support of allowing their child to transition, I think it is coming from homophobia,
*  because their sense is that if they have a very feminine son over a masculine daughter, I think
*  more so for the feminine sons, if they don't want a gay son, well, if this child transitions to female,
*  then she will appear to be a straight woman when she's attracted to men when she gets older.
*  That was, I had a conversation with someone where they were praising Iran and they were saying Iran
*  is less homophobic or excuse me, less transphobic than the United States. And they were talking
*  about how many people transition over there. And I was like, do you know why? It's because they
*  literally can be thrown in jail if they're gay men. I mean, this is why they're, one of the reasons
*  why in some Middle Eastern countries they transition is because there's actually laws
*  against homosexuality. So for homosexual men, they're left with a couple options, the possibility
*  of being thrown in jail or sexually transitioning. And so what did this person say when you
*  brought that up? Stammered. There's nowhere to go with it. I mean, sometimes people like to say
*  things because they have a thought in their head that they think, you know, they haven't really
*  fleshed it out. And they're like, well, this is, look, look at this. Well, you know, some places
*  in the Middle East are very open-minded. And I was like, that's not open-minded. Like they're
*  homophobic. They want these people to appear to be women. And it's just, you know, it's very
*  unfortunate. I think there are trans people and I think there are homosexual people and they're
*  different. And I think the only way we're going to find out who's who and what's what,
*  and let people make a real honest, balanced choice is to have no bigotry. And that includes
*  bigotry of information. That includes keeping people from discussing and exploring subjects
*  without hate, which is what you're doing. And this is why it's so crazy that people are attacking you
*  and they go after your work because I think in many ways people that are on the fence about this
*  stuff, it throws them to the wrong side. It makes people possibly transphobic that might not be
*  because they read them like these people are fucking crazy. I'm not for them. Oh no, those trans
*  people are all crazy. And they'll start saying things like that because they'll see some of
*  the reactions to your work that they know are inaccurate, that they know are radically biased.
*  Yeah, I've had some trans people reach out to me saying that the things that some of these activists
*  stand for are not things that they would have ever asked for. And they say that they're actually
*  quite mortified that these are the things that some people, not even trans activists, I think some
*  allies even, some people who are not transgender who decide to take it upon themselves to speak for
*  the community because they think that's, I guess, the right thing to do. And actual trans people
*  are saying that you don't speak for us. We don't want these things that you are saying.
*  It's about power, I think. It's about power and control. And it's not even about the people that
*  they claim to be protecting. Well, I think it's also about conformity. There's a thing that people
*  do when they are something, whether they're a right-wing Trump supporter, they want everybody
*  to be a right-wing Trump supporter. And they want to argue that position. And I think people do that
*  with everything. I think they do it with being a vegetarian or a vegan. I think they do it with
*  being a yogi. I think they just love other people doing exactly what they're doing.
*  And I think, unfortunately, that is also the case when it comes to some trans activists. They want
*  more trans people out there. Right. And I can see that logic because by inflating the number of
*  people who identify this way. And so also with the trans umbrella, it's now widened to also include
*  third genders or anyone who is even gender non-conforming. So I think part of this is
*  driven by the desire to inflate numbers so that that can, in their mind, justify acceptance. But
*  I don't see why we can't just say, yes, we should accept everyone. We don't have to call people
*  trans. We don't have to widen the definition of what it means to be trans. And even within
*  the community, you have people who are trans, who have transitioned, who have medically transitioned,
*  who are saying people who identify as a third gender or who are mildly gender non-conforming,
*  they're not the same as me. And it's not appropriate to say we're the same. And again,
*  from my perspective, if someone is struggling with their feelings around gender, it's not helpful to
*  lump them all as one because again, they're coming from different root causes. So if you can't talk
*  about what the root cause is, you're not going to help someone. Yeah, I would agree. And I think
*  that one of the things we might be encountering here is that the acceptance of this is fairly
*  novel. And the new perception of trans people, this new acceptance of it is we're working it out.
*  And I think in the process of working it out, you've got a lot of virtue signaling, you've got a lot
*  of people that are conforming and they're not exactly sure what they're conforming to. And
*  we're trying to figure out how to determine what's natural, what's not, what's right, what's wrong,
*  what's healthy for people, what's not, what's hateful, what's not hateful. There's just so much
*  confusion. And in the middle of this chaos, it's very difficult to sort it out.
*  Yeah. And I think also when you're saying with what's natural, I think some people,
*  part of the push with the children is to say, look, if kids are feeling this way,
*  and society accepts us in children, then again, this is something that people can't argue against,
*  right? I think it's part of a larger goal to facilitate acceptance for adults as well.
*  And again, there's no reason why we can't do that. We don't have to tokenize these children
*  as a way to do that. What is the argument for doing it with children? Is the argument that
*  the earlier they transition, the quicker they'll be happy, the more time they'll spend in the gender
*  that they belong to rather than the gender of their birth? Right. And also that if they block
*  puberty, that they will not go through these physiological changes that are going to make it
*  more difficult for them to identify as the opposite sex. Yeah. This is a really, one of
*  the things that was disturbing to me that didn't make any goddamn sense was people saying that
*  you can block their hormones and then if they change their mind, it's easily reversible.
*  And I'm like, you don't understand human development. That's crazy to say that.
*  Now, recently that's been disavowed. Recently there was, I forget what scientific body came out.
*  I think it's the NHS in the UK.
*  Yes. And I think you're right. And they said, no, we'll actually know when you, there's radical
*  changes to the body that are irreversible when you block hormones at a very young age. I had this
*  conversation with someone on the podcast just a year or so ago where they were saying, if the
*  child changes their opinion, you could always reverse. And I'm like, what are you talking about?
*  If you're introducing estrogen to a six-year-old and you're telling me when they're 14,
*  it's going to be the same as if they didn't introduce estrogen and they didn't block their
*  hormones. That's crazy talk, but that shows to me where people's minds are when it comes to this.
*  They want something to be true and they argue it as if it's true. And then it goes along with this
*  whole conformity thing where everybody has to conform to show that they are on the right side
*  of this ideology and that if you don't, you'll be attacked. Well, the thing is too, this is what is
*  being promoted in the mainstream in terms of anything to do with trans issues. This is what
*  you see is that these blockers are perfectly, we don't have the data. We don't know what the
*  long-term effects are. And what I want to know is why the parents are not being told this, right?
*  That those changes were made. Were the parents who have signed off on this treatment, were they made
*  aware of the fact that these guidelines have been changed? These are things that people in the field
*  have been very critical of, but this has not been discussed more widely. So now that this has been
*  changed publicly, do all the parents who have signed on for this treatment know that? I don't
*  think any of them do because no one reported on it. And what are the repercussions? Two outlets
*  reported on it, I should say. Right. And it was very silent in a lot of ways. It was just, they
*  put it out there and that's it. But what are the repercussions and what do these parents do when
*  they find this out? And they find out that these blockers they're giving their children,
*  unlike what they've been told, they aren't reversible.
*  What are they going to do? I have a number of parents who I've met over the years who asked me
*  what they think about it. That entire chapter I wrote, chapter five, was all the advice I wish I
*  could tell them face to face. But it's very difficult when a parent is asking you this and
*  you don't feel like it's, I don't feel it's my place to tell them what I think about their
*  parenting decisions. But you can see the pain in their eyes. This is very difficult. And I think
*  for a lot of them, they were told if they don't allow their child to transition, that child is
*  going to commit suicide. And that's not true. So that's another thing that's being promoted very
*  widely, the belief that if these children do not transition, they are at a high risk of suicide.
*  And I don't fault these parents for going along with it. Because if you, I mean,
*  you're a parent, Joe, if someone said that to you, I think you would similarly feel
*  like you don't have a choice. Yes. We're spending a lot of time talking about the negative aspects
*  of transitioning. Even if it's just transitioning as children, or rapid onset gender dysphoria that
*  occurs in teenage girls, particularly with autism. But let's, let's try to be positive about this.
*  Let's let's look at the positive aspect. And I wanted to know, did you cover that at all?
*  For what, what are the the what are the characteristics or what groups of people
*  find that this actually does work out well for them, even at a young age? I mean, and how would
*  a young person absolutely and definitively know or is it just completely personal,
*  whether or not they are in the wrong gender? And what are the benefits of transitioning early?
*  There was one meta analysis, I believe it was of 27 studies that did show for
*  people who have transitioned that they do experience a lessening of feelings of gender
*  dysphoria and their life satisfaction goes up. And other comorbid issues that they might have,
*  like anxiety, depression, substance use, all those things go down. So like I said,
*  I do think transitioning can help people. And I, I think, you know, I'm glad that you mentioned
*  that, because I don't want it to be all doom and gloom. And I don't want it to seem like this is
*  such a heavy negative issue, right? Like, I do think that this can help people. And I think it's
*  good that there is more awareness about this. And I do think it's good that society is on board
*  with helping trans people and supporting them. In terms of how people determine whether it's the
*  right choice for them. I think, again, it's a good mental health professional who can determine,
*  you know, go through a proper assessment. And if you make this decision, so I should clarify,
*  I'm not a clinician, I don't work with patients anymore. But from the conversations I've had with
*  my colleagues, you know, this is a decision that you're making over a period of time,
*  you've really asked yourself if this is the right choice for you,
*  which case, yeah, I think that's great.
*  And there's, there's an issue with a lot of trans people of being accepted. And how much of a factor
*  is that in their happiness? Whether I mean, that's one of the things that I would say
*  is probably responsible for a lot of this promotion of positivity, or promotion of,
*  of people accepting people being, you know, reluctant to criticize people or, or discuss
*  in any negative way trans issues is that they want to support people that are doing this very
*  difficult life changing decision. And when when they are doing that, it's such a difficult thing
*  to discuss, right? Because I know the suicide rates are very high with trans people. And it
*  doesn't seem to matter whether they transition or not. I believe the suicide rate. It's pretty
*  much saying it. There's one study that showed that the suicide rate is 20 times what would be seen
*  in the general population after transitioning. So some people will say, that's a sign that
*  transitioning doesn't help. But then other people will say, that's a sign that transitioning did
*  not come soon enough. And the authors of that study were very clear to say, you know, this is
*  not causation, you can't make many assumption between transitioning and the outcome because it
*  was only following these patients, right? There was no, it's not like you randomly assigned
*  them as you would in an experimental study to or if you were to design the study to be able to make
*  cause and effect conclusions, you would need to do random assignment and things like that. But
*  they're basically saying that if these people hadn't transitioned, it's, there's a possibility
*  that they would have fared even worse. So I think it goes down, it goes back to just
*  it being on a case by case basis. I don't think we should be generalizing in either direction.
*  Yeah, that's a good perspective. I think that that's kind of what I was getting at. It's like,
*  what is it that's causing these, is it, is the suicide rate so high because of society's lack
*  of acceptance? Is the suicide so high because of their own personal dissatisfaction with
*  the, you know, being born in the wrong gender and what can be done? Is that why people are so
*  accepting? Like maybe that's what it is that causes people to get angry when you criticize
*  anything involving trans. It's almost like they want people like us who are not trans to step out,
*  step away and let them sort it out. Does that make any sense?
*  I get it. No, I get it. I get it. And I get how it can probably come across as patronizing for
*  someone like me to step in and have a voice because they'll say, what do you know about what
*  we experience in day to day life? I totally get that. And I'm not saying that I do. I definitely
*  don't, but I'm coming from the perspective of being a scientific researcher and knowing the
*  research literature and being non-ideological and seeing, seeing why there's such a imbalance in
*  terms of this conversation. And it's because people are afraid. So I'm in a position to speak out.
*  I'm not afraid. Do you feel that you're pigeonholed at all by this subject matter? Because
*  this is, I mean, you're a fairly young woman and this is your chosen area of exploration and study.
*  Do you, what do you, where do you go from here? Do you feel like this is something you'll be
*  studying for years to come and discussing and talking about for years to come? Or do you feel
*  like there's going to come a point in time where you can want to move on to other subjects?
*  Well, I'm so grateful for this, to write a book. I mean, to write a book is an absolute dream.
*  It's been something I've been wanting to do since I was a child. So I'm super grateful to
*  my editor, Natasha, for that. In terms of me and my career, I mean, there's so many things that I
*  plan to do in terms of the subjects. This just happened to be the one thing that I wrote my
*  first book about. But even within the book, I cover a bunch of different issues. I talk about
*  sex differences in dating. That's something else I think is really important to approach dating and
*  sex in a way that's evidence-based, which I feel like a lot of young people are not doing today.
*  What do you mean by that? Well, I think, say in the name of gender equality, one big myth is that men
*  and women should act the same when it comes to romantic relationships and sex. And I think that
*  actually harms both women and men. No, you're raising your eyebrows, but you'd be surprised
*  what's out there. I'm confused. What do you mean by that? That men and women should act the same?
*  Well, just that, say, so women, some women love casual sex, and I say the power to you, but I
*  think most women on average do not enjoy casual sex as much as men. And so, but they're being told
*  that this is how you should behave to be an enlightened woman. And I'm saying, you know,
*  I think it's totally fine to just do you. You don't have to do anything in the name of being
*  an enlightened woman. And if you say you don't like casual sex, that's totally fine too.
*  And I think also there's a sense that if women require an investment from their partners,
*  I mean, in terms of an emotional investment or effort, that that's somehow being high maintenance,
*  but from an evolutionary perspective, that's actually beneficial because women want to know
*  that in the event that you do end up carrying this person's offspring, that they will be there to
*  help you. I didn't know that this was something that's being promoted. So women are being
*  encouraged to behave like men, to be an empowered woman, to have this non-emotionally connected
*  sexual relationship and to have casual intercourse with people and not worry about it because that's
*  what makes you an empowered woman. Yeah. And I think also evolutionary psychology has a bad rep
*  because people think it's sexist. They think that it says that women should be confined to certain
*  stereotypical gender roles or that women are inferior to men or that women should be sexually
*  submissive. And I'm not saying any of those things. I just think, again, if you try to hide
*  what science and reality is, it's not going to help you.
*  I've never understood that line of thinking. I never understood why people think that evolutionary
*  biology means women should be confined to very specific behaviors or interests. It's just pointing
*  out that for the most part, a lot of women gravitate towards these areas. It's a fascinating
*  area of study, but there are women cage fighters. Most men are not cage fighters,
*  but there's a good percentage in the UFC that are women. Obviously, there's differences in what
*  people want to pursue. There's women soldiers, there's women police officers, there's a lot of
*  females that buck trends because they're true to themselves. Whatever is in them that makes
*  them decide to be a boxer or a jujitsu player, they pursue it. I don't think that evolutionary biology,
*  when it shows that the vast majority of women don't gravitate towards those things, I don't
*  think that that's sexist. And I don't think it's encouraging women to have any specific interests.
*  I think it's just laying out data.
*  Right. And there's a biological component to that, right? Because for women who are more
*  male typical, they're likely exposed to higher levels of testosterone in the womb.
*  But to go back to your earlier point about where I go next and do I feel pigeonholed,
*  not really, because I do write about a whole bunch of different issues. Even outside of sex
*  research, I write about politics more widely, more so the cultural aspect of them. But yeah,
*  I feel like I'm at a very fortunate point right now in my career.
*  Well, the reason why I was saying is I feel almost pigeonholed by having this conversation with you
*  because I'm having two trans-oriented conversations in the last month or so,
*  and I've had a couple of them before. I've even got messages from people like,
*  why are you interested in this? Well, god damn it, I'm interested in everything. I'm interested
*  in volcanoes, okay? I'm interested in asteroids. I'm interested in a lot of things. This to me,
*  I don't want people to think that the reason why I'm interested is because I'm discouraging it
*  or I'm anti-trans because I'm absolutely not. But I am also anti-ideologically based thinking
*  that's not logical or fact-based or that discourages people from asking nuanced questions or observing
*  things for what they really are instead of what a certain segment of society wants you to think of
*  them as. Well, and you know, to people who are saying that to you, I honestly believe,
*  give it a couple of years and you won't be asking that question anymore because we will see
*  why these conversations were so critical because we will see the aftermath of not talking about
*  these things. I think that's true. And I think there's a certain amount of cowardice in not
*  discussing these that really disturbs me. Disturbs me and makes me very fearful. I know people whose
*  children, very young children, they believe are trans and they're going to go through this whole
*  thing and give them hormone blockers. And you know, I have no business to tell them differently.
*  There's no, I can't do anything about it. I just have to, I don't know. I don't know what's going
*  on. I just know that it's a real thing. And you have to step back and go, what would have happened
*  20 years ago? What would have happened 30 years ago? Is that better or is this better? Is it better
*  to just let the child become a grown adult and decide for themselves or is it better to step in
*  and for whatever reason, decide that Billy is really Sally? I don't know. And I don't think
*  anybody knows. And I think that's why this discussion is so important because the ramifications
*  of making a wrong choice or of influencing or of deciding for that child, it's so great.
*  Right. How can I ask you, how do you deal with the pushback? Because it doesn't seem to affect
*  you at all. And I love that. And I'm wondering, has it always been like that for you or was there
*  a very conscious decision on your part to just not listen to it?
*  I know where I'm coming from. I know I'm not a hateful person. And then when I'm, when, you know,
*  there's a lot of people that have all sorts of crazy opinions about me. There's nothing I can
*  do about that. I just remain true to myself and ask things or discuss things that I'm curious about.
*  That's it. I mean, yeah, there's, there's blowback, but there's blowback with everything I do.
*  There's not a damn thing I can do without people getting upset at me. I just have too much of it,
*  too much reach now. There's too, there's too much bandwidth. It's too much. Too many people coming
*  in too many. They see you as a threat. But I don't know why, you know, I'm not a threat. I might be,
*  if you have a rigid ideology that doesn't make sense and I oppose it, I oppose that idea that
*  this rigid ideology that doesn't make sense should just be left alone and never discussed.
*  The only thing that's, it's a threat to your own personal mindset. I'm not doing anything to anyone.
*  I'm just talking about things. So I don't know why they would think of me as a threat.
*  I'm not promoting any hateful behavior or actions at all. And I never would. It's not something I'm
*  ever interested in. I want people to be happy. I genuinely want as many people in this world to
*  be happy as possible and to be loving to each other and to be kind and open-minded and to allow
*  people to live their life the way they see fit, as long as it's not doing any harm to other people.
*  I don't think that's a bad thing. And as long as I don't think that's a bad thing, and as long as
*  I have this opportunity to express myself the way I really feel, I'm going to continue to do it.
*  And it shows, right? It resonates with your audience. And I'm so glad I get to chat with you
*  semi-face-to-face and actually congratulate you in person for the Spotify deal because it's just
*  amazing. And it's really inspiring to see someone who has literally built it from the ground up and
*  you know, you're self-made. So it just, it's for all of us who are watching it shows, you know,
*  you can do it too if you work really hard, probably.
*  Deborah, it's weird, you know, because there's nothing I ever planned. And it just, I just keep
*  showing up. I just keep doing it. And then it's got, it's become this very strange thing.
*  I remember there was a time I was on stage in Chicago. It was like, it must have been like
*  at least five years ago. And I just asked, I go, how many people listen to the podcast? And I
*  expected it to be just like a few claps here and there. It was 3,700 people in that place,
*  the Chicago theater. And they went, yeah. And I went, oh shit. And that was the moment I realized
*  like, oh shit, like what's happening? And that was a long time ago. You know, that was five years ago.
*  Where it's at now is very, very, very strange. And if I keep doing it, if I keep having interesting
*  people like you on and keep having these interesting discussions, I guess it just keeps
*  getting stranger and stranger. And I don't know what that means. I really haven't figured it out
*  is keep doing it. If people are getting mad at this or getting mad at this discussion, first of
*  all, I know you're a good person and I know you're not a hateful person. And I swear to God, I'm not
*  either. And I don't think there's anything wrong with having these discussions. And if people want
*  me to have a trans person on to show the opposite perspective, I would love to, but
*  I don't think there's anything wrong with what we're saying. I really don't. And particularly
*  when it comes to children, I just, I can't imagine that there's an argument against what you're saying.
*  I just think the truth speaks for itself, you know, and what you're saying in terms of, you know,
*  where you're coming from. I also know where I'm coming from and I know what my intentions are.
*  No one else knows. So that's at the end of the day, that's how I sleep at night. And I know that
*  people are going to see that what you and I are saying right now is true. So that's really all
*  that matters. It doesn't matter all the people who want to call me names and say that I'm a bad
*  person because I know that I'm really just trying to protect these children.
*  Pete I think you are as well. And nothing but love and respect for all the people that do
*  transition and are happy with it. Nothing but love. And just, I know that you're coming from
*  a good place and I really do hope that it does some good and that there are people that listen
*  to this and do get, they get a different perspective and perhaps do a little research
*  and realize like, we might be about to make a terrible mistake that you can't change.
*  Yeah. Yeah. That's all I can say about it.
*  Do you have plans to write another book?
*  Well, this book has just come out. So I'm very excited about promoting and talking about it. But
*  in terms of what I want to achieve with my career, yeah, I want to do hopefully more books. I want
*  to do more TV. I would love to do documentaries, more podcasts, everything. I feel very lucky. I
*  feel journalism has opened up this freedom that I unfortunately did not have as an academic scientist.
*  Pete Well, I think the world of journalism and particularly the world of open
*  and free media, new media like podcasts, it really needs people like you. It really needs academics
*  who have decided to use the freedom that you get from new media and explore these subjects in a
*  non-confined way. So many academics feel confined by institutions and by the politics involved in
*  these institutions to the point where these subjects can't get discussed because of these
*  rigid ideologies. I think it's so important that people like you do express yourself the way you're
*  doing and bravely. I think it's really, for our culture, it's very, very important.
*  Thank you. But also with journalism, I would say I get it because I think some journalists who
*  write about very far left themes, I don't know that they necessarily agree with what they're
*  writing about. But at the end of the day, you need a paycheck. And if that's what you need to write
*  about, then that's what they write about because it can be hard. And journalism is a very competitive
*  industry. So I think I like the fact that there is so much more room now in terms of people doing
*  their own thing. I'm very, very grateful for the platforms who have me on and the editors and
*  outlets who let me write for them because I think there needs to be more of a balance. And I think
*  people also are growing tired of only one acceptable way of thought being promoted, right?
*  People are sick of it. I think they really are. And I think what you're saying is very true in
*  terms of journalism. Journalism is so important, but unfortunately for many journalists, the
*  traditional avenues of journalism, whether it's print-based or even television, those things are
*  drying up and they're forced to sort of submit to these clickbait type articles. They kind of
*  have to. They get stuck into this position where they have to write things that are going to
*  excite people. They write things where the headlines are going to grab people and rope them in.
*  I think that's many of the reasons why they have to write these stories that are outrageous or
*  inflammatory, maybe even about things that they don't necessarily agree with. But they're starving.
*  There's really, you have to do something to get people's attention today. I defend clickbait all
*  the time. I defate clickbait like, listen, man, we fucking need journalists. And even if it's the New
*  York Times that's writing clickbait or the Washington Post, why do you think they're doing
*  that? Do you think they're doing that because they're dumb? Are they unethical? No. They need
*  people to fucking read things because they can't get clicks otherwise. There's too much information.
*  There's too much data. There's so much out there. It's so hard to get someone to pay attention to
*  any issue. And if you're a journalist, there's only so many different things you can cover.
*  And I think for a lot of them, they're just trying to stay alive.
*  Yeah. But I guess the larger hope is that because journalism is supposed to be objective and it's
*  supposed to show you what's important in the world and show it from a fact-based perspective,
*  that something like money and clicks would not be influencing the direction that we're going in.
*  Yeah, that would be cute, but it's not real. I think I would love it. I mean, I've talked about
*  this many times. I would love it if somebody came out with a really truly objective, fact-based
*  news source with everything where there's no bias left or right at all. And they're just looking at
*  the absolute concrete, irrefutable facts of every different situation and every different story in
*  the news. I mean, I think that would be fantastic. I think a lot of people like myself and probably
*  you as well, and a lot of people listening would gravitate to. And I think there's a real market
*  for it. I just don't know if you could actually do it because I think that if you get a bunch of
*  people together and you put together some sort of an organization, you're going to have an ideological
*  bend to it. They're going to lean one way or the other. And then they're going to omit facts or
*  add their own opinions to things or editorialize. And next thing you know, you're left or right.
*  You're CNN or you're Fox or whatever the fuck you are. Well, that's the thing, because we all have
*  our own biases. And then I think the main thing is, are you aware of those biases and do you try to
*  counter them? I think for myself, I'm a columnist, so I have more room in terms of giving my own
*  opinions. It doesn't have to be, it's not, if you're a columnist, you're not supposed to be
*  purely objective. And you know, so I think part of the problem is that, and even good scientists,
*  you know, you need to be aware of what your particular leanings are so that you can say,
*  okay, this should not be affecting my work. Yeah, I agree. You don't have any problem at all with
*  porn. You think porn is fine and porn is recreational. A lot of people would push
*  back against that. And a lot of people would push back and they would say that it's damaging to
*  young women, that it objectifies women in a harmful way, and that it changes the way young people
*  and particularly look at sex, and that they mirror and model themselves after these very unrealistic
*  scenarios that are depicted in these films. What do you think about that?
*  Right. I've never said that I have no issue with porn. I would just say I'm not anti-porn.
*  I think that pornography has a time and place. I think if you're an adult,
*  in terms of sex more broadly, whatever's consensual, that's your business. But I do think,
*  especially young children, I don't think that's good for their development. I don't think that
*  that's a way that people should learn about what sex is going to be like, because that's
*  pornography is not indicative of what real life sex is. And I think for people who are concerned
*  that pornography is, that it's a, I mean, there's so many different angles in terms of the criticisms
*  of porn, but say one common criticism is that pornography makes men interested in things that
*  are, you know, potentially degrading to women. I do think there is some pornography that is not
*  very nice in the way it depicts women for sure. But I don't think viewing that as what makes men
*  misogynistic or disrespectful of their partners. I think that's something that is inherent in them.
*  And again, as someone who has worked with sex offenders, you know, anti-sociality is more
*  predictive of someone's behavior and their views of women. It's not about being exposed to porn,
*  because I think most pro-social men, if they see something that's very degrading and awful to women,
*  they're going to say, that's horrible. And I don't want to look at that.
*  I think the issue is not really with porn as much as the issue is with human beings. I think that
*  porn is in a lot of ways, like many things like, like alcohol, for instance, you can have a drink
*  every now and then, or you can drink all day long and ruin your life. What is the problem? Is the
*  problem the alcohol or is it your behavior? Is it the human being? I think it's a human being and
*  human beings' obsessive, compulsive behavior and people's addiction to things. The addiction
*  to pornography seems to be an issue. And so some people's idea is, well, you should ban pornography.
*  Well, that's sort of the same argument for banning alcohol, but it doesn't really work.
*  Like, you can't really tell people what to do if some people don't have a problem with it.
*  Like, there's some people that enjoy porn every now and then. They watch porn,
*  they'd rather masturbate than have a relationship or whatever. Maybe they just don't want to deal
*  with people, but they're horny. I don't know, for whatever reason. But there's nothing wrong with
*  that. But there is something wrong for them with the action of watching porn all day and
*  disassociating and being weird. But again, I don't think it's a porn problem. I think it's a human
*  problem. It's the same thing as gambling. There's a lot of things that people get really obsessed
*  with and they get addicted to. I don't think the problem is the individual thing. This has always
*  been my take on porn or really on a lot of what we call vices. I don't think the problem is the
*  things themselves. And I not just respect, I support individual choices. I love the fact that
*  we have freedom. You could do whatever you want. I think you should be able to do anything. You
*  should, as long as people aren't getting hurt by it. I wonder why we have this perspective on porn
*  though that we don't have on other things. Because porn in many ways should be just people having
*  sex and filming it, right? People obviously like sex. So why is it such a big deal to film it?
*  Why is it such a big deal to show it to other people? It's a very strange aspect of being a
*  human being. That this one thing that so many people are obsessed with and literally go out
*  of their way to be successful so they can get more sex. That is like if you ask men, if men could not
*  have sex, how many men would be driving Ferraris and taking selfies in front of private jets? How
*  about zero, right? This is why they're doing it. They're signaling that they have wealth. They're
*  trying to make themselves attractive. Why are they trying to do that? For status. For what? Well,
*  maybe to show off to other men, but more likely to show off to whoever they're attracted to,
*  whether it's the opposite sex or the same sex. They're trying to get sex. So why is it that
*  filming sex is so taboo? Well, okay. To go back to your point about porn addiction, number one,
*  there's no evidence for pornography addiction in that- I need to introduce you to some of my friends.
*  You don't know what you're talking about. I don't doubt that there is. I don't doubt that for some
*  people porn is a problem for sure. And like you're saying, there's some people who watch for hours.
*  In the research I was doing before, there are some people I would talk to who literally sit and watch
*  pornography eight, 12 hours a day and it's affecting work. They're up super late. They can't get up in
*  the morning. It's affecting their relationships. That's not healthy. That's definitely excessive.
*  I don't deny that that exists, but that's not addiction. That's usually procrastination.
*  It's procrastination. Oh, wow. That's a weird point of view. I think they're addicted to it.
*  They're obsessed with it. If you're obsessed with something, don't you think that that's an addiction?
*  I mean, are we splitting hairs here? I guess it depends on what- if you're meaning addiction as in
*  like a colloquial use of the word, maybe. But in terms of if you're talking about drug and alcohol
*  addiction, it's not because drug and alcohol addiction is characterized by tolerance and
*  withdrawal. So people who- some people will argue, like I said, with pornography that if they watch it
*  and they start watching more extreme versions of it, they're saying that this is my tolerance.
*  But if you actually sit and have a conversation with those people, they'll say, actually,
*  this is what I've liked all along. It's just, it took me a while to accept that. So it's not,
*  there's no tolerance and you don't see people having withdrawal when they stop.
*  Well, they might not have physical withdrawal, but they do get obsessed with it and they do have a
*  compulsion to look at it. I know people that if they take a day from porn, they think about it
*  all the time and they can't wait to get a loan to watch it. I think it is an addiction and I think
*  it is similar to a drug addiction the same way gambling is similar to a drug addiction. There's
*  an internal drug. There's something that's going on in your mind that you are getting addicted to,
*  the excitement, the endorphins that you get from gambling. I think there's many people that get
*  those same excitement and that same excitement or similar and endorphins from watching pornography
*  and masturbating. Well, I mean, yeah, it's rewarding, but I think for a lot of people,
*  it's a coping strategy and if you give them different coping strategies, suddenly they're
*  not reliant on pornography to feel better, to deal with stress. But isn't that a strategy for
*  getting over addiction? You would admit there's an addiction to gambling? I think it is recognized
*  now, I believe. But don't you think that that's a similar situation because there is no withdrawal
*  and it's not like you reach a certain point where you need more to get you off.
*  I guess it is really, right? Because they gamble bigger and bigger numbers. But what I'm saying is
*  you don't really develop a tolerance to gambling, right? But it is a gambling addiction.
*  But the thing is with people with so-called pornography addiction, and research has shown
*  this, if you give them other coping skills and ways to deal with stress in their life
*  or you teach them, say, they give them assertiveness training so that they are able to speak up about
*  what's bothering them instead of turning to pornography as a way to feel better,
*  it actually cuts down on how much they're viewing time and how much they rely on it.
*  That's interesting. And I wonder if you get healthy user bias because if you're getting someone that
*  is willing to admit and accept the fact that they do have some sort of a sex or pornography addiction,
*  that's not the average person. I think there's a lot of people out there that are addicted to porn,
*  but you never hear from them because there's so much shame attached to it.
*  Right. But I think someone who is spending 8 to 12 hours a day, that's a lot of time. That's pretty
*  far in terms of severity. So I don't think that for everyone who uses porn as a coping strategy,
*  it's necessarily going to be that extreme. But my issue is that this has been
*  portrayed as something that is definitive and that we should treat it. I think it was maybe
*  two years ago, everyone was talking about porn addiction and within the field, people who work
*  with people with problems with pornography in a therapeutic context will say that it's not an
*  addiction. There are other things usually going on in someone's life. And those are the things that
*  you need to talk about when you sit down with a therapist. That's interesting. Yeah, I mean,
*  I guess I would agree that for a lot of people, it probably is procrastination and there's probably
*  a lot of other factors as well. But then again, people get horny. So even if you find all these
*  other coping mechanisms where you get horny, you're probably going to watch porn again.
*  So you slide right back into it. Well, there's no solution. I don't know. I mean, it's a weird
*  thing as opposed to gambling, right? You're not going to get horny for gambling, right? There's
*  not like an equivalent thing where you build up this thing inside your body that needs to take a
*  risk, right? But whereas with pornography, like it's particularly with men, you do sort of build up
*  this need to release. Right. And then it becomes a question of can they integrate this back into
*  their life in a healthy way without it becoming destructive again? Yeah. So why do you think it
*  is that we have this weird take on sex? Because it's a weird thing that it seems to be,
*  there's no problem with sex, but filming sex and showing sex is where things get strange.
*  Because sex is still considered stigmatized and it's taboo. And even when you're a sex scientist,
*  there's so much stigma around that. You would think that as a scientist, that there would be
*  some sort of removal of that perception, but no. So I think, you know, I write a lot about
*  sex positivity also. I think if we were to decrease the stigma around human sexuality,
*  that would help in so many ways. That makes sense. Do you feel like you get extra discrimination
*  because you're a beautiful woman who studies sex? Do people like automatically go, oh, she's a freak,
*  she's just looking for something to study that fits to her own little weird stuff? Do you get that?
*  I think people, well, I have in the past. I think people, and I don't blame them for making
*  assumptions because people tend to study what they find interesting. And usually I think people think
*  you have some sort of personal reason for studying the things that you do. For me,
*  my research expertise was basically kinky sex and sex toys, but I'm extremely vanilla and monogamous
*  and actually pretty boring. So, you know, for me, it was a way of living vicariously through people
*  that I would talk to and when I would go out and study these different populations.
*  Or studying something perhaps that doesn't jive with your own proclivities.
*  Right. Yeah, I think, I mean, most people would say that human sexuality is really fascinating.
*  And I would have a number of people say to me in the time when I was in graduate school that
*  they wish they had also been studying sex, but they, you know, were afraid of what people would
*  think or it's too stigmatized. And I think that's really a shame because the more people who are
*  interested in doing good work, then that's going to help everybody. Yeah, it is. It's one of those
*  things where people are like, why are you studying that? Like because it is stigmatized, it does have
*  this weird sort of connotation to it. Whereas it is a natural part of human behavior and it's
*  something that most people are at least mildly interested in sex. Like the idea of studying it
*  being a problem is very odd. But I wonder if it's like different in Canada than it is in America,
*  because Canada seems to have a healthier perspective in general about sex. I think America still has,
*  for whatever reason, the echoes of the Puritan ideology that was established when this country
*  was founded. Because we have comprehensive sex education for as far as I know, for the most part,
*  that's what is predominantly taught in schools with children. And so I think the idea of sex ed
*  makes people uncomfortable because some adults will say you're introducing ideas into kids' heads.
*  You know, they wouldn't otherwise be thinking about these things. But studies have actually
*  shown that children who get comprehensive sex education, of course, if it's age appropriate,
*  actually make better decisions when it comes to their sexual health. They're more likely to delay
*  when they start having sex and they're more likely to use contraception when they do. So that's in
*  contrast to abstinence-only sex, which basically tells you to wait until marriage. Of course. I
*  mean, that's with everything, right? I mean, that's why Europeans have less alcoholics,
*  because they introduce alcohol to kids younger. You're allowed to drink beer or wine when you're
*  young. It's not so taboo and crazy. So it's not like this built up thing that you're told to avoid.
*  Well, I think too for kids, not kids, let me restate that because obviously kids should not
*  be having sex. Teenagers. For teenagers, yeah. If you just tell them that they shouldn't do something,
*  what are they going to do? They're going to go do it. Instantly, yeah. So it's better that they have
*  information and education so that they, I think that's, they can make more informed decisions that way.
*  Unquestionably. When I was in high school, there was an open secret that girls who went to all
*  girls Catholic schools were the biggest freaks, like across the board. They were the ones who
*  wanted to have the most sex. They were crazed. They were literally crazed. And we would always
*  try to figure it out, but we knew it was a fact. And it was an open fact that kids, when I was like
*  17, we all discussed it and we're all, we're like, what is, how is, what is it? And we just
*  figured it out. Well, it's obviously suppression, but I mean, it's amazing that other people didn't
*  see, like, how do the parents not know they're creating monsters? They're creating sex monsters.
*  Like one of the girls that I dated when I was in high school, who went to an all girls school,
*  all girls Catholic school was crazy. She was crazy. The way I describe her, I was like a kitten. Like,
*  if you know, if you roll a ball on the ground, a kitten has to dive on it. That's how she was
*  with a dick. She couldn't stop herself. And I think it was literally because of what they did
*  to them. They told them sex is bad. It's evil. It's terrible. Boys are bad. And they're all together
*  all with a bunch of girls. They can't wait to get out of that place and go find a boy.
*  But okay. What are the guys like then, the guys who were at those schools?
*  That's a good question. I would assume they'd be sex crazed too. I didn't have any guy friends
*  that went to all guys Catholic schools for whatever reason. In Boston, where I grew up,
*  it was mostly all girls Catholic schools. I don't know if there was all guys Catholic schools.
*  The guys that I knew that were brothers with these girls, they went to regular schools.
*  I don't know what was going on. I mean, they were just trying to make sluts. Maybe they had like
*  some crazy secret agenda to turn these girls into promiscuous young ladies. I don't really believe
*  that. Maybe it was probably the opposite, right? It was probably like they're trying to reinforce
*  purity. And by doing so, they screwed up the idea of what sex is in these girls' heads.
*  And that's the thing too. I also don't think men and women should be held to different
*  standards when it comes to that. And I think for girls, especially them being chased,
*  and when I say chased, I mean, C-H-A-S-T-E and being virginal, right? And protecting their
*  whatever things, quote unquote, inherent value as women by being virginal. I don't think that's fair.
*  I think it should be, you know, if we're going to say that sex is something special and you should
*  choose carefully who you have sex with, that should be across the board. And conversely,
*  if we're saying that people should be able to have sex as much sex as they want,
*  and that's fantastic, then that should be across the board also.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, I agree with that. And that does exist in other countries. But for whatever
*  reason in America, we generally speaking, don't have that value. And I guess that would be why
*  people that are striving for women's equality would tell women that you are exactly the same
*  thing as a man and you should pursue the same things men do, like casual sex, to sort of affirm
*  that a man and women are the same in that respect.
*  Amanda Yeah, I think that's where the what the intention is, where it's coming from. But again,
*  at the end of the day, I'm just about making choices that are good for you and then make you
*  happy. And, and there's no need to feel pressure to behave in a certain way. You know, I have young
*  women who reach out to me who will say a lot that they don't, they can't perform like they're straight
*  and they can't perform like they're male partners. And that worries them. Because for men, you know,
*  if they're turned on, they're turned on right away. Women, it tends to take a little bit more time,
*  you know, and it's a bit more context dependent. And if you're telling young women that they need
*  to be exactly the same as men, they're going to think they're going to internalize this and
*  think there's something wrong with them. And that just makes me so sad because there there's nothing
*  wrong with the way our system were the way we're built, right. And so yeah.
*  Kyle Well, I think the solution to that is what you just did discussion, talk about it,
*  you know, I think having these kind of conversations about it, and hopefully people will hear
*  these conversations and it'll broaden their ideas and broaden their perspectives.
*  Deborah, thank you so much.
*  Deborah Yes, when are you when are you moving to Texas?
*  Kyle At the end of the month.
*  Deborah Whoa,
*  Kyle Yeah, I'm out of here. This place is going to blow up. This place is going to sink. Watch,
*  as soon as I leave. Boom. I just thought it's it's fucking this place is crazy. They they the
*  lockdown still exists, right? There's the homelessness is completely out of control.
*  There's the overpopulation is out of control. The way they're handling this is so bad.
*  I'm just upset with the federal government's handling of this everybody's hand. There's so
*  many people that are just financially, they're so fucked right now. And I think people should be
*  I don't I mean, I don't want to say people should be held accountable for but I think
*  people should make decisions based on the way the place that they live is handling this really
*  difficult problem. And the way the solution they've come up with in California is to jack
*  up taxes. So the most recent solution was to jack up taxes to 54%. Like you guys are out of your
*  fucking mind. retroactively back to January. There's a proposal. It's crazy. It's not going
*  to fix it. They're bankrupt. This state is bankrupt because they're incompetent. They're
*  not going to become competent if you give them more money. You know, it's just they've they've
*  managed the money that they got very poorly. They already have high taxes. There's a 13.5%
*  state income tax here in California. And the place is still fucked up. It's like, this is a this is a
*  very telling and dangerous time. In a lot of ways. It's very challenging. And it exposes a lot of
*  things. And one of the things that exposes I don't I don't particularly like the way things are run
*  here. And I don't like being in a place that has such a high population either. I think
*  there's a real problem with living somewhere that has 20 million people plus 40 million in
*  the whole state. It's so crazy. There's so many people here. And the only thing that was really
*  keeping me around was the Comedy Store and my friends. And a lot of my friends are bailing
*  a lot. I mean, there's a really going all over the place. My friend Joey's moved in New Jersey.
*  Theo Vaughn is moving. I think he's moving in Nashville. A lot of my friends are talking about
*  Texas. People are just bailing. There's a mass exodus out of California right now.
*  That's crazy because I was actually planning to move to LA eventually. So now that you're going,
*  I was going to say the next time I'm in town, I'll come say hi, but you're gonna be gone.
*  Well, maybe I'll be here every now and then. You know, I look once things are back to normal,
*  whatever normal is going to be, I'd be happy to come in every now and then. And we're going to
*  keep this studio for a while. I'll come to the Comedy Store and still do shows there. I miss all
*  my friends that that work there and that perform there. So I'm sure I'll be in town at least a few
*  times a year. But I just want to change too. I think there's other places to live. I want to
*  live in a place where it rains. That's another thing. It's very unhealthy living in a place
*  where it's always sunny. I think it gives you a really delusional perspective. It's beautiful for
*  you because you come from Toronto. It's 55,000 degrees below zero. Well, it's not snowing every
*  day, counter to what people think. We do actually have summer and sunshine sometimes. Of course you
*  do. Look, I love Toronto. But the thing is, when people come from somewhere like that and then you
*  come to LA and it's sunny all the time, you're like, this is amazing. But after a while, it's like,
*  it gives you a distorted view of nature. And I think that's one of the reasons why people in LA
*  are so delusional. They very rarely have to deal with actual nature. I always felt like there was
*  something real humbling about growing up in Boston because it got so goddamn cold and it snowed so
*  much that you just knew, like there were certain point in time where you had to submit to nature.
*  You had to huddle in. There's two feet of snow outside. You just stayed home. You just hung out
*  with the family. You played games. You did what you had to do. No one's going anywhere. The roads
*  are shut down. They have to plow. It takes days. And there's something about that, just understanding
*  that sometimes you have to be at the beck and call and the will of nature. That doesn't exist
*  in California. Every 20 years or so, we get a wake up call, the earth shakes and buildings fall
*  down. You go, fuck, I got to get out of here. And then people move out. And then a couple of years
*  later, they forget. A bunch of people move in and then it gets overcrowded again. But this is like
*  one of the first years, I think, where California didn't grow. And that's very strange because every
*  year California's population just keeps growing and growing and growing. And they say this is
*  one of the very first years in recent memory where it's not growing. So many people are leaving that
*  it's actually not growing. Change is good. I'm happy for you. Thank you. I'm happy for you too.
*  Thank you. I'm happy for you. You have a podcast as well, right? I will be starting a new podcast,
*  so I would tell everyone to follow me on social media. I'm at DrDebraSo on Twitter and Facebook
*  and at DrDebraWSo on Instagram. And I'll be announcing a whole bunch of new stuff coming
*  soon. And it's D-E-B-R-A. So nothing crazy with the O and the H. A lot of people like the...
*  Deborah can be spelled so many different ways, right? Right. And then so is S-O-H. Very simple.
*  All right. Well, thank you very much, Deborah. It's always good to talk to you. Next time,
*  hopefully we get to see each other in person. I know. Thank you so much, Joe. I appreciate it.
*  Stay safe, stay healthy, and don't read the comments. Take care. Bye.
