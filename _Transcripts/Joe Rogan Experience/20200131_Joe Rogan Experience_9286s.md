# Joe Rogan Experience #1420 - Mark Normand
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [January 31, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEWgei2u6vM)
*  Ladies and gentlemen, Mark Norman!
*  Hey hey!
*  Did your thing come unplugged?
*  No no, I'm all good, it just isn't as long as I hoped.
*  Is it?
*  Which I've heard before.
*  Ha!
*  But yeah, no we're good.
*  We're gonna get new things with a box and like a little wall.
*  Yeah, we're gonna make it like a real radio show.
*  Finally, this thing's been slacking.
*  Yeah I know, that's what I've been saying man.
*  Just this little box right here that controls the volumes is just too complicated, nobody
*  can figure out where the dial is for their thing.
*  It's pretty historic too, that looks aged.
*  Does it?
*  Yeah, it's a little weathered.
*  It's probably from all the weed smoke.
*  It's patina.
*  That's what they call it.
*  Patina?
*  Patina.
*  Is that your maid?
*  No!
*  Patina's like the surface of an old car when it has kind of like, or maybe a knife that's
*  been kind of like slightly rusted.
*  A little wear and tear.
*  Yes, yes.
*  People enjoy a patina.
*  Ah yes.
*  A fine wearing of a nice object.
*  Like a MILF is a patina.
*  A little bit.
*  MILFs have a little bit of patina.
*  I like a MILF.
*  I like a crow's foot and an old labia.
*  You name it.
*  Yeah, a girl likes to do shots.
*  Yeah, like a Tampa whore, you know?
*  Tampa!
*  Yeah, I was just there.
*  Yeah, did you do the improv with the three floors?
*  No, that room stinks.
*  I did the side splitters.
*  Oh, that's supposed to be a really good room.
*  Great room.
*  I've been there forever.
*  You know, Richard Jennings photos on the wall and all that shit.
*  That's old school.
*  God, that guy, he's one of my all time favorites.
*  That Tampa improv, does it still have the three floors?
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  And the third floor is like 10 seats?
*  Yeah, Ebor City, everybody's hammered.
*  It's like Bourbon Street down there.
*  It's not great for comedy.
*  Last time I was there, which is quite a while ago, I got introduced by someone who wanted
*  to, I want to introduce you to the local swinger community.
*  Oh!
*  The people that are like really into swinging in Tampa are not people anybody wants to have
*  sex with.
*  Right, right.
*  They find each other and they all just, no one gives a shit.
*  You fuck her, I'll fuck her, I'll fuck him, you fuck me.
*  Did you look at them like a lineup kind of thing?
*  There was like 20 of them that came to the show.
*  Whoa!
*  Not one fuckable weirdo?
*  I mean, listen, things can get ugly when you get hammered.
*  Of course, of course.
*  Did you see my ex?
*  They weren't in the best shape.
*  They didn't seem like they were concerned about the way they looked.
*  Got it.
*  It seemed like they just got together and just fucked everybody.
*  Everybody fucked everybody.
*  See, that might be the ruse.
*  I think they know they're ugly, they want to get laid.
*  It's a perfect crime.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  So, yeah, it's a smart move.
*  You get into a fuck club.
*  Yeah.
*  It's happened to me a couple times or so many times.
*  One time Nashville, this one guy was driving us around all weekend and then Sunday, the
*  day he was taking us to the airport.
*  He's like, well, he goes, it was really nice to meet you guys.
*  Next time you guys are here, I'd love to take you to a swinger's club.
*  I was like, and we were both, I think I was with Hinchcliffe, and we were both like, what?
*  And he's like, yeah, well, yeah, just, that's one of the things that I do.
*  I'm in sort of an open relationship with my woman.
*  So then we started questioning him, like, do you always, do you get a chance to see
*  the guy she's going to bang?
*  He goes, yeah, yeah, and I also have veto power.
*  Oh, wow.
*  But of course they want to bring you in because he's the hero if he brings in a celeb.
*  Then you get to bang the wife.
*  They probably got headshots on the wall of all the other guys who fucked her.
*  He was not telling me to fucking, he's like saying, if you want to come watch, come hang
*  out.
*  I think that would be worth it.
*  I would get some popcorn and go nuts.
*  Popcorn, a fucking operating mask.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  Like a coronavirus Asian.
*  Yeah, some fucking rubber gloves he used to wash dishes with.
*  Like, what?
*  What am I doing here?
*  What am I touching?
*  Yeah, yeah, maybe a laser pointer just to fuck with them.
*  Yeah, they had, well, they used to have those.
*  I've never been to an actual sex club in LA, but a buddy of mine has been to one.
*  And he said, you know, you go into this room and all these, there's like weird red lights,
*  red light bulbs and everybody's banging everybody.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, do you ever watch those dancing bear videos?
*  No.
*  Oh, man, J-Mo, pull it up.
*  He's going to get wood.
*  I can't pull it out.
*  It's called CFNM, clothed female naked male.
*  And it's so hot because it's the woman in charge and it's a bunch of dude strippers who come
*  in with bear hats on, like bear masks, and they're in a speedo and they just start dancing.
*  Eventually they're getting blown.
*  They're fucking the chicken from accounting and banging Deborah from sales.
*  And it's like kind of, oh, mediocre looking women getting railed by these studs.
*  Really?
*  And it's great because they like it.
*  And they keep the masks on?
*  Oh, yeah.
*  So why do they guys keep the masks on?
*  Well, that's just because it's anonymous.
*  It's hotter.
*  It's just a fuck object.
*  Oh, right.
*  So the woman can like flip the switch and detach and just enjoy the physical pleasure
*  of it.
*  And it's like a bachelorette party or an office party or something.
*  And it's killer.
*  It's always in like an office setting or something.
*  She doesn't have to look in the eye of the man and feel shame and weirdness.
*  Yeah.
*  The women are turned on.
*  It's so much hotter.
*  You know, because all we see all day is like dudes like, come on, let me fuck you.
*  But when the woman's taking charge, it's better.
*  You feel better about what you're watching.
*  Yeah.
*  They get jaded though.
*  I used to know some guys from martial arts that used to do male stripping and they get
*  real jaded.
*  Oh, really?
*  Yeah, they get real weirded out by it after a while.
*  That makes sense.
*  Women screaming at you.
*  A lot of ladies looking to cheat on their man.
*  Right, right.
*  And maybe the first day it's fun, but after a while you're like, ah.
*  And then.
*  This is somebody's aunt.
*  The other thing comes is that guys want to hire them.
*  Guys want to hire them to strip.
*  And then they have to make these decisions like, okay, I want to try to let them touch
*  my butt.
*  That's it.
*  It's funny when gay guys around, a guy turns in like the woman.
*  He's like, hey, respect me.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, the roles are reversed.
*  Well, it's all guys.
*  It's guys being a problem.
*  It's always guys.
*  Yeah, it's always guys being a problem.
*  You should see my DMs, man.
*  It's just ball sacks and jerk in and gay dudes like hot dudes.
*  Sometimes we're just like, hey, the things I would, I would drain your asshole.
*  Oh yeah.
*  I find it flattering.
*  Why do you think they're going after you?
*  I think I got a Twinkie Otter vibe, you know, Otter.
*  That's one of those gay terms.
*  They got Otter, Bear.
*  I knew about Bear.
*  Yeah, there's a bunch.
*  J Mo you know them all.
*  That's a whole like zoo.
*  What's an otter?
*  Otter's like a thin medium sized guy.
*  Oh, you're a medium sized guy.
*  Like the little guy would be like a twink.
*  I don't know what Brad Williams would be.
*  He'd be like a Hershey's Kiss or something.
*  Koala Bear.
*  There you go.
*  Yeah, he does have chlamydia.
*  But yeah.
*  Koala Bears have chlamydia?
*  All of them.
*  Yeah.
*  True story.
*  Google.
*  Imagine if that's where chlamydia came from.
*  Somebody had to fuck a koala bear.
*  Well, apparently we got aids from a monkey.
*  So maybe koala gave us chlamyd.
*  Do you know where that actually comes from?
*  It's not from someone fucking a monkey.
*  A bite?
*  No, it was from someone who hunted a monkey.
*  Hand job?
*  No, cut the monkey and cut his hand and got monkey blood in his hand while he was like
*  butchering a monkey.
*  Oh, that makes more sense.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Because who's fucking a monkey?
*  David Chappelle had a bit about it.
*  100% infection rate.
*  100%?
*  Wild fucking, that is insane.
*  Wild koalas have 100% infection rate of chlamydia.
*  For two decades, scientists have brought wild koalas into wildlife hospitals to treat their
*  chlamydia.
*  Can't we give them, I've had chlamydia six times in my life.
*  Can't we give them a penicillin shot?
*  Well, they'd have to go grab all of them.
*  Well, you know, they're really in deep, deep trouble because of the wildfires in Australia.
*  They said that something like 80% of their habitat's been destroyed.
*  Ooh.
*  The fucking, the fires over there are insane.
*  I did a benefit Sunday night with Monty Hoffman, or Monty Franklin rather, Whitney Cummings
*  and Jim Jeffries.
*  Oh, wow.
*  We did a benefit for the wildlife fires.
*  Jeffries must be getting his door knocked down with that shit.
*  Oh, I'm sure, yeah.
*  Well, Monty Franklin's Australian as well.
*  This was a double Australian, double American card.
*  Oh, boy.
*  Wild.
*  Yeah.
*  It was a fun show.
*  But when you see the devastation, it's crazy.
*  70% of Australia is covered in smoke.
*  Whoa.
*  70%.
*  And it's as big as the United States.
*  Ah, that's a bummer.
*  Yeah.
*  It's crazy.
*  And they basically have no way of stopping it.
*  I mean, unless the rains put it out or it burns all the way to the coast.
*  Yeah, it's a stupid question, but what is the money going to do?
*  You know, I know it helps people who are burned.
*  It's for wildlife.
*  Ah.
*  The money's all for wildlife.
*  A lot of them have been burned.
*  Like, they had a little bit of a presentation.
*  You know, I mean, some of them, they've rescued and they have to put them back
*  into suitable habitat.
*  And that's the money's going to wild.
*  I mean, you're not going to fix the fucking devastation by the fire.
*  No.
*  In terms of like the plants and the houses and stuff like that.
*  I mean, you can only hope those people whose homes burned down had some sort of
*  insurance, but how much fucking insurance money is there?
*  I mean, so many houses got wrecked.
*  Yeah.
*  What is the number now?
*  Like how many houses have been burnt to the ground in Australia currently?
*  Yeah, because all you hear about is the animals.
*  Yeah, well, it's a billion animals.
*  That's why a billion animals are dead.
*  Wow.
*  So this will be in history books.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Oh, boy.
*  Dude, just think about a fucking billion animals are dead from a fire.
*  I mean, that's insane.
*  Yeah.
*  That's going to change the ecosystem.
*  Oh, for sure.
*  Though the ecosystem over there is weird anyway.
*  Oh, they got spiders that kill birds.
*  Yeah.
*  That's insane.
*  I mean, I think they're going to be there too.
*  Oh, really?
*  Yeah.
*  It's like so many of their animals are invasive species.
*  What about the Aborigines?
*  Because they live in huts and shit, right?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, what about them?
*  I didn't even think about that.
*  They're fucked.
*  I don't think they live in huts for the most part.
*  I think a lot of them live in normal communities.
*  You probably did.
*  Probably like.
*  Crocodile Dundee.
*  That's all I know of that and Arch Barker.
*  They have so many different languages, the Aborigines do, that they could go like 20
*  miles away and not have any idea what those guys over there are saying.
*  Yeah.
*  Wow.
*  And most of those languages aren't even written down apparently.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  My buddy Adam Green Tree is from Australia and he runs a mining company and they hire
*  a lot of the folks that are Aborigines.
*  And he's gotten to be very close with a lot of them and kind of gotten to know their
*  culture and to understand their culture.
*  And it's really, really strange.
*  Like really strange.
*  Yeah.
*  They're scattered all over the country and so many of them have, they call them mobs,
*  like a tribe is a mob, and they have a different language than another mob that's like 30
*  miles away.
*  Are they dangerous?
*  What do you mean?
*  Like do they fight each other and stuff?
*  I don't know.
*  That's a good question.
*  Yeah, I don't know.
*  I went to Australia for the Melbourne Comedy Fest and I was bummed at how not different
*  it was.
*  It's not that different.
*  From America?
*  Yeah.
*  No, Melbourne's real close.
*  Fantastic food.
*  Great food, great plays, great people.
*  Yeah.
*  That laugh lounge is awesome too.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Good club.
*  Great club.
*  Great comics over there too.
*  Very good.
*  They're into it.
*  Yeah.
*  Very good.
*  Although they didn't like the dark stuff, I noticed.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, well I think there's so much...
*  Excuse me.
*  There's so much...
*  That coffee, man.
*  That turmeric is going right up my asshole.
*  It's that layered Hamilton superfood.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Love to watch him masturbate.
*  But yeah, those audiences there were very tense when I got dark.
*  Really?
*  I think because they have some real racial problems and real...
*  They're kind of behind the times a little bit on stuff.
*  So I think they're like, hey look, that shit's happening.
*  We're not laughing at it yet.
*  Oh, right, right.
*  Okay.
*  Well you know in the 1950s, just not that long ago, they were actually taking Aboriginal
*  babies from the parents and trying to raise them.
*  Yeah.
*  Well at least that's good intent.
*  They should have probably asked first.
*  Oh, they just took them.
*  I don't know.
*  I'm not that informed, but some Australian people were trying to explain to me how the
*  relations are very fucked up.
*  Right.
*  Wow.
*  So the Aborigines get their babies stolen by honkies.
*  And I don't know, in a weird way the mom's got to kind of be like, well it's a better
*  life.
*  I don't think so.
*  They got a TV.
*  I think she misses her mom.
*  Yeah, I guess you're right.
*  She misses her daughter.
*  I don't know, man.
*  It's not good.
*  Either way, donate to the chlamydia.
*  Yeah.
*  How many houses have been burnt down?
*  Do they even know?
*  I probably don't know exactly.
*  I saw one thing that said in New South Wales alone there was 3,000 houses, but another
*  thing said that that was the number.
*  So I don't know if it's 3,000 total or just in that area.
*  That's not too bad.
*  It could be worse.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, 3,000.
*  I mean there were 600 last year just in Malibu.
*  Oh shit, I forgot about that.
*  Damn.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, the fires.
*  Water can fuck you.
*  Fire can fuck you.
*  Everything can fuck you.
*  Yeah, it's crazy.
*  How long do we stop saying that's fire?
*  That's going to be insensitive after a while.
*  Yeah, everything's going to be insensitive.
*  Well, if we let people, let the woke brigade keep taking over words, we'll be down to grunts
*  and pointing at things.
*  Everything will be offensive.
*  Because if you keep progressing, something's got to stop.
*  Everything goes.
*  Everything goes.
*  Everything goes eventually.
*  And then even grunts and pointing at things will be offensive to people who are deaf who
*  use sign language.
*  Because now you're culturally appropriating from sign language people.
*  I was driving here on the highway and I thought, man, the carpool lane's insensitive to lonely
*  single people.
*  Like what if you don't have a friend?
*  What if I don't know a guy?
*  You get an electric vehicle.
*  You can ride in the carpool lane.
*  Is that right?
*  Yes.
*  There's the loophole for the losers out there.
*  Oh, it's one of the best reasons to have a Tesla.
*  Yeah.
*  Get that fucking left lane, baby.
*  So many Teslas in this town.
*  This is such a wacky backwards lala land over here.
*  Oh, it is.
*  Chipotle's got a fucking valet in LA.
*  Does it?
*  Yes.
*  I'm going to go to the gym today.
*  Wow.
*  But I love Chipotle.
*  But...
*  It's wacky.
*  It's wacky, man.
*  I mean, it's so beautiful.
*  I was telling him I went to the...
*  I'm pitching a show again that'll never sell.
*  But I went to Fox lot and it's all these good looking girls with their shoes kicked off
*  laying on a picnic table, drinking a coffee.
*  I'm like, you don't know what you got, whore.
*  This is an amazing life.
*  You don't have any respect and any gratefulness and appreciation.
*  How do you know they don't?
*  They're just enjoying the day.
*  She's going, ah, my phone is not working fast enough.
*  I hate her.
*  Fucking God.
*  I live in New York.
*  We're all up each other's ass.
*  There's a rat on my dick.
*  It's five degrees outside.
*  My apartment's the size of J Moe's asshole.
*  I'm fucked.
*  Wow.
*  And these gals are kicking their feet up.
*  Who's J Moe?
*  Oh, you.
*  Sorry.
*  I thought it was a new girl that I don't know about.
*  Oh.
*  Some new it lady.
*  Right.
*  My favorite video in New York is the rat that's killing the pigeon.
*  Did you ever see that video?
*  No, I never saw that.
*  I saw Pizza Rat.
*  Yeah, Pizza Rat ain't shit on pigeon killing rat.
*  The fucking rat's killing a pigeon.
*  Wow, it's like the woke brigade.
*  They're attacking each other.
*  Yeah, very similar.
*  Taking the pigeon down and attacking it.
*  The pigeon tries to flood away and the rat fucking chases it.
*  Wow.
*  I didn't know rats are predatory.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  I thought they were mostly just scavengers.
*  Yeah, I guess so.
*  I didn't know they would actually go after a live thing and attack it and kill it.
*  Yeah, desperation, man.
*  Was it in the subway area or was it on the street?
*  I think it was on the street because I don't think pigeons actually go into the subway.
*  That's a good point.
*  For the most part.
*  Good point.
*  I've seen a few in an airport before.
*  Oh, here it is.
*  So here's this pigeon and this rat is trying to walk off with this fucking pigeon.
*  And it's as big as him.
*  That's what's crazy.
*  What a bitch ass pigeon though.
*  Come on, flap it up.
*  Wow, they have some big fucking teeth, these cunty rats.
*  You know they never stop.
*  It's got them by the neck.
*  Look at that.
*  They never stop growing rat's teeth.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, that's why they're always gnawing because they're partly filing them down.
*  Give it a gook.
*  I can't believe I know any more animal facts than you.
*  I actually do remember that now that you bring that up.
*  Sure you do.
*  Nice pull there Jojo Rabbit.
*  Look at this fucking thing.
*  And the pigeon gets away at one point slightly right there.
*  Look at him, chase it down.
*  He's like, no, no, no, bitch.
*  Get the fuck over here.
*  The pigeon's so damaged it can't get away totally.
*  It can't fly.
*  So eventually he drags it through the hole in the fence and fucks it up.
*  That's the scariest when you go into their lair.
*  And the pigeon knows that.
*  I can't get off the street.
*  Look at it's mounting him.
*  It's got his back.
*  Bite in the back of his head.
*  It's like Khabib.
*  Yeah, very similar.
*  Holy shit.
*  Just can't get away.
*  He's smashing you.
*  I just didn't know they killed things.
*  I thought they only just ate stuff that was laying around.
*  I thought there's so much food in New York City.
*  They would just run around eating everything.
*  They eat each other.
*  I do know that.
*  Oh really?
*  I do know that because I lived in Encino and I was renting this house and the house had
*  a lot of rats.
*  And I leave my garbage in the garage and put it out in the morning.
*  And I was seeing these rats.
*  So I set a trap.
*  Not mice, rats.
*  Fucking rats.
*  Big rats.
*  So I hear, snap.
*  So I go out to check and there's a fat boy that's got his head crushed in this trap.
*  I mean he's dead as fuck.
*  So I'm like, okay, I'll just get it in the morning.
*  I don't want to deal with that right now.
*  So I get up in the morning and the only thing that's left is the tail.
*  Oh.
*  They ate everything.
*  They ate everything.
*  There was like the feet and the tail.
*  All the guts, the body, the spinal cord, everything.
*  There was just like a stain and the tail.
*  So rat tails are so disgusting that even rats don't eat rat tails.
*  There's a lesson there.
*  You hear that, rednecks?
*  Yeah.
*  Get rid of those rat tails.
*  I'm talking to you, Theo Vaughn.
*  Here's the move.
*  You poison a rat, then get it in the trap, then they eat the rat, then they get poisoned.
*  That could be something.
*  Yeah, you could.
*  But the problem with poisoning rats is a lot of times it doesn't kill them immediately
*  and then coyotes get it and then they get poisoned and then mountain lions kill the
*  poisoned coyotes or they kill the rats.
*  So owls also get killed by rat poison.
*  It's a real problem with owls because a lot of people leave rat poison outside their house
*  and then the rats eat the poison.
*  They get weakened, then the owl comes in and eats them.
*  Wow.
*  Circle of life.
*  Circle of life.
*  Damn.
*  You lived in New York.
*  Yes.
*  You had mice, I'm sure.
*  Oh yeah.
*  I lived in New Rochelle though.
*  I never lived in the city.
*  I couldn't afford to live in the city when I lived up there.
*  It's right next to the Bronx.
*  Okay.
*  Yeah, that was mice, man.
*  Oh yeah, mice are everywhere.
*  They're brutal and they really...
*  I'm so scared of them.
*  I know it's like a wussy thing, but when they're running around I just jump up on the table.
*  Yeah, I can't handle it.
*  It's brutal.
*  I have to call a masculine friend to help me.
*  Even when they're on the trap screaming, I don't know what to do.
*  I take a broomstick, I stick it to the sticky trap, and then I go outside and put it in
*  the garbage can.
*  While they're still alive?
*  Yeah.
*  So you let them just suffocate out there or whatever?
*  Yeah, yeah, that's on them.
*  Fuck them.
*  You figure it out.
*  It's a weird system, right?
*  The ecosystem of rats and mice and humans.
*  It's a strange thing.
*  Yeah.
*  There's a lot of them.
*  And they've killed us with the plague.
*  Apparently that was all rats.
*  Well, it's the fleas really.
*  Fleas from, I think, Crimea came over on boats attached to rats, and then the rats
*  ran through Europe and fucked everybody up.
*  Cry me a river.
*  Ah, you can't help yourself.
*  Again, I'm sorry.
*  I love words.
*  Did you ever see the Netflix documentary called Rats?
*  No.
*  Oh my God, you have to.
*  I don't know if I want to.
*  You have to.
*  You just go, what?
*  First of all, they all have diseases.
*  Oh yeah.
*  All of them.
*  I mean, you just don't come in contact with them.
*  But if they bit you, like you're fucked.
*  Most rats are fucked.
*  Yeah.
*  I've seen tests on rats in different parts of the country too.
*  And New York City is, I think they said, it's either the number of rats is the same as the
*  number of people that live in New York City or the biomass.
*  I'm not sure which one, but both of them are equally terrifying.
*  Yeah.
*  If it's the biomass, it's actually more terrifying, right?
*  Because it means there's so many rats that it's the same mass of bodies as there are
*  of human beings.
*  But I don't think they really know.
*  Are there any fucking surveyors down there in the subways?
*  How do they know?
*  How could you know?
*  Also, if you measure the weight of all human beings and all ants, it's even.
*  Yeah, I know that.
*  Oh damn, I thought I had you again.
*  No, I knew that one.
*  I love a fun fact.
*  That's a weird one, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Ants are freaky too, man.
*  They said if an ant was our size, it would be faster than a Ferrari.
*  Whoa.
*  Give it a gook.
*  Yeah.
*  Callan, at one point in time, Brian Callan wanted to be, what is it?
*  What's the type of person who studies?
*  Anthemologists.
*  Is that like phrases?
*  Right.
*  Etymology is words.
*  Entomology is study of insects.
*  Oh.
*  Yeah.
*  So he did some time in the jungle.
*  Oh.
*  And they would have to put turpentine all over the posts of these platforms that the
*  tents would be on because there were so many ants on the jungle floor that you, he said
*  he was lying in bed.
*  You could hear the ants.
*  Ah.
*  You could hear them walking.
*  In sync.
*  Yeah.
*  They're eating something.
*  There's so many of them.
*  Yeah.
*  They just kill.
*  They kill elephants.
*  Come on.
*  They climb up the elephant's body and go right into its ear and just start eating its brain.
*  Oh, man.
*  What can an elephant do?
*  It just doesn't have hands to move it.
*  It's not a goddamn thing it can do unless it's really close to a giant river and it
*  can jump in and try to drown those little cunts.
*  Oh, man.
*  Right?
*  Brutal.
*  Brutal.
*  What a way to go.
*  It's amazing.
*  We've lived as humans.
*  How did we survive, primitively?
*  Well, we got lucky.
*  Then we got smart and when we got smart, then we started overpopulating.
*  Yeah.
*  Because then we figured out all these different ways that nature was kind of keeping our bodies
*  in check, keeping our numbers in check.
*  We have systems for rats and mice and all these different things to keep them in check.
*  Well, nature sort of had a way to keep humans in check.
*  Predators, diseases, starvation, injury.
*  So you're saying we beat nature.
*  We beat nature.
*  Which is probably why we're so fucked up mentally because we're not supposed to beat nature.
*  Well, we're a little too safe for sure.
*  For sure.
*  We're all contained in these buildings where no predators can get ass.
*  We all get doughy like little fucking human water balloons.
*  And one inkling of discomfort and we have to fix it and work on it, bitch.
*  We complain.
*  Yeah, we're getting our jaw shaved down to look prettier.
*  Oh.
*  Just digging through rats in New York.
*  They don't know how many there are.
*  There's estimated of 250,000, tens of millions, but this is a new trap that was put out in
*  Brooklyn.
*  This is a video of them, I guess, testing it.
*  It's an alcohol trap where they fall into this bucket of alcohol and they drown.
*  Ah.
*  And here in the video, that's why I'm showing it, they open up these buckets.
*  Oh.
*  It's filled with dead rats.
*  These guys have to touch these things.
*  I wouldn't trust it with just little rubber gloves on.
*  I know, I know.
*  And so this is just full of dead rats.
*  Can we use those?
*  We should be able to use those for something.
*  For fuel.
*  Yeah.
*  Burn them to keep your house.
*  Might as well.
*  Yeah, why can't they?
*  Just scoop it out.
*  Oh.
*  It's a good size.
*  Decent size.
*  Decent size.
*  At least feed jungle or zoo animals or something.
*  Right.
*  Like a snake.
*  Yeah, right?
*  Yeah, you gotta use the buffalo.
*  But you know the coronavirus, the Wuhan coronavirus, whatever it is, they think that came from
*  snakes.
*  Ah.
*  Maybe that's what happened in China.
*  Maybe they fed a fucking rat to a snake and next thing you know, Jed's a millionaire.
*  And Jamie actually has a conspiracy theory about that.
*  Do you know?
*  Uh oh.
*  I know you hate Asians.
*  I just read it online.
*  Well, I'm saying you have one.
*  I mean, I'm not saying that it's like you've been putting it out there.
*  Let's hear it, Daddy.
*  It's not like it's mine in my back pocket of conspiracy theory.
*  What is the conspiracy theory?
*  Was that there's some sort of a bio weapons thing?
*  Yeah, I mean, I'll Google it.
*  I'm so glad I never got bitten by the conspiracy bug.
*  A bio lab for...
*  I have no interest.
*  ...the most dangerous pathogens on earth was open.
*  Dun dun dun.
*  Well, the Chinese have always got something cooking.
*  They're ahead of us.
*  In a lot of ways.
*  In every way.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, we don't even know because we don't speak their language.
*  Ah, that's a good point.
*  Maybe their comedy is like because of the language structure, maybe their comedy is
*  way better.
*  Well, they got more words and letters and characters, but I've been over there to their
*  comedy clubs in Shanghai and they weren't great.
*  China built a lab to study SARS and Ebola in Wuhan, and the US biosafety experts warned
*  in 2017 that a virus could escape the facility that's become key in fighting the outbreak.
*  Ooh.
*  But wait a minute, what is this article from?
*  The Daily Mail?
*  I just found a place that had the best headline and place for you to read it.
*  Daily Mail's a wee bit suspect, lad.
*  Yeah.
*  A wee bit suspect, a little bit outrageous with their captions, a little bit clickbaity.
*  Well, everything's clickbaity now.
*  They kind of have to be, man.
*  I mean, that's how they make money.
*  Sure, but where's the integrity?
*  How do you sleep at night?
*  They sleep on a pile of money.
*  I guess so.
*  This is the Chinese website for it.
*  Academy of Sciences, large research, infrastructures per user surface platform.
*  It's translated from Chinese.
*  Oh, I guess so.
*  Yeah, wow.
*  Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory.
*  Look, they have an award.
*  Look, we have an award.
*  Look at that.
*  I love when people stand by awards.
*  Like, look, look, we are better.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a weird picture, right?
*  Two people stand there holding an award.
*  Yeah.
*  Look what we won.
*  Right.
*  We're flossing.
*  You don't do corporate gigs anymore.
*  No.
*  I did one over the holidays because I had like seven of them.
*  They pay amazing.
*  I'd wear a tuxedo.
*  I did a pharmaceutical awards.
*  I got fired within 15 minutes.
*  It was supposed to be three hours.
*  There's such queefs over there.
*  It's a ballroom, round tables, tuxedo, beautiful hotel in Philly.
*  They got me a limo out there, crazy money.
*  And I was supposed to, you know, like, rickety your face the whole thing, you know, be an
*  awards guy, present it, talk to them, have a speech.
*  And I just did my clean act.
*  I used to open for Seinfeld and a lady got offended and it happened to be the CEO's wife.
*  And she bitched him out and then he bitched me out and they fired me.
*  Wow.
*  Did you have to pay anyway?
*  I got paid.
*  Win.
*  Yeah.
*  But it's disheartening.
*  You go, hey, twats, these jokes have worked on The Tonight Show.
*  What do you want?
*  Yeah.
*  The Tonight Show is pretty...
*  Yes!
*  Squeaky.
*  Pretty squeaky.
*  But how far, like, how far along were you?
*  You said 15 minutes into your act, were you ramping up the offensiveness?
*  No.
*  Well, I do 15 minutes of jokes out of the gate, like, to open it, and then you do the
*  awards for the whole thing's like two and a half hours.
*  And I had a stack of cards, like, try so, but de ba do, wins for best whatever, muscle
*  relaxer.
*  So what did the guy say to you when he fired you?
*  He said, my wife is offended, how dare you?
*  It was offensive to women.
*  I did a joke about vibrators.
*  And he was like, you got to get out of here.
*  Like, how dare you?
*  That's offensive to women?
*  I know!
*  The vibrator's better than me, you know?
*  Like, I'm the loser.
*  Why is it offensive?
*  I think she was looking for something.
*  And maybe they haven't fucked in six years, you know?
*  It's always some deep-rooted thing.
*  And she's drinking, and she's on Adderall, and she's like, off with his head!
*  I can't do that, I'll just fire him.
*  Exactly.
*  And firing me is like a fun power move, you know?
*  It gets you ramped up, look what I can do, look at the power I wield.
*  Right, and then she tells all her friends, you know, I fired the comedian.
*  Exactly.
*  What a piece of shit he is.
*  Mark Norman, don't ever go to his show.
*  I can't tell you how many emails I got.
*  Hey, I thought you were funny, when you're coming to Helium, I'm coming, I couldn't laugh
*  next to my boss, you know?
*  And I was like, God, you idiots!
*  Have some balls!
*  Live it in that world, man, that corporate world.
*  Yeah, I'm like, you're all drug dealers, you sell drugs, and you're mad at me for making
*  a yuck-em-up?
*  I don't get it!
*  We're all backwards, priority-wise.
*  Like, you make a coronavirus joke, nobody cares, you make a Kobe joke, and you're the
*  devil.
*  But it's like, way more people died with corona.
*  I'm not saying either one is fun.
*  It's a person.
*  It's a person.
*  You can nail the individual person.
*  Plus there's the cult of personality, famous person, well-loved, and then died with his
*  daughter, and then died with like six other people, there's like a lot of things.
*  I guess you're right.
*  But isn't that all fascinating?
*  Because your body knows immediately.
*  You know, oh, that was too far.
*  That's fine.
*  Well, wasn't that something that Stalin said, that one death is a tragedy, a million deaths
*  is a statistic?
*  Oh, I like that.
*  Was that Stalin?
*  Was it Stalin or someone in World War II?
*  I think it was Stalin.
*  But it's, yeah, we get lost in numbers.
*  Like when someone says, like, the universe is 14 billion years old, you're like, okay,
*  what does that even mean?
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  I can't do that.
*  That's in my head, and it's just like, oh, a bunch of zeros.
*  Also Kobe was here, and China's a zillion miles away.
*  That's in your backyard kind of thing.
*  Well, here's a statistic you probably didn't know.
*  Fifty people die every year in swimming pools.
*  That seems got to be more than that.
*  No.
*  Fifty?
*  Yeah, we're getting better.
*  Come on.
*  Five-zero.
*  But every day.
*  Well, how about gun deaths?
*  I bet a swimming pool is more dangerous than a gun in the home.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  I don't think 50 people die every day from guns.
*  You said every year.
*  You meant every day?
*  Did I say every year?
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, that's what I'm gonna say.
*  I'm sorry.
*  Fifty in LA alone.
*  I need more coffee.
*  Yeah, every day.
*  Thank you, Jamie.
*  Fifty a day in America.
*  Fifty a day in swimming pools.
*  Want to hear another good one?
*  Yeah.
*  I think there's coconuts fall on their heads.
*  Oh, that's a cartoon.
*  That's classic.
*  You just picture that lump coming up, you know?
*  I think that's worldwide, though.
*  That's great.
*  I mean, how do you do the funeral for that one?
*  You just go, well, what are you gonna do?
*  Coconuts.
*  Coconuts will fuck you up, man.
*  In one of those really tall trees?
*  Sure.
*  You know, it's a big one in New York.
*  The AC falls on people.
*  Oh, Jesus Christ.
*  That's a big one.
*  That happens all the time.
*  Oh, fuck, man.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh my God.
*  And cows kill more people than sharks a year.
*  Really?
*  Sharks are, it's almost like black people where it's just sexier to talk about it, you
*  know, but the cows are actually the ones killing more people.
*  Cows kill more people than sharks.
*  Give it a goog.
*  The coconut thing might be an exaggerated...
*  Oh!
*  Shut your mouth.
*  I'm sorry.
*  Shut your mouth.
*  There's a whole Wikipedia thing about it.
*  Yeah, I've gone through that.
*  Yeah, they don't really know.
*  Wiki can be anything.
*  Well, some days people get better at it.
*  They wear helmets.
*  Some years.
*  Why not wear a helmet every day?
*  Well, they're probably poor and they want a coconut.
*  Yeah, I guess, good point.
*  If you're trying to climb a tree and the coconut just nails you halfway down and then you fall,
*  that's a double whammy.
*  Good point.
*  Right?
*  Bonk.
*  Yeah.
*  Splat.
*  It feels like a 70s arcade game, you know?
*  Have you seen those guys climb the trees?
*  Fuck, man.
*  Those guys get up high too.
*  Amazing.
*  And they're basically just clinging and pulling themselves and clinging and pulling themselves.
*  Right.
*  I saw a video of these guys in the Amazon climbing trees.
*  It's like, what the fuck?
*  They were kids.
*  They were like 12-year-old kids and they were 200 feet in the air.
*  Wow.
*  Just shimmying their way up this tree.
*  Like, god damn.
*  Unbelievable.
*  I wonder if they'll evolve differently because it's a different muscles.
*  Well, you know what it is?
*  Their feet are much stronger and they look different.
*  Oh, really?
*  Have you ever seen what happens when people walk barefoot like in the jungle all the time?
*  Their feet spread out.
*  Right.
*  Their fingers spread out like hands.
*  Their feet look really weird, man.
*  They splay out.
*  Yeah.
*  Like, our feet are like, they're in a cast.
*  Because we're in shoes all the time.
*  But their feet actually go out in directions.
*  Interesting.
*  They're like, their big toes point left and right.
*  Yeah.
*  And then everything else sort of goes out like when you spread your fingers.
*  Jamie, find me some jungle bare feet.
*  Because it's creepy.
*  I was taught this by my friend Steve Rinella who went to Guyana and was hanging out with
*  these people in the jungle.
*  And he was like, you can't recognize their feet.
*  It's like, what is going on with your feet?
*  Like, they're unrecognizable.
*  Yeah.
*  Because, look it, that's their feet.
*  Look at that.
*  Oh, wow.
*  Isn't that crazy?
*  It's crazy.
*  It looks like a webbed foot, like a duck's.
*  It says, the Amazon tribe that kills and eats monkeys.
*  Well, you should say all Amazon tribes that have access to monkeys because apparently
*  they love monkeys.
*  Uh-huh.
*  But, yeah.
*  Look at his feet, man.
*  But, go to that one picture.
*  Look at that.
*  That is insane, man.
*  Oh, wow.
*  And it's because they're always gripping the surface of the ground.
*  So they develop all this strength and thickness.
*  Look how thick their toes are.
*  Right.
*  Doesn't that left side monkey look like it's got a dong?
*  It does look like a dong.
*  It's like perfect positioning.
*  It's real weird, right?
*  They look a lot like when you see primates other than the primates have that little thumb.
*  Yeah, right.
*  You know what would be interesting is to cut one of them open and then cut you open.
*  How much more shit you would have in you.
*  Because you eat all this prosa- I mean, you eat still pretty well, but they've never had
*  caffeine.
*  They've never had a drop of alcohol.
*  Right.
*  They've never had a hamburger.
*  They would just be pink, I bet.
*  They eat a lot of monkeys, though.
*  Ah, that's all natural.
*  Yeah, I guess.
*  Except for the aids.
*  I don't think you get aids from those monkeys.
*  Oh, okay.
*  I think you gotta go to Africa.
*  I think it's actually- I think it's chimps more than it is monkeys.
*  It's so weird, though, the feet thing.
*  That's crazy.
*  Yeah, there was a great radio lab episode on-
*  Oh, I love radio lab.
*  Yeah, it's an awesome podcast.
*  But on Patient Zero, where they were trying to figure out how did HIV come from?
*  And they think they narrowed it down to a hunter that it killed.
*  Because they do something called bushmeat in a lot of these really poor areas, where
*  they basically just shoot everything and just chop it up and whatever you can eat.
*  Whether it's a monkey or a giraffe or whatever the fuck you kill.
*  Sure.
*  Yeah, those are tough people.
*  Those naked and afraids, even.
*  I'm like, I don't know if I can do it.
*  Naked and afraid.
*  They can kiss my ass.
*  Most people probably get all kinds of crazy fucking parasites.
*  Yeah, bug bites and food poisoning.
*  They eat berries and pond water and shit.
*  Dick fish.
*  Fish that swim up your dick hole.
*  Do you know that's real?
*  No.
*  Yeah, there's certain- especially in the Amazon.
*  If you urinate in the water in the Amazon, there's certain little tiny fish that are
*  actually attracted to the smell and the temperature of your urine.
*  And they'll fly up the old pee hole and make their way into your car.
*  Yikes.
*  Can you pee it out while it's going up?
*  I don't think you can.
*  Look at that.
*  Those are cockfish.
*  River monster.
*  Fish swims up your urine stream.
*  Look at that.
*  Damn.
*  Little fucker.
*  It's like candoroo or something.
*  Yeah, and look, he's got teeth.
*  Look at him on the left-hand side, Jeremy.
*  The mouth.
*  He's just chewing away.
*  He looks like a dick.
*  He's trying to blow you from the inside.
*  You ever hear that old Chinese torture where they get you hard, they hammer a glass spike
*  into your dong, and then they break it.
*  And then you piss shattered glass.
*  That's a Chinese torture?
*  That's what I heard.
*  How do they get you hard?
*  Ah, there's ways.
*  You know, you bring a lady in or a small boy.
*  You know, you do what you got to do.
*  Or a pile of money.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  So who are you voting for?
*  Nah, just kidding.
*  I'm joking.
*  What a whirlwind you're in, huh?
*  Strange.
*  Strange to watch it take place because it's so obvious what it is.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  I'm not that balls deep into this stuff.
*  Yeah.
*  It's not.
*  I'm not the guy.
*  It's very strange and this is a little out of left field, but how much of this is based
*  on your look?
*  If you weren't a muscular, bald-headed white guy, I don't know if this would be a different
*  game.
*  Well, it's easy to paint me as a douchebag.
*  Right.
*  And also what's really funny is the thing that I said in the video was exactly what
*  they did.
*  I said if you just take the worst aspects of someone, take out everything else, magnify
*  it, and you can paint them out to be a real piece of shit.
*  Of course.
*  I have 10 texts today.
*  But what I said is that it's hard to do that with Bernie because he's a really consistent
*  guy.
*  He's the real deal.
*  He was out in the front lines in the 60s with the civil rights.
*  Right.
*  Getting changed to people and getting arrested.
*  Yeah.
*  He was.
*  That doesn't mean he's going to be a great president.
*  No, of course not.
*  I don't know what's required to be a president.
*  I really don't.
*  And I don't understand what's required to make sure the economy functions correctly
*  And also I don't understand what's required to make the military function correctly.
*  No.
*  It's just guesswork.
*  I mean, maybe we're better off with Trump.
*  Maybe we're better off with someone else.
*  I don't know.
*  But what was fascinating to me was that these people, like fucking CNN, printed something
*  saying that I was homophobic and transphobic.
*  And there's a clip that they're using that's completely out of context.
*  That the only, look, as far as trans people, some trans people listening to this, I got
*  nothing but love for you.
*  For everybody.
*  And in fact, Eddie Izzard is one of my all time favorite guests.
*  Oh, I love Izzard.
*  And he's one of the most inspirational and brilliant people I've ever met.
*  I love that guy.
*  And he's probably one of the most public trans people and the first most public celebrities
*  to go trans.
*  I don't care.
*  Nobody cares.
*  But this had to do with fighting.
*  This had to do with a man.
*  Oh, that's what it is.
*  This was what I was saying in the video that they're using was me saying, you're a fucking
*  man.
*  Definitely shouldn't use those words.
*  But this is why I was upset.
*  There was a guy, this person was a man for 30 years, transitioned to become a woman for
*  two years and then started fighting women in MMA and didn't tell them that she used
*  to be a man.
*  And was smashing girls.
*  She literally broke this girl's skull.
*  Like broke her face and was kind of bragging about it.
*  Like she was, you know, she was hyping up her MMA career, right?
*  And then people found out that she was a trans woman and she used to be a man.
*  And she said that she didn't have to disclose that because it was a medical procedure and
*  it had nothing to do, it wasn't their business.
*  Very shady.
*  I was like, bullshit.
*  Now here's the thing.
*  If she disclosed it and everyone knew, I'm 100% in favor of it.
*  If you want to do that, if you're a woman and it's your choice to fight a trans woman
*  and see how you do.
*  And in fact, a woman who eventually went and fought in the UFC, a girl named Ashley Evan
*  Smith, who's a really good fighter, like, you know, UFC caliber fighter, unlike this
*  other woman who was the trans woman.
*  That trans woman is just really strong.
*  She wasn't the same caliber as a world-class martial artist.
*  Ashley Evan Smith actually won at beating her.
*  Oh yeah?
*  Yes.
*  And then she fought in the UFC afterwards.
*  Can we see a photo of this girl?
*  It's not.
*  Oh, I just want to know, does it look like a dude?
*  A little.
*  They couldn't tell?
*  A masculine woman.
*  Okay.
*  When he was a dude, he looked like a guy, like a bro.
*  And then when he became a woman, he looked, you know, like a little, yeah, definitely
*  you could say he was a woman.
*  A dude lady.
*  But I, you know, I was like, get the fuck out of here.
*  You're a fucking man.
*  And so they take it out.
*  He's so transphobic.
*  Like, not, I'm not.
*  Listen, this is-
*  Yeah, you just don't want people to get hurt.
*  This has only to do with athletics.
*  That's it.
*  In terms of your gender identity and who you are and what you want to do, I don't care.
*  And specifically my wheelhouse, which is fighting.
*  There is a gigantic physical advantage that men have in that particular sport.
*  Well, we all know that when a guy hits a girl in the street, there's a different vibe than
*  when a girl hits a guy.
*  That's the problem is that's what the fights looked like.
*  The fights looked like a guy hitting a girl.
*  And he's, you know, also fighting people that aren't that skilled.
*  It's a low level MMA promotion, you know.
*  And then when it came out, there was all this outrage.
*  But what was really fascinating was how many people were mad at me but didn't have an equal
*  amount of, they weren't equally upset that this woman was deceptive about the fact that
*  she was trans.
*  It's bad for the cause.
*  If you're really in support of transgender people, it's very bad for the cause if you
*  have a transgender woman that doesn't disclose she's transgender and is beating the fuck
*  out of biological women.
*  And here's one of the big problems with it, ultimately.
*  The ones who get fucked over are biological women.
*  In this whole race to be woke and including transgender women in female sports, biological
*  women are the ones getting fucked over.
*  When these trans women are winning world records and becoming world champions.
*  It's, you know, it's where the rubber meets the road between pragmatic, objective people
*  that are analyzing all the facts and people who want to stick with a woke ideology and
*  they don't want to hear it on the other side.
*  So this is the big one that people are calling me out on.
*  The other one is the homophobia one is like, come on, man.
*  Look, I have nothing but love for gay people.
*  Nothing but love.
*  I love gay people, but I make fun of them.
*  I make fun of me.
*  I make fun of my mom.
*  I'll make fun of you when you're here.
*  I'll make fun of you when you leave.
*  It doesn't mean I don't love them.
*  Like I was saying before, one of my most popular memes online is in support of gay marriage.
*  And it says, if you hate gay marriage, it's because of one or two reasons.
*  Either you're dumb or you're secretly worried that dicks are delicious.
*  That has been shared fucking millions of times.
*  In fact, I had a gay strong man in here.
*  I saw that.
*  Yeah.
*  And he was the world's strongest gay.
*  And he was talking about Rob Kearney was talking about how hilarious he thought that was.
*  And he had seen that as one of the first exposures that he had to me.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, they're just looking for shit to pin to you.
*  That's all.
*  It's to marginalize him.
*  And it's also people that don't want anyone who's not woke to represent anything on the
*  left.
*  Yeah.
*  If you're going to be on the left, there's a lot of people.
*  First of all, I should say this before I say anything about the blowback.
*  The positive side, like the support that I've gotten from people because it has been overwhelming
*  and really heartwarming from so many from great comics and scientists and people that
*  have had on the podcast.
*  Psychology Today wrote an article about how the media is gaslighting you on me.
*  Yeah.
*  Like they're like, they're trying to paint this guy out to be this monster.
*  Like have I said stupid shit?
*  A hundred percent.
*  I've done 1400 plus podcasts.
*  A lot of them high, like a giant percentage of I said a bunch of stupid shit.
*  I couldn't even believe why I was saying it.
*  I like to say inappropriate words.
*  I do it all the time.
*  Why?
*  Because it's fun.
*  Yes.
*  Because we're comics.
*  It might hurt some people.
*  Yeah, but some people like it.
*  I like saying words you're not supposed to say sometimes, but it doesn't mean I'm homophobic
*  or racist or sexist or misogynistic or transphobic.
*  These things aren't true.
*  I love everybody.
*  Like literally, if you're a nice person, I will love you.
*  I'm cool with everybody.
*  The weird thing is they want it to be true.
*  Why?
*  It's not even about the justice or helping people.
*  It's about nailing a guy down.
*  It feels more like vindictive and we want to hurt you than it does let's save the world.
*  It's more like if you go, I'm actually not, they go, ah, whatever.
*  Well there's a couple things going on.
*  One, this podcast has gotten way too big and it actually can influence elections.
*  Oh.
*  That's real.
*  Do you like that?
*  That's terrifying.
*  No, it's not good.
*  I don't think I want to have anything to do with politics after this.
*  No, same.
*  I'm sorry I asked the question.
*  No, but I'd rather talk to you.
*  Okay.
*  I'd rather talk to you than ever talk about this shit and have politicians on and not
*  know whether or not they're full of shit or not.
*  Congratulations.
*  I don't know anything about politics.
*  I don't follow it.
*  People are obsessed.
*  It's taking over too much time in your day.
*  It burns too many calories.
*  The people get so passionate about it.
*  It's all changing and it's all silly.
*  I would love if they revamped the system and made it so there was like a council of really
*  smart people who get to decide on things.
*  Think tank.
*  Get the smartest people in here, not the most likable.
*  And get them fed them, give them at least a micro dose of mushrooms before they make
*  their decisions.
*  I mean Obama hated gay marriage, but we all like him.
*  I don't think he hated gay marriage.
*  Or he was against it.
*  He was doing that for political reasons because he was trying to attract a certain amount
*  of people that were on the right.
*  And it's a ploy, right?
*  They have to play their hands carefully.
*  They're playing chess.
*  They give up a pawn.
*  What's the difference though?
*  He could have swayed the election.
*  I mean he was in charge of shit so he could make policies.
*  Well Hillary Clinton didn't believe in gay marriage until 2013.
*  There you go.
*  That's weird.
*  But it's not real.
*  It's in their world.
*  That's what it is.
*  The world of politics.
*  They're giving up a pawn.
*  They're making a concession.
*  Right.
*  Exactly.
*  And so what this is, is take me down to make Bernie look bad because Bernie dared to post
*  one of my videos.
*  In the meantime, Bernie has surged to number one in the polls.
*  Oh, is that right?
*  Yes.
*  He's number one in the polls and number one for the first time in the betting polls.
*  So it's like look, I don't know if it's good or bad.
*  Well it's like Chappelle.
*  Chappelle hates Chappelle.
*  He's the transphobic guy of the year.
*  Whatever.
*  He's won the Grammy three years in a row for best comedy album and he just won the Mark
*  Twain award.
*  So it's like we talk a big game and we complain and bitch and moan but I think the real shit's
*  out there.
*  Well even more telling.
*  When Rotten Tomatoes only let five woke critics judge his special, he had a zero percent on
*  Rotten Tomatoes.
*  Exactly.
*  Then when they let the general public do it, it jumped up to 99 percent.
*  99, yeah.
*  Which is fucking unheard of.
*  I know.
*  This is weird, right?
*  I mean we do it but the people with the big voices and the loudest people are all going
*  oh, what are you going to do?
*  They never chime in on that shit.
*  Right now you are one of the loudest people.
*  Oh shit.
*  And here's the other thing.
*  That's terrifying.
*  Those people that are the other loudest people out there are all being employed by giant
*  companies.
*  Ah, is that what it is.
*  Now if you're a part of a giant media company, we don't even have to say any names, you have
*  to make arrangements with political parties and candidates.
*  They will give you access to candidates but in exchange they would like you to run certain
*  stories, they would like you to cover things, they would like you to not cover other things.
*  I mean you're seeing this anti Bernie Sanders push across the board.
*  Hillary Clinton just came out and said that nobody likes him.
*  I saw that.
*  She said that.
*  Why would you say that?
*  The guy campaigned for you.
*  What are you an eight year old?
*  Nobody likes him.
*  Exactly.
*  And she said that he's a career politician.
*  Like...
*  What does that mean?
*  Were you involved in industry before this?
*  Did you manufacture televisions?
*  What did you do before?
*  You're a lawyer for a little bit.
*  Okay.
*  Aren't you a career politician?
*  Your husband's clearly a career politician.
*  This is a crazy thing to say.
*  And then there's a lot of people that are in support of Elizabeth Warren that were trying
*  to push the narrative that Bernie Sanders is sexist.
*  This helps that narrative.
*  Because Elizabeth Warren was saying that.
*  She said that he had said to her that a woman could never be president.
*  Did you ever see that exchange where the two of them were on CNN?
*  I heard about it.
*  I try not to watch anything.
*  Good for you.
*  But, so this is what it's been for me just to watch all this play out.
*  But...
*  This is the first time I've seen you rattled by the way.
*  You're usually cool as a cucumber.
*  You look a little...
*  I just want to make sure that I say it the way I think it.
*  All right.
*  Get it out.
*  But that's why.
*  If I feel...
*  If I look rattled.
*  But the positive thing...
*  It's okay to be rattled.
*  Has been the outpouring of support by so many people.
*  It's been overwhelming.
*  And then the support to negatives, the ratio is incredible.
*  So it's awesome.
*  Well, the good news is everyone who knows you likes you.
*  All the people who are saying shit have probably never met you or don't even listen to the
*  pod.
*  But this is a...
*  Well, even listening to the podcast, you don't know me that well.
*  But this is a part of the problem with human beings communicating through social media.
*  Social media is the worst way.
*  Twitter or something that is the worst way to either know someone, express a feeling,
*  or show any compassion.
*  And no one...
*  This is one of the reasons why cancel culture is so ripe.
*  Because this is the best way to cancel something.
*  Through a tweet, fuck you.
*  Look at how many comics did that with Louis.
*  After the Louis CK thing went down, there was a bunch of comics that were like, now
*  is my chance.
*  I'm going to move up the ladder.
*  And Tim Dillon posted this awesome Instagram post about that, recognizing that.
*  Let's see what this is.
*  A lot of these people that are VirtuSign are these insanely mediocre, untalented comedians.
*  That tends to be.
*  You don't see Michelle Wolf or Michael Che and all this shit.
*  Exactly.
*  Especially when the leaked audio came out.
*  People are like, oh, he's leaning into it.
*  He's all right now.
*  Listen, Louis CK has always said the most inappropriate shit that's funny.
*  Go back and...
*  You guys aren't even fans.
*  Well, when you tweet, the remorse is much smaller.
*  Like canceling a guy through the computer, you're not going to feel as much guilt and
*  shame and meanness.
*  You don't feel anything.
*  It's through a keyboard.
*  You don't feel anything.
*  I'm hoping that social media will evolve to something that people that somehow or another
*  allow people to be more compassionate to each other.
*  Maybe we'll just understand how to use it better and understand the consequence.
*  Maybe when everybody gets canceled.
*  Right.
*  Well, it's like you can't drink and drive, but you can drink and tweet.
*  It's career suicide instead of auto manslaughter.
*  We know the Justine Sacco story.
*  No.
*  Is that the AIDS chick?
*  Yes.
*  Yeah, that's amazing.
*  She was on her way to Africa.
*  She was...
*  I think she took an Ambien and she was drinking.
*  And she's like, going to Africa, hope I don't get AIDS.
*  Just kidding, I'm white, lol.
*  That's a good tweet.
*  It's a good joke.
*  It's a joke, a Mark Norman joke in a lot of ways.
*  Thank you.
*  It is in a lot of ways, right?
*  That's kind of like something that you would say as a joke.
*  I get it.
*  I don't know if I'd go with the white angle, but I like it.
*  What would you say instead of white?
*  Because white people do get AIDS, so it doesn't really make sense logically.
*  Right, but when you're on Ambien and you're fucking liquored up.
*  Oh, Ambien, man.
*  You only have a couple minutes before the flight takes off and you lose cellular.
*  Yeah, yeah, you misspell a few things.
*  You're like, fuck, I can't go back.
*  I know.
*  It's fucking hectic when you try to get a tweet off on the runway.
*  I know.
*  It's true.
*  And then the whole flight, you're waiting.
*  You don't buy the Wi-Fi.
*  Headed to Cincinnati, buy tickets at marknorman.com.
*  Fuck, fuck, fuck.
*  I didn't spell Norman right.
*  Right, right, right.
*  I misspelled my own name.
*  The whole world would change if Twitter gave you like 10 seconds of edit time.
*  Yeah.
*  We'd change the whole world.
*  Roseanne would be on the air.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, at the end of the day with all this shit, my feelings about all this are it's
*  interesting to see.
*  It's interesting to see the hate brigade come my way.
*  And it's interesting.
*  It's very heartwarming to see support.
*  Yes.
*  So, you know, at the end of the day, I've got a giant body of work.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  You can only lie so much about what I am and what I've done.
*  You know, when people watch the Elon Musk interview, they're not like, look at all the homophobia.
*  Right.
*  He hates women in that interview.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like nonsense.
*  Like, have I made inappropriate jokes?
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  I'm a comedian.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  When you, and especially if you're drinking and you're smoking pot, you're swinging, right?
*  You know how it is when we're doing this.
*  Of course, of course.
*  Pitches are coming your way.
*  You're like, I'm going in.
*  Yeah.
*  And you don't hit the ball.
*  You're like, ah.
*  Last time I was here, I made eight jokes about fucking kids.
*  It's funny because it's so extreme.
*  Like a racist joke.
*  It's funny because racism is stupid.
*  These people, they're grasping at straws.
*  They got nothing.
*  It's not real racism.
*  It's a joke.
*  Yeah.
*  Not hiring a guy because he's brown is racism.
*  Exactly.
*  Come on.
*  What are we doing?
*  Exactly.
*  And they just know that the word racism is going to get some eyeballs.
*  It's going to get some shit stirring up.
*  Well, that was the crazy thing about the CNN articles.
*  They put in all the isms.
*  All the isms and all the obias and like, they're not applicable.
*  A history of these things.
*  There's a history of these things.
*  Well, there might be a history of jokes, but there's no history of actual homophobia, actual
*  transphobia other than me calling that guy a man who beat the fuck out of women.
*  But I don't understand why people weren't upset that that woman who used to be a guy
*  was doing that.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a little harsh.
*  Literally.
*  You're worried about women.
*  No one cared about that woman.
*  Nobody wanted to interview that woman and say, hey, are you okay?
*  Well, that's how deep in the shit.
*  That's how deep in we are.
*  I'd rather have her head split than me get canceled.
*  And again, I'm 100% for anyone who knows that that's a transgender woman fighting that woman.
*  Consensual.
*  Yes.
*  And here's a perfect example of it.
*  The former UFC featherweight champion is, her name is Jermaine Duran to me, and she's
*  a fucking assassin.
*  She's a beast.
*  She's a 10 time world Muay Thai champion.
*  I mean, just one of the most technical fighters in the sport.
*  She's super badass.
*  She fought a man and fucked him up.
*  Is that right?
*  You can watch it online.
*  She KO'd him.
*  Wow.
*  She KO'd a man with a right hand.
*  She's a fucking killer, man.
*  Was he a fighter guy?
*  He knew how to fight.
*  He was swinging.
*  Oh, wow.
*  Oh, that guy's gotta hit him, bro.
*  She knew better.
*  She's a world champion.
*  I mean, she's...
*  Sure.
*  But look, if she wanted to do that and he wanted to do that, I'm fine.
*  If he pretended he was a girl and he went and tried to fuck her up, then I'd be like,
*  you're an asshole.
*  That's what this is.
*  It's just about deception.
*  I'm not against trans people.
*  I think when you're talking about trans athletics, when Martina Navratilova, who is outspoken
*  lesbian, who is one of the greatest tennis players of world, world class tennis players,
*  world champion, one of the greatest of all time.
*  She the hot one?
*  When she comes out, no.
*  When she comes out, and she did, coming out against trans athletes competing with women,
*  the outpouring of hate that came her way.
*  Oh, really?
*  Yes.
*  People are calling her transphobic and this and that.
*  Look, this hasn't been settled.
*  If you look at the actual facts, the number of world records, the number of champions,
*  the number of people that are now trans, it's getting weird.
*  What is it, the International Olympic Weightlifting Federation, one of those fucking...
*  The powerlifting federation, whatever judges that, they recently came out and said, we
*  are no longer allowing transgender women to...
*  Oh, really?
*  Yeah, because they're breaking all the world records.
*  Oh, but are they in trouble now?
*  I think it's justified.
*  I think that's one of the ones where people are like, well, yeah, you're winning by 200
*  pounds.
*  Ah, yes.
*  It's like you're taking people and they lose some of their strength when they go through
*  the transition, they lose some of their strength when they go through estrogen therapy, but
*  there's, god damn it, there's a lot going on there.
*  There's tendon strength.
*  There's the size of the bones, the hand strength, the size of the hands.
*  There's the shape of the hips, the shape of the shoulders.
*  There's more, you can generate more power.
*  There's also a lifetime of having testosterone running through your body.
*  It's almost like a woman who's taking steroids her whole life and then quits when she's 30.
*  She's still gonna have giant advantages.
*  Sure, but how come you don't see it the other way, do you?
*  You don't see it the other way.
*  You don't see the man or the woman becoming a man and then entering a man category.
*  Yes, imagine a woman who transitions to becoming a man and then fighting an MMA.
*  Good luck.
*  Good luck on Nate Diaz, you know?
*  Yeah, well there's a woman who was a woman and then transitioned to a man who is now
*  a boxer who is a spokesperson for, I wanna say, Everlast or like, Edidas, like a big
*  company now has this transgender female to male boxer, which again, I'm all in.
*  Look, I don't even think you have to say anything if that's the case.
*  There it is.
*  Now, how many fights does this person have?
*  Wait, this was a woman?
*  Was a woman.
*  Okay.
*  But here's another problem with this.
*  Ready?
*  In order to transition, you have to take testosterone.
*  Ooh, so now you're taking supplements.
*  As a woman, Manuel was a USA national amateur boxing champion.
*  He was invited to compete in the 2012 Olympic trials.
*  However, a shoulder injury during Olympic qualifying changed everything.
*  So how many fights?
*  Manuel.
*  When Manuel, scroll back, back, back.
*  Confusing to have man in the name.
*  Manuel was recovering from the injury.
*  He decided, well you can say he back then.
*  See, they're saying he a lot.
*  Okay, so you say he.
*  So much work.
*  Because he was already a he.
*  When he was recovering from the injury, that's when he was a girl.
*  But let's keep using the same name.
*  When Manuel was recovering from the injury, he decided to transition from female to male.
*  It proved to be the toughest fight of his life.
*  He was shunned.
*  Has he had any fights?
*  As a male?
*  Scroll up there.
*  Battle it all against all odds.
*  Went his way back to the sport.
*  Became the first person competing in a professional boxing match as a transgender fighter.
*  On December 8th, 2018, Manuel climbed to the ring against Hugo Aguilar at a Fantasy Spring
*  Resort Casino in Indio, California and came out a winner.
*  There you go.
*  Six-year journey.
*  Absolutely worth the wait.
*  There you go.
*  Congratulations to Manuel.
*  Look, I'm all for that too.
*  Yeah.
*  My take on that is there's only one issue.
*  That issue is Manuel, to transition, has to take testosterone.
*  So how much testosterone?
*  And who's monitoring it?
*  And how often are the tests?
*  Because if you have, especially some women, particularly African American women, have
*  dense bones.
*  Really?
*  They have really good bone density.
*  Yeah, oftentimes rivaling European males.
*  Maybe we should segregate racially.
*  LOL.
*  Well, they're just too good.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know about that.
*  Black people are so good at sports.
*  Well, Canelo Alvarez, one of the best boxers in the world.
*  Pretty redhead.
*  Oh, he's good.
*  Fucking awesome.
*  Yeah, he's really good.
*  Gennady Golovkin, pretty fucking awesome.
*  All right.
*  Russian.
*  What was that, the white Mike Tyson guy?
*  He had something.
*  Who's that?
*  Oh, he was big.
*  Tommy Gunn?
*  Oh, no.
*  Tommy Morrison?
*  Wasn't he good?
*  Yeah, he was good.
*  Yeah, he's a good fighter.
*  Yeah, a good fighter.
*  But he got fucked up by a lot of other, like Ray Mercer.
*  Uh-uh.
*  Worst knockout in the history of the heavyweight division, I think.
*  Oh, wow.
*  Because he got caught in the ropes.
*  Oh!
*  He got caught in the ropes and Ray Mercer, who was an Olympic gold medalist and a murderous
*  puncher, just fucking smashing him.
*  Oh, that's brutal.
*  Just his head.
*  No protection at all.
*  He's not putting his hands up.
*  He's trapped.
*  So it's just bang, bang, bang, bang.
*  Oh, I can't watch this.
*  And he was never the same again.
*  But he did go on to beat George Foreman.
*  Beat George Foreman by decision.
*  Beat Donovan, Razor, Ruddock by stoppage.
*  A guy who went the distance with Mike Tyson.
*  There you go.
*  Tommy Gunn was a good fighter.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  That's one for Whitey.
*  One for Whitey.
*  That's it.
*  Just one.
*  There's a few.
*  We had Marciano.
*  What was it?
*  Rocky.
*  What's his face?
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Rocky Marciano.
*  Yeah, and Lamada was pretty good.
*  He beat Sugar Ray a few times.
*  Yeah, well, Vasily Lomachenko is probably one of the best pound-for-pound fighters on
*  the planet Earth today.
*  And he's another one who's Russian, but Russians are different.
*  They're white people.
*  Yeah, they're like Whitey 2.0.
*  Yeah, they're Whitey 2.0.
*  That's a good one.
*  They're just fucking hard people, man.
*  They're tough.
*  They're tough.
*  Which shows you it's not really about the skin.
*  It's about your environment.
*  That's a lot of it.
*  And the genes.
*  I mean, there's certain people in all...
*  I mean, there's body styles, right?
*  There's endomorph, ectomorph, and mesomorph.
*  And there's certain people that have advantages based on the amount of fast-twitch muscle
*  fibers, the size of their fists, different sports.
*  There's different sort of benefits to different body types and different sports.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  But, you know, with this...
*  Asian's ping-pong.
*  I think it's just really popular over there, right?
*  Oh, no, they're great.
*  I think it's Chinese, but I don't want to get in trouble.
*  But I think it's because it's really popular, right?
*  Ah, maybe.
*  I don't know if they're...
*  Do you think they have a physical advantage?
*  I don't know.
*  They just seem to have a knack for that pong.
*  They have a lot of killer pool players over there.
*  Really?
*  Well, that's all metrics.
*  It's all physics, you know, and they're smart people.
*  It's also very popular.
*  It's very popular over there.
*  Pool is huge in the Philippines.
*  Really?
*  Oh my God, gigantic.
*  Some of the greatest players of all time come from the Philippines.
*  I didn't know that.
*  Yeah, there's a guy named Efren Reyes.
*  I got a signed photograph of him out there on the wall by the pool table.
*  The hot Asian lady with the black hair, long black hair.
*  Oh, yeah, Jeanette Lee, the black widow.
*  Oh, man, she was great.
*  She's a beast.
*  You ever watch those trick shots?
*  Killer pool player.
*  They're unbelievable.
*  I could do three days on YouTube with those trick shots.
*  Oh, dude, I wind down at the end of the night every night watching pool.
*  Oh, look at that.
*  Because I used to be hard to find pool matches on television.
*  Right.
*  It's hard.
*  ESPN doesn't have them.
*  I'd set it in my DVR, look for billiards.
*  Because I used to play a lot, all day long when I lived in New York.
*  I played tournaments.
*  I was more obsessed with pool than I was with almost anything.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  If there was money in professional pool, I probably would have quit doing stand-up.
*  What?
*  Yes.
*  You know, like a pool grift, like a bar brouhaha.
*  Like get hustled?
*  Yeah, and then you like snap the stick and go, come on, motherfucker, come at me.
*  Most that's nonsense.
*  I don't know.
*  From the color of money.
*  Artie Lang's got some stories out in Newark.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, he's hanging out with dirtbags.
*  I mean, I've had guys yell at me and stuff like that, but not because I was beating them.
*  I was never that good.
*  I went to real pool halls.
*  There's a place called West End Billiards in New Jersey.
*  I know West End Billiards.
*  It doesn't exist anymore.
*  I've seen it.
*  And there's also Amsterdam.
*  I go to Amsterdam every time I'm in New York.
*  Yeah.
*  All right.
*  I play with professionals.
*  Like I used to play a lot of tournaments with professionals.
*  But there was never any like, you never had the guy with a pretend like he had a gimp?
*  No.
*  None of that?
*  That's all movies?
*  No, no.
*  I mean, I had guys try to hustle me.
*  One of my best friends, my friend Johnny B. I met him because he tried to hustle me.
*  But I could just tell, talk.
*  I knew I wasn't very good.
*  I was just starting out.
*  I was just playing and he was really good.
*  And he's like, come on, let's play a game.
*  You know, I'll give you a spot.
*  I'm like, get the fuck out of here.
*  And he's like, oh, you're too smart.
*  I was never good enough to hustle and I was never good enough to beat the really good
*  players, but I was obsessed with it.
*  Yeah.
*  What was my point?
*  Oh, so I, every night when I wind down, the way I wind down, I like to watch pool.
*  All right.
*  So it's, it's even when it's crazy, it's like not that crazy.
*  Right.
*  It's a good winder because if you watch like street fights, you're all keyed up.
*  Oh, I can't watch those.
*  Oh, you know what I hate most in anything in street fights is when the dude's heads bounce
*  off the concrete.
*  Oh, brutal, brutal.
*  There's one, there's this Puerto Rican dude and this other guy and the guy doesn't know
*  how to fight and the Puerto Rican dude does.
*  And you could see they're standing in front of each other in the street and he just crack.
*  And the guy goes, and you see him like sideways, his head bounces off and his girlfriend goes,
*  get in the car puppy.
*  And he jumps in the car and takes off.
*  Oh my God.
*  See, they think it's a movie and then the real life kicks in.
*  Well, some people are, they're just fronting and they think they're going to get away with it.
*  And then the other guy is actually a boxer.
*  And that was the case here.
*  That guy, he threw an educated punch.
*  Like he knew what he was doing and he caught that guy right in the jaw and he went out his head.
*  He had to bounce.
*  There's a fucking this thing.
*  Ah, that kills me.
*  It's like, it kills people all the time, man.
*  Dude, I grew up in Louisiana and these like corn fed white guys with polo shirts and Doc Martens
*  and short short blue shorts with the woven belt.
*  They would get to these brawls, these big white motherfuckers and they would just like kick them in the face
*  when they're down like a soccer kick.
*  Like you'd just be outside the bar.
*  Like I just watched the guy get his jaw broken on a Friday night at one in the morning
*  and he'd just go back in the bar.
*  I mean, it was horrific.
*  Horrific.
*  They slamming people in the cars and kneeing them in the face.
*  Bar fights, man.
*  How many people have died in bar fights?
*  I know, I know.
*  Fucking terrible.
*  Yeah, the jaw gets wired.
*  You see the guy the next week has got that neck brace, you know.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Ah, dude.
*  Brutal.
*  Yeah.
*  All for what?
*  Because somebody bumped into you?
*  Exactly.
*  Just spilled your beer?
*  Well, just people looking for fights and then they get a little bit of booze in them and,
*  you know, they're mad because their girlfriend's fucking some new guy.
*  I guess so.
*  And they're like, god damn it, fucking bitch.
*  I don't have that in me.
*  I don't have that anger.
*  Congratulations.
*  But I'm not bragging.
*  I like to booze it up.
*  I like to smash some gash and have a good time and do some shrooms and, you know, eat a lady out.
*  But I can't imagine wanting to kick a guy in the face while he's on the ground.
*  No.
*  It's not good.
*  That's a rage.
*  Maybe he was beaten or he's deeply closeted or something's going on there.
*  Well, it's like some men grow up getting their asses kicked.
*  I guess so.
*  And you grow up getting abused.
*  It's one of the things that I would notice in high school.
*  The kids that would want to fight all the time, they were getting abused at home.
*  Ah.
*  There was a lot of that.
*  Right.
*  And they don't have as much guilt about it.
*  They'll just smash your face.
*  Exactly.
*  I would be like, oh shit, I'm sorry.
*  Someone's been doing that to them, whether it's their older brother or they're getting bullied.
*  And so they bully people back.
*  You know that old expression, hurt people, hurt people.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And that's, you know, when people like to hurt people.
*  That was the thing that I hated the most about fighting was when I would knock someone out.
*  Yes.
*  It would weird me out.
*  I get it, man.
*  I would try to celebrate.
*  I would just try to like.
*  And then after a while I started not celebrating.
*  I would just walk away.
*  Yeah.
*  I'd be like, that's actually probably a better move anyway.
*  It looks cooler.
*  Because I would just smash somebody.
*  I would kick them and then they would go down.
*  I'm like, that dude's not getting up.
*  I'm just going to walk away like this always happens.
*  And then after a while it kind of always happened.
*  Yeah.
*  Like in MMA when they just knock the guy down and they walk away, they don't even cheap hammer fisting.
*  Well, it's a thing.
*  It's like when guys do that, they're letting you know like, I know this is the end.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't have to follow this up.
*  Right.
*  There's a feeling that you get when you hit someone and you see their eyes roll back like, you know.
*  You know.
*  But some guys are so savage.
*  They don't give a fuck.
*  Even after the guys like the most famous one to me was Dan Henderson knocked out Michael
*  Bisping.
*  It was so clear that he was out and Dan Henderson flew through the air and smashed him with
*  a punch on the way down.
*  Then he made that silhouette his logo.
*  So Google Dan Harrison's logo.
*  Because it's one of, look, they had like this epic shit talking session.
*  And then actually Michael Bisping went on to beat Dan Henderson in a rematch, which was
*  huge for the title.
*  I like when they have a shit talking because I feel weird when they tap gloves and then
*  try to murder each other.
*  Look at that belief.
*  That is him.
*  See, look at that.
*  That literally is his silhouette when he was, you know, I mean, you can't, it's hard to
*  say it's a cheap shot because the reality is he knocked him out.
*  Well, he knew the guy was out, but you're kind of supposed to keep punching until the
*  referee pulls you off and the referee wasn't in the right place to pull him off.
*  Damn.
*  But that's kind of crazy that that's his logo.
*  Of course.
*  Dan Henderson is a fucking savage.
*  Yikes.
*  He's the last person you want to piss off.
*  Yeah, that's too much.
*  That'd be like Cosby having a logo of like a lady sleeping.
*  Look at that.
*  Not sure why Michael Bisping doesn't like my logo.
*  He isn't even in it.
*  Aw, this guy's harsh.
*  Savage.
*  Damn.
*  Hey, he's a fucking world champion.
*  That's the kind of mentality that you have to have to be the kind of, I mean, he was
*  a, I think he was a two division champion in Pride.
*  I think he won that.
*  Yeah, I know he did.
*  He won the 85 pound title and the 205 pound title.
*  Monster.
*  Yikes.
*  One of the greats.
*  And he was a woman.
*  No, he is now though.
*  No.
*  The whole thing is kooky.
*  He's a they.
*  He's a they now.
*  He's not a woman.
*  Okay, perfect.
*  Okay, that's easy.
*  Yeah, they be's.
*  It's in it weird now that like the nicest thing you can say about a person is, I don't agree
*  with everything they say, but I still like them.
*  It's like, I hate that we have to do that now.
*  That's so narcissistic.
*  I disagree with some of the things.
*  I gotta let everybody know that.
*  Yeah.
*  I hate that.
*  Can't you just like a guy?
*  I wonder if narcissism, if you could track narcissism on a chart, I wonder if it's ramped
*  up because of social media.
*  Whoa, are you kidding?
*  Of course.
*  What do you mean?
*  But right, it is like something that you feed, right?
*  I mean.
*  It is a psychological condition that you also probably can treat.
*  I don't know.
*  I think we're too far in.
*  Yeah, but if you have narcissism and you get humbled by life, you take some L's in your
*  life.
*  Yeah, what you need.
*  You sort of, you need, everybody does.
*  Yeah.
*  You also, maybe you grow older and wiser and you realize this is stupid, you keep making
*  duck faces on a selfie stick.
*  You know that, have you ever seen this image?
*  There's a fucking photo, it's one of my favorite photos, a candid photo.
*  There's a girl on a lounge chair with her ass up in the air and she's holding a selfie
*  stick and the guy is taking a picture of her taking this picture of how fucking ridiculous
*  it is.
*  She's literally got her ass straight up in the air and she's got this selfie stick.
*  So she's doing this and she's on a lounge chair by the side of the pool.
*  And he caught it.
*  And I think like the capture is like 2019 be like.
*  It's true.
*  I mean, back in the day to get on TV, you'd have to earn it.
*  There it is.
*  Look, look.
*  Oh, that's classic.
*  That is classic.
*  Still loving our generation.
*  That's what it is.
*  Come on.
*  Okay, it's Barstool Sports.
*  Look at that.
*  That is so crazy.
*  I bet she nailed that photo though.
*  Look at all the work she put in.
*  Dude, the dicks that must have come into her DM like a sleepy river filled with lumber
*  just rolling towards her DM.
*  A logging camp.
*  Yeah.
*  Just a fucking a lumber boat overturned.
*  Well, like in the 80s or 90s to get on a camera, you had to walk by like a TV store.
*  I remember you'd be like, oh shit, I'm on it.
*  You remember we'd look out at you and that was like a big deal.
*  But now it's just in your pocket.
*  Now it's so easy.
*  Then you can put out into the world and anybody can be on YouTube.
*  Anybody can have an Instagram.
*  Yeah.
*  And your whole life.
*  People just storing everything now.
*  It's like, it's too easy.
*  It's me, me, me.
*  Your voice is counted.
*  It sucks.
*  Yeah.
*  That's the thing too.
*  Opinions are counted from the time you're 12 on.
*  Right.
*  Your opinion.
*  If you have a 12 year old moron and he writes a tweet, it looks just like a scholar.
*  Exactly.
*  It's got the same font.
*  Exactly.
*  It's got the same spelling.
*  It's auto correct.
*  So it corrects the words.
*  Like you fucking idiot.
*  That could be from a 12 year old or it could be from a 50 year old guy who works at Stanford.
*  Right, right.
*  And it's written.
*  So you just kind of buy it.
*  This is this guy's thoughts.
*  Yes, yes.
*  I know.
*  It's terrifying, man.
*  What's also interesting, Louis CK had a funny thought on this that really resonated.
*  He was like, it's when people say things on Twitter, it's just talk.
*  It's written down.
*  So everyone's like, look, look, look, look what he said.
*  Like people say crazy shit all the time.
*  And we're used to saying like fuck that guy.
*  But you should write fuck that guy on Twitter.
*  Look, he said fuck that guy.
*  Yeah, it's written.
*  It's official.
*  It's written.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like people have said things about people since the beginning of time and then you go,
*  why'd you say that?
*  And I'm like, I'm sorry, dude.
*  I was fucking drunk and I was mad and my girlfriend broke up with me.
*  That kind of shit and people get over it.
*  But if it's written and then people retweet, oh yeah, I remember when he said this about
*  you.
*  Oh, he tried to delete it but I got a photo of it.
*  How many times do you talk shit about a comic and then you walk in the green room and he's
*  sitting there and you're like, oh hey, what's up buddy?
*  Hi, fella.
*  Thank God you were just talking.
*  But it wasn't written.
*  Now it's not official.
*  Now it's not on paper.
*  Well, it's, you know, look, most of us deserve to have some shit said about us every now
*  and again.
*  Yeah.
*  But the loudest people are the ones who have a lot of shit and they yell at you before you
*  find their shit.
*  Oh, that's what's always really fun to find out, right?
*  Every green room I go to, there's all this shit on Twitter.
*  Then I go in the green room and I go, we don't agree with that, right?
*  And they go, no, come on, it's crazy.
*  Then you go back to your bullshit life on, I know a guy who's like an animal activist.
*  And he kicks his dog.
*  No.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's like, I go to his apartment, he's kicking his dog, like, hey, get out of there.
*  And he kicks it in the ribs.
*  You're like, you're the animal guy.
*  You kicked it hard?
*  How many you get to yelp?
*  You get like a rrr.
*  Oh, Jesus.
*  And you're like, what?
*  You're the activist dude.
*  You know, you're PETA, bitch.
*  Dick.
*  I know, but the online, it's, we all are fucked.
*  We are all selfish.
*  We're all shitty.
*  We're all cunts.
*  We're all cowards.
*  Deep down, we have all that.
*  But on Twitter, you can be a superhero.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, we're all primates.
*  Yes.
*  We all have some weird monkey energy inside of us.
*  And, you know, sometimes it comes out wrong, especially because you're different all the
*  time.
*  Right.
*  You're different depending upon the kind of stress you're under.
*  Exactly.
*  Whether or not you've had sleep.
*  Exactly.
*  Whether or not you just got fired.
*  Right.
*  So many variables that people don't want to take into consideration.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  And you want to look good.
*  You want to look cool.
*  It's like makeup.
*  Twitter is makeup.
*  Dude, Twitter is makeup.
*  Ah.
*  You're right.
*  Oh, t-shirt.
*  Bro, you're right.
*  You just nailed it.
*  Thank you.
*  It is like that.
*  You're dressing it up.
*  And some people go so far as Twitter for them is plastic surgery, where they're just given
*  in and they're like, I'm hooked on this.
*  Right.
*  Well, I don't know if you know this, but a lot of ladies, they take the Photoshop to the
*  photos and they like make their butt bigger and their waist smaller and their legs thinner.
*  Right.
*  So my wife will go out with her friends and one of her friends is basically a magician.
*  She'll take a photo and she'll start fucking with things and make girls' heads bigger,
*  make another girl bigger arms, make them insecure, and make her waist smaller.
*  They do weird shit.
*  Yeah.
*  And they do like little subtle things like make this bitch's nose a little bigger, make
*  her fucking ears a little bigger.
*  Damn.
*  Yeah, they do weird shit to each other.
*  Whoa.
*  And then they call each other.
*  You got to take that picture down.
*  I don't like the way my nose looks.
*  Oh, I'll fix it.
*  I'll fix your nose.
*  Right.
*  So they'll change your nose and put it back up.
*  Like, it's cartooning.
*  It's funny.
*  You're doing cartoons.
*  You're making cartoons.
*  Right.
*  That's not even a person anymore.
*  It's funny because like a lot of guys, you know, we're shallow and material.
*  We like, what do you call it?
*  Visual.
*  We're very visual.
*  And women always say, oh, men are so pig.
*  They're pigs.
*  All they care about is tits.
*  And it's like, no, no, you care too.
*  Don't act like it's just us.
*  Right.
*  You want a, you have 18 filters on your face because you want to look good.
*  Such as us.
*  You're shallow as well.
*  Well, I had a bit that I did in my last special about watching Fox News and about how Bill
*  O'Reilly was sitting right next to Megyn Kelly.
*  And I go, and they're right next to each other.
*  So I assume they're in the same climate.
*  But Bill O'Reilly was dressed like it was chilly out.
*  Right.
*  He had a shirt and a jacket and a tie.
*  I go, Megyn Kelly was wearing something that was best to be described as a vagina curtain.
*  And it wasn't a good curtain either.
*  I go, it was one of those curtains sits over grandma's kitchen sink.
*  It's kind of fluttering the breeze.
*  You could always see the yard.
*  And I'm like, her vagina is right there.
*  And it's cut low so you can see some of her tits.
*  Right.
*  Like you see, it doesn't have any sleeves on.
*  Like there's so much skin.
*  Yeah.
*  But a man, if a man wore a sleeveless skirt to an office, he would be fired.
*  Well, we're gross.
*  But is that sexism?
*  What is that?
*  Probably.
*  I mean, by definition it is, but we don't give a shit.
*  It's like if a girl has a ton of cleavage and you go, wow, that's a lot of cleavage.
*  I go, whoa, easy creep.
*  You're like, you have the cleavage.
*  Right.
*  I'm the weirdo for calling it out.
*  You're showing it everywhere.
*  Yeah.
*  Like if a guy has yoga pants on and a giant hog with a kielbasa in his pants, are you
*  allowed to say anything to him?
*  You go, hey, you gotta go home and change.
*  What if you're straight and he's straight and you go, bro, nice dick.
*  Yeah.
*  Just a compliment.
*  That's cool.
*  You're not trying to hit on him.
*  It's all good with the men and women stuff because we're the same, but then we have different
*  rules.
*  So it's all very confusing.
*  Well, girls can say, girl, your ass looks amazing.
*  Right.
*  And no one cares.
*  Well, girls can say that to girls.
*  Sure.
*  And gay guys can say it to girls.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  They can say it to girls.
*  Yeah.
*  The gay guy girl relationship is a special one.
*  It is.
*  That's special because it's girls.
*  They could be around guys, but they're around guys who fuck guys.
*  Right.
*  So they feel safe.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  It's all rape.
*  It just comes down to the rape threat.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  There's no threat that way.
*  Exactly.
*  And there's no threat of deception.
*  Right.
*  Because the guy's not interested in you.
*  Right.
*  So he's not pretending he wants to fuck or he doesn't want to fuck you when he actually
*  does so you don't really know.
*  Like how many girls have those fucking creepo friends that have just been lurking in the
*  pool waiting on the shore for the boat to come in to dock.
*  It's got to be tough to be a gal for that one.
*  It's got to be tough to be that guy.
*  Well, that too.
*  Hoping she gets fat, hoping things go wrong.
*  I don't know if she gets fat.
*  He might pull out.
*  Maybe not.
*  He might de-dock.
*  No, he'll probably just get her back in shape again once he gets her.
*  I think if we knew how much girls wanted to be found attractive, they'd be a little embarrassed.
*  I think if we knew how important that was, because girls are very secretive.
*  Women.
*  Sorry, women.
*  Like I'm a big fan of the ladies, blah, blah, blah.
*  But I think a lot of the things that they are thinking, if that was out, they'd be embarrassed.
*  Yeah.
*  Because they got some stuff going on in that noggin that we don't know about.
*  Well, it's like there's so much currency in being attractive for a woman.
*  It's like being a celebrity man.
*  Right?
*  Right.
*  If Chris Rock shows up anywhere, people are like, oh shit, it's Chris Rock.
*  Come on in, Chris Rock.
*  Hey, come on in.
*  Come on in the restaurant.
*  We got a seat for you.
*  Get the fuck out of the seat.
*  Chris Rock's going to sit here.
*  Would you like a drink?
*  Would you like this?
*  Would you like that?
*  Do you want something for free?
*  We'll give you gifts.
*  It's like this is a celebrity.
*  Well, a woman who's really hot has almost the same treatment.
*  Come on in.
*  Have a seat.
*  Get you a drink.
*  I'll get you a drink.
*  Hey, ladies, what are you doing later?
*  There's a little after party.
*  Love to have you come.
*  They get invited like they're...
*  Of course.
*  Yeah, it's different.
*  A really attractive woman is like a superhero.
*  They have superpowers and men fall apart.
*  If women...
*  I think they know what kind of power that is.
*  It's biological.
*  But they don't experience it.
*  They don't experience it from the perspective of a male.
*  Oh, if they knew how fucking juiced up we were.
*  When you see a beautiful woman with the legs and the skirt, the cleavage, it's insanity.
*  I wish a woman could feel that for one second.
*  Insanity.
*  You're horny and crazy and you're irrational.
*  You're not thinking rationally.
*  No, you stumble over your words.
*  You say stupid shit you don't really mean.
*  The only closest thing is, you know when sometimes you're about to bang a gal and you're about
*  to put it in and she's all ready to go and you go, ah, I'm going to hang back.
*  And she's like, what the fuck?
*  She's flipping out.
*  That's the closest women will get to knowing how horny we are.
*  When do you do that?
*  Well, we've done that with girlfriends and stuff.
*  She's laying there.
*  You tease your girlfriend?
*  Huh?
*  You tease your girlfriend?
*  Well, for fun, yeah.
*  Oh baby, I'm ready to...
*  Not really.
*  Yeah, and she's soaking wet, the blanket's ruined, the candles are lit and the nips are
*  hard.
*  Windows are steamy.
*  Yeah, and she's got a little gloss of sweat from the first time I went down on her and
*  made her jizz and now she's ready for the medium-sized dong to penetrate and you hang
*  back.
*  You back out.
*  If you could bottle that feeling that women have right there when they call you the F-word.
*  I've had women say horrible things because they're so worked up.
*  The gay F-word?
*  Oh yeah.
*  Just like, what do you get?
*  Come on.
*  I don't want to say it because who knows?
*  You don't want to get canceled?
*  Exactly.
*  But if you could bottle that, you would have...
*  If we were alone, you'd say it.
*  Of course.
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  But people can't see intent.
*  I know.
*  They can't see nuance, these cuts.
*  They can't.
*  Look, I grew up in a black neighborhood.
*  There was a big difference from when one guy would go, fuck you, white boy, to, ah, fuck
*  you, white boy.
*  There's intent.
*  Of course.
*  They're racist, I guess.
*  They're both evil or mean, but I knew what one group meant and I knew what another group
*  meant.
*  It's the same words.
*  It's like the word retarded.
*  You could use that word and everyone laughs, or you can use that word and you're a monster.
*  Or you use that word of a little kid that has a disease, like Down syndrome or something,
*  you're a monster.
*  Or, with your friend, he's like, where are my fucking keys?
*  Where are my fucking keys?
*  Like, hey, dude, they're in your hand retard.
*  Of course.
*  Of course.
*  But the bummer of all that is everybody knows that.
*  Everybody knows that and they're playing games.
*  They're playing games and they're lying.
*  Well, they're playing games and they're trying to eliminate your ability to express yourself
*  with nuance.
*  Because they're trying to pretend that these words can't mean different things.
*  But they always have meant different things.
*  So they're taking away that.
*  But you're not going to fix anybody.
*  You're not going to change life.
*  You're not going to make sick people better.
*  You're not going to do anything different.
*  Language is complex.
*  There's a lot of variables.
*  Emotions are complex.
*  And the scenarios in which you're using those languages.
*  Right.
*  That's what I don't get.
*  Why would you want to be on that bad, snitch, cunty, tattletale side of all this?
*  Because they want to be woke.
*  And because there's a lot of fear in being against wokeness.
*  That's what it is.
*  And people coming after you.
*  But you're a good human.
*  I'm a decent douche.
*  Like, I feel like we have good bones and we want to help people.
*  Like, you would probably stop a bully if he was picking on a weaker person.
*  Oh, for sure.
*  So to me that's more important than nitpicking through these dumb, retarded words.
*  They don't see that.
*  And also, here's another problem.
*  When it comes to people like you or me, we are in this weird place where we're talking
*  and literally right now millions of people are listening.
*  That is strange.
*  And no one thinks that's fair.
*  Including me and you.
*  It's not normal.
*  So people that are listening, there's a certain percentage of them that are like, fuck that
*  guy.
*  Why is he talking?
*  Why do you get to talk?
*  And so you say anything that deviates from the standard.
*  You have to comply 100%.
*  If you don't want to be shit on, you have to comply 100%.
*  And then if you don't, they come after you.
*  It is scary.
*  And it's a bummer.
*  Who wants to live like that?
*  Well, nobody does.
*  But here's the thing.
*  When you don't comply, so many people are like, thank you.
*  Of course.
*  Thank you.
*  There's so many.
*  I think more.
*  More people are happy.
*  It's just the voices that are upset at you for not being woke are the louder ones.
*  And they're more into it because they're retarded.
*  Oh, we just did it.
*  Way to tie it all up there, Petty.
*  It's a weird thing.
*  It is.
*  It's a weird thing we're doing with language.
*  It's very strange.
*  It's very weird.
*  My friend had a good point, black guy, by the way, and he would say, it's got to be
*  weird in 10 years when this kind of all dissipates.
*  And some lady's in a job interview and she's like, I'd love to work here.
*  And the guy's like, says here in 2016 you wrote men are scum?
*  What did you mean by that?
*  I'm a man.
*  And she's like, oh, it was a different time.
*  Emotions were high and Harvey Weinstein, he's like, yeah, but that's hurtful.
*  Like I'm a man.
*  You're saying it's kind of quite a generalization.
*  Like that's so mean.
*  It's so hateful.
*  There was a big scandal about that just a couple of years ago, maybe a year ago or so.
*  There's a woman who got hired by the New York Times and they were going through all her
*  tweets and a lot of it was like anti-white men tweets.
*  She said that she was doing it ironically and she was also doing it to respond to people
*  that were tweeting hateful things at her.
*  She was trying to rile them up.
*  And also she was young.
*  Like a lot of times you're tweeting stuff when you're young and you're trolling and
*  you don't even know what you're doing.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  And I don't know, I saw a great tweet the other day about how there's that big white
*  male rage is like a big funny thing going around right now.
*  It's like a hashtag.
*  Male rage?
*  Yeah, white male rage, like the Joker and everything.
*  Oh, that's hilarious.
*  It's funny because there's a lot of white male rage out there so it works but it's also
*  weird that we've kind of funneled, you're not allowed to be mean to any other group
*  and talk about it.
*  Like black people have rage, Asians have rage.
*  But you can white male it to death.
*  Yeah, which is like as a comic you're like, well now it's kind of hack because you're
*  just doing that every time.
*  And B, there's other rages.
*  So why wouldn't you want to, but you're so worried about being appropriate that you have
*  to just stick with this one that everybody, I don't know, it feels very easy.
*  Folk culture, I don't know if you know this, but it's impossible to be racist against white
*  people.
*  Did you know that?
*  Because white people, power plus something is racism.
*  And white people are always in power so you can't be racist against white people.
*  It's nonsense.
*  It feels very condescending to brown people too.
*  Like I won't ever talk about you, you're perfect, let's ruin this honky over here.
*  Well, they're loud and boring.
*  The people that do that, they're loud and boring.
*  And it feels like there's a lot of them.
*  There's a lot of them.
*  Well, there's also a lot of 20 year olds out there.
*  Look, if you caught me when I was 20, I would be loud and fucking boring too.
*  I'd be really annoying.
*  That's the other thing is like a Shane Gillis, people go, can you believe he said that?
*  I'm like, well, you said this thing 10 years ago, but I've evolved.
*  Well, maybe you will.
*  Well, not only that, you got to understand that he's talking shit.
*  And back then he didn't think anybody was listening.
*  You're talking shit.
*  When you're talking shit, you're just trying to make your friends laugh.
*  He was trying to say inappropriate things that you're not supposed to say to make his
*  friends laugh.
*  Sure.
*  That's what you do.
*  That's what you do, man.
*  That's what you do.
*  It doesn't mean you mean those things.
*  Yeah, that's what white male rage is.
*  That hashtag is inappropriate shit to make the people laugh.
*  But because there's so much content out there and all of us are putting out so much content,
*  you can find these instances where you're just talking shit.
*  And if you just isolate those, you can pretend that that defines a person.
*  But it doesn't.
*  Right.
*  But it doesn't.
*  Because you never use the good shit to define people.
*  Exactly.
*  You're defined by a giant chunk of whoever you are, like all the things you do.
*  You have your weak spots and you have your strong points.
*  You're defined by a lot of things.
*  That's like when I saw that CNN thing, I was like, that's not why the show is popular.
*  You're pretending that the show has gotten all these downloads because it's like this
*  white transphobic hate platform.
*  That's not true.
*  That's not true.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I'm not even speaking for myself.
*  Just looking at it objectively.
*  That doesn't make any sense.
*  But if you say that, you could change, you could shift the way people...
*  Of course.
*  Of course.
*  And so that's what they were trying to do.
*  But all it really does is erode people's confidence in your ability to describe things accurately.
*  Ah, yeah.
*  You lose your genuine card.
*  I don't trust that guy.
*  Do you know what they did to Cenk Uygur?
*  Who's that?
*  From the Young Turks.
*  He's a political commentator.
*  He was talking to...
*  This is one of the most egregious ones I've ever seen ever.
*  He was talking about to David Duke on the phone.
*  Right?
*  And David Duke saying that, I'm not racist.
*  You know, David Duke, fucking head of the KKK.
*  Of course.
*  From Louisiana, yeah.
*  And he was saying, oh, of course you're not racist.
*  So they use that as a quote.
*  Saying that he said to David Duke, oh, of course you're not racist.
*  Wow.
*  And they tried to say that he was coddling David Duke.
*  That's a lot of spin.
*  But it's not spin.
*  It's deceptive.
*  It's a lie.
*  And then they made a retraction, but it's too late.
*  And not only that, why?
*  Why do you want to do that?
*  Well, it's because he's running for Congress.
*  So Cenk Uygur right now is running for Congress in California.
*  So they tried to do that to him in the same way.
*  It's like this weird thing.
*  They have these relationships with politicians and political parties.
*  And they don't want people like him in because he's one of those take the money out of politics
*  guys.
*  He's got this thing, this wolf pack where they're trying to take money out of politics.
*  The same thing that Bernie Sanders is doing.
*  Ah, interesting.
*  I see a pattern here.
*  Well, I mean, look, that's where their bread's buttered.
*  They want more butter.
*  They want more bread.
*  But it's funny because when I was a kid, you'd hear about the 60s and Nixon and all this
*  corruption.
*  You're like, oh, that's the 60s.
*  But it just keeps going.
*  It's a different kind of corruption.
*  It's it's sanctioned corruption.
*  It's legal corruption.
*  You're allowed to do it.
*  Oh, you're allowed to have these relationships.
*  It's not illegal.
*  You should you know, you should have to.
*  There's one of the things they do that's really sneaky is they hire these media companies
*  to do organized campaigns.
*  So if you see a bunch of people tweeting mean shit about a candidate, a lot of times you
*  go and you see, well, who's tweeting this?
*  They have one fucking follower.
*  Of course.
*  And they they've only been posting for like a week.
*  And most of the stuff they're posting is against this one candidate.
*  Yeah.
*  They have these dummy accounts.
*  So either it's a person who that's the only time they've signed up for Twitter and they
*  just want to shit on Bernie Sanders.
*  Or it's a this sort of contrived collection of people or I mean, fake people.
*  One person has like 50 accounts or one media company, you know, media organizing company
*  that is like literally hired to do a campaign to try to push a narrative.
*  And so they just fill the mentions up with these bots, essentially, just saying a bunch
*  of different things that are negative about a candidate or negative about a person or
*  negative about whatever, about anything.
*  Yeah.
*  And this is one of the ways that they sort of try to shift the zeitgeist.
*  And when they can't control that, when they don't have to control the narrative, then
*  they start panicking and then they pull out the heavy guns.
*  And then they start asking, you know, these news stories, whether it's a newspaper or,
*  you know, an online publication to write inflammatory things about you.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  That's essentially how they try to shift opinion on things.
*  And it's not illegal, right?
*  But it's fucking super sneaky and really sleazy.
*  It's funny how they do the it's not illegal loophole kind of because it's still wrong
*  and mean and hurtful and a lie.
*  But imagine if it was a comic, right?
*  Imagine if you say, look, aren't you filming a special tonight?
*  Yes, I am.
*  Two shows, Dynasty typewriter.
*  I don't know when this comes out.
*  It's already sold out, right?
*  Yeah, sold out, baby.
*  Tough shit, you fucks.
*  Can't get in.
*  So imagine if this special comes out and you tweet a link to it and then underneath it,
*  you use 50 dummy accounts to talk about how fucking amazing that special is.
*  And then people find out about it.
*  And they go, Jesus Christ, Mark Norman, what the fuck is wrong with you?
*  Well, what do you mean?
*  They would say that to you.
*  Imagine if you had 50 dummy accounts tweeting about how amazing you are.
*  Well, that's what politicians do.
*  That's what corporations do.
*  So a lot of people do that to try to shift opinion.
*  And they're doing it through Twitter.
*  You know what the solution to that is?
*  Say the fuck off Twitter.
*  Well, how long till it's illegal?
*  It feels like it's getting dangerous out there.
*  Doing stuff like that sort of should be illegal.
*  It's basically what the Internet Research Agency in Russia was doing when they were
*  having all these fake accounts and they were tweeting.
*  I mean, they were doing all kinds of different things.
*  They were pretending that it was black women against Hillary Clinton.
*  It was really Russians.
*  Like, as black women, we can't vote for this bitch.
*  And then they were also...
*  And all the whiteys are like, oh, I want to be on the side of the black women.
*  They were even organizing this stuff.
*  I had a woman in here, her name was Renee DeResta, and she spent an incredible amount
*  of time analyzing this stuff.
*  And it has all this data and hundreds of thousands of posts and millions of interactions and
*  all these different...
*  It really can shift the narrative on things.
*  And it's all this fucking troll farm in Russia where people are getting hired to pretend
*  like Muslims and Texas separatists.
*  They put together these organizations across the street from each other.
*  So the Texas separatists and this Muslim group, and they're both organized by these fake Internet
*  Research Agency people that are working in Russia.
*  And they put their fucking protests right across the street from each other.
*  Look at that.
*  So they're fighting with each other.
*  That's it.
*  They must be having a blast watching that shit go down.
*  Well, also, they're funny.
*  That's what's really funny.
*  They're memes.
*  The memes they make are really funny.
*  Like they made some fucking killer memes that were legitimately hilarious.
*  And she was talking about, she's like, I'm telling you, I was laughing really hard at
*  a lot of these memes.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Oh, man, what a kooky world we're living in.
*  And I don't even want to dive into it because it bothers me.
*  It's weird.
*  But I think it's important to talk about.
*  I guess so.
*  Talk about like this on a podcast because it lets people know like, oh, that's what's
*  happening when you go.
*  Right.
*  And so you know what else people do?
*  They have these accounts that they use for a long period of time as a fake account.
*  So they'll even put fake photographs up or they'll put a cartoon fixture up and then
*  they'll use it to tweet about random shit.
*  They'll tweet about Star Wars and the weather.
*  Oh my God, global warming is real.
*  Can you believe this?
*  They'll retweet interesting articles and they just do this to try to give it the illusion
*  that it's a real person.
*  And they'll have 80 of those.
*  And this is all a company.
*  So if like if you have a media corporation that is designed in the company, what they
*  do is they make these media campaigns on social media.
*  They organize campaigns to push a narrative.
*  They'll have these things just like a company would have assets.
*  They have these accounts.
*  They'll have fake accounts and it's not illegal.
*  What do you call that gig?
*  That seems like a pretty good gig.
*  Making fake Twitter accounts and then having fun little jovial nice quips and things all day.
*  I know, it's like a media campaign.
*  I mean, you could start that business if you wanted to do that.
*  Wow.
*  It's not illegal right now.
*  Sure, sure.
*  But maybe we should just get rid of Twitter.
*  I mean, I like it because I write jokes and I like to get feedback on jokes and whatever,
*  but it seems like it's doing more harm than good.
*  Well, it's doing good and it's doing harm.
*  Where it does really good is in Arab Spring.
*  A lot of the stuff that happens overseas, like these people, one of the only ways they
*  can get the news out, because the news is locked down in their country, one of the only
*  ways they can get the news out is through social media.
*  And sometimes even through a virtual private network.
*  Right.
*  They have to use a VPN to go and-
*  Arab Springs, the worst soap of all time.
*  Well, well, well.
*  That's the one that you can cut into, the Irish Spring one.
*  I always wanted to cut into that because it's commercial.
*  I know.
*  Cutting soap is fun.
*  I used to come to Carvewood sometimes.
*  They use soap as a little practice.
*  But yeah, I don't understand body wash.
*  Do you do body wash?
*  I don't trust it.
*  Come on, man.
*  I don't do cologne either.
*  Well, cologne is weird.
*  That's deep and weird.
*  I don't get guys who do cologne.
*  What is body wash?
*  Is it soap?
*  It's the liquid.
*  But is it soap?
*  It's soap.
*  You usually put on a loofah.
*  Oh.
*  But I don't do it.
*  I'm not opposed to it.
*  I like the bar.
*  I like the bar.
*  Yeah, give me the bar.
*  I think, like, ethnicities think that white people are weird.
*  Yes, I was just going to...
*  Yes, go ahead.
*  Go ahead.
*  My black friends get mad at me because I don't have a washcloth.
*  Yeah, a lot of, not just black, but Latinos as well.
*  Oh, is that right?
*  I don't have any Latino friends.
*  Gross.
*  They like washcloths and they think white people are disgusting.
*  You just use soap and then, you know, your wife goes in later and she uses the soap and
*  then your fucking kid's using the soap.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Like, hey, hey, what are we doing here?
*  I mean, I got that soap up my ass and everything.
*  Bumping uglies.
*  Wee!
*  But it's also weird when you're showering with a lady.
*  You remember you were showering with your girlfriend when it was new and fucking in
*  the shower and then you got to wash your ass?
*  That was always a weird moment.
*  That's a weird moment.
*  Yeah.
*  And when you, if you try to have sex in the shower, like, who gets the water?
*  Like, where do we stand?
*  Yeah, I'm cold over here.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Especially New York, right?
*  Right.
*  Also, the water will ruin the lube, if you will.
*  The natural lube.
*  The natural lube.
*  Yes.
*  Yeah, it gets it all...
*  Rinses it away.
*  A little too much friction.
*  And your ass cheek keeps hitting the plastic.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  You want to pull your shorts down a little bit so you can get a little more slipperiness
*  in the slide.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  Yeah.
*  Ah, shower sex is the worst.
*  Yeah, it's like a good idea.
*  I think Ari used to have a bit about it.
*  It's a good idea on paper.
*  Right.
*  But in practice, it's not really the best move.
*  Yeah, are you losing libido there?
*  Because you're what, 61?
*  52.
*  Ah, shit.
*  But I'm on testosterone.
*  Sorry.
*  I take testosterone placement, so I'm not losing shit.
*  Are you still horny?
*  Oh, all the time, yeah.
*  Oh, okay.
*  Yeah, I have my testosterone levels are basically like what they should be if I was 30.
*  Right.
*  It's basically the same.
*  I feel like a...
*  I don't get crazy with it.
*  I'm still horny, but now that I'm with a lady, you know, I don't...
*  I'm glad because I don't have the energy to do the small talk.
*  I still want to bang, but that whole like...
*  You want to bullshit.
*  I want to bullshit.
*  I can't do it.
*  It's brutal.
*  Yeah.
*  That's the hard part to me.
*  Well, that's the part about being single is the...
*  Yes.
*  You're not necessarily deceptive, but you are definitely putting on a little bit of
*  an act.
*  Of course.
*  Of course.
*  You're polishing up the old turd.
*  Yeah, because we're a bunch of retarded apes.
*  Disgusting.
*  Yeah.
*  We're just like...
*  You're just thinking like how long, how long, how long, how long, how long, how long, how
*  long until the underwear come off.
*  When can we fuck?
*  Yeah.
*  When can we fuck?
*  And the girls, they're not dumb.
*  They know that.
*  They're going, all right, he wants to fuck now, but I'm going to get more food out of
*  him and drinks and...
*  You know what was the most depressing thing about being single?
*  After you came, you'd be like, what did I do?
*  Oh, dude.
*  I've got to get out of here.
*  Story of my life.
*  What happened?
*  Yeah.
*  I went on a real tear and that was, every morning was just like, oh, I got to make some
*  changes.
*  Well, you start thinking that you really are into this person until you come.
*  And then you're like, no, you tricked me again.
*  Makes you realize biology is a mother fire.
*  It knows what it's doing.
*  Talk about deceptive.
*  Holy shit.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Well, Brett Weinstein was explaining this to me.
*  He's a biologist.
*  And he was explaining to me that there's different strategies for mating that biology has set
*  up for us.
*  And there's two different types of women that are attractive to men.
*  He was like, there's beautiful and then there's hot and there's a difference.
*  And what beautiful is, is someone who has good genetics.
*  She seems like she has a pleasant demeanor.
*  You like her personality.
*  You really want to be around her.
*  And then there's hot.
*  It's kind of slutty hot.
*  Porn star.
*  The reason why you like that is because the idea is that you can mate with them quickly
*  and you can spread your DNA, but you don't have to make any commitment.
*  You can jet.
*  Right.
*  So literally these strategies are set up by nature.
*  So when you see a girl with a little tiny skirt and big giant tits stuffed into this
*  like fucking crazy cleavage and like a little short little thing in her belly showing, she's
*  like, hey boys.
*  She's letting you know there's not a whole lot of game here.
*  You can get right to it.
*  And then if you shoot one in there and make a baby, it's like you can spread those genes
*  very quickly.
*  So throughout humanity, like throughout the evolution of the human animal, that has probably
*  been a strategy that evolved.
*  So like women that like maybe their personality sucks or maybe they're abused so they don't
*  have high self-esteem.
*  So they feel like the best way to definitely get attention without making sure that a man
*  works for it because they don't feel like they're valuable enough.
*  So they'll wear like skimpy clothes and they'll slut it up.
*  Why do you think it is that a lady is so bummed out after the bang?
*  Like if you want to leave.
*  Because you pretend that you're so into her and you think you're so into her.
*  And then as soon as you come, she's like, oh, he's going to hate me now.
*  He wants to leave.
*  Because that feeling when you come, if you're not really into a girl and you got tricked
*  by your own dick and then after you orgasm, like what the fuck.
*  That feeling, which every guy knows.
*  I know it's natural.
*  If you don't know it, I don't understand you.
*  Of course.
*  Well, that's why it's annoying when we go, oh, men are such pigs.
*  Like this is how I'm wired.
*  Like you can't shoot me.
*  That's like me going, hey, you bleeding weirdo.
*  Like no, that's just how your body's made.
*  That's how my body's made.
*  Why can't you sympathize?
*  Pretend they want more.
*  No, we actually think we want more.
*  We do think it.
*  Yeah.
*  Until you come and then you're like, ugh.
*  I've been in love all night.
*  I'm like, this is the best woman on earth.
*  And then it just, all the interest just shoots out of you.
*  But how about this ladies?
*  And this is going to be controversial.
*  But look, I hang out with you.
*  We're not fucking.
*  Why don't you bring it?
*  Like give me some knock knocks or something.
*  Right, give us some jokes.
*  Give me some jokes.
*  Give me something to work with.
*  Yeah, like all you showed me was like I chased you for five hours all night, you know, trying
*  to win you over, trying to be funny, trying to be interesting.
*  Why don't you spin it now?
*  Why don't you win me over?
*  Right, right, right.
*  You're kind of, in a way, you're kind of saying like sex is my only thing.
*  No, but there's a lot of funny, interesting, cool ladies out there.
*  So throw that at me.
*  Be one of those.
*  Yeah, be one of those.
*  Be one of those.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, there's some boring dudes too, so.
*  Well, there are a lot of people.
*  This is boring people.
*  Yeah, there's a lot of people that are boring.
*  Male and female.
*  Of course.
*  I couldn't imagine being a girl and having some boring ass fucking dude trying to stick
*  his hog in you.
*  Oh, gotta be brutal.
*  Everywhere you go and then saying, hey, you know, you should probably smile a little.
*  Make you look better.
*  I hate that move.
*  Has that ever worked?
*  Oh, I don't know.
*  Maybe, must have.
*  Guys who do that, they make us look bad.
*  A really dumb guy and a dumber girl.
*  Yeah, maybe it would work.
*  Oh, I'm sorry.
*  Right.
*  I'm self-conscious about my smile.
*  Oh, you got a beautiful smile.
*  You think so?
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, okay, thanks.
*  Yeah, like those two are made for each other.
*  You guys deserve your little idiots.
*  But they're not.
*  They really should both go into the woods and get eaten by wolves.
*  That's what should happen.
*  Right.
*  In the real, like if we really were trying to make a better human race, there would be
*  more variables.
*  There'd be more traps.
*  That's true, that's true, but we gotta be nice, you know.
*  Well, we should be nice.
*  We should be nice, but sometimes I think it's just genes.
*  Like sometimes people just have knucklehead genes.
*  Well, yeah, sometimes I see people, like you know, you're walking down the sidewalk and
*  you're in somebody's living room and they're at 8,000 pounds, they're watching two and
*  a half men, they got a bowl of Cheetos and a beer, and you're like, you're kind of a
*  waste of life.
*  Like, no offense, you deserve life, you have a right to live, but I'm out here trying to
*  write jokes and I'm driving from gig to gig, I'm doing pods, I'm going gay, whatever it
*  is, at least I'm trying something.
*  At least I have a little ambition.
*  You're moving.
*  You're out there experiencing life.
*  Yeah, even if you send a tweet out, at least like you put something into the world, even
*  though it could be horrible, but like this guy, I'm just like, you're just waiting to
*  die.
*  You're just counting the minutes till you go.
*  There's something about like...
*  And then they have kids!
*  And then you're like, now you brought even more shit into the world.
*  Ah, my god, I hate myself, I'm sorry.
*  It's okay, you're alright.
*  But like, you know, you see, you're a dad of nine or whatever, and then...
*  I have 80 kids.
*  80 kids, that's a lot of testosterone you're putting in you.
*  Shooting loads all over the place.
*  So you probably teach your kids like, hey, make something with your life.
*  Yeah, well, they can only use electronics for a certain amount of time during the day.
*  Alright, good for you!
*  They, you know, they're involved in activities.
*  They play sports, they do things.
*  I think you gotta do stuff with them too, and also they have to see that you're doing
*  stuff.
*  As a parent, like one of the things that kids get out of you is that they see you live by
*  example.
*  That's important.
*  Totally.
*  And then on the flip side though, I get selfish and I go, well, it's a good thing this fat
*  cunt is sitting in a bark lounge all night, because now I get to go and do something with
*  my life and he's not in my way.
*  That and you also feel better.
*  You know, you come home from a hard day of getting after it, you see that fat slob sitting
*  in front of the TV laughing really hard at Big Bang Theory, and you're like, oh, okay,
*  buddy, I'm fucking better than you!
*  You hate to say it, but...
*  You do hate to say it.
*  That's why sometimes I think us being, we're under six foot, and isn't that a bummer?
*  Wouldn't you love to be six foot?
*  I don't know, man.
*  I think something about me being short has helped me be more ambitious.
*  That's what I'm saying!
*  That's what I'm saying.
*  It makes you push.
*  It's probably a benefit to it.
*  Right, right.
*  You want it.
*  That's why, like, ugh, that sounds bad, but ugly people are funny.
*  A lot of ugly people are funny.
*  You gotta bring it.
*  They did some study where kids trust ugly people less.
*  So it's not just being shallow, it's kind of innate.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Imagine being a woman who has terrible genetics, and there's probably some of them listening
*  to it right now, and it's not a goddamn thing you can do about that.
*  Yeah, it's not your fault.
*  You got a giant Fred Flintstone head.
*  Sure.
*  You're trying to make your way through this life with a football player's body.
*  Oh, yeah, got some moles on you.
*  Oh, you got everything wrong.
*  Yeah.
*  Your hair's falling out.
*  You're like, shit.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  You got stubby fingers.
*  Bad jowls, you know, you got the turkey neck.
*  Yeah, everything, weird elbows.
*  And you're just out there just trying to get after it.
*  Yeah.
*  Nobody wants it.
*  I love an ugly lady who's horny.
*  That's your favorite?
*  I love that.
*  I'm not saying to bang.
*  I mean, I have.
*  But I love an ugly, horny lady, because she's, I feel like we have a lot in common.
*  I have a buddy of mine, and his favorite is a girl with kind of a mugs-y face, but a killer
*  body.
*  Oh, that.
*  He's like, those gals go to work.
*  That hits a nerve in a guy, because you're like, it's attainable, and she's probably
*  like got normal self-esteem, and she's not entitled.
*  She's at the gym every day, all day, just fucking doing squats.
*  Yeah.
*  Same with meathead boring guys who are like, I got to get some traps, because I got no
*  skills talking-wise.
*  Yeah, just find some dingbat chick and shoot those fucking loads into her.
*  Yeah, you hope that all those groups meet.
*  Like you dumb workout guy.
*  And then they get hit by an asteroid.
*  Yeah, or that.
*  Or that.
*  Or on the spot.
*  Yeah, it's, I mean, but sometimes those dingbats have kids, and those kids go, god damn, my
*  parents are fucking stupid.
*  That's true.
*  I'm going to do something with my life.
*  That's a good point.
*  That happens a lot.
*  I think there's really fucking smart people of idiots for parents.
*  That's a good point, yeah.
*  Thank god for those people.
*  Yeah, I think that's, you know, that whole expression, like hard times make hard men,
*  hard men make easy times, easy times make weak men.
*  I'm hard.
*  I'm hard.
*  I think there's something to that.
*  Like fucked up parents make interesting kids.
*  Sometimes, not all the time.
*  Not all the time.
*  Yeah, it's not like a pedophile where if I touch your kid, he'll be a pedophile.
*  That's a weird one.
*  Isn't that crazy?
*  Yeah, that's a weird one.
*  That's apparently a big one with priests.
*  This thing about how many priests who molest kids were actually molested by priests, and
*  it's very high.
*  That is wild.
*  It's horrible.
*  Yeah, you'd think I'd go the other way.
*  Yeah, you would think you'd learn some horrible thing happened to you.
*  You don't ever want that to happen to someone else.
*  But it just shows how fucking crazy kid fucking gets into a kid's psyche.
*  Like it messes you up.
*  It breaks everything.
*  Yeah.
*  And also you've lost your trust in adults.
*  A lot of girls, when they get molested when they're young, they become hypersexualized
*  and they try to use their sex to get attention deep into their lives.
*  Sure, a lot of porn stars I think were diddled.
*  A lot of porn stars.
*  Yeah.
*  Yikes.
*  But then there's also the Oprahs of the world, the Michael Jackson, the Tyler Perry.
*  These people were all diddled.
*  And look at them.
*  They used their diddle anger into greatness.
*  Sure.
*  Yeah, it's not standard.
*  It's not like everybody who gets molested.
*  You got to channel it.
*  It's like when you get bullied, you can channel your rage into getting better at something.
*  Have you seen, do you watch TV at all?
*  Oh yeah.
*  Do you watch The Outsider on HBO?
*  I keep hearing how great it is.
*  Joe List told me it was amazing.
*  Fuck, I watched episode four last night.
*  Fucking A, that show's good.
*  Is it horror?
*  I don't like horror.
*  It is horror.
*  Ah shit.
*  But I don't want to give away too much.
*  It's a mystery.
*  It's Jason...
*  Biggs?
*  Bateman.
*  Bateman, thank you.
*  Bateman, boy, he's good.
*  He's in everything.
*  He's amazing.
*  He's amazing.
*  He's amazing in Ozark.
*  You watch Ozark?
*  Yeah, I love Ozark.
*  I finished that in two days.
*  Ozark's so good.
*  That show's so good.
*  This is like that, but like it's...
*  I don't want to give away too much.
*  It's horror mystery.
*  All right.
*  It's fucking good, man.
*  I'll check it out.
*  I mean, there's not a moment in that show so far where I've been like, what?
*  It's Stephen King, right?
*  Yes.
*  Oh, he's a beast.
*  Stephen King.
*  How many books has that guy read?
*  Fun fact.
*  What in the fuck?
*  Stephen King grew up poor in Maine and his dad did the old cigarette move and never came
*  back.
*  Going out for a pack of smokes, fatty, and I'll see you in hell.
*  Never came back.
*  Wow.
*  And look at him.
*  Greatness.
*  You got to channel it, folks.
*  Have you ever read Stephen King on writing?
*  No.
*  Fantastic book.
*  Oh, I'd like to.
*  It's fantastic.
*  It's all his process for writing and like him, like all the different things he's gone
*  through while he was writing and a lot of the books he wrote, like amazing ones.
*  Like Kujo, he doesn't even remember writing it.
*  Wow.
*  Just fucked up on coke and booze.
*  Is that right?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Just finding like fucking an empty case in his writing room and coke everywhere and just
*  writes this amazing book.
*  That makes me like him more.
*  I didn't take him for a cokehead.
*  I think Carrie was the first one that he sold.
*  Was it Carrie or Christine?
*  I think it was Carrie.
*  Carrie was the first one he sold.
*  And he just right out of the bat, they're like, holy fuck, what is this guy doing?
*  And he was just boozing and smoking.
*  And smoking a ton of cigarettes too.
*  Yeah, that's apparently, he said that was one of the big bummers when he quit smoking
*  cigarettes is that cigarettes apparently positively affect.
*  It juices you up.
*  Yeah, it juices up his neurons.
*  The firing of the neurons.
*  Yeah.
*  I've had a cigarette before I go on stage before.
*  Oh yeah?
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Hinchcliffe used to smoke cigarettes.
*  Now he just does the vape thing.
*  And one time I was like, give me one of those.
*  Just let me try it.
*  I had a cigarette before I went on.
*  I was like, whoa, you get juiced up.
*  And then I did it with Chappelle.
*  When Chappelle and I did a couple of arenas.
*  Oh, he's chain smoking.
*  Yeah, but that's one of the reasons why.
*  Interesting.
*  It fires up your brain in a very unusual way.
*  And I think probably more so for someone who doesn't smoke.
*  Of course.
*  Because you're not chasing the dragon.
*  You're just getting the rush.
*  Would the gum work?
*  Or is it heavy to the cig?
*  I don't know.
*  I tried the gum.
*  It didn't do much for me.
*  Cigars work.
*  That's too much.
*  I smoke cigars every now and then.
*  And halfway through I always go, I gotta stop.
*  You almost throw up, right?
*  Yeah, you almost throw up.
*  And it gets me cloudy a little bit.
*  My anxiety goes up.
*  For me.
*  It definitely gets your anxiety up.
*  You smoke weed a lot.
*  I'm such a lightweight when it comes to the ganja.
*  All the negative goes up and the good goes down.
*  You know, anxiety.
*  You might have some demons.
*  I hate myself.
*  Demons.
*  No one likes you.
*  You're gay.
*  Whatever it is.
*  So it all escalates.
*  Well, good things.
*  None of those things are true.
*  So just smoke more weed and just deal with life.
*  But I can't live like you.
*  It eats me alive.
*  It's too strong.
*  The voices are too powerful.
*  Yeah.
*  I like those voices.
*  I like them.
*  They teach you things.
*  They teach you things that are fucking with you.
*  They teach you what's bothering you.
*  Yes.
*  That's what I like.
*  But I can't win.
*  I can't beat them.
*  I understand.
*  Like when I'm hungover.
*  Oh my God.
*  It's not just physical pain.
*  It's like I can't.
*  The phone rings and I'm like, I can't do it.
*  I can't face it.
*  It's horrible.
*  I gotta work on that.
*  Well, maybe not.
*  You know, everybody's different.
*  Like some people have a really adverse reaction to coffee.
*  Caffeine really fucks them up.
*  Some people just can't drink coffee.
*  Oh, I love coffee.
*  And some people can't smoke weed.
*  We're all so different.
*  So different, yeah.
*  I have friends, one drink and they get fucking gerbilized and they're off to the races.
*  You don't even know where they are.
*  They're gone.
*  And now, you know, Mike's gone and this is a fucking shell that looks like Mike with
*  fucking shark eyes.
*  And they're just running around with no soul.
*  It's like their soul leaves through their ears.
*  Oh, flies away.
*  The soul is so underestimated or under whatever because we, I'll have four drinks and I'm
*  like, I notice I'm knocking a mailbox off out of a car with a baseball bat.
*  I'm like, how'd I get here?
*  And I don't feel any guilt about it.
*  But if he was sober, he'd be like, shit, somebody's coming.
*  We're going to get caught.
*  We're going to get on film.
*  Oh, dude, especially if you're doing many shots.
*  You're with buddies and you're like, come on pussy, one more, one more.
*  Let's do it.
*  And you're, you know, eight, nine drinks in and you're like, you're gone.
*  You're not even there anymore.
*  It's also crazy to think from 13 to 31, I was drunk the whole time.
*  13?
*  Oh, I've been from New Orleans, man.
*  We just got after it early and it was just part of the culture.
*  Your dad would hand you a Miller High Life, you know, and say, shut up and drink this.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, it was fun time.
*  I mean, I lost my virginity to a prostitute.
*  I grew up eight blocks from the French Quarter.
*  I went to public school.
*  It was bananas out there.
*  Yeah, we talked about your transgender nanny that was taking care of you too.
*  You got that right.
*  Beating up people for taking your bike.
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  I tried to sell him, pitching all this shit.
*  Nobody wants it.
*  God.
*  Really?
*  I've pitched 15 shows.
*  Jeffrey Tambor is out of a job and he was really good on that other one.
*  He was good, yeah.
*  He's a beast.
*  He got in trouble with the real transgender people.
*  I heard, I heard.
*  Most trans people I've met are pretty cool and like, they don't want to be coddled so
*  much.
*  You know, we think, oh, easy.
*  You know what's weird?
*  We're not really helpful to midgets.
*  Have you noticed that?
*  I don't think you're supposed to say that anymore.
*  Oh, what do you call them?
*  Small people.
*  Little people.
*  Little people.
*  Sorry.
*  I mean, I'm friends with a couple, littles, but I don't know.
*  How do you shorten little people?
*  LPs?
*  Yeah, LPs.
*  All right.
*  And we're standard play.
*  They're little.
*  But yeah, they're all good eggs and they don't get any help.
*  No one's shortening anything.
*  Right.
*  Like nothing on earth is designed for them.
*  That's true.
*  And yet we don't, like toilets are still tall.
*  Right.
*  And they got to jump up there.
*  Right.
*  And they go with the toilet.
*  And I'm saying, that's great.
*  We accommodate, but why don't we ever help them?
*  Isn't that strange?
*  What do you think there's more of?
*  Oh, it's got to be more midge.
*  Not anymore.
*  Trans is becoming really chic.
*  Yeah, but midge you can't pick.
*  Right.
*  Well, I don't know if trans is...
*  You can't fake it.
*  You can't fake a midge.
*  Can you say midge?
*  Interesting.
*  It's a name.
*  Yeah.
*  It's tricky though.
*  Dwarf?
*  It's like calling a white guy with a backwards baseball had a wigger.
*  Right.
*  That sounds too much like bigger.
*  What about Tigger in Winnie the Pooh?
*  Yeah.
*  He could jump high.
*  He was loud.
*  You know Winnie the Pooh is all about an acid trip.
*  No, they say that about everything.
*  The ride.
*  Come on.
*  Go on the ride.
*  Yeah, something about the ride at Disneyland.
*  It sounds like the worst ride of all time.
*  It's basically an acid trip.
*  I remember one of the times I did it, I went through Disneyland High as fuck and I was
*  on the ride.
*  No.
*  This is Winnie the Pooh's...
*  He's on acid.
*  There's all these visuals and everything becomes psychedelic and the colors are weird.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  See if you can get a video of the Winnie the Pooh ride.
*  No, I'm telling you.
*  Alice in Wonderland I'll get.
*  All right, there's mushrooms, there's talking cats and shit.
*  No, something happens during the ride and you go...
*  Winnie the Pooh goes into Dreamland.
*  Oh, I don't know about the Dreamland.
*  He goes into Dreamland.
*  You're basically on acid.
*  You're going through an acid trip.
*  Yeah.
*  It sounds like he's mellow.
*  He's got...
*  He's eating honey, he's got no pants.
*  Doesn't feel acid-y.
*  Well, watch this.
*  See?
*  Here's the Winnie the Pooh ride.
*  Do do do do do.
*  This is Disney World?
*  Disneyland.
*  Disneyland.
*  This is out here.
*  So you go through, everything's normal.
*  All right.
*  All right.
*  All trippy.
*  And then as you're going through...
*  Not really.
*  This is just pretty.
*  Everything's lights and yeah, you're on this little fucking thing and you're on your little
*  roller coaster ride and oh, here's Winnie.
*  All right.
*  And he's floating around with a balloon.
*  It's kind of a cool ride.
*  Good colors.
*  My daughters were really young.
*  They liked this.
*  Oh, so pretty.
*  Very pretty.
*  And you're going through and there's Eeyore and then there's that other pig.
*  I don't know who the fuck that is.
*  Piglet.
*  Piglet.
*  And so then you go through, a bunch of shit happens and give me a little fast forward
*  here because it's going to be boring.
*  Yeah, this is the worst trip ever.
*  Isn't that LSD honey?
*  Isn't that like a way...
*  I think that's what it is.
*  Well, there's that Nepal honey that's psychedelic honey.
*  Maybe that's what it is.
*  Give me a little fast forward.
*  It is a little trippy.
*  So something...
*  Oh, what was that?
*  It's a trip.
*  So right there.
*  So what happens before that trip?
*  Find out what happens right before that, Jamie.
*  Something happens.
*  Yeah, see, because he's floating around.
*  Watch.
*  So Winnie the Pooh is sitting there and all of a sudden he floats out of his head and
*  look, he's floating like he's fucking tripping balls.
*  And then as the thing goes, it goes black and then you see Winnie floating and then
*  boom, you're in psychedelic land.
*  And then the thing is weird and whacked out and there's jack-in-the-box heads with big
*  tongues and everything is neon psychedelic colors and the world's melting and it's honey
*  and honey spelled phonetically correctly.
*  I see it now.
*  It's got a little, what's that, fear and loathing.
*  It's DMT.
*  This is like a DMT trip.
*  That's what it's like.
*  Like all these psychedelic things, you're seeing this is about as close to creating
*  some sort of a psychedelic hallucinogenic trip in a kids' ride as you can get away with
*  without getting arrested.
*  I thought you meant the actual cartoon and story.
*  No, no, no, no, no.
*  But this I see.
*  Yeah, it's like they're doing something.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Like why is he tripping balls?
*  Why is he floating?
*  You're a millionaire and this is where you spend your time.
*  Oh, that's how I work.
*  Just reminding you, I didn't show it to you yet, there's a VR, I don't think it's a game
*  but I think it's like a VR experience if they have multiple of those but it's an ayahuasca
*  trip.
*  Ooh.
*  And I think like, I'll show you the like.
*  Bring it on, JMo.
*  What's interesting that you're saying this is that Terrence McKenna actually predicted
*  that you could recreate in the future with virtual reality a psychedelic trip and it
*  would have the same exact effect as a psychedelic trip because it would be able to show you
*  the same visuals.
*  You know, you remember, I don't know if you remember this but there used to be, you know
*  what phone freaking was?
*  Do you remember phone freaking?
*  Mm-hmm.
*  There was a way that you could use a public payphone and you had a device that would make
*  a noise because a public payphone, right, you would press a button like beep, beep,
*  beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.
*  Yeah.
*  It would hold a thing up to the phone and it would go, whee!
*  It would send a signal through sound and the phone would just open up for you so you could
*  use it.
*  Oh, no quarter.
*  No quarter.
*  And you would just start calling people.
*  Oh, cool.
*  And it was done somehow or another through sound.
*  Like you would mimic the sound the phone would make ordinarily.
*  Uh-huh.
*  So it tricked whatever was on the other end that was waiting for the signal that was coming
*  from those deeply deep things.
*  Right, right.
*  Is this it here?
*  Uh-huh.
*  Ayahuasca.
*  I've always wanted to do it.
*  Have you done it?
*  I have done DMT.
*  I have not done ayahuasca but this looks a lot like DMT.
*  You've done DMT?
*  You never mentioned it.
*  Stop joking.
*  Ah, ha ha.
*  Yeah, there it is.
*  There it is.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, wow.
*  That's pretty cool.
*  They're eventually going to be able to nail this and make it exactly like what you'd experience.
*  Right.
*  VR is going to be dangerous, man.
*  That's going to take over a lot of shit.
*  Have you done any of the VR experiences that you can go through now in a warehouse?
*  No.
*  You're in the
*  Yeah.
*  It's pretty damn convincing.
*  We have one of those Oculus things right out here that's attached to an iPad.
*  It's pretty cool but there's a thing in Woodland Hills called Sandbox.
*  They have a couple of them somewhere else besides Woodland Hills but one of them is
*  only like a few miles from here and you put these VR goggles on and when you get the goggles
*  on you go into this house and you fight zombies and I mean, dude, it'll fucking freak you
*  out because it's all dark and the zombies are running at you.
*  Oh, wow.
*  They're like, there it is.
*  So you, they dress you up.
*  So you got these VR things.
*  Just a fat kid in basketball shorts.
*  So this is reality and zombies.
*  So this is you running through this.
*  This is what it looks like to anybody watching but what you see is these crazy fucking zombies
*  running at you and these giant pus-filled monsters.
*  It's fucking, I guess they're not showing the actual footage of the video.
*  But it's pretty dope.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like, it's a heartbeat thing.
*  Like you get your heart rate jacked.
*  Wow.
*  Because it feels like they're really coming at you and you're wearing a haptic feedback
*  vest so when they claw at you you feel it on your chest.
*  Whoa!
*  Like, ahhh!
*  Like, da da da da da!
*  But imagine the fucked VR.
*  Yeah, there it is.
*  That's what they look like.
*  Whoa!
*  Yeah.
*  So.
*  It's so embarrassing when they show the other one.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Seriously, see that?
*  So the zombies are running at you.
*  They're in your face like really quickly.
*  Wow!
*  Yeah, it freaks you out, man.
*  It's kind of funny.
*  That's basically what Twitter is.
*  You think you're changing the world.
*  You think you're doing all this shit and it's just you in a basement.
*  And nothing's really happening.
*  And nothing's really happening.
*  You think you're killing zombies.
*  Look at that thing coming at you.
*  Booking now available.
*  Deadwood Mansion, that's what it's called.
*  It's fucking dope.
*  Very exciting.
*  I'm a fan.
*  Yeah, give that to the school shooters.
*  You know, just have a classroom setting and they can just shoot it up so they won't shoot
*  up a real one.
*  I don't think that has the same feeling of chaos.
*  But if we could get their actual teacher and their actual classmates, I feel like that'd
*  be a nice way to get that out of your system.
*  It'd be a little better than what they're doing now.
*  Sure, sure.
*  Sure.
*  Maybe with pedophiles too.
*  You could have a kid in there and let them get it over with.
*  Right.
*  Imagine if they did that.
*  If they said the best way to treat pedophiles is to have virtual children that you can rape.
*  People would be like, wait, what?
*  I mean, it sounds crazy, but it's a victimless crime.
*  It's like when you give the heroin addicts, they're free needles.
*  Or you give them methadone.
*  Or that too.
*  But people go, what are you giving them drugs?
*  You go, well, it's better than them dying on AIDSy heroin needles.
*  Right.
*  Or, you know, overdosing.
*  Give them heroin.
*  There's places in the world where they give them a distributed amount of heroin and it's
*  pure.
*  So they make sure that they're not giving them anything that's spiked or got some fentanyl
*  in it.
*  On paper you go, what are you, crazy?
*  You're giving them heroin?
*  But it's better.
*  It's almost like the first guy to think of gangrene.
*  You hear about that guy in World War II.
*  Everybody's getting gangrene.
*  So he said, fuck that.
*  He cut his arm open, stabbed one of the dead guys and put a little bit of gangrene in his
*  wound and everybody's like, what are you nuts?
*  He's like, I'll get immune to it.
*  And he worked.
*  Really?
*  It worked.
*  So that kind of outside the box thinking.
*  What a fucking crazy asshole.
*  I know, but I mean, look around.
*  He's got dead bodies everywhere.
*  He's got no hope.
*  He's walking in a gunfire.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  It might have been World War I, but it was some World War or some war.
*  Some fucking savage from Iowa.
*  Some farmer savage.
*  But brilliant guy in a way.
*  Yeah, a lot of ways.
*  Thinking outside the box.
*  I love different kind of thinking.
*  You know, that's why I like comedy.
*  Because you see something like Norm MacDonald's got that great bit about, and my dad had a
*  heart attack and died and they go, hey, he's in a better place.
*  He's on the floor.
*  You know, it's like, I like that kind of, you go, oh yeah, you're right.
*  You're not wrong.
*  But yeah, I don't know.
*  I like that stuff.
*  Yeah, I do too, man.
*  I mean, comedy is like, we all have these, particularly for people that were working
*  in these jobs, like we were talking before, when you do these corporate gigs, for those
*  people, comedy is kind of extra important because their whole brain is programmed to
*  this fake way of thinking and talking all day.
*  Sing it, sister.
*  And I think it's cathartic.
*  You go into a comedy club and some guy says some horrible thing and you're like, ah, I
*  feel better.
*  All my friends that I know that do work, I only have a few friends that do work in, you
*  know, like office environments, they fucking love comedy.
*  Love it.
*  They need it.
*  Yes.
*  Assholes like you and me just saying things that they could never say.
*  But we're different than that.
*  I think we're a little built differently.
*  You know, we couldn't do, I couldn't do that office gig.
*  I was a janitor for years just because I didn't want to talk to anybody.
*  And it was a better job than clerical bullshit.
*  I don't want to be in a cubicle.
*  I deliver newspapers for the same reason.
*  I was in my car driving by myself, throwing the papers out the window.
*  That's a great gig.
*  Yeah, it was a great gig for a comic.
*  I always say if I wasn't a comic, I'd be a FedEx guy or UPS guy.
*  That would be my gig.
*  You got no doors, you got no door on the fucking van.
*  You got shorts on.
*  You can listen to whatever you want.
*  Whatever you want.
*  You got headphones in.
*  It's great.
*  Actually, it's a great gig, right?
*  I have a buddy of mine who's a mailman.
*  Oh, well that's a little different.
*  Back in Boston, same thing.
*  He had a route.
*  He would fucking put headphones on, listen to music, walk around.
*  The problem with mailmen is you got to hit every single house.
*  The package guy.
*  Everybody loves a package.
*  Also, I'm sure there's some horny housewife who you can pop in on.
*  Looking brown do for you, bitch.
*  Some milfy lady in lingerie.
*  Oh, I'll sign that.
*  Do you want to come inside?
*  Okay.
*  Yeah, that's porn.
*  Yeah, how many ladies can do that though?
*  The thing is, a girl who's...
*  If a guy is at the door and the guy looks good and she looks good, it's almost 100%
*  of the time she can get that guy to fuck him.
*  I know.
*  What a privilege.
*  Almost 100% of the time she can get that guy to fuck her.
*  I think that's why...
*  I think it's a big part of why women aren't as aggressive because they don't have to be.
*  Of course.
*  Well, it's not their nature.
*  I mean, the nature is...
*  The male, the testosterone, the conqueror.
*  If you took fucking away from women for six months, that would be interesting to see how
*  much they'd want to fuck.
*  Not that women aren't horny.
*  Obviously, they get horny, but it's a different kind of...
*  It's a safe horny.
*  Guys will walk into a glory hole and put their dick through it.
*  I don't think a lady's putting her vag up to a wall.
*  That is the weirdest form of porn.
*  Yes!
*  I love it.
*  The glory hole porn.
*  I'm a big fan.
*  Where there's a girl just sitting in a fucking refrigerator box and a guy just sticks his
*  hog through a hole and she's like, oh yeah.
*  Well it's the ultimate fantasy.
*  But it's weird.
*  I can't get a girl at the bar to fuck me, but if I put my dick through this hole and
*  I don't know who's on the other side, it could be LBJ.
*  Oh, BJ.
*  I just fell backwards into that one.
*  Yeah, it could be anybody.
*  Could be anybody.
*  You're cool with that.
*  You just deal with it.
*  You just deal with it.
*  It just feels good.
*  You pretended someone hot.
*  Yeah, and also you hope the wall is not too thick.
*  Right.
*  Because you want to get as much maximum dong shaft.
*  Right.
*  That's why the refrigerator box is a good move.
*  Perfect.
*  Love a box.
*  You can't have like a real wall.
*  No!
*  You don't want sheetrock cutting down on your two inches.
*  Oh yeah, well not only that, the fucking chalky, rough stuff.
*  That would ruin the...
*  You're banging your shaft on the sheetrock.
*  Yeah.
*  Imagine you get sheetrock scrapes on your heart.
*  Oh, I've been there.
*  JMo, you got a long one.
*  Nice and smooth and eroded by then.
*  By all the rest of this.
*  Good point.
*  So many dudes.
*  When you're rubbing areas where dudes' dicks rubbed up against you.
*  You're going to get some of that koala bear chlamydia.
*  That's fine.
*  You ever had the chlamyd?
*  Never.
*  Come on!
*  No, I got lucky.
*  You were fucking in the 90s.
*  I got lucky.
*  You were a hot piece.
*  I got lucky.
*  All right.
*  Never got it.
*  You got it?
*  Many times.
*  How many?
*  I got immunity to it.
*  You get it and you get rid of it real quick.
*  Oh.
*  I can ride it out.
*  Well, why don't you just ride it out and then maybe you'll be immune to it.
*  Maybe, but I don't want to give it to someone else.
*  Oh, but you're going to fuck no matter what, right?
*  Yeah, I just wear the kana, but then the booze kicks in.
*  You go, ah, fuck it.
*  Also, fun fact, and ladies won't admit to this, but there's a lot of skanks out there
*  doing the, just take it off.
*  Take it off.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  They don't come clean on that, but that's a big thing ladies do that I don't get.
*  Feels better for them.
*  Does it?
*  Supposedly.
*  I think I'm a guy without a guy, fuck me, in my vagina.
*  With or without a condom.
*  Women are so secretive.
*  Why don't they tell us shit?
*  Because they get shamed, man.
*  But man up or have some balls.
*  Be shamed and live your life.
*  I think the shame that women experience is fucking really frustrating because guys, when
*  guys shame women, it's mean and guys shaming women about being sluts, that shit doesn't
*  work on men.
*  It's nonexistent.
*  It doesn't work the other way.
*  Yeah, you just fuck 10 girls, you piece of shit.
*  What am I going to do?
*  But they can make it not work.
*  Just go, yeah, blow me, fuck you.
*  I don't care.
*  It's not in their wheelhouse.
*  Why not?
*  Toughen up.
*  Because genetics.
*  Because the way the world has been sort of the world of human beings has been evolved.
*  I'm clearly talking like a scientist here.
*  Look at the N word.
*  The N word was flipped.
*  Now it's a positive.
*  Now it's positive for them.
*  Yeah.
*  So use slut.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, they've tried.
*  Oh, okay.
*  Amber Rose had the slut walk in LA.
*  She still have it?
*  Good for her.
*  Or she give up on that?
*  Good for her.
*  When is it?
*  Might be next week.
*  Coming up soon.
*  Fourth one, I think.
*  Really?
*  Slut walk number four.
*  Imagine if it gets like slut walk 40 and she's like strapping everything down and tying
*  everything together and waddling out there.
*  Yeah, she's very sexy.
*  I like that, huh?
*  Oh yeah, curvy, curvy, curvy lady.
*  Plus the confidence you have to have to wear that haircut.
*  Oh, the short hair, yeah.
*  Yeah, that's a girl who knows she's hot.
*  And you got to have a pretty face.
*  Oh yeah.
*  You know, to pull the short hair.
*  But the slut thing, the problem with the slut thing, and nobody wants to say it, is I don't
*  care if you're a slut.
*  I say be promiscuous, go nuts, hoe it up.
*  But they feel guilty.
*  Well, they feel guilty, I think, because of biology.
*  For the same reason that Eric Weinstein was telling me that there's different mating strategies
*  that people have.
*  For a female to just hoe it up all the time, she's not going to have a man that's there
*  to take care of the child while she's pregnant and vulnerable.
*  I think this is what biology is sort of set up.
*  Right, right.
*  Wow, that's fascinating.
*  I think that's why that clock tick thing is real.
*  Oh, biological clock.
*  Yeah, I'm not going to have a baby or it's going to be retarded if we don't fuck now
*  and have a kid.
*  But there's also different countries that have different feelings about sex.
*  Like a lot of Latin American countries, they're very open sexually and it's different.
*  The women too?
*  Yeah, the women too.
*  They have just a different attitude about it.
*  Australia, different parts of the world, they're freer and open about sex.
*  Even in Canada, I think it's different than in America.
*  Why are we?
*  It's a Puritan.
*  You know, like Chris Brown to me, what he did was worse than what Louis CK did.
*  But Louis CK is a sexual component which makes everything way worse in America.
*  I'd rather be jerked off on and punched in the face.
*  Well, you didn't even jerk off on them.
*  You jerked off in front of them.
*  Whatever it was.
*  So it's like, why are we so focused on...
*  Let's start with...
*  Because if the Chris Brown thing happened now, the Chris Brown thing happened before
*  this whole Me Too thing took place.
*  Ah, so it's a timing thing.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  Isn't that interesting?
*  For sure.
*  Weird.
*  There's a lot of people that snuck through that sort of time period.
*  Right.
*  You know?
*  Aren't you glad you never raped anybody?
*  Yes.
*  Man.
*  I mean, I don't want to, but...
*  So glad.
*  I'm glad you don't have that A on your conscience and B on your record.
*  And also, aren't you glad you never got raped?
*  Sure, sure.
*  That's a big one.
*  That's a big one.
*  I've fucked people unconsensually, but I've never been held down and banged.
*  Have you fucked people unconsensually?
*  Maybe talk about it?
*  Oh, you know, you got a gal and she's like, come on.
*  You're like, I'm good.
*  She's like, come on.
*  You're like, all right.
*  Oh, so you didn't really consent, but you made her...
*  So you made it sound like she didn't consent, but you really didn't consent.
*  No, I didn't.
*  But that's normal.
*  I think everybody does that.
*  You fuck your ugly wife or your ugly husband.
*  But if a girl wants to fuck you and she talks you in it and you feel bad afterwards, no one's
*  going to feel sorry for you.
*  You got that right.
*  But if a guy does that to a girl, badgers a girl into doing it, people will come down
*  hard on you.
*  It's weird how that works because I get the dicks and the DMs all day long.
*  I get all that shit and nobody cares.
*  And I go, what if this bothered me?
*  And people go, ah, you're a guy.
*  Fuck you.
*  Do you know Whitney?
*  Do you know Whitney?
*  I do, a little bit.
*  Not well.
*  I like her.
*  Ask her about the DMs that she gets.
*  Oh, really?
*  She shows them to us.
*  It's fucked.
*  I told her to get a book.
*  I said, you should write a book about dick pics that people send you because it's not
*  a dozen.
*  It's dozens.
*  Really?
*  Dozens.
*  Man.
*  She's always got like weird dicks coming her way too.
*  Like curvy.
*  We're in a group text.
*  She'll show us the dicks and like, what the fuck?
*  Wow.
*  Weird, weird hook dicks.
*  Yeah.
*  Do they like, does she like it?
*  No.
*  Yeah, see that's it.
*  It's just guys just send pictures.
*  They do it to every girl.
*  Look, there is probably a fucking gigantic population of creepy dudes out there that send
*  dick pics.
*  Well, here's another one.
*  I was hooking up with this girl years ago.
*  I met in Arizona and she was like, send me a dick pic.
*  And I was like, all right, sent her the dick pic.
*  Eight, five, I will say five years goes by.
*  I get a tweet.
*  Hey, is this Mark your dick?
*  It's added me.
*  And it was.
*  It was my sheets.
*  My shoes were in it.
*  My desk was in the background.
*  And I was like, that's not mine.
*  And I was like, ah, ah, it spooked me.
*  So she sent you that or someone else did?
*  Random guy like Minnesota said, hey, is this your dick?
*  And she texted it to some guy.
*  I guess.
*  Fuck Mark, no, I mean, here's his cock.
*  And I just denied it.
*  Oh, fuck him.
*  Fuck that guy.
*  I'm going to put it on Twitter.
*  I gave it a favorite and I moved on.
*  Isn't that interesting how Twitter lets you show dicks?
*  Twitter lets you show hardcore porn.
*  Hardcore porn.
*  Hardcore porn.
*  Which is fun.
*  Sometimes you're in the airport like, ah, fuck it.
*  It's crazy.
*  I'll look at this for a minute.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, you can ask fucking, coming, everything.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Everything.
*  You name it, baby.
*  Isn't that weird?
*  I mean, it's a gigantic platform to allow hardcore porn.
*  Instagram does not.
*  No.
*  And you two.
*  On Instagram, you can't even show nipple.
*  Oh, wow.
*  You can't show anything.
*  Girls get kicked off of Instagram for having like transparent shirts.
*  Oh, really?
*  Yeah, you can't even show nipple.
*  Isn't it amazing when you see how many beautiful, sexy, stunning women are on Instagram?
*  You could go through for hours.
*  Right.
*  It's probably our best resource.
*  You talk about oil and all this shit.
*  I think the hot women in America, it's up there.
*  It's pretty good.
*  It's pretty good.
*  But it's also, there's a lot of Photoshop out there.
*  Ah, damn it, you're right.
*  Remember what I was talking about?
*  These ladies doing cartoon work on their pictures?
*  Killing my dream, man.
*  Killing the dream.
*  Also, it's weird.
*  This is some guy's daughter and some mom's daughter.
*  Yep, yep.
*  But then she hits 24, she's on her own.
*  I guess so.
*  Or whatever age it is.
*  Are you nervous about your...
*  They see her in that picture.
*  Yeah, you have to be.
*  But I'm also, look, I think girls like boys and boys like girls.
*  I want everybody to be happy.
*  Yeah.
*  What are those gays?
*  I would hope that, there are those gays too.
*  I would hope that they could find someone who's nice to them.
*  And I would hope that they don't get bullshitted.
*  But I mean, remember you?
*  You were a fucking poon hound back in the 40s.
*  You know what it's like, these dudes out there?
*  That was back before radio, though.
*  That's true.
*  Nobody knew anything.
*  Nobody knew any better.
*  Imagine if you were living, like legitimately living, like a thousand years ago.
*  They probably didn't even understand how you got pregnant.
*  You know, and diseases killed you.
*  You got syphilis, everybody died, your hair fell out, your nose rotted off your face.
*  They would have crazy diseases and no cure.
*  That's probably why the Bible steps in.
*  You know, it's like, hey, don't eat pork, pork's killing everybody, let's say don't
*  eat pork on Friday, or whatever it is.
*  Abstinence too.
*  They're trying to preserve you from venereal diseases.
*  Right, right.
*  And that's why being a virgin was so good.
*  You know, if you're not, you get thrown in the volcano.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, I was reading this book about the Wild West, and they're talking about all the people
*  that had syphilis.
*  It's just, they just all went to whorehouses and they all got sick.
*  Man, the wild, we're so lucky to be alive in this time.
*  Oh, we're getting yelled at on Twitter!
*  Those guys had to ride a horse without a saddle.
*  But imagine when it's like a hundred years from now, they're going to be looking at this,
*  poor idiots.
*  They didn't have virtual reality.
*  I know, that's true.
*  They didn't have to live in the real world and drive cars everywhere.
*  Yeah, ignorance is bliss, man.
*  Yeah, you don't know.
*  I mean, back in the Wild West days, they were just happy they figured out the horse.
*  That's true.
*  Like, oh my God, I'm so glad we had horses.
*  Yeah.
*  Imagine those idiots that didn't have horses.
*  Right, right.
*  They'd walk everywhere.
*  The fuck out of here.
*  Do that Donner Pass, the fact that that happened is bananas.
*  Not that long ago, man.
*  I know, I know.
*  Not that long ago.
*  And it didn't just happen once.
*  There was a couple other instances of people trying to make it across and froze to death
*  out there.
*  Damn.
*  But the movies in 4098 are going to be so much more boring.
*  We get to watch The Revenant.
*  Some guys chasing Native Americans, he's killing a bear, he's fighting a guy in a river.
*  The movie in that year is going to be a bunch of dudes podcasting.
*  You know what I mean?
*  It's going to suck because we don't have any struggle, so there's no conflict for a movie.
*  What if they'll ever have a podcasting movie?
*  A movie about podcasts getting crazy, podcasts changing.
*  We've had Angry Birds.
*  Do you remember Christian Slater had that, was that radio?
*  Pump up the volume.
*  Yes.
*  Kevin Smith had one.
*  Kevin Smith did?
*  Yeah, we're Walrus.
*  Walrus?
*  Remember, I don't know if you saw this, it came out maybe three or four years ago.
*  What was it about podcasting?
*  He played a podcast who was going to get an interview and the guy kidnapped him and turned
*  him into a walrus.
*  Oh, jeez.
*  That's a kidnap movie.
*  I never saw that movie.
*  Yeah, well.
*  I saw Red State though.
*  That was one of his best movies.
*  I saw that.
*  That was crazy.
*  That was crazy.
*  He made me see that movie without telling me anything.
*  Ooh.
*  He goes, I don't want to tell you shit, I don't want to tell you anything, just have a seat.
*  Bad PR for Republicans.
*  It's called Tusk.
*  Tusk, that's right.
*  Tusk.
*  Yeah.
*  Crazy movie though.
*  I was like, Jesus, Kevin.
*  I didn't see that coming at all.
*  I thought it was going to be a funny movie.
*  I didn't know he had it in him.
*  Yeah, he did.
*  You just hear about comic books and hockey jerseys.
*  Oh, Jesus.
*  Don't show me that.
*  Holy hell.
*  Why are you showing me that?
*  You just spoiler alerted me.
*  Was that Dr. Phil?
*  Son of a bitch.
*  It's like on the front cover of the movie.
*  And then you showed it to me, son of a bitch.
*  What if I was going to watch that tonight?
*  I wonder how this turns out.
*  I wonder what it looks like.
*  You know what else is kooky is the fact that our attention spans are getting so short.
*  We like a YouTube video to be four seconds.
*  All we do is check the time, but then the movies are getting longer.
*  Yes.
*  It is weird.
*  So our podcast.
*  Yeah.
*  Bill Maher had that statement.
*  He was like, how come our attention span is either seven seconds or three hours?
*  Right.
*  Exactly.
*  The Irishman, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, these are all three hour plus.
*  Did you like the Irishman?
*  I haven't seen it yet.
*  Well, you got to watch it in chunks, which is shitty.
*  Because it's too long?
*  I love Scorsese and I liked it.
*  It's not his best by far, but I liked it.
*  Why do you got to watch it in chunks?
*  Because it's so long?
*  It's so long.
*  Yeah.
*  What if you're one of those guys who just can sit there for four hours?
*  You could do it, but it's like a novel.
*  You got to really take it in.
*  How many hours is it?
*  Three and change, I think.
*  That took a break about two hours in.
*  I got some 20 minutes to get up and walk around.
*  I got some problems with it, but it's a good movie.
*  Yeah.
*  When you go to the movie theaters, when was the last time you went to the movie theater
*  and you saw a three plus hour movie?
*  I went two nights ago, but it wasn't three and a half.
*  When was the last time there was like a legit three?
*  I remember that Tarantino movie.
*  They did the double feature.
*  Oh, Grindhouse.
*  That's right.
*  They had it playing during it.
*  I went to that.
*  I saw that in the theater.
*  But those are two movies.
*  Right.
*  They're standalone.
*  Yeah.
*  But once upon a time in Hollywood, that was pretty fucking long too.
*  Pretty long.
*  Yeah.
*  I watched that twice and I loved it.
*  That dude, he's doing it right.
*  He really is.
*  He's doing it right.
*  He's got only nine movies.
*  He's going to make 10 movies and then he's going to retire.
*  Yeah.
*  Allegedly.
*  I heard he's going to TV.
*  He's going to back up the fucking Brinks truck.
*  Beep.
*  But thank God he slipped through.
*  There's some guy out there who's just as brilliant as him who hasn't gotten a shot yet.
*  Maybe.
*  But here's the thing.
*  He's grandfathered in too.
*  Because his movies are so fucked up.
*  Like once upon a time in Hollywood, spoiler alert, there's some scenes where he's taking
*  this chick's head and fucking smashing it.
*  It's great.
*  Whoa.
*  I don't know if a new filmmaker could get away with that today.
*  Interesting.
*  I don't know.
*  Because some of that shit's disturbing.
*  It's very disturbing.
*  Yeah.
*  And I think he's so grandfathered in with the hyperviolent, ultraviolent movies.
*  Well, it goes to show if you sell tickets, nobody gives a fuck.
*  Nobody gives a fuck.
*  You're making money.
*  But with him, there's no risk.
*  Like if it's a Quentin Tarantino movie, he's never missed once.
*  Right.
*  The Django, Hateful Eight, Pulp Fiction, you keep going down the list, all his fucking
*  movies.
*  Reservoir Dogs.
*  They're all killer movies.
*  And they're all goriest shit and darkest shit.
*  Has he had one bad movie?
*  What is the name of a bad Tarantino movie?
*  Some are better than others, but none are bad.
*  Yeah, but they're all great.
*  Like Hateful Eight I even liked.
*  I loved that movie.
*  Yeah.
*  What was, the Django was fucking fantastic.
*  Django was fun.
*  And you get to realize Leonardo DiCaprio can act his fucking asshole.
*  Oh, he's amazing, man.
*  Like you see him in a lot of these movies.
*  And you know what the problem with Leonardo DiCaprio is?
*  First of all, he's beautiful.
*  I don't like that.
*  He's getting uglier though.
*  Let's give him that.
*  A little bit.
*  A touch.
*  A little chub.
*  I mean, I'd still blow up.
*  A little chubby.
*  Yeah, if you had to.
*  That kind of shit, when people accept awards and they go, climate change is real.
*  Like hey, hey, hey!
*  You're not here for that!
*  Alright, we all know it's real.
*  Move on.
*  Come on, man.
*  You're not fixing the world by holding your trophy for pretending.
*  But that's the point.
*  So you gotta go, okay, he's in a good bin.
*  I get it.
*  We put people in a bin now.
*  Okay, he's in a good bin.
*  He flies private.
*  Of course he flies private.
*  You can't say climate change is real and fly private.
*  Well, you can say it, but yeah.
*  That's like syphilis is real, but you won't wear a condom.
*  Oooooh!
*  Yeah, what are you doing to protect yourself from that problem?
*  Penicillin?
*  Hmm.
*  I just don't like, that's why I love Ricky Gervais' speech.
*  Oh, that was fun, huh?
*  It was amazing.
*  That was great.
*  It was amazing.
*  It would just suck to be one of the people who get pissed about that.
*  Like man, what a shitty life you have.
*  I want to find those people and bookmark them.
*  Yeah, right?
*  Check in on them anytime anything goes wrong.
*  I loved it.
*  I'm friends with Ricky now, I can say that.
*  I love him.
*  We exchanged niceties on Twitter.
*  Oh, really?
*  Yeah, which meant I met the world to me.
*  Oh, that's beautiful.
*  Hey, tell me about your experiences with Seinfeld.
*  Since we did the last podcast, you did like...
*  I did some gigs.
*  You tell me you had a great fucking time.
*  Great time, he's the coolest guy.
*  I mean, he helped me out by giving these gigs.
*  I opened for him at the Beacon and he's a cool dude because he goes, I want one green
*  room and he goes, whoa, I don't want to bother you and he goes, no, no, I want to hang.
*  How cool is that?
*  That's very cool.
*  And then there's this one there legend comedy guy wants to hang with my dumb ass.
*  Well, I think that's one of the things that a lot of comics miss when they get really
*  big.
*  Yeah.
*  And when you're Jerry Seinfeld, it's like all the rest of us are in this place and he's
*  like, ugh, he's legend.
*  Seinfeld.
*  But that's how we see him.
*  He still sees himself as this Long Island nobody, which is so cool and also why he's
*  still funny.
*  Yes.
*  And he's like, I'm worried I'm not relevant anymore.
*  I'm like, what do you mean relevant?
*  Your show comes on eight times a day.
*  You got comedians in cars, you're touring everywhere.
*  You're fine.
*  It's hilarious to think that he's not relevant.
*  I know.
*  It's like David Tell.
*  David Tell, I'm a hack.
*  I suck.
*  I'm an old hack.
*  You're brilliant.
*  You're one of the best ever.
*  Ever.
*  That's why he's so funny though.
*  Exactly.
*  Because he's not blowing himself.
*  Larry David.
*  Larry David's like, ah, I suck.
*  I'm in the way.
*  Nobody likes me.
*  Driving a Prius.
*  You're my hero.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  But every time he looks in the mirror, he's a bald, you know, bald nothing.
*  Worth a half a billion dollars.
*  I know.
*  And he's genius.
*  He's changed my life.
*  He's changed the world with his comedy and he can't, it won't sink in.
*  I love that.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, that's why they're so good.
*  That's why they're good.
*  I think if you start really believing you're something special, you're fucking doomed.
*  You're doomed.
*  You're doomed because then you're not going to be you.
*  You're going to be some like, yeah, I'm fucking, oh, I'll just go out there and be awesome.
*  And I've seen that before and it's ugly.
*  It's an ugly picture when guys, they think they're the shit now and then they don't try
*  that hard and they don't work at it.
*  And you think they can just go out there and talk to people and people are just happy to
*  see them.
*  And that lasts for about three minutes.
*  Right.
*  And then people are like, what is happening here?
*  Confidence is a killer, man.
*  It can be.
*  It can be.
*  But it's all confidence through hard work and discipline, like knowing that you're ready.
*  But even then you still have to have that little edge.
*  Yes.
*  Little edge of fear.
*  Exactly.
*  Exactly.
*  Like those, some of the great fighters were all bullied or something.
*  There's something behind them where they just have that extra flame in them.
*  Yes.
*  I mean, almost all of them will tell you, some of them will hide it, but almost all
*  of them will tell you that they're terrified.
*  Yes.
*  I heard a cowboy was talking about like how he flips out before every fight and he's in
*  his head.
*  I'm like, oh, good.
*  That's how I am before a special or a late night or whatever.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  And you feel better.
*  You're like, okay, I'm not a wuss.
*  Yeah.
*  Any good set, anything that's important, those butterflies are going to be fluttering around.
*  Your adrenaline is going to be pumping.
*  You're like, holy fuck.
*  Here we go.
*  Right.
*  Chappelle talks about it.
*  Chappelle's like, I get nervous.
*  And if you watch interviews, he's hunched over.
*  He's weird.
*  And he's not this cocky savant, you know, smoking.
*  I mean, he is.
*  He's brilliant.
*  But he's not that guy.
*  He's mastered that look.
*  He works hard, but he's calm because he's done so many sets.
*  Right.
*  And he's so good.
*  I mean, he kills 99.9999% of the time.
*  But when we worked together, we did a couple of arenas together.
*  We were both like, all right, here we go.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, you get, you know, like right before you go on stage, he was about to go up there,
*  about to, he looked at me, he goes, not a whole lot of motherfuckers get to do this.
*  And then he went out there and fucking murdered.
*  How great is that?
*  That's the best feeling that you get before a show.
*  If you don't have that.
*  Yeah.
*  And everybody's scared of that feeling, right?
*  Right.
*  Because that feeling is like, God, I don't want to be uncomfortable.
*  I just can't wait until I'm so confident.
*  But you will never be that because if you are, then you won't be funny anymore.
*  Exactly.
*  It's a catch-28.
*  It's brutal.
*  And they always say, do something every day that scares you.
*  And we do every day.
*  I mean, comedy, people are like, why do you get up so much?
*  Because I'm scared of it and I don't want it to overwhelm me.
*  I want to be able to control the fear a little.
*  Also, if you're building your act, it's almost imperative that you go up every day.
*  Oh, it's not almost.
*  Yeah.
*  It is.
*  Yeah, I shouldn't say almost.
*  There's bits that grow.
*  The more you do them, like you have a new tag, like, oh my God, that tag's perfect.
*  How many times have you done a special and then a week later you come up with a line
*  like, I wish that was in there.
*  It's the worst.
*  Bits are never done.
*  They're done.
*  They're never done, but then they are.
*  Then they're overdone.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  That's true.
*  You overcook it.
*  Yeah.
*  And then you're like, oh, I hate this bit.
*  You know, Tom Segura had an excellent strategy for that.
*  You know, we were talking about it and he said...
*  He records quick.
*  He's prolific.
*  Yes.
*  He's super prolific.
*  But he also says that what he does is, like, some bits, he'll get bored with them and he
*  just won't use them for, like, months at a time and then he'll replace them with new
*  bits and then he'll come back to them when he's about to film so it feels fresh.
*  Whoa.
*  I couldn't do that.
*  I need all the time I have.
*  My jokes are too short.
*  That's impressive.
*  Yeah, but you have non-sequiturs.
*  You have a lot of non-sequiturs.
*  Yeah, just boom, boom, boom, boom.
*  I'm such a pussy that I need laughs.
*  Silence, I'm not good with.
*  Like, I see Bill Burr working shit out and, like, the crowd's like, where's he going with
*  this?
*  And then you see him two weeks later and it's murdering.
*  Right.
*  To me, I'm like, I gotta get more of that.
*  I gotta get more...
*  The ability to just...
*  Sit in it.
*  Eat the dicks.
*  Yeah.
*  And don't get me wrong, I bomb quite a bit.
*  But...
*  It's not on purpose.
*  Yeah, exactly, exactly.
*  Chris Rock used to do that all the time.
*  Yeah, I've seen that.
*  He would walk in there and just fucking... just try.
*  Just practice shit.
*  What else?
*  What else?
*  And he would even tell the audience, hey, don't get too excited.
*  Right.
*  You know?
*  He would just go up there and fucking make it happen.
*  Well, the audience can be such queef sometimes because they're like, hey, this is mean.
*  And you're like, yeah, but I'm going somewhere, you dumbass.
*  I'm working this out and it's gonna be beautiful.
*  Stop stepping on the buds of the roses.
*  Because it'll be a bud one day.
*  Don't step on it yet.
*  But people are so quick to negate.
*  Well, one of the good things about the comedy store is they know that we're working shit
*  out.
*  They talk about it so much on podcasts.
*  They know that...
*  And I've had people come up to me and go, dude, I saw that bit four months ago and I
*  just saw it again.
*  It's amazing.
*  That's the best.
*  It's come to life.
*  Yeah.
*  I go, yeah, it sucked four months ago, right?
*  He was like, I didn't think it was gonna be very good.
*  Of course.
*  But we know.
*  They don't know.
*  But I got a bit of a beef with these bigger name guys doing that.
*  They go, I go to the clubs to work it out.
*  I'm like, well, they still paid.
*  Yeah.
*  They're still real people who want to show.
*  So I get a little wishy washy with that.
*  I like the sandwich bits in between proven bits.
*  You gotta try them out.
*  But sometimes I'll open with them, man.
*  Sometimes I'll come out of the gate with a new bit.
*  That works too because the fear of it makes you come up with something.
*  Yes.
*  Yeah.
*  It would also make you really go over it in your head.
*  Make sure you got all the fucking I's dotted and the T's crossed.
*  Yeah, that's the key.
*  Fear is there.
*  So why not twist it and use it the way the newspapers spin?
*  You gotta spin your emotions.
*  Exactly.
*  Exactly.
*  And get something out of it.
*  Exactly.
*  So you're filming tonight.
*  Yeah.
*  Two shows.
*  I've been doing this hour forever and I'm getting to the point where I go back to San
*  Francisco, I go back to Denver and they go, well, we saw a lot of this.
*  So I gotta put it down.
*  Right, right, right.
*  I don't want to let people down with the same material.
*  And it's killer, it's tight, it ends big, it starts big, it's dark, it's edgy, whatever
*  you want to call it.
*  Woo!
*  And I can't sell it.
*  Nobody wants to buy it.
*  So fuck it.
*  I'll do it myself.
*  How is nobody buying your special?
*  Well, you gotta have a hook now.
*  I feel like if you're a cracker, you know, you gotta be depressed, you gotta be molested,
*  you gotta be half Jew or something, you gotta be in a wheelchair.
*  We need a good hurtful derogatory term for white men.
*  We need one.
*  Yeah, well, ironically, it's straight white male.
*  Yeah, but it doesn't work.
*  It doesn't hurt.
*  Right.
*  You call me a straight white male, I'm like, eh.
*  It's nothing.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  But, you know, there's words.
*  There's certain words.
*  Sure, but I will say this.
*  When you grow up in a neighborhood and you're the minority, getting called a white boy or
*  honky, it hurts.
*  Okay, so when you grew up and you were a minority, it was effective.
*  Yes.
*  But is it effective today still?
*  Not really, but it is.
*  It didn't stick.
*  But if you're a black kid and you grow up in a white neighborhood and you hear that
*  shit all the time and it hurts, and then you grow up and then you're no longer in that
*  fucked up environment and someone calls it to you again, it still hurts.
*  Right.
*  It still works.
*  Right, right, because you're still a minority.
*  Yes.
*  White boy doesn't work anymore.
*  If somebody calls you white boy, you're like, well, I guess you're mad at me.
*  It doesn't hurt, but that's the problem.
*  It's just the intent.
*  Why do you want to hurt me?
*  That's what stings, not the actual word.
*  What's your beef?
*  But there's a sting to the N-word that's never been reached with any other word.
*  No other word.
*  Cunt.
*  No other word.
*  Nothing.
*  Maybe the F?
*  Fag?
*  No, no.
*  No, it's not the same because they weren't enslaved.
*  Well not only that, it didn't have dual meaning.
*  That word also has a meaning that you say to your friends in a joking way and nobody
*  gets upset at all.
*  Right.
*  You say it to heterosexual people, they would joke around about it.
*  It means different things.
*  I would never call you the N-word in the locker room.
*  Right, exactly.
*  Unless you were packing.
*  That's exactly.
*  Yeah.
*  Then I'd be like, oh, this guy's a real black.
*  Yeah, it's, you know, the real problem is actual racism.
*  Yes.
*  If there was no racism, then no one would give a fuck what words you used and it would
*  all be fun.
*  Because if you had a derogatory term towards people, it wouldn't even work.
*  Right.
*  I read a tweet about how the alt rooms, the audience is all white and in the club shows
*  it's diverse even though we're saying the fucked up shit.
*  That's a great point.
*  I forgot, I should give the guy credit, but I forgot who said it.
*  I did a set at the UCB about 10 years ago.
*  Wow, is that right?
*  They don't pay.
*  Well, that's a whole different bag of hammers.
*  That's crazy.
*  That's weird.
*  That's crazy.
*  You're selling out every night, you have a packed house and you don't pay the comics.
*  What are you selling?
*  Are you selling something that I don't know about?
*  This is the name UCB.
*  That's nonsense.
*  That's nonsense.
*  The name UCB exists because of guys like Patton, Sarah Silverman, Louie and all those people
*  that perform there.
*  Right, right.
*  I mean, look, they got their hustle.
*  I'm not trying to knock it.
*  And it's working, apparently.
*  But the comedy store pays.
*  Yeah, it pays well.
*  And it's a fucking great show every night.
*  Improv pays.
*  These clubs pay.
*  Right, right.
*  I mean, I don't want all the money.
*  You got to give me something and I give it to the bartender and I give it to the door
*  guy and I give it to the guy who parks the cars.
*  There you go.
*  Right, right.
*  But you can't take all the money.
*  Yeah, I wrote these jokes.
*  I drove here.
*  Not only that.
*  Yeah, it's like, what are you selling?
*  I know.
*  You have a fucked up business that's relying on people being suckers.
*  It's very strange.
*  You're relying on comics being suckers.
*  You think?
*  Yes.
*  But you're getting stage time.
*  So what?
*  I can get stage time anywhere I want.
*  Well, you can.
*  So could you.
*  You can get stage time at a lot of...
*  You can now.
*  And meanwhile, people would come to see you and they would pay money to see you and you
*  wouldn't get any of that money.
*  What's that about?
*  It's very strange.
*  It's nonsense.
*  Right.
*  Straight up nonsense.
*  Yes, you filled the room up and you killed.
*  Where's the money?
*  Oh, you bought a new house?
*  And then they'll buy a new building.
*  And then these guys are driving Ferraris to work or whatever.
*  I don't know if they're driving Ferraris.
*  They probably drive Hondas and they take them home and then they take the Ferrari out.
*  Ha ha ha.
*  Suckers.
*  Also, those audiences aren't as good, which is weird too.
*  Like I'm working for free and yeah, there's very precious vibe in there where you say
*  like, my roommate's gay and they're like, wait, you said gay.
*  Hold on.
*  Let me dissect this.
*  I don't think about the joke anymore because you're just so busy worrying about these terms.
*  Well, it's probably a lot of young kids too.
*  Very young.
*  Riding that woke pony.
*  The woke pony.
*  So what are you going to do?
*  You going to YouTube it?
*  I'll try to shop it around.
*  What about Amazon?
*  Yeah, they got a lot of, you got to have a favor done for you.
*  Jeff Bezos, what the fuck?
*  Yeah, put it out.
*  Mark Norman, trust me.
*  Killer.
*  Yeah, tweet it out.
*  Do something.
*  I will 100% tweet it out.
*  I appreciate it.
*  Once you film it, I think once you film it and people get a look at it, they'll be like,
*  I bet you'll sell it.
*  I just want eyeballs on it.
*  You'll definitely get that.
*  If you put it on YouTube, I'll tweet the fuck out of it.
*  I appreciate it.
*  You're a good egg.
*  100%.
*  You're a good egg too.
*  Oh, hey, thanks.
*  But yeah, you start doing comedy and you feel like you're getting somewhere and then you
*  try to sell a special that's been worked out for years and it's tight as a drum and everybody
*  goes, this is a great thing.
*  Why won't Netflix pick it up?
*  But you're not what we're looking for.
*  It's all branding now.
*  We want branding.
*  We want to get a certain quota, which I guess I get.
*  I'm all about spreading the love and diverse and hooking people up, but it should be, if
*  it's funny, it's funny.
*  Stand-up comedy has always been a meritocracy and I think it should say that way.
*  There's plenty of funny women.
*  There's plenty of funny everything.
*  Of course.
*  Fill in the blank.
*  Especially now.
*  Look at all the Asians.
*  There was one funny Asian or one famous Asian, I should say, was Margaret Cho.
*  And now it's like Ronnie Chang, Ali Wong, Chang Wang.
*  Ronnie Chang is fucking hilarious.
*  Killer.
*  You see the new Spesh?
*  Yes.
*  Very good.
*  He's good, man.
*  Yeah, and he's angry.
*  Yeah, angry and tight and relatable.
*  The topics, it's fucking tight shit.
*  Really good, man.
*  He had that great bit about the internet about how it's going to be like smoking in 20 years.
*  I can't believe you let your kid look at the internet.
*  You looked at the internet while you were pregnant?
*  Great bit.
*  Great angle.
*  That is a great angle.
*  That's a great angle.
*  Yeah, there's a lot of good comedy right now.
*  There's a lot of bad comedy.
*  There's a lot of, yeah, but there's more good comedy than I think there's ever been
*  before.
*  Of course, of course.
*  I don't think I've ever known a time where there's this many straight up assassins.
*  Yeah.
*  Why do you think that is?
*  The internet.
*  Yeah.
*  More platforms for people.
*  You know, look at guys like Schultz, who's literally become one of the biggest comics
*  in the world.
*  He's huge.
*  Just through putting his own stuff online and for the same reason, because they didn't
*  want to buy his shit.
*  Sure, sure.
*  But he's filming a new one and that is getting picked up by someone.
*  I heard.
*  Yeah, listen.
*  He's open for great content.
*  Right.
*  And he takes advantage of all the platforms.
*  He's really good at putting funny videos on, all those fashion videos that he does.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, he orchestrates them and coordinates them.
*  I think he'll go down in history as some kind of marketing guru.
*  He's a genius.
*  It's impressive.
*  And he's a great comic on top of that, which you usually don't get.
*  Right.
*  You usually get a really good marketer who kind of sucks as a comic or you get a guy
*  like Attell, who's a genius who doesn't market himself at all.
*  No, he can barely sell a DVD.
*  And he doesn't change his clothes.
*  It's the same thing.
*  It's a hat, a black jacket.
*  It's like he wears the same shit.
*  Yeah, he always says, I look like an unemployed umpire.
*  I mean, he's fucking brilliant.
*  He's amazing.
*  But he's the worst marketer of all time.
*  When I hear that he can't sell tickets in certain markets, I'm like, what are you talking
*  about?
*  I almost want him to call me every time he's got a gig and I'll tweet it.
*  But people want a cartoon when you really break it down.
*  I know of guys who are funnier than, you know, Fluffy, but Fluffy sells out arenas because
*  they like him.
*  That's not just about the writing.
*  He's very personable.
*  There's that.
*  Yes, he's very likable.
*  I think the problem with Attell is that he doesn't market himself well.
*  And no one else does either.
*  That's all it is.
*  But I think the bumping mics thing has changed.
*  That helped.
*  That helped him.
*  Because Jeff Ross is such a personable guy and the two of them together, it's hilarious.
*  It's fun and it's a really big Netflix show.
*  Yeah, he's great at it.
*  And they can do a hundred of those.
*  The two of them together, they can do a hundred of those.
*  Never ends.
*  I think people need to know, it's got to be like, we're animals.
*  You got to go, oh, the fat guy, oh, the dumb guy, or the family guy.
*  Right, right, right.
*  Yeah, Fluffy.
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  I like that guy.
*  Yeah, Hawaiian shirt, big guy, Hispanic.
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  It's got to be bite-sized nugget of who you are.
*  I know you're into cars.
*  Yeah, I'm doing Matt's show tomorrow.
*  You're doing Matt Ferris' show?
*  8 a.m. Venice, baby.
*  Malibu.
*  Beautiful.
*  Beautiful.
*  I'm driving a...
*  It's actually a film.
*  I love it.
*  You'll probably be hungover.
*  Oh, I'm going to be hurting.
*  Fluffy's into cars, but he's into Volkswagen buses.
*  Oh.
*  Bro, he's got like 30 of them.
*  That's a weird choice.
*  They're crazy.
*  He's got a warehouse filled with Volkswagen buses.
*  I like them, but...
*  But they're all like customized.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, it's crazy.
*  Oh, wow.

*  Someone told me he's a car guy.
*  I mean, he's got a bunch of other cars too.
*  Yeah.

*  What a weird vice.
*  Look at this, Volkswagen buses.
*  Whoa.
*  Cool.
*  They're dope too.
*  They're like mint.
*  Mint condition.
*  Yeah, it's like a sneaker collection.
*  It's just got different colors.
*  Look at that.
*  And all these Volkswagen posters on the wall.
*  They're pretty badass.
*  But how weird is that, that he kept buying them?
*  That's fascinating.
*  Like after he had two, and he's like, eh, I'm good.
*  It's weird that that's the thing that grabs him.
*  He's like, I gotta have him.
*  He probably has more than 30.
*  I mean, look at that.
*  Wow.
*  He click on that video.
*  Can you click on that video?
*  Oh, we can't.
*  We can't play it.
*  I gotta wrap this up anyway.
*  Oh, shit.
*  We're closing in on 6 p.m.
